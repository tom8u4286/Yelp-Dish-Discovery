            "i have seriously been trying to eat here for years, but there is always a really long wait without a reservation...and of course, i was never smart enough to make a reservation.  the girls and i needed a quick dinner and it was rather early, so i was hoping there would be no wait.  luckily, i was right.  when we first sat down, the bus boy brought us water immediately, but then no one came over to us for what seemed like 20 minutes.  we eventually had to flag a waiter down, who was very apologetic and proceeded to provide the best service ever!  not only was our server very attentive, so was the rest of the staff.  even the hostess came by at one point to check on us, which i found rather strange but funny, all at the same time lol.  \n\nwe started with the fried <mark>Lotus Chips</mark> with mole sauce.  just an fyi: the fried <mark>Lotus Chips</mark> do not come with mole sauce.  the waiter offered it to us for making us wait, i believe, and i sure am glad he did.  the fried <mark>Lotus Chips</mark> are good, but a bit plain.  however with the mole sauce, it was delicious!  one of the girls or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the pozole rojo, which was good, but it was nothing compared to the caldo tlalpe\\u00f1o the other girl or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>.  the caldo tlalpe\\u00f1o was so flavorful that it was hard to believe that it was only soup.  here's a warning: if you cannot take spice, then the caldo tlalpe\\u00f1o is definitely not for you.  sorry, sucker lol.  i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> one each of the lengua taco and the barbarcoa taco, which were both delightful.  lastly, we shared one order of the diver scallops and green beans in <mark>XO Sauce</mark>.  i love scallops, green beans, and <mark>XO Sauce</mark>...however this was a tad salty.  it was mostly the <mark>XO Sauce</mark> so i made due by not getting too much sauce in each bite, which worked out nicely.  \n\nfinally, to make up for forgetting about us, the waiter brought out a complimentary dessert, mango and sticky rice.  i love this dessert anyway so i was pretty excited when he brought it out, but of course it had a twist to it.  normally, it doesn't come with whipped cream on top, but this one did with what seemed like crispy rice treats inside.  anyway, i don't normally eat whipped cream since it's so fattening, but i figured hey, i'm on vacation...live a little!  and man, am i glad i did!  yum!", 
            "definitely get the addictive <mark>Lotus Chips</mark> and playful, flavorful silencio (ha!) duck tongue taco. the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco with oyster and beef tendon wasn't bursting with flavor, and the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> steamed buns were dry and would have benefitted from more filling. and if you're feeling lucky, cross your fingers that a sampler of dumplings accidentally gets dropped at your table by a server who immediately disappears, because it's going to be your favorite dish of the night.\n\nthe changing wall art of iconic/iconoclast figures gives the small space a lot of personality, and i just loved the warm colors and rustic feel. it's vegas, so it's a little bit put-on, but isn't everything?", 
            "great atmosphere and a really fun blend of mexican and chinese. interesting concept and many of the dishes seemed quite inspired. food portions are small and quite expensive. the <mark>Lotus Chips</mark> were good, the eggplant and seta taco was okay, but the vegetable friend rice was top notch. \n\nwe had a great waitress too, who was really friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. she was bit robotic in her run down of the menu (she gave the same exact speech to the party next to us 5 minutes later), but was attentive and gave us good recommendations. the food also comes out fast, which is a plus.", 
            "stopped in here to munch before having cocktails at the chandalier. <mark>Lotus Chips</mark> and habanero salsa are a match made in heaven. fish tacos and <mark>Refried Bean Taco</mark> were good... glass noodle salad is refreshing but overpriced and not filling.\n\nthis is tapas style, so be prepared to order a lot to feel satisfied... which gets pricey ( but it's vegas, so you knew that, right?) great snacks or appetizer option before hitting the town!", 
            "came to grab a quick bite. had the <mark>Lotus Chips</mark>, enmoladas, caldo, sui mai beef, <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, <mark>Refried Bean Taco</mark>, and grilled fish taco. some dishes were fusion, some were not, all are good. those giving this place a bad review probably had the wrong expectations. service was great, no wait, food came out quick and fresh, ambiance was chill.", 
            "we stopped in because they were open late and a friend said it was really good. it was good but as many others have said the price is a little steep. for some things there is a reasonable price and for some things not at all. we snacked on the <mark>Lotus Chips</mark> and they were great. we got the lamb gouza which sounded good but didn't blow us away. i liked it more than my bf did. the duck fluatas on the special menu sounded interesting and the mole was good but the duck was dry and lacked that fatty rich duck flavor. it was a disappointment. the bf said both of his tacos were pretty good. the stand out was the shu mai sampler. they were really delicious. it was around 65 dollars before tip for two tacos, <mark>Lotus Chips</mark>, gouza, shu mai and fluatas and no drinks. honestly we could eat a lot of really delicious things in las vegas for less and i am a person who would happily pay more for food it it delivered in both quality and taste. you could tell the quality was there, the taste was inconsistent across our dishes and that leaves me feeling like there was not a value to our meal. \n\nwith so many places to try in las vegas i don't know if i would return but maybe for a snack of chips and shu mai because they really were special.", 
            "great food and reasonably priced for being on the strip! be sure to try the <mark>Lotus Chips</mark>!", 
            "i almost didn't go here based on yelp reviews but then decided to take a chance.  i'm glad i walked in with low expectations because i was blown away by the great food and cool ambience!\n\nwe started with the <mark>Lotus Chips</mark>.  they were perfectly seasoned, sliced paper thin and then deep fried.  the had a great crunch and because they were so thin they just crumpled in your mouth.  it was a great start to the meal!  next we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>.  this was awesome!  both my husband (who's half chinese so he knows his chinese food) and i agreed that it was one of our top <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> experiences.  they used brown rice as well so it had a nutty, and grainy texture that was very pleasant.  the <mark>Chicken Ji Song</mark> (lettuce cups) was also delicious although a bit messy with the sauce dripping onto my hand with every bite.  lastly, we tried the chilaquiles which is one of my husband's favorite foods.  it was delicious with the melted cheese and green tomatillo sauce! the waiter told us all the dishes are small plates meant to share but i thought the portions were quite big (especially the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> and chilaquiles).  the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> alone is enough for a meal for one person.\n\ni loved this place and recommend everyone to give it a try!", 
            "i was a little apprehensive about trying this place because of the mixed reviews and the prices... \n\nwe deliberated for a little while, but decided to try with the knowledge that 1) this is not really a fusion place and 2) we probably weren't going to be full.\n\nthe place is decorated really cute and fun and the service is very friendly and attentive. i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the wild mushroom taco, the 20-vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, and the <mark>Open Sesame</mark> cold noodles. my companions or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Lotus Chips</mark>, lengua taco, some kind of taco with oyster, and pozole rojo.\n\nthat wild mushroom taco was so delicious!!!! i have never had anything like it. priced at $5.50, it is rather expensive for a teeny tiny taco but i loved it and that makes it totally worth it. i thought that the noodles and <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> were also pricey, but really good and surprisingly filling. try counting 20 vegetables in the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>... try it! j really enjoyed the pozole. i'm sure he wished it came in a larger portion too. the <mark>Lotus Chips</mark> were thin and crispy, not greasy at all.\n\nso in conclusion, it's no lie that this place is super expensive. however, i still think it is worth the splurge because in the end, if the food and dining experience can exceed my expectations, then i am glad that i tried it. trust me, i have paid close to the same dollar amount for sub-par food and service.", 
            "i see this place has some not so good reviews.  i stopped in looking for something different for lunch while i was out on the strip and china poblano did not disappoint.  i sat at the bar on the right side of the restaurant and was quickly presented with a menu.  service was good, not the best i've had but it was perfectly fine.  the food was outstanding!  \n\ni started with the <mark>Lotus Chips</mark> and they were crispy, and uniquely seasoned.  i then got the lengua taco and the lamb potstickers.  both of these were also delicious and perfectly seasoned.  since i had been imbibing at the diamond lounge i did not order any drinks.  the food was 5 stars easy, the service was between a 3 and 4, but the prices . . . man it hurt.  seriously $6 for one taco, and that was it just the taco, and $13 for 5 potstickers?  i know it's the strip but i'd expect these prices up on the third floor of the cosmo not the second.  but, the food was so good i'm going to give 4 stars and will probably make my way there again."

            "mediocre meal; did not have the \"wow\" factor i was hoping for. \n\nto start, the hostess attempted to seat my client and i (both in business suits and obviously on a business lunch) at the \"communal\" table, where she said we would probably be joined by other diners but that \"it's okay, because everyone is family.\"  we glanced around the restaurant and noticed lots of open two seater tables, and kindly requested a private table since we were on a business lunch.  the hostess seemed a bit flustered by our request, but did let us eat at our own table after offering us the bar instead, which we declined.  \n\nwe tried the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>, <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, langosta tacos (lobster), and <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark>.  the best part of the meal was the lobster tacos.  they were actually very tasty, although on the small side.  everything else.... not what i expected from such a well known chef.  there's just not much to say besides it just being mediocre food.  both of us decided it was not the memorable meal we were expecting.  with all of the dining choices at the cosmopolitan, i will certainly try another option next time.", 
            "oh where to start.... my visit with this restaurant was such a disappointment and embarrassment to me and the girls. we sent back almost every dish that was brought out to us. we started with <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> a staple item to all mexican restaurants my friends or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the guacamole and asked for it mild. the guacamole was excellent, spicy but oh so good. my friend sent it back it was too spicy. i had or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> carnitas tacos which my server made a suggestion n the <mark>Cochinita</mark> which are yucatan flavored pork with marinated onions he swore i would prefers these so i took his recommendation and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> them they were brought out and oh hell no! they were awful i asked for the original order of carnitas and ugh! when they were brought out they were dripping with grease. i could not eat them. so i sat and ate chips and thought gosh i am getting pretty full..off these...chips...", 
            "so expensive for such small portions...they must be high! that was the least filling $120 lunch i've ever had. there were 4 of us and it came out to $30 each.\n\n<mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>: i appreciate the warm chips. the salsa had and ok flavor, but lacked some freshness. maybe it needs cilantro or onion.\n\ntacos: we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> 3 different of their tacos(pancita, cochinita, and barbacoa). nothing special in the way of flavor. every taco had a chunk of fat in it. and at $9 for 2 tiny tacos that adds up. \n\nlamb potstickers: meh, not really anything better than you would get in the frozen bag. they were light on flavor. we asked for some sort of sauce and the waiter obliged, but reminded us that that sauce doesn't normally come with the order. the sauce added sssooo much. if it weren't for the sauce i would have had a hard time eating it.\n\ngazpacho something: a fruit salad. this was very good, but again a very small portion.\n\n<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>: i didn't eat this because i don't like tuna, but from what a heard one of the better dishes of our lunch.\n\n<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>: recommended by the host, it was pretty good, but really oily. \n\noverall: i wouldn't go back.", 
            "i am not the type to leave a bad review but what i experienced today at lunch is simply... unacceptable.\nfirst let me say that i am a big fan of jose andres. i ate at bazaar and jaleo multiple times and love it.. so i decided to stop by china poblano for lunch today.\ni sat at the bar and my waitress was very friendly. i had the agua fresca based on her recommendation and it was delicious. i also tried the lemon drop and it was very nice. i quickly or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a gazpacho and the quail... and it went downhill from there.\nlet me first say that the place was not busy at all... \nit took at least 25 mn to get the gazpacho. my waitress apologized and i told her that it was not a big deal and things happen. now, call me difficult but if the first course took much longer than expected, you would think that they would make sure that the next course doesnt? wrong.. bottom line is, i placed my order at 11:45am.. i received my second course at 12:25pm. during the whole time, no manager approached me nothing, i finally lost patience and asked one of the waitstaff to check on it. he did but came back behind the bar without saying a word to me... so i asked him again and without looking at me said \" it is going to be a few more minutes... \". i pointed out to him that the couple next to me came later , ate and was already gone. the brought me <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>. \nand the quail? well, no one really checked on me to see if i was happy with it.. some of it was raw. for most part the dish was pretty boring. a piece of dragon fruit in the middle and 4 small pieces of fried quail. big deal. obviously i am upset. i think that they missed the mark as to how to handle guest complains. i quickly asked for the check, paid and left. won't be back. i was planning on ordering more food but the attitude from the guy behind the bar really pissed me off so i went to comme ca on the third level and finished my lunch and it was great...", 
            "i was very disappointed with this place. i was so excited about the concept, but severely let down.  $5 for a coke!!! unreal!!  the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> was ok. a little on the pricey side.\n\ni ate the <mark>Ten Treasure</mark>- fresh shrimp/ham/ seasonal vegetables/wide cellophane noodles/good fortune it was $17.  wow, only 3 shrimp and 2 pieces of small ham. not impressed.\n\nwe also had the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> melted chihuahua cheese/tequila blanco/fresh tortillas $9- not impressed with the amount of cheese i paid $9 for. \n\noverall...boo, not a vegas worthy place to eat.", 
            "admittedly, part of the reason i may be a little hard on this place is because i was planning on spending about seven bucks on a slice of pizza and a <mark>Diet Coke</mark> at the hidden pizza place in the cosmopolitan before exiting vegas, but a last second swerve turned into throwing down over $30 here instead.  anyway you look at it though, i just don't think this place was all that great.  \n\nalthough the whole concept of having chinese & mexican food on the same menu might sound interesting, at the end of the day it's not as if the menu here is combining the flavors of both cuisines into some sort of fusion dishes (that would be interesting...i'm not sure if it would be any good, but interesting).  the menu is essentially divided into chinese & mexican sections.  \n\ni decided to go w/mexican.  i had two two tacos & well as <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> to be exact.  i had a chicken mole taco, which was okay.  i'm a huge fan of mole sauce, and i can't put my finger on what it was exactly, but i just wasn't a huge fan of the mole here.  part of the problem was i think they used too much of it.  it pretty much drenched the chicken.  i also had a fish taco.  it was nothing special, pretty much your run of the mill fish taco.  i was just looking to get a little food in my system before hopping on flight and not expecting to get a full meal.  that's exactly what i got.  each taco was about two or three bites.  as for the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>...once again nothing special.  one of my dining companions went the chinese route.  she got soup and some sort of gyoza, which i tried and thought was kind of greasy (she felt the same and felt her soup was okay).  \n\nbetween three of us we spent about $90.  one dining companion or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the same two tacos i did and we split the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> (the third got the soup & gyoza).  a big portion of our bill was the <mark>Diet Coke</mark> we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> (which  were a necessity imo after all the alcohol we consumed over the weekend).  they were $5 a pop each for an 8 oz bottle and we each had two.\n\nthe food at china poblano isn't horrible, and the small portions are what's expected, but i still wasn't a big fan of this place...", 
            "take this with a grain of salt, because i was in vegas\n\ncarnitas\n\nsticky buns\n\nel pastor\n\n<mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>\n\nbarbacoa\n\nit was good, i was drunk, i don't remember", 
            "don't be fooled like me by the exterior! it looked like a normal restaurant from a glance but it isn't! as you can tell by the store name its a fusion of asain/mexican food. my bf brought be here recently to eat their tacos. i must say it was one of the best tacos i've had and i love soft tacos from trucks to stores. their carnita taco was so good. the meat was very very soft and moist. it just shreds so easily. the sauce was sweet and a very soft hit of lime which was perfect. i also had the chicken taco was to me was just okay. the chicken tasted good but the sauce was a little to strong for me. i also had the <mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark>. the meat was also again superb. the slice of pineapple, at first i was skeptical, but they complemented the meat so well. you must try that one. we also had the hot and sour soup. it was again very delish. it wasn't the typical hot and sour soup that has a lot of pepper it was more sour in a differen't way. the chicken pieces were cooked to perfection. it was so soft and moist. easy to eat. my favorite was the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>. the salsa to me was either a hit or miss with people. its either you like it or you don't because it has a some particular strong flavor. i loved it. i kept on eating it and my boyfriend just stared at me. this is a place you def need to try. although its a bit on the pricey side what isn't in vegas?  and you are in vegas! why not! just do it! :)", 
            "i came here for dinner on a weeknight because i was intrigued by the venue and concept.  the first thing i noticed was that the prices seemed quite high for chinese/mexican food, but this was the cosmopolitan, so not surprising.  we had a combination of chinese and mexican food which was good, but really nothing special.  what really surprised me was the disjointed service.  all of our food was brought out piecemeal.  my girlfriend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> two tacos and my buddy and i eached orded a soup dish.  my girlfriend got one of her tacos brought to her first.  then she sat there and waited for my buddy and i to get our food, one at a time, several minutes apart.  then my girlfriend's second taco came.  bringing out the food piecemeal would make sense if it was a family-style meal, but i think it was pretty clear we each or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> our own dish.\n\nthe kicker was that we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>, and didn't get it until we were almost done with our dinner, and then only after i asked about it.  the waitress was very friendly and pleasant, but this restaurant was just kind of off this night.\n\ni think a restaurant that charges these kinds of prices for this kind of food needs to compensate by offering something unique, whether it be service, a special venue, etc.  i just didn't see it here, and there are way too many other great dining options in vegas.  i'm glad i tried it, but will probably not go back.", 
            "my boyfriend and i came here after we missed the lunch window for wicked spoon.  we were starving (which usually allows crappy food to taste a little better) and just went for what was close.\n\ni should have known that a chinese/mexican restaurant would not be a good idea.  there is a reason why i've never come across this mix.  it's because it simply does not work!  this restaurant should either focus on making better chinese food or better mexican, not attempt to make both types of cuisines.\n\ni had the dan dan noodles and some soup with wontons (the name escapes me now).  the dan dan  noodles were okay.  the soup didn't have much flavor.  it's only saving grace were the wontons.\n\nmy boyfriend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> one lobster taco (because they are $10 a pop) and two chicken tacos (mole sauce on the side).  he said the lobster taco was good, but the chicken was just whatever.\n\noverall, the best thing that we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> was the guacamole and the <mark>Mexican Coke</mark>.  the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> were decent.",

            "when i saw china poblano on food tv's \"best thing i ever ate: las vegas,\" i knew we had to go when we were out there. it's a restaurant designed for us, really - mexican and chinese. not fusion, but three separate kitchens taking care of both of our food needs at once, without one of us sitting and watching the other eat. being that it was jos\\u00e9 andr\\u00e9s, we had high hopes, and they were met easily.\n\nhis plate: <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with mexican cream and queso fresco; carnitas taco (braised baby pig, pork rinds, spicy salsa verde cruda); pescado frito taco (fried fish, salsa mexicana)\n\nher plate: \"<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\" - delicate steamed buns with chinese barbecue pork; \"ocean nest\" - scallops/shrimp/king crab/lobster/pan-fried egg noodles/ seasonal vegetables; \"<mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>\"\n\nto share: <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> - fresh tortilla chips, house-made chipotle salsa\n\nthe <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> were good, though nothing out of this world. the pork buns were the only actually disappointing part of the meal - the dough is a little gummy and maybe overworked - though the filling was flavorful and moist, and happily not over-salty. we ended up taking these home and they were better as cold leftovers in the middle of the night.\n\nmy pan-fried egg noodles were nice and crisp, with a deliciously oceany broth. there was no king crab, which i'd been looking forward to, but the shrimp had their heads on and were fantastically fresh. the bok choy was the perfect choice for the 'seasonal vegetable' and i'd definitely get this dish again. the ocean flavor was just so good.\n\nthe fries were described as good, but not memorable. d's tacos were both fantastic, full of flavor and great textural contrasts. the carnitas were not slimy, as they are at some restaurants, and were nicely accented by the pork rinds on top. since we've been home, the tacos have been mentioned a few times. we'd love it if jos\\u00e9 added a china poblano in dc, but we'll also definitely visit it again when we're in vegas next year.", 
            "***3.5 stars***\n\nenjoyed it.  menu could still use a little refining - but amidst the overpriced nature of the strip - this place was exciting food at a reasonable price.\n\na few thoughts:\n-love the decor inside.  funky and fun - highlighted by the chinese fertility dolls in the middle/center, which are also where people sit while waiting for a table.\n\n-cocktails were great.  had the salt drink, as described by others, and it was phenomenal.\n\n-excellent service.  ali, our waiter, was attentive and just a very nice dude.\n\n\nand, food was a really unique mix of flavors.  loved the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> dish.  also the eggplant was really different (in a good way), loved the consistency of it.\n\nif i was to give this place a few suggestions it would be: a little less red meat/pork on the menu; tacos, as described by others, were a little greasy; and while the eggplant itself was cooked very well, the sauce on it was a little too heavy.\n\nlastly, get the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>.  some of the best i've ever had.", 
            "my brother wanted to try this place out and rightfully so.  i mean how many places serve chinese and mexican food under one roof?  notwithstanding the concept, the bright lights and artistic decor you felt like something was a bit off.  i expected to see a fusion of dishes on the menu, but instead it was more like two restaurants on one menu.  although i feel like its a novel concept, the prices are high for what it normally costs.  now granted maybe it costs more to maintain this kind of a restaurant, but the general knowledge of mexican and chinese food, is that it shouldn't be extremely expensive without some fancy hard to find, hard to spell, impossible to make dish that's tagged for $$$ dollars \n\nor<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>:\n<mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> $4 (the chips were good and the salsa was fire roasted)\n\nthe unruly monk - hand-cut noodles/ wild wood ear mushrooms/ poached egg/spicy sauce $17.88  (very good, although i've had this at a standard chinese restaurant at very good tastes for half the price.)\n\nlengua  - beef tongue/salsa pasilla $4 (fantastic melted in your mouth)\n\n<mark>Viva China</mark> - soft beef tendon/ kumamoto oyster/scallions/ sichuan peppercorn sauce $5.50 (one of the strangest things i've ever tasted, i'm still not sure if i liked it or not.  the consistency of the oyster just makes the whole thing a little off.)\n\nso in summary, this restaurant is an interesting idea, although i don't think its implemented quite right.  pre established bargain cuisine, such as chinese and mexican, can certainly throw someone well versed in that universe into a frenzy with prices.  although our waiter was great, the service just didn't justify the prices.\n\nif you don't plan to eat much, then it's $$, but if you plan to actually eat a meal, then make it $$$.  \n\nwould i go back?  sorry, but my dollars will be going elsewhere", 
            "ate here this past sunday night. the best i can categorize it was strange.  the atmosphere is very casual - felt more like a <mark>Cafe</mark> than a fine dining experience. long tables with backless chairs, mexican pottery and artwork on the walls. no bar to wait for your table so we went to another restaurant's bar while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. the menu is not chinese-mexican fusion it's basically half chinese and half mexican and all small servings (like tapas). our group of 4 started with guacamole which was the most expensive item on the menu. it was truly delicious and was served with homemade tortillas which brought me back to mexico in one bite.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> as well which were very good. on the chinese side we went with traditional sui mai, lamb pot stickers, and 2 noodle dishes. everything was good but not outrageous. plus i'm accustomed to dipping sauces with sui mai and pot stickers that are usually seasoned with garlic, ginger and a touch spicy. the sauces here seemed just to be soy sauce. we finished off with a few more mexican choices - <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>, scallop ceviche and barbeque beef tacos. all were very good but again not amazing. also the offerings at the bar are very limited unless you're drinking tequila which i wasn't because i had to start drinking at the bar next door so i started with sky raspberry vodka which i couldn't get at china poblano. plain vodka only here. also only chinese or mexican beer. i probably wouldn't return unless i happened to be in the cosmopolitan and was really hungry.", 
            "so i was walking through the cosmo with a big group and we decided to stop for lunch at this place. it looked nice but nothing special. i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the lettuce wraps and lamb potstickers to share with someone. the portion size was extremely small. i could have ate it all by myself instead of sharing and still not been full! the food was okay. i probably wouldnt remember the meal at all except for the fact that it was so expensive and i walked away hungry! i payed $4 dollars for a small thing of <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> (isnt that usually free?!) and for the two plates i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> (potstickers and lettuce wraps), 1 non refillable cup of juice and a can of sprite and two small tacos (2 or 3 bites) the bill came out to a wopping $78!!! i couldnt believe it! the ambiance of the  place was very cool but i would never recommend this place to someone unless they have lots of money!", 
            "a friend and i were looking around the cosmo for a food court, and we thought we walked into one when entering china poblano.\n\nboy, were we wrong.\n\nwe were immediately greeted by a very enthusiastic host who was knowledgeable of pretty much the whole menu.  he recommended things like ceviche, the house <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> (which apparently is internationally recognized) and some various kinds of dim sum.\n\nto put it very plainly, china poblano is a tapas bar and restaurant that specializes in both chinese and mexican finger food.\n\nthe thing is everything here is a bit pricey.\n\nthat being said, i elected to just get some chips, guac, <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>.  i'm normally pretty picky with my guacamole, but i must say that it was probably the best green stuff i've ever had that i didn't make myself.  that says a lot.  the chips were fresh and the salsa added a nice spicy kick.\n\nmy friend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a dim sum sampler that included two pieces each of whatever dumplings they had, which was also pretty good.\n\noverall, while we were disappointed that we'd be spending a whole lot more than we would at the food court, we walked out of the eatery pleasantly surprised.  i'll definitely be back to try that <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> the host was talking about.", 
            "i've passed by this place quite a few times, but finally decided to dine in today. the service was very attentive, but i felt like they didn't go beyond what they teach you in table-waiting 101. our server asked if we were ready for drinks, entrees, then desserts and let us know her personal favorites for each course, but didn't actually describe any of them. i honestly didn't have any problems with the service though, it's the food/prices that leave me less than satisfied. \n\nguacamole ($15): although it was pretty pricey, it was probably my favorite dish of the night. there were a lot of large chunks of avocado, which is something i could never complain about and it was very fresh and flavorful. the only thing that i didn't like was that the waitress asked if we were done with it once the chips ran out, even though we still had about a third of it left. it was just kind of annoying that she was trying to take the plate away, rather than offering us more chips.\n\nlarge pot of <mark>Jasmine Downy Pearls</mark> ($8.88) - very aromatic and tasty. i would probably come here just for the tea.  \n\n<mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> ($4): i hardly touched the salsa, but i ate all the nice and crisp chips with the guacamole. definitely worth the four bucks.\n\npescado frito ($6.50): not very flavorful and not very \"fried.\" if i'm going to pay $6.50 for one taco, i expect it to be pretty damn good. \n\ndancing eggplant ($9.88) - the waitress seemed a little reluctant when we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> this. she made sure to warn us there were bonito flakes on it and the eggplant was boiled. i had the feeling she didn't like that at all. we thought it was just okay.\n\ntraditional sui mai ($13.88): i really loved the crisp water chestnuts they added in the sui mai. the edible gold flakes on each piece also gave it a unique presentation. \n\n<mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> (hot and sour soup) $8.88: this was the most disgusting hot and sour soup i have every had. it seriously ruined my palette. the whole bowl of soup just reeked and tasted like hot red wine. i have never tasted hot and sour soup like that before. i couldn't take more than two bites of it without feeling sick because of the strong wine flavor it had. don doesn't even like hot and sour soup, but he could still taste how much worse it was than others. \n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> ($8.88): way too salty and saucy. and for a whopping $8.88, this was definitely not worth it. \n\njericalla ($11) - have you ever had abuelita hot chocolate? it comes in a package like this: http://beautifulspitup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/abuelita-mexican-hot-chocolate1.jpg containing tablets of compressed cocoa, sugar, and cinnamon: http://beautifulspitup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cut-abuelita.jpg. well, the small amount of custard on the bottom of the cup was covered in what seemed to be ground up tablets of abuelita hot chocolate: http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v1zh1nc2vaskonusyjs5ja/l.jpg and no, that was not a good thing. i felt like ai was just munching on hot chocolate powder. i mean, the custard and sorbet alone were good, but i couldn't eat those without eating all the powder. plain and simple, it sucked. \n\noverall, i loved the presentation of all the dishes, however the flavors just didn't match. the hot and sour soup really killed it for me. the only thing i think was worth coming here for was probably the tea, but that's still not something i would drive over here for.\n\nwarning: if you look at your bank statement a day or two after coming here and the amount charged is a lot higher than what you actually paid, it's because they like to \"pre-authorize\" themselves for a 30% tip, but it goes down to whatever you actually paid them when the transaction clears. why anyone would give this place a 30% tip is beyond me...", 
            "so to start off, the staff and service here was good.\n\nthe idea of this place seemed like a good idea but as my group looked over the menu, none of the food was what we were expecting.  i understand the concept of this place being that you all order small dishes to share within the group.  the waitress explained that normally you need about 2-3 dishes per person to fill you up. keep in mind each of these small dishes are about 5-25 dollars.  with a large party, this place is not worth it for you.\n\nour waiting asked if we would like to have some <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> for the table. we said sure so they brought out two sets since we had 7 people. then she goes, i can bring out some guacamole if you guys would like as well. we said, sure. so they brought out two bowls\n\ni was really craving tacos but noticed it was 5.50-10.50 for one. i asked her how big the tacos were and she said 2-3 bites worth. sorry, i don't care how good this taco was... it's not worth that price. i can get a better tasting taco in east la from a taco truck. \n\ntheir \"famous\" <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> didn't wow me either. tasted like something i could get at any regular chinese place. \n\nwhen we got out check with a grand total of 171 dollars we were pretty confused since we only order a taco each and some <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>. we then noticed we were charged 12 dollars for <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> and then 15 dollars for each bowl of guacamole. pretty shocked at this point. cool. \n\ngot home and looked at my bank account to find that 15 extra dollars was charged on my debit card from them. so overall, i'd never come to this place again.", 
            "the service was friendly and attentive on a busy night during a convention.\n\ni was in town for work, so i just grabbed a seat at the bar. the server was helpful in working my way through the menu. \n\ni had a taco night and a noodle dish. both were pretty tasty. the best tip from the server was to get sides of the homemade chili oil and habanero salsa. i think those made the meal for me.\n\ni am just not too crazy about this trend at upscale mexican places where they charged you a few bucks for <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>. oh well.", 
            "usually i read lots of reviews before eating anywhere, but seeing as we were on vacation, my wife and i took a risk and went into china poblano blind.  good thing, because had i trusted yelp's 3-star review, i might have missed out on a memorable meal.\n\ntrendy and quirky beyond belief, this restaurant exudes cool (or hipster, depending <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> view, but i took it as cool).  it has booths and community tables, and the dishes are all small plates from mexican and chinese cuisine... not much fusion, but it's nice to mix and match.  my wife and i shared <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>, with hot, fresh chips and a smoky chipotle salsa with just the right amount of kick.  i got a carnitas taco, which was succulent and had homemade pork rinds on top.  my wife liked her barbacoa taco as well.\n\nfor our \"main courses\" (although remember, it's small plates, so that doesn't really apply), i had the lemon tree shrimp, which was unbelievably good.  the shrimp tasted fresh, and the sauce was redolent with black pepper and celery, and the occasional chunk of citrus fruit.  my wife had the <mark>Beijing Glass</mark>, a noodle dish that was not to my taste, but it looked beautiful, with all the components (noodles and tons of different asian veggies) sectioned out in the bowl, waiting to be mixed.  she loved it.\n\nsome people are complaining about the size of the dishes.  well, it's small plates, and you're supposed to order 2-3 items.  the wait staff tells you that.  our waitress even asked us during lunch if we were satisfied with the amount of food we had or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> -- and we were.  far too many restaurants go for quantity over quality, but china poblano serves properly sized meals.  two or three dishes really should be enough to fill up one person.  if not, i dunno, go to one of the millions of buffets on the strip instead.  if i'm going to spend $30 on a meal, i'd honestly rather have high-quality food than \"all-you-can-eat.\"", 
            "yesterday was actually \"take two\" for us here, since we planned on meeting a friend for dinner.  he got called in to work and couldn't make it, but it wasn't necessarily a \"tragic evening\", because the food here is pretty amazing.\n\na quirky but compelling mix of chinese and mexican cuisine (but not on the same plate, thank gawd!), you're free to mix-and-match however you please, just like the decor, which i can only describe as \"big trouble in little chinese tijuana.\"\n\nwe started off with <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>. i am a sucker for fresh, warm chips and these pretty much ruled.  most with a palate for something a little kickier will find the salsa wanting, but having been burned by too many muy caliente sauces in the past, i found this one just right.\n\nbear kicked it off with one of the tacos as well - i don't remember which, but the blissful look on his face was recommendation enough for me.  i decided to mix it up with two tacos: the chicken and mole poblano and the bbq pork with marinated onions, along with \"<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\": four delicately steamed buns filled with more bbq pork.  bear had the \"special 8\" dim sum - (probably not getting the name right, but i won't forget that taste!) - delicate, tasty jewels of meat, spices and veggies swathed in very light wrappers. i had bites of the chicken and pork...which i will have to definitely try in the future!\n\nit was all a-mazing. paired with rum-and-cokes for me (<mark>Negra Modelo</mark> for bear), the tastes of each item are light and exquisite - tender meats, flavorful but not overpowering sauces, but don't sit brick-like in your stomach as most chain-restaurant style chinese and/or mexican foods have a tendency to do.  \n\nbecause i'd really had a taste for some pho noodles all week (nursing a pretty wicked cold earlier), i knew i wouldn't get them here, but when i saw \"dan-<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>\" noodles on the menu, i knew i wasn't leaving until i had some, which i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> in lieu of dessert.  i love good \"dan-dan\" as much as the next chinese food enthusiast, but these? not saying it wasn't a healthy sized portion, but these bad boys made me wish for a kiddie-pool sized bowl that i could jump into and do the backstroke in. oh, yeah.  they are that. freakin'. good.\n\nbear had a dessert i did have a bite of - mangos with a light creamy sauce and maybe pine nuts? - that i made a mental note to have next time we visit.\n\nto sum it up - awesome food, great service from everyone, but most especially from our bartender/server casey. however, i only have one 'caveat' to present.  when the bill arrived, it did give me one of those \"ruh-roh, raggy!\" moments when i saw the total.  not saying you have to be mark cuban or steve wynn to eat here, but if you have a more-than-healthy appetite - and we do, you may want to put china <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> \"special occasions only\" list.  it's just that all that wonderful food does add up (all tacos, dim sum and other items are priced separately), so you may want to have a \"point guard\" with you to keep an eye on the rising tab. \n\nother than that, i would dare say that we'll be back!", 
            "we decided to finally stop by and check out this fusion inside the cosmopolitan, since my man loves mexican and i love chinese food. it was pretty empty when we visited (around 3 pm) and we sat down at the bar where we got to watch some of the staff preparing tortillas. the prices were definitely strip-worthy, so as budget conscious people, we only picked 3 items.\n\n<mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> - for $4, it was a decent choice, and the salsa was indeed yummy.\n\ncoctel de camarones - on the pricey side for it's size ($15), though very nicely presented. we were disappointed that it did not come with chips (it is similar to ceviche) but we made do with the chips from the appetizer (which apparently, weren't refillable). it was very delicious; however, we weren't a big fan.\n\nthey had specials on the menu (which oddly enough, was only written on one of the two menus we received and isn't on the website menu) and our server suggested we try one of them. not a big fan either - it was a meat tortilla sandwich on top of a sauce (which made the tortilla itself soggy), and the flavors were nothing spectacular.\n\nservice was great however, and pretty fast. i'd try this place again, but i may stick to the china side of the menu (that said, i may just go to chinatown instead).", 
            "i was not even going to give this place a star.  the service was horrible, it took over 10 minutes for someone to approach us to take our beverage order, then it took another 10 minutes to get the drinks, which should have been our cue to leave.\n\nwe then or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> to start, which again took forever to get to us, then why we continued to order more was beyond me, but we did, which included the queso poblano dip, nothing exciting to write about, in addition to two very small tacos, which were ok, and then some potstickers, which my son said were horrible, and i took a bit and he was right.  anyway, i will spare you the rest, just don't recommend going here, and we live in vegas, and could recommend several other places that do a better job.   very disappointed!",

            "so when i heard chinese mexican fusion i expected something different than what it was. however, i wasn't disappointed when i saw the menu. it's broken up into mexican style dishes and chinese style dishes. our server said it was similar to a \"tapas\" place with small plates that were meant to be shared, or to order two plates per person for a full meal. i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the mexican asparagus and the chinese dancing eggplant. the asparagus was amazing and i devou<mark>Ichtegem's Flemish Red Ale</mark> of it. honestly would have been okay with just that because it was a pretty decent portion. the eggplant wasn't really what i expected. it's covered in a soy sauce glaze and these fish flakes (i forget the actual name, but they smell and taste really fishy). the eggplant was not the texture i expected. was hoping for something i would have to chew rather than something that just slid down my throat. the taste was okay but i couldn't do the slimy-ish texture. we had them bring <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> for the table and both were really good. i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the classic margarita and was not disappointed. if i ever make it back i really want to try the <mark>Margarita Bandera Flight</mark>, as a friend did and said it was amazing. our server was great, answe<mark>Ichtegem's Flemish Red Ale</mark> of our questions and ma<mark>Ceviche de Peje Sol</mark> great recommendations around the table that were raved about. he had no trouble dealing with the 14 rambunctious girls there for a bachelorette party and all of our food came out fairly quickly!\n\nmy gripe with this place is that even though it seems like there are a lot of choices, i had a tough time finding something to order other than my asparagus (which i was really excited about). i wish i would have or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the tacos because they looked really good. a friend had the dan dan and said it was pretty spicy, but lost or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> off the mexican portion of the menu.",

            "if you read my review of jaleo, you will find that i love, love, love jose andres and everthing he touches. china poblano is one of my go-to restaurants every time my mom comes into town and asks me where i want to eat (i mean, it is pricy, so i only get to go on my mom's dime ;) ) everything is so delicious, the service is always on point, and both are consistent. \n\nyes, it is expensive (their menu is online available through the cosmopolitan website with all prices clearly listed). yes, the portions are small. yes, it is really more chinese food + mexican food than it is fusion (the food comes from two separate kitchens, after all). \n\nwe always try to order the more rare / odd items .. can't seem to bring myself to pay $14 for a tiny order of siu mai that would probably be better at a dirty hole in the wall dim sum restaurant (sidenote: can anyone recommend a good dim sum restaurant nearby?)\n\n--\nfavorite items:\nguacamole with <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> - $15. handmade at the table, deliciously chunky. bypass if trying to save money, get it if you're splurging\n\n<mark>Viva China</mark> taco - $5.50. rich, chewy, juicy, salty, gooey. bypass if you do not like foods with \"weird\" textures. \n\n<mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> - $12.88. pretty, deliciously crispy on the outside and moist, tender lamb on the inside. must have\n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - $12.88. love the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the sauce. could be spicier. have never had authentic dan dan noodles, so i could not tell you if these are authentic or not, but delicious nonetheless. must have. \n\n<mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> - $11.88. this is the biggest portion of hot and sour soup i've ever seen in my life. definitely meant for at least 4 people. not a traditional hot and sour soup. is pretty thick. very good. \n\ndiscontinued items?:\nthey had this chile-relleno type item once with pomegranate seeds on it. it did not look appetizing but was delicious. it looks like a frog with red warts on it. i no longer see it on the menu so it may have been a special, but if you see it, i recommend it!\n\nthey also used to have scallop ceviche - super untraditional and really expensive for what you are getting, but really fun. tiny little lime with a slice of raw scallop and some brown sugar in between. sprayed with tequila. you are meant to pop the scallop in your mouth and bite into the lime in one fell swoop. i no longer see it on the menu, though. \n--\ndrinks:\n<mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> - $14. what fun! yummy, boozy fun. \n<mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark> - $15 / glass. yummy, but be careful, it's pretty spicy! \n--\n\nnot such a fan of:\nthey always push the 20-vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> because johnny iuzzini said it was his favorite dish on the show \"best thing i ever ate.\" i find it bland, boring, and wayyyyy overpriced.\n\ndancing eggplant - really pretty! i don't really like eggplant in general, though. \n--\n\ncons about the restaurant itself:\nthe restaurant is literally right outside of marquee. at lunch in the summer, it's overrun by trashy girls in swimsuits without coverups and douchey bros trying to get into the dayclub. at dinner time, it's overrun by girls in skimpy dresses wobbling in their heels and douchey bros with popped collars trying to get into the nightclub. luckily, if you have a reservation, you never have to wait for long, and sometimes they will have you wait inside on the steps rather than out in the throng. \n\nthe chairs in the middle of the restaurant have no backs. i'm a sloucher anyway, but sometimes after a big meal you want to lean back and pat your belly, but if you try to do that you will just topple over. there are no purse hooks under the table, and since the chairs don't have backs, you either have to hold your bag in your lap or, if you are lucky enough to be a group with an odd number of people, on the spare seat.",

            "my friends arrived on a later flight and hadn't eaten their dinner yet, so this was the first restaurant we found here just by walking around the second floor of the cosmo. the place looked interesting with it's very casual atmosphere, and so, although i was kind of skeptical about a place serving chinese and mexican food, we decided to keep an open mind as it looked pretty decent. but boy, was it a bad mistake coming here.\n\nthe hostess was nice enough to seat us right away even though the place looked relatively full. the server came over and welcomed us and asked us what we'd like to drink.....but i had a hard time understanding her as it sounded like she had laryngitis or something. anyway, we decided to try a mix of dishes since the server recommended we perhaps try 2 chinese dishes and 2 mexican dishes just to mix it up. we  didn't want to order too much since it was pretty late so went ahead and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the chips & salsa, <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles, dancing eggplant.....then we looked over at the next table and the dish they or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> looked interesting so we asked them how and what it was? ...it was the gan pung ji chicken and they told us it was very good! so ok, we went ahead and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> it just to try something different.\n\noh boy. the eggplant dish had a thick black sauce over it that totally overpowered the eggplant ....kind of tasted like and overly sweet hoisin sauce, but whatever it was, we didn't like it at all. the eggplant itself was cooked ok, but would have been tasteless without something on it, but not that strong. next, was the <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles which is more like a small noodle salad where you have to mix all the ingredients together yourself. something tasted off about these noodles, and again, we didn't like it at all. next was the chicken dish. it's basically a fancied up lemon chicken type dish. sauce was starchy and way too sweet.\n\ni think the best part of the dinner was the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> which tasted fresh...and together with our coronas and red wine....somewhat made us forget about the chinese food we had just ate. \n\ni can't say i will ever come back to this place as there are so many better places to eat in vegas. and the prices of the dishes here are not cheap for what you get! next time i think we'll stick to a real chinese restaurant for real chinese food.", 
            "i know i shouldn't have expected an authentic chinese/mexican restaurant, but i can't help it.  we were hungry, my grandma wanted to be at the cosmo and we thought this place looked cool.  while it looks cool and the staff is very friendly, i was very disappointed with the food and the prices. my boyfriend bought...well, i can't remember the spanish name for it, but he said it translates (literally) to spoiled cheese.  it was my first time trying it, but he said that it was mediocre for how much he was being charged ($10 for a small thing of cheese and a few tortillas on the side, what).  i got the papas fritos, which was actually filling because it was really just a bunch of fries in mole and queso fresco.  it was ok, i expected there to be more cheese and the fries to be crispier. also, again it was a small amount of fries and it was worth $7.  'scuse me, but i could go to robertos and get a huge ass box of carne asada fries for that same price.  i would get five times as much as you gave me. my grandma got the pork buns (siopao) and man.  that really disappointed me.  after being an avid chinatown visitor of both la and las vegas, and being of filipino descent, i was appalled that these four, dainty buns were $12.  if you're going to charge that much, these buns better be damn good.  nope.  i ate it all though because i didn't want to waste food that was expensive. it ended up being over $40 for just three plates.  mind you, we didn't even order other beverages.  oh, and they charge $4 for the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>. seriously?! sadly, the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> were the only good dish too.  \n\ni would rather go to panda express for \"chinese\" or taco bell for \"mexican\", that way we would've saved our money.", 
            "walking in the place has a very relaxed vibe and beware the chairs are heavier than they look. ha\n\nour waiter recommended the mango margarita which has the perfect hint of spice. i took him up on it and was not sorry. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>, <mark>Fried Wonton</mark>, several tacos and a caesar salad. the first thing that came out was our tacos, random. \n\nhowever, they were delicious! if you're not too hungry go that route. the salsa is a chipotle style so it was a nice contrast. they add a spice to the chips that rocks. the wontons are not crazy deep fried and they come with a nice sauce. i didn't eat the salad but my mate said it was the best he's had in awhile, i'll take his word for it. \n\nit was a casual easy going experience and i definitely recommend trying it!", 
            "it satisfied its purpose. \n\nwe had a reservation for new years, the place was swamped. there was six of us and we each had different dishes. \n\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> guacamole, <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> to start off. the salsa was really good and gave us time to check out the menu. \n\nwe had or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> drinks which took around 15-20 minutes to arrive. they were simple drinks; beer, vodka soda, gin soda, etcetera. \n\nthe server said he'd explain the menu eventually but never really got around to it. \n\ni or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> chilaquiles and added chicken to them (which is very common in the original dish), the chicken came separate and seemed to have been dipped in oil. i still threw it on the hot pan that contained the chilaquiles and mixed them together (which should've been done in the kitchen, i think), and proceeded to eat. they were okay, nothing remarkable. \n\nat the end, we got the check all together for the group. i guess the rush did let the server have separate tabs(?).  surprisingly, they had already added the \"gratuity\" in the check and the server forgot to mention it. \n\n\nonce again, this was during new years eve. may be a single occasion but i still would have expected more at a restaurant inside a casino.",

            "well stopped to get a quick bite while the room was being cleaned. we got the quesa funding and the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>. the chips were incredible, salsa was a little sweet, and the cheese on the corn tortillas were slightly greasy but full of flavor. pretty price for the amount you get, but these appetizers are good for about two people.", 
            "i came to china poblano a few years ago and had a pretty great experience, so was anxious to take my boyfriend here on my most recent trip about a month ago, and man oh man was i severely disappointed. \n\nthe concept of serving mexican and chinese food in the same restaurant is intriguing and in an odd way, works extremely well. no matter what dish you end up ordering, the food is definitely good. that's where my two stars come from. so a+ on the food and even the unique decor. \n\nthe service though... oh man the service. quite horrendous. first, we had a 20 minute wait for a table, but when our name was finally called we were sat at the bar (apparently bar is not self-seating here, but requires a host to seat you here). my boyfriend and i like sitting across from each other during meals, so felt a little odd to be next to each other, but nonetheless, it didn't bother us much as it was kind of fun to sit up where we could experience the action of the bartender and tortilla chef first-hand. we started off by ordering a drink each and an order of <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> (which i must say, considering 95% of mexican restaurants give chips & salsa for free, this was a little pricey here). they weren't bad, but i have had better elsewhere. we then or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> 4 tacos (2 tacos each). about 20 minutes after ordering, 1 taco was delivered. where the other 3 were, we had no idea. we asked the bartender, who was also our waiter, and he had no idea either. he went to the kitchen to check and came back to tell us it would just be a few more minutes. about another 20 minutes passed by, and 2 more tacos were delivered. we were still missing the 4th and questioned where that one may be. finally, another 10 minutes later, the 4th and final taco had been delivered. this long wait for 4 measly tacos was just ridiculous to me. the bartender did try to help, but it fell a little short. he could not offer to compensate us for the drinks we've already or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>, but he did tell us we could each order one more drink and those would be on the house, so we took up his offer and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> 2 more drinks.we then got our check, paid and left, dissatisfied, and still very hungry. \n\nthe next day, my boyfriend noticed that the amount charged on his card was more than was on the initial bill. they ended up charging him for the 2 \"on the house\" drinks. this issue has still not been resolved. \n\ni really love the food here and the atmosphere is fun, i just really wish the service would improve and that free drinks were truly free.", 
            "we expected the menu to be a fusion of flavors but really it was just a restaurant offering two different menus in one. portions were small, food was severely over priced and they served their sodas per bottle. the food quality wasn't good. the shining star was their salsa and chips. the salsa is great, but do yourself a favor and take it to go and pair it with food from somewhere else. the staff is moving your plates and grabbing plates to clear the table while your still eating, but the actual server who takes your order was mia we had to ask someone to get him for us. it makes enjoying a dinner with your friends and family hard. get the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> to go but don't stay and eat.", 
            "a creative concept, but execution is mediocre.\n\nhonestly, the idea of a chinese and mexican restaurant usually would have me running in the opposite direction (i hate fusion places), but the jose andres connection really drew me in. this place isn't a fusion restaurant, it's really just a bunch of mexican and chinese options. \n\nmy sister and i got: chips & salsa, 2 tacos (hongos & <mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark>), 1 order of <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>, 1 order of <mark>Swallow a Cloud</mark> (wonton noodle soup), and 1 order of <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> (fried pork buns with condensed milk dipping sauce).\n\nthe <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> were okay - salty chips but good chipotle salsa. the tacos were also okay; the hongos (mushrooms) one was way too citrus-y and could've used more guac to balance out, and the pancitas <mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark> (pork belly) was good because of the pineapples in it. my sister did say that the pork belly could have been a lot more tender, though. <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> was not good. the noodles were off, and the peanut sauce was salty and too spicy even after adding the vinegar brown sauce on the side. the <mark>Swallow a Cloud</mark> wonton soup was also mediocre because of the bland noodles. i think the winning dish was <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> - who would have thought condensed milk to dip fried pork buns into is actually really yummy? \n\nthe concept is creative because there are a lot of options, and the drinks menu looked good, but the food itself was just mediocre. maybe coming from california set the standard high for asian and mexican food, but this place was a little too expensive for just the mediocrity."

            "conceptually \"chinese mexican fusion,\" china poblano is billed as a blending of the two rich cultures.  located on the 2nd floor of the cosmopolitan somewhat hidden in the back, the restaurant is certainly eye catching.  with an entryway shaped like buddha and \"mexican takeout\" windows on either side the campy feel is palpable, but acceptable.  with an interior of communal and separate dining tables, a noodle making station, and wall decorations ranging from chinese opera masks and lanterns to luchador masks and oaxacan carvings the interior was colorful to say the least.  in addition to the fixed objects there were also large morphing murals - projections of famous and peasant chinese and mexican individuals.  to see the restaurant is to love it-or perhaps to hate it-it is certainly over the top.\n\narriving in warm soft shells and approximately three bites each the first tastes of taco would come from langosta.  described as meaty lobster/mango/arbol <mark>Monk Chile Sauce</mark> ($16 for 2 now, $6/e prev) the flavors were good, but unfortunately the lobster was slightly overcooked and i felt the <mark>Monk Chile Sauce</mark> overwhelmed the subtleties of the sweet crustacean.\n\nsilencio tacos - duck tongue/rambutan fruit ($4.5/e.)  unfamiliar with rambutan until this time i was impressed by the fleshy sweet fruit and its ability to temper the salty, savory, and somewhat chewy tongues.  while not as nuanced as some of the other tacos, these are definitely worth checking out if only to experience the ingredients at a relatively cheap price.\n\nthe cochinita tacos, described as yucatan-style pit barbeque pork/marinated onions ($4/e) were good, but rather expected and unidimensional.   savory and sweet the pork and onions melded nicely, but in total the flavor was no better or worse than a good pork taco anywhere else.\n\ncarnitas braised baby pig/pork rinds/spicy salsa verde cruda ($4/e prev.)  with the braised baby pig perfectly done-supple, moist and flavorful-the addition of pork rinds added a lovely degree of crunch and saltiness.  tempering the other two dishes and adding a bit of spice plus vegetal acidity the salsa was spicy without being overly so-in my opinion they should serve this salsa instead of the chipotle version with the tortilla chips.\n\ncoctel de camarones fresh shrimp/jumbo lump crab meat/tomato/avocado ($12.)  essentially a whole lot of underwhelming salsa in a bowl with a couple of snappy sweet shrimp, thin shreds of crab, and chunks of avocado plus tortillas for dunking it was almost as if someone forgot to add salt, or spice, or vinegar, or really anything other than the listed ingredients which simply were not of all that impressive quality.\n\nlove is in the air heirloom tomatoes/sugar air ($8.88) was much simpler in ingredients and much more complex in flavor.  nicely presented in a large bowl with what must have been two fresh whole tomatoes and a splash of vinegar the dish was topped with an \"mg\" manufactured foam full of delicate sweetness that acted only to enhance the natural flavors of the tomatoes beneath.\n\n<mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> vegetables/crispy lace ($11.88 now, $8.88 at our visit) delivered five pockets of lamb, cabbage, radish, and smoky seasonings inside a crispy lace shell.  while slightly oily, the lamb itself was impressively cooked and not a bit gamey-with the m\\u00e9lange of vegetables elevated by the cumin and black pepper this dish was clever and tasty with obvious contributions from both hispanic and chinese cultures.\n\nocean nest scallops/crab/shrimp/pan-fried egg noodles/seasonal vegetables ($10 at our visit and now $22 w/ king crab/lobster) would be a successful yet rather ordinary dish.  with crispy noodles resting in a gentle fish broth at the base and three head-on shrimp, three scallops, and a few chunks of crab interspersed with bok choy, spinach, and onions the flavors all worked and the textures were nicely done-at $10 the dish was a steal, but lobster or not i don't think i'd recommend it at the current price point unless there was a good deal more seafood.\n\nthe unruly monk with hand-cut noodles/bok choy/wild wood ear mushrooms/poached egg ($16) was served in an enormous bowl with perhaps a half liter of broth, boiled bok choy, a single egg, and a plethora of mushrooms the dish would be a nearly mirror experience of the ocean nest-a nicely executed dish, but no better than could be made at a local chinese restaurant in most mid-sized us cities.\n\nin the end i think the verdict is still out on china poblano - i'm not willing to rule it out, but i'm also not ready to say the \"concept\" (which is exactly what it is) \"works.\"  while certain dishes worked to great effect, others merely represented decent versions of americanized ethnic food, and some were simply underwhelming.  looking at the menu only 2 weeks after my visit i already see many changes and given andres' propensity for exploration i've no doubt the menu will continue to evolve as they find what works and doesn't.",

            "2.5 stars\n\nunfortunately, i was ultimately disappointed.  the service was actually quite excellent, but the food ultimately fell short, considering the price.  \n\nit was interesting to see that in the front of house, there were two kitchens.  a mexican kitchen and a chinese kitchen on opposite ends.  i was hoping for more fusion entr\\u00e9es, but there were only a few.  the menu was predominantly mexican or chinese.  \n\nsetas tacos: mushroom tacos.  nothing special.  it felt it needed some kind of fresh vegetable in there to add some crunch.\n\n<mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>: actually pretty good with an amazing variety of vegetables in it.  good flavors, season well.  is it worth paying $16 for <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>...however good it may be?  questionable.\n\nthe unruly monk: hand-cut noodle soup.  when it came out, it smelled absolutely amazing and then it went downhill from there.  the hand-cut noodles were overcooked and mushy.  the broth lacked flavor.\n\n<mark>Beijing Glass</mark>: my friend had this one.  it actually had a nice crunch and was refreshing.  i'd call this dish a success.\n\nguacamole: this was really good guacamole with just a hint of heat.  but $12 for only one cup of guac????  c'mon...that's crazy talk. \n\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with <mark>XO Sauce</mark>: interesting concept, but wow...that <mark>XO Sauce</mark> is extremely overpowering and extremely greasy.  i had about 4 fries, but after that, it was too much.\n\nhappy buddha giggling taking a bath: it seemed like a pretty fun dessert.  how can you not like a jello mold of buddha sitting in lychee foam??  it was fun to squeeze his cheeks to make his mouth move, but it was pure novelty and not worth the $10. \n\nall-in-all, it was some hits, but more misses.  great service kinda made up for it.", 
            "picky eaters do not apply. to enjoy this place, you have to be an adventurous eater.  if you just get chips, <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, or a pork bun, you will not be happy.  \n\nfor foodies who won't turn their nose up at a beef tendon taco, this is the place for you!  super creative food and a great bargain for what you get.  \n\nwe started out with the pozole rojo ($9) which is a spicy shredded pork soup with chickpeas, cabbage, pork rinds, chopped onions, radish, and avocado.  this was a really good portion size for $9 and so tasty.  you can get it with a shot of tequila for an extra $3 but our server didn't recommend it unless we just wanted to do a tequila shot. apparently the tequila is offered for hangovers.  hair of the dog, you know.\n\nnext we tried the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco ($5.50 each) which has beef tendon, a kumamoto oyster, and sichuan sauce.  yes, beef tendon in a taco.  this was extremely tasty.  i could eat ten of these.\n\nwe also tried the cochinita taco ($4.50 each).  it's pretty much pork and pickled onions.  pretty good, but the carnitas taco topped with pork rinds is so much better.\n\nanother great dish was the papas with <mark>XO Sauce</mark> ($6).  french fries covered in a dried scallop sauce.  they serve it with lime, which you think would be awful.  but it's actually really, really good!\n\nthe big surprise of the night was the gaspacho morelia ($10).  this is a huge plate of very fresh, very tasty fruit covered in freshly squeezed orange juice.  some of the fruit had some spicy seasoning on it, which enhanced the flavor of the fruit.  pineapple, watermelon, mango, jicama, dragonfruit, strawberries, and queso fresca. very good and light.\n\nthe cocktails are also very inventive.  i don't think i can ever have a normal margarita again after having the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> ($12) served here.  the salt foam is a perfect compliment to the margarita and doesn't have the harsh taste of salt on the rim.  my husband had the <mark>Lychee Sour</mark> ($12) which was also very good.  \n\n$63 before tip and we were very, very full.  service was impeccable and very friendly.  just focus on the more creative dishes.  yeah, you can get a pork bun in chinatown for cheaper.  of course you can get a carne asada taco at a taco truck for cheaper.  come here for the creative dishes that you can't get anywhere else.",

            "oh my, chinese and mexican fusion...i should have thought of that earlier. despite how different the 2 cuisines might look, they have a lot of similarities.\n\nwe started with some drinks. i had the \"salt air\" margarita -- and oh my. this works a lot better than salt around the rim because you can just get a mouthful of the salt while drinking. the undesired effect is that you might get a \"milk mustache\" after you drink it, but hey, it's cute, right? definitely a must-try if you like margaritas.\n\nthe food here is served in small plates, so it's a good idea to share everything so you get to try a bunch of stuff. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> quite a few things to share, and some of them, unfortunately, were on the saltier side (smoking chef?), but other than that everything tasted good.\n\nof all the things, i recommend trying the siu mai (thin skin, delicious pork), the chile en nogata (the walnut cream really made the dish) and the lamb potstickers (it's got that crispy lace which is oh so hard to make!). they have a few items with the shirley lee family <mark>XO Sauce</mark>, but i'm not a fan of that...i prefer other brands' <mark>XO Sauce</mark> much better. if you like handmade noodles, you might want to try them here too -- while they're not the best i've had, they were hearty and rustic, and will surely win a few hearts.\n\noverall, it's a very interesting place where you can get the best of both worlds. when you're surrounded by all different sorts of restaurants in vegas, it's nice to see something different.", 
            "i have seriously been trying to eat here for years, but there is always a really long wait without a reservation...and of course, i was never smart enough to make a reservation.  the girls and i needed a quick dinner and it was rather early, so i was hoping there would be no wait.  luckily, i was right.  when we first sat down, the bus boy brought us water immediately, but then no one came over to us for what seemed like 20 minutes.  we eventually had to flag a waiter down, who was very apologetic and proceeded to provide the best service ever!  not only was our server very attentive, so was the rest of the staff.  even the hostess came by at one point to check on us, which i found rather strange but funny, all at the same time lol.  \n\nwe started with the fried <mark>Lotus Chips</mark> with mole sauce.  just an fyi: the fried <mark>Lotus Chips</mark> do not come with mole sauce.  the waiter offered it to us for making us wait, i believe, and i sure am glad he did.  the fried <mark>Lotus Chips</mark> are good, but a bit plain.  however with the mole sauce, it was delicious!  one of the girls or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the pozole rojo, which was good, but it was nothing compared to the caldo tlalpe\\u00f1o the other girl or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>.  the caldo tlalpe\\u00f1o was so flavorful that it was hard to believe that it was only soup.  here's a warning: if you cannot take spice, then the caldo tlalpe\\u00f1o is definitely not for you.  sorry, sucker lol.  i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> one each of the lengua taco and the barbarcoa taco, which were both delightful.  lastly, we shared one order of the diver scallops and green beans in <mark>XO Sauce</mark>.  i love scallops, green beans, and <mark>XO Sauce</mark>...however this was a tad salty.  it was mostly the <mark>XO Sauce</mark> so i made due by not getting too much sauce in each bite, which worked out nicely.  \n\nfinally, to make up for forgetting about us, the waiter brought out a complimentary dessert, mango and sticky rice.  i love this dessert anyway so i was pretty excited when he brought it out, but of course it had a twist to it.  normally, it doesn't come with whipped cream on top, but this one did with what seemed like crispy rice treats inside.  anyway, i don't normally eat whipped cream since it's so fattening, but i figured hey, i'm on vacation...live a little!  and man, am i glad i did!  yum!", 
            "i like jose andres, chinese food and mexican food.  put them all together you'd get something spectacular, right?  well, at least that's i hoped for.\n\nthe service at china poblano was good.  i loved the interior.  images of mao, frida kahlo, the dalai lama, etc. projected on screen on the walls - nice touch.\n\ni had the <mark>Jasmine Downy Pearls</mark> tea and it was amazing.  it was fragrant and it tasted good.  it was a neat idea that they give you a timer so you get to enjoy the perfect tea whether you like it mild, medium or strong.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a bun of different things from the menu:\n\n<mark>Golden Pigs</mark>:\n4 fried bbq pork buns with a side of condensed milk.  dipping pork buns on condensed milk might seem pretty odd but it works.  sweet and savory just go well together.  5/5\n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>:\na braised pork sandwich.  the bread tastes just like biscuits but the filling's saaaalty. if you look at the menu, you'll see \"<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>\" in a box which will make you think that's their specialty.  honestly, i hated it. 1/5\n\ntacos (carnitas, langosta, <mark>Viva China</mark>, pescado frito):\nthe carnitas came with pork rinds on top but the pork in the taco was dripping in oil.  just let the oil drip off your taco and you're all set. great taco variety. 4/5\n\n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>:\n4 steamed bbq pork buns. yep, that's all i can say about that.  nothing special. 3/5\n\nlucky six siu mai:\n2 scallop siu mai, 2 beef siu mai and 2 traditional siu mai topped with itty bitty pieces of gold leaf. 3/5\n\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with mole:\ni wanted fries with my sandwich.  i had to pick between mole and <mark>XO Sauce</mark>.  fries + <mark>XO Sauce</mark> just doesn't seem appetizing so i went with mole.  the mole was overpowering.  there was a scant amount of mexican cream and queso fresco.  i can usually finish an order of fries but not this one. 2/5\n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> with chorizo:\nagain, nothing special. 3/5\n\nmango sticky rice:\nthis was the best thing on the menu.  instead of using sticky rice, they used puffed rice so you get that nice crunch with a nice creamy coconut sauce and semi-sweet mangoes. 5/5\n\nchocolate terra cotta warriors:\nthe name \"warriors\" is misleading because you only get one warrior made of chocolate filled with chocolate mousse on top of cookie crumbs and ginger ice cream.  it looks like something just died on my plate complete with dirt and flowers.  the presentation was just too funny but this chocoholic wasn't 100% pleased with the taste but the creativity was there. 4/5\n\ncajeta flan:\na flan made with goat's milk served with salted caramel ice cream and pineapple chunks.  the flan was mild and the salted caramel ice cream was just lovely. 4/5\n\nso why 3 stars?  for the amount and type of food you get vs. the price, not worth it.  it's like they grabbed the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> from viva zapatas, steamed bbq pork buns and siu mai from spring mountain, fish tacos from rubio's for like $3 each and decided to serve it to you for double or triple the price.  part of what makes chinese and mexican food great is that they're inexpensive.", 
            "my friend talked up chef jose andres so much on a (sorta) recent trip to dc that the name stuck, and after seeing it tagged to china poblano at the cosmopolitan, i figured it was destiny calling and just had to try it. \n\ni'm not really of the belief that culinary experiences, however life-changing they may be, should break the bank and i'll just tell you now that for two people, drinks, four small plates and dessert, came in at about a couple dollars over 100--but make an exception for this place because it was pretty effing good. \n\njust know what to order. \n\nthe 18 <mark>18 Monk Noodle</mark> was so amazing. you don't even realize the noodles are whole wheat, because they're just so good with the sauce and the shitakes. our waiter suggested we opt for the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> as opposed to the ceviche pargo and i could've, no wait--should've hugged him for it. the tuna was so fresh. the soy it was bathed in and amaranth seeds that topped it really enhanced the fish in a way that is pretty indescribable. \n\nwe also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, and the xo scallops in <mark>XO Sauce</mark>. i wouldn't recommend either because you didn't really come here for melted cheese and i don't want you to pay $18.88 for two golf-sized scallops, respectively. that was our mistake--but don't make it yours! a side note, they were both good, but not great and your hard earned dollars deserve great, okay?\n\nafter dollar signs kept racing through my head as i tried to figure out the damage, i wasn't really up to pay another double-digit figure for dessert, but the lady next to us devoured her mango sticky rice in a matter of minutes, so we thought, we'd come this far. #yolo \n\nanyways, it was so incredibly good! it's not your traditional thai-place-msr by any means. it's so light and airy and everything in it just works so well that as i write this all i really want to do is drive down to the cosmopolitan in my jammies and order it. \n\nas far as the service, and given it was a tuesday night, we got seated right away. our waiter, miller, was awesome! he didn't shy away from putting his two-cents when he knew we were making potentially catastrophic mistakes trying to decide what to eat and god bless him for it.",

            "i was super excited to have been able to get dinner reservations at china poblano on its opening day.  having grown up eating a lot of chinese and mexican food, i was excited about this fusion of such different cuisines.  furthermore, i had high expectations for a restaurant of chef jose andres.  unfortunately, i was underwhelmed by my experience at this new casual dining restaurant.\n\nfirst, service was not up to par.  despite our 7 o'clock reservations, we had to wait about 45 minutes to get seated.  we were comped guacamole and chips for the long wait, which was a nice gesture.  servers kept bringing us dishes which were meant for other tables, which became annoying after the third time.  \n\nsecond, the food was just okay.  the menu is split up between mexican cuisine and chinese cuisine, with a few fushion dishes.  i thought the whole menu would consist of fusion dishes. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a variety of dishes from both sections of the menu -- nothing really stood out as being delicious.  the <mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark> taco was good.  the fries with mole was interesting. the hot and sour soup was salty.  the dishes are all very small, tapas style and they bring out everything as it is ready. \n\nfor dessert we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the chocolate warrior and giggling buddha.  both looked interesting but neither tasted good. \n\nas for decor and ambiance ... the restuarant is casual, the atmosphere is fun.  the decor is kinda tacky looking.  with all of its bright colors and funky decorations, it kind of reminded me of pink tacos.\n\nall in all, i love the concept and the history behind the fusion of mexican and chinese food. i also feel like the china poblano has a lot of potential.  however, it definitely has a lot of kinks it needs to work out before it can be a big hit.", 
            "portion sizes are like tapas. prices are like standard entrees. tastes are nothing to remember. you're basically paying for flashy street food, but the prices are 3-4x more. i initially went to china poblano because i heard that the tacos were insanely good. i must have misheard that conversation.\n\nwe started off with a pot of golden monkey tea, which was pretty good. they hand you a perfect tea timer with your pot, so you can enjoy your brew just how you like it. i was impressed, so far. then, i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> some food.\n\nappetizesr:\n-shu mai scallops (6 pcs) - shu mai was more gooey than the usual plumpness that i expect from shu mai. it wasn't that great, especially for the $12 price.\n-steamed oat noodles:  noodles were a little overcooked. dipping sauce was average. regretted ordering after first bite.\n\nfood:\n-<mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark> (pork belly + pineapple tacos) (2 pcs) -  this was ok. didn't blow my mind or anything. i'll take real $2 street tacos over these $9 tacos any day.\n-<mark>Viva China</mark> tacos (beef tendon + oyster + scallions) -  a taco recommended by the waiter.  again, nothing special.\n-<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> - a tasty, juicy pork sandwich. by far the best tasting food on our table. you only get one per order. and, it's tiny.\n\noverall, the apps were mediocre. the food is puny, bland, and pricey. ended up spending over $30 a person and we were still hungry.\n\nwe stopped ordering food after receiving plate after plate of disappointment. we ended up going to the hidden pizza shop upstairs to make up for this mediocrity. spent $4 there and enjoyed that meal that made my stomach and wallet happy.", 
            "while wandering around looking for a place to eat, my friends and i stumbled upon china poblano.  once someone pointed out to me that it is a jose andres restaurant, i knew i had to try it.  although i didn't think it was his best, i enjoyed every dish i had for one reason or another.\n\nlike most of his restaurants, china poblano is more of a tapas-style place in that they serve up smaller plates intended to be shared amongst a group.  eating in this manner, i was able to try three different dishes. the first were the lamb pot stickers which were small in size, but surprisingly filling.  i enjoyed the \"crispy lace\" (in essence, extra fried bits from the pan, which is never a bad thing) and thought they were well made, but overall didn't find them different enough from anything i've had before.  on the other hand, the two types of tacos i tried were both tasty and very original.  the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco has soft beef tendon, kumamoto oyster, and a touch of a slightly spicy sauce on top.  the oyster was the real standout here, as the softness of it complemented the texture of the tendon, while the natural saltiness of it really added a punch to the dish.  the other taco i tried was the <mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark>, which is slow-cooked pork belly and pineapple.  if you know me, you know i love pork belly, so this was a big winner.  the saltiness of the tender pork belly balanced so well with the sweetness of the pineapple and made for a great dish.\n\nwe also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> some drinks.  i shared the cold \"tea\" for two, which was a mixture of green tea, tequila, and beer.  the presentation was nice, as it comes out in a tea pot and is served in a couple nice glasses, but flavor was a bit off.  although i found it a refreshing drink, i thought they added a bit too much lemon to it and wished there was more of a green tea flavor.  another friend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the lemon drop \"soup,\" a lemon vodka drink with lemon \"noodles\" made out of a gelatin-like substance.  it also seemed very refreshing, and the \"noodles\" were an interesting touch.\n\noverall, i really enjoyed my lunch at china poblano.  although it was a little expensive for a normal lunch, spending $25 to share 3 dishes and a drink at a jose andres restaurant seemed pretty reasonable.  although it wasn't quite good enough to break into 4 star territory (felt like more of a 3.5 to me) i would definitely recommend checking it out if you are a fan of his, or if you are just looking for something different to try.", 
            "great concept...not so great portion sizes.\n\ni reallly do love tacos from china poblano but i don't like the prices. $15 for guac? omg. $14 for siu mai? omg!!!! i don't even remember what i paid for 2 pork belly <mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark>. \n\ni have eaten her 2x. once in a hurry before entering marquee and last  week in no rush for a late lunch. the place was calm and somewhat empty so we got great service. \n\nsure they hand make dim sum here but i think they are creating dim sum for elves/fairies! i needed a microscope to see my siu mai. they are packed with flavor but not worth $14 for 6 tiny pieces. \n\ni think they need to work on their portions and maybe hire some dim sum chefs from the bay area. they are on point with the tacos so i won't ding em there. just be prepared to pay a pretty penny for food that costs next to nothing at home. \n\nvegas tip: order from the to-go window if you're roaming around the hotel and try the tacos. don't forget to order a beer!", 
            "not much to recommend here. as a general rule, i come to vegas prepared to spend cash, so i'm not going to dock this place for being ridiculously overpriced relative to your traditional mexican or chinese restaurant. $4-$5 per taco and $22 for a seafood noodle dish may seem steep, but i'm ok with it if the food is top notch. \n\nunfortunately, china poblano fell short of expectations. the <mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark> taco had very little pork belly and was overwhelmed by sauce. the portion sizes were small across the board. the guacamole was pretty good, but then again, it's pretty hard to screw up guac. \n\ni would not dine here again nor would i recommend it to others.", 
            "i loved the tacos! \n\nmy friend and i each or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> two because we wanted a snack before dinner. but they were so good that i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> one more and she or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> two more. i didn't know it was a restaurant by andres until i overheard a server telling another table. i wasn't surprised each taco was $5 because i'm used to overpaying in vegas but it was well worth it! each taco was so flavorful!\n\nconchinita - bbq pork with magenta-colored marinated onions\n\nbarbacoa del res- bbq beef with chile and pickled cactus\n\n<mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark> - pork belly with pineapple",

            "i really enjoyed our dining experience here. if i could live on a diet of  just <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>, i would.  what a delightful concoction! we went for more of a mexican feast than chinese, so here is the breakdown.\n\nthe tacos: \n<mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark> (slow-cooked pork belly/ pineapple) - great play on flavors. the pork belly had good crispness to it and complemented the pineapple. \n\n<mark>Viva China</mark>* (soft beef tendon/ kumamoto oyster/scallions/ sichuan peppercorn sauce) - my husband's favorite. great fusion taco. the tendon was cooked just right. \n\nsilencio (duck tongue/ fresh lychee) - neither of us had tried duck tongue before, so we had to try it. fantastic! the sauce had a bit of spice to it that really made work. \n\n<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> (oaxacan-style barbeque beef/guajillo chile/ pickled cactus paddle) - the was a big taco filled with flavorful barbacoa and nopales. i'm not sure if it was worth the price, but it was tasty. \n\ncarnitas (braised baby pig/pork rinds/ spicy salsa verde cruda) - this was the favorite of the night. the carnitas were perfect, but the addition of the pork rinds really made this taco off the chain! we could have eaten 10 of these. \n\nthe rest:\nhuitlacoche noodles (wild mushrooms/ fresh mexican corn truffle/ knife-shaved noodles) - the huitlacoche actually worked well in this dish. i wasn't sure going in, but felt adventurous. the noodles were cooked perfectly. this is a dish that is big enough to share. this dish was surprisingly spicy, so beware. \n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> (melted chihuahua cheese/tequila blanco/fresh tortillas...with chorizo) - tasty! maybe a bit expensive. it reminded me of being with family in mexico and eating fresh tortillas off of the comal with cheese. \n\nmango sticky rice - the was actually a cream of sweet rice on top of mango shave ice topped with crispy rice (think rice krispies) and fresh mango. very refreshing! \n\nour server was attentive and the manager even came by the see if we were satisfied. overall, we had a pleasant dining experience.", 
            "don't be fooled like me by the exterior! it looked like a normal restaurant from a glance but it isn't! as you can tell by the store name its a fusion of asain/mexican food. my bf brought be here recently to eat their tacos. i must say it was one of the best tacos i've had and i love soft tacos from trucks to stores. their carnita taco was so good. the meat was very very soft and moist. it just shreds so easily. the sauce was sweet and a very soft hit of lime which was perfect. i also had the chicken taco was to me was just okay. the chicken tasted good but the sauce was a little to strong for me. i also had the <mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark>. the meat was also again superb. the slice of pineapple, at first i was skeptical, but they complemented the meat so well. you must try that one. we also had the hot and sour soup. it was again very delish. it wasn't the typical hot and sour soup that has a lot of pepper it was more sour in a differen't way. the chicken pieces were cooked to perfection. it was so soft and moist. easy to eat. my favorite was the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>. the salsa to me was either a hit or miss with people. its either you like it or you don't because it has a some particular strong flavor. i loved it. i kept on eating it and my boyfriend just stared at me. this is a place you def need to try. although its a bit on the pricey side what isn't in vegas?  and you are in vegas! why not! just do it! :)", 
            "went here close to a month ago and just getting around to posting a review. we've tried several other restaurants at the cosmo and have become fans of the resort and it's food offerings. <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark> started off not so great, with the hostess service a bit frenzied and disorganized. there was no one at the hostess area and a bunch of us milling by the entrance not sure what was going on. once seated, everything changed. the server was awesome...cheerful, knowledgeable and attentive. the service seemed a bit rushed at times. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> six different things and the time in between servings was sometimes not enough. i have no problem with the portions, which are on the small side and for the most part really aren't suitable for sharing unless you order a bunch of things.   i'm always about quality and not quantity, and the quality was excellent. these dishes, sauces, etc. aren't just slapped together. they are creative, complex and well executed. the prices for small plates is high, but again, cosmo on the strip, what do you expect.  now for the food: \n\n<mark>Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll</mark> - delicious, but nothing really set it apart from all the other good <mark>Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll</mark>. \n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - wheat noodles in a spicy pork sauce. omg. it's been a month and i still can't stop thinking about it. \n\n20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>. the price will blow you away, but have to say we really enjoyed it. the time and effort that goes into this dish is incredible and you can literally identify all 20 vegetables finely chopped in perfect proportions. \n\ncarnitas taco - awesome. the spicy verde cruda sauce...i asked for a side dish of it and almost drank it. \n\n<mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark>. had never tried pork belly, and the combination with pineapple was intriguing. good, but not my favorite. \n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> - outstanding, with a nice slightly burnt top to the cheese, perfect texture and great tortillas.\n\nthe beer was cold but could have been colder.\n\nwill definitely be back.",

            "the first thing that went wrong was on the wall. at first, i liked the decor --a casual, colorful blend of chinese and mexican motifs --chinese opera masks, oaxacan wood carvings, red glass lanterns, bicycle wheels on the ceiling (not sure the country, but cool). they also had portraits that were actually large projections, that switched every few minutes. so you had frida kahlo, the dalai lama (not chinese, by the way!) and random peasants.\n\nwhat pissed me off before our food even came out was that they were projecting a photo of mao. if you were running a german restaurant, would you put up a picture of hitler? because that's basically who mao was in china. i know it's consi<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> hip and trendy to use mao's image as a cultural icon, but this must stop. \n\nokay, on to the food. the next thing that went wrong was they brought out the wrong order --we'd or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> duck tongue tacos, they brought the beef tendon with kumamoto oyster. my husband took a bite and realized the mistake --and also that the oyster was really off. i could smell it across the table, and no way should a fresh oyster smell that strong. kumamotos are my favorite oyster so i am very familiar with a fresh, sweet specimen. this was wrong. \n\nour server was very friendly and seemed sharp, she took it away with an apology and we got the duck tongue. i took a bite and it was pretty tasty. however, i couldn't get over the fact that i was chewing on a tongue, and tender and flavorful as it was, i couldn't take another bite. \n\nhowever, the salsa that came with the tacos was delicous. i was eating it with a spoon (since i didn't want any more tongue). one of the best salsas i've had, it ranks up there with papalote's in sf and cancun's in berkeley. really amazing. \n\nthe <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> was fresh and healthy --a big mixture of chilled glass noodles and veggies. it was underdressed, however, and finally we asked for extra dressing which helped a lot. \n\nthe gazpacho was a big surprise --we expected the traditional soup presentation, but instead, got a bowl of cut fruit, and a server squeezed orange over it, tableside. it was delicious, with jicama and dragonfruit in the mix. \n\nwe also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the scallop ceviche at the recommendation of our server and this was a huge disappointment. for the price (about $12, i think) we got 4 bay scallops (tiny). the concept was cool --they were served on top of limes that had chiles and sugar on top. you popped the scallop and followed with a squeeze of sugary, spicy lime juice. it just underwhelmed because the scallops were so diminutive and less than stellar. for that price and with that presentation, you expect stellar and full-sized diver freshness. \n\nthe dessert we got was great --tres lychees (a play on tres leches cake). the lychees came three ways --in a milk-soaked cake, whole, on top of the cake, and as a foam. \n\nour whole lunch bill came to about $75, and i was still a little hungry afterwards. if you go, i recommend being extremely judicious with your ordering, read reviews to see what's good, and maybe stash a snack in your purse.\n\nsome people have complained that there isn't enough \"fusion\" on the menu --but most of the dishes (even if they're listed as \"mexican\" or \"chinese\" only) have a twist. we discovered that the twists are not necessarily explained on the menu, and you may get some big surprises (like our gazpacho). so i appreciate what the restaurant is trying to do --blend two disparate traditions in a delicious way, surprise with ingredients, and use molecular techniques when it enhances the food.", 
            "i lived in dc for a while, so i am a frequent visitor to jose andres' restaurants and an avid fan.  i was really excited to try his new restaurant in vegas, and it did not disappoint!  i came here with a group of 4 people, and we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> 11 dishes i believe + 2 desserts.  they have a few chefs working at the front of the restaurant so people walking by can watch them make handmade tortillas and hand pulled noodles.  they also have two take out windows with a smaller menu that you can order from.  the decor is modern with chinese and mexican elements and made me think of something i would see in an urban outfitters catalog or on display at the moma.\n\nthe guacamole and hand made tortillas were to die for!  i could have just eaten guacamole for dinner.  and they have the best tortillas i've ever had.  my favorite presentation was the scallop ceviche, which they place on a carmelized key lime.  they lightly spray vodka on it, you eat the scallop, and then squeeze the lime into your mouth.  almost like taking a tequila shot.  i also thought the hand pulled noodles were amazing and cooked to perfection.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the unruly monk soup, and it was very light and refreshing, but at the same time, full of vegetables.  i would probably come here for lunch and order just that and maybe a small side dish.  we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> another soup, <mark>Caldo Tlalpeno</mark>, which i thought was more fusion, and i also enjoyed that soup as well.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the nice, but naughty dish with lotus root and pea shoots which doesn't taste very chinese because the pea shoots were somewhat raw but i enjoyed it nonetheless.  i also enjoyed the <mark>Chicken Ji Song</mark> and liked the presentation of it, especially with the fried sweet potato on top.  we tried a bunch of different tacos, and i think flavorwise, i liked the beef tendon and it was melt in your mouth tender, but also the greasiest taco out of all of them.  we didn't end up order any dim sum because i knew i could probably eat tastier (and cheaper) dim sum in chinatown.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the flan and the happy buddha giggling taking a bath.  the flan is deliciously creamy and easily one of the best flans i've ever had.  the happy buddha is really cute and he really is taking a bath!  it's one of the most entertaining desserts i've ever had.  it isn't your normal jello.  they make it from scratch with fresh strawberries and use seaweed extract instead of gelatin, and it has a very smooth flavor.  it's very refreshing at the end of a huge meal.\n\nthe dishes aren't that expensive but they do add up very quickly, and we ended up spending more than i wanted to, but it was definitely a fun and enjoyable experience, not to mention yummy!", 
            "food is amazing!!!! like every food item we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> melted in my mouth. \n\nnot a fan of the table layout - all the tables are very small and only 1 ft away from the next table...so if you get stuck to someone annoying they will become a part of your meal...not cool\n\nportion sizes are tiny - so you wind up ordering 3ish items per person which is ok but doesn't work well when you have such a small table",

            "where else can you dine under the watchful gaze of mao zedong? it's ironic that his image is used in a restaurant since under his... um... leadership... millions starved due to his wackadoodle policies. and, let's not even mention the whole torture and death thing.\n\nbut, i digress. my wife and i stopped by china (pronounced \"chee na\") poblano after already eating dinner a couple hours earlier. so we only got 2 things. now, on to the food...\n\nlangosta tacos ($16) - lobster, salsa mexicana, arbol <mark>Monk Chile Sauce</mark>. 2 per order. the lobster was a little tough and the tortilla was too small compared to the amount of filling. the tortilla was also too fragile -- it tore apart as i picked it up to take a bite. they should have doubled up the tortillas for each taco like typical street tacos.\n\ncoctel de camarones ($12) - fresh shrimp, jumbo lump crab meat, tomato, avocado. it's basically a soup bowl of salsa with a few shrimp and bits of crab meat and avocado thrown in. it's served cold, which i wasn't expecting. if you like fishing out your food from a bowl of salsa, this is the dish for you. i wasn't a fan.\n\nsingapore sling ($11). a delicious cocktail made of gin, brandy, pineapple juice and some other stuff. it goes down a little too easy.\n\nthe bottle of coke that my wife or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> was cool. it's hard to screw up coke.\n\ni really want to like this place. i love the concept and i'm a big fan of jos\\u00e9 andr\\u00e9s. i'll gladly go back to try other dishes because there are many items that sound delicious. i just hope my next meal won't be as torturous. haha... get it? mao... torture...", 
            "i enjoyed some of the food and drinks at china poblano, but i am baffled as to what the fuss is all about.\n\nmy biggest pet peeve with this restaurant was that it is pretentiously creative.  i agree that the concept of chinese and mexican food served together is an interesting (and successful) one, but then it goes too far.  for example, i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> gazpacho, expecting some semblance of a cold vegetable soup.  when the waitress brought a fruit plate with orange juice drizzled on top, i assumed the kitchen had made a simple mistake and tried to send it back.  she explained that it was, indeed, gazpacho.  but where was the soup?  she said that the orange juice was the liquid (but literally, the juice was squeezed on like you might squeeze lemon onto a piece of fish...there were only a few drops).  call it a fruit plate, but don't call it gazpacho.  gazpacho is a soup.  this was not soup.\n\nthe same thing happened with dessert.  i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the mango sticky rice and, behold, there was not a single grain of rice on the plate.  the waitress proudly proclaimed that it was \"their take\" on sticky rice, which was really a milky reduction with some mango puree.  if it had blown my mind flavor-wise, i would have been fine with it, but as it was it was a weak little dessert and the texture was slimy.\n\nalso, unless you're dining with only one other person, the concept of sharing at this small plates restaurant will be frustrating.  i spent a relative lot of money on a not-too-substantial amount of food.  plus, the carnitas tacos were too salty.\n\nthe service, too, was unimpressive.  our waitress completely forgot to bring a drink my friend had or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>, and the servers were repeatedly bringing the wrong dishes to our table.  everything seemed disorganized.\n\ni loved my margarita, the salt breeze margarita (served with a delightfully light and airy salt foam on top).  i also loved the guacamole.  but, really, i can find good margaritas and guacamole at plenty of other places in vegas.  on the whole, china poblano was a disappointment.",

            "while wandering around looking for a place to eat, my friends and i stumbled upon china poblano.  once someone pointed out to me that it is a jose andres restaurant, i knew i had to try it.  although i didn't think it was his best, i enjoyed every dish i had for one reason or another.\n\nlike most of his restaurants, china poblano is more of a tapas-style place in that they serve up smaller plates intended to be shared amongst a group.  eating in this manner, i was able to try three different dishes. the first were the lamb pot stickers which were small in size, but surprisingly filling.  i enjoyed the \"crispy lace\" (in essence, extra fried bits from the pan, which is never a bad thing) and thought they were well made, but overall didn't find them different enough from anything i've had before.  on the other hand, the two types of tacos i tried were both tasty and very original.  the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco has soft beef tendon, kumamoto oyster, and a touch of a slightly spicy sauce on top.  the oyster was the real standout here, as the softness of it complemented the texture of the tendon, while the natural saltiness of it really added a punch to the dish.  the other taco i tried was the <mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark>, which is slow-cooked pork belly and pineapple.  if you know me, you know i love pork belly, so this was a big winner.  the saltiness of the tender pork belly balanced so well with the sweetness of the pineapple and made for a great dish.\n\nwe also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> some drinks.  i shared the cold \"tea\" for two, which was a mixture of green tea, tequila, and beer.  the presentation was nice, as it comes out in a tea pot and is served in a couple nice glasses, but flavor was a bit off.  although i found it a refreshing drink, i thought they added a bit too much lemon to it and wished there was more of a green tea flavor.  another friend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the lemon drop \"soup,\" a lemon vodka drink with lemon \"noodles\" made out of a gelatin-like substance.  it also seemed very refreshing, and the \"noodles\" were an interesting touch.\n\noverall, i really enjoyed my lunch at china poblano.  although it was a little expensive for a normal lunch, spending $25 to share 3 dishes and a drink at a jose andres restaurant seemed pretty reasonable.  although it wasn't quite good enough to break into 4 star territory (felt like more of a 3.5 to me) i would definitely recommend checking it out if you are a fan of his, or if you are just looking for something different to try.", 
            "this place is fun and i love the concept, but the execution culinary-wise is not quite up to snuff.\n\nthis is an interesting concept: take the best of both culinary cultures, and blend some to create unique dishes. it's fusion, but not totally, since some of the dishes remain faithful to the traditional recipes.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> and shared family style, so that meant we sampled a bunch of tacos and noodles. some were nice hits, some were really bad misses.\n\nhighlights:\nhuitlacoche noodles - i've always wanted to try huitlacoche (corn smut fungus), and it integrates seamlessly into this chinese-styled dish. however, they skimped on how much huitlacoche they gave. also it takes on flavors so well that i couldn't tell what was the corn itself or if it just absorbed the black bean sauce. still very tasty though.\npozole - i love pozole already and it's funny because there's tons of hominy in this dish (whereas the huitlacoche was lacking). the twist is that they give chinese shrimp crackers to dip instead. yum.\ndim sum - in general all the dim sum was good, but not great here.\n\nlowlights:\nunholy monk soup - the blandest, blandest soup evar. don't monks usually deprive themselves of earthly pleasures? eat this and you'll feel like a monk too - this dish deprives you of all flavor. don't give alms to this one.\n<mark>Viva China</mark> tacos - this has oysters. i pretty much only like oysters fresh & raw with lemon. when oysters get messed with any more than that, they tend to taste funky. the rest of the taco - very good. the oyster part - bad.\n\nso while this place has a great concept, some of the dishes just aren't very good. i like how they maintain both traditional and want to mix it up too. the bad dishes were very bad, the good dishes were pretty good. i guarantee that you'll have fun here though.", 
            "like a 4.47 rounded all the way up because the lakers are on a 4-game winning streak. \n\ni came to china poblano during its opening week. a couple feet ahead of me, at the front of the restaurant, was big papi himself: jose andres. wearing baby blue, tweeting from his blackberry, eating what looked like every single dish on the menu, teaching his three daughters (who were sitting in descending order by height) how to use chopsticks - how cute.     \n\nanyway, the food. the bottom-line for me at any restaurant is the final product. the flavors, the textures, the temperature contrasts, all the good shit, working in unison to evoke memories or tell new stories. value, ambiance, service - that stuff's nice, too - but i'm not going to knock off stars from any restaurant if the waitress didn't fill my cup of coffee six times, or if i couldn't understand the gibberish coming out of the filipino waitress' mouth. notably, the ambiance and service at this restaurant were super-chill (like, 5/5 chill). \n\nhaving said that, the food here was generally very good, too.

            "my boyfriend and i stumbled in here after getting lost in the maze of the cosmopolitan hotel and finding out that it was 10pm and not many places were open (surprising since this is vegas).  it looked promising.  we were expecting a little fancy schmancy for the meal, price-wise and portion-wise, but we were in for a shock.  extremely pricey for extrememely small protion sizes.  i understand the whole tapas concept, but these tapas were barely enough for one person to share with himself, let alone two whole people.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the scallop ceviche, which unbeknownst to us, was deconstructed.  i believe it was a $16 plate consisting of 4 parboiled baby scallops, like a large bay scallop (think: size of a little bouncy ball you get in a quarter machine), each sitting on a half key lime, sprinkled with what looked like paprika on top.  it tasted like a parboiled scallop sitting on top of a dry lime, sprinkled with something flavorless on top.  i cringed as i ate each scallop, thinking this was sooo not worth $4, even for vegas, especially for vegas.  next came carnitas tacos.  2 tiny street size tacos, which i will admit were very tasty, but again, very tiny, not filling at all.  at this point we were dying.  then came the pork siu mai to save the day.  i believe these were one of the cheaper menu items, but it had twice as much food as our first 3 plates combined.  they were really tasty too, i could tell they were hand made.  these little dumplings were our saviors, at least we could leave feeling like we ate something and not pass out from starvation on our way out the door.  i expected a little more food, flavor, and decor to make up for the bill we were presented with.   that said, i won't be coming back,  and i wish i never came.",

            "so expensive for such small portions...they must be high! that was the least filling $120 lunch i've ever had. there were 4 of us and it came out to $30 each.\n\n<mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>: i appreciate the warm chips. the salsa had and ok flavor, but lacked some freshness. maybe it needs cilantro or onion.\n\ntacos: we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> 3 different of their tacos(pancita, cochinita, and barbacoa). nothing special in the way of flavor. every taco had a chunk of fat in it. and at $9 for 2 tiny tacos that adds up. \n\nlamb potstickers: meh, not really anything better than you would get in the frozen bag. they were light on flavor. we asked for some sort of sauce and the waiter obliged, but reminded us that that sauce doesn't normally come with the order. the sauce added sssooo much. if it weren't for the sauce i would have had a hard time eating it.\n\ngazpacho something: a fruit salad. this was very good, but again a very small portion.\n\n<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>: i didn't eat this because i don't like tuna, but from what a heard one of the better dishes of our lunch.\n\n<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>: recommended by the host, it was pretty good, but really oily. \n\noverall: i wouldn't go back.", 
            "chinese and mexican under one roof? weird, right?\n\nwrong.  so good!  they recommend that you order 2-3 plates for each person and share.  so, almost like chinese tapas... with a mexican flair. choices are available from dim sum, noodles, tacos, soups, etc.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> some of the more traditional choices, like shu mai and tacos (both chicken and barbacoa), which were very good.  but the best were the off the beaten path items... the rainbow congee (soup with sausage, carrots, and snow peas) was delicious.  it seemed like it had polenta or some similar base, and the flavors complemented each other with the added crunch of the veggies.  by far, the wen rou salad was the best! tofu and avocado were blended with a delicious citrus based sauce which was phenomenal.\n\ni see so many of the reviews talk of how expensive this place is.  ok, but it is the cosmopolitan!! hello! this place is one of the more reasonable in the hotel (even the buffet is $29 per person) and we were really glad to have eaten here instead.  we had two dishes each and we were not hungry at all.\n\ni would definitely go back.  the flavors were amazing!", 
            "after countless stories about how great chef jose andres is i assumed this place would be absolutely amazing.  therefore, i set my bar preeeetty high for this place and expected greatness.  what i got was decent mexican and chinese food.  many of the reviews were right, its not some type of amazing fusion blend of the 2 but more so of the 2 cuisines in one restaurant.\n\nthe tongue(lengua) tacos were very delicious, but after having some authentic tacos from the ghetto side of vegas, it made these ones look like a joke as there was no special kick to it.\n\nwe also tried the dan dan noodles which were pretty unique out of all the dishes we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>, but for some reason didnt hit the spot.  i couldn't taste too much of the unique flavors as it was just plain spicy.\n\noverall, its not a horrible place, but nothing spectacular to earn a 4-5 stars in my book.", 
            "i made the mistake of having such high expectations of china poblano because they were just completely crushed.  i had heard so much about  culinary genius, jose andres and that is the reason i even went into the restaurant after perusing the menu.  if it was not associated with jose andres, i would have immediately done a 180 after seeing the $11.00 price tag on a serving a dim sum.  \n\njose andres is known for his tapas servings and so our group or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a number of tapas servings to share.  and they were just ok.  it wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind blowing either.  if i am paying $8 for a mini mini pork sandwich- it better blow my mind, and it did not.  my favorite dish was the eggplant dish, but it wasn't fabulous enough for me to return. i even tried eating the chinese dish and mexican dish, side by side to see if that would make a difference in the \"experience\", but it didn't.  in fact, i still don't get it.  it was not a fusion restaurant, but rather two menus in one. \n\nthe ambience is cool and trendy, but next time i am considering mexican or chinese, i will definitely go elsewhere, where the flavor satisfaction matches the price.  i can get ambience elsewhere.",

            "after reading the reviews, i guess i was expecting more.  we started with the setas, which were very good.  but the caldo tlalpe\\u00f1o was much more soupy than what i expected.  unfortunately, it was followed by the <mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> (hot and sour) soup.  although that is what we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>, the dishes come out from the kitchen as they are ready.  it would have been better if the setas had been served between the caldo and the soup.\n\nbut the big disappointment came at desert.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the chocolate terra cotta warriors which are described as \"caramelized bananas / sesame.\"  but what came out was three thin cross sections of a banana and a chocolate \"terra cotta warrior\" on a bed of dry oreo cookie crumgs.  the chocolate was filled with a chocolate creme and there were two dollops of vanilla ice cream on the plate, but despite all of that, the desert was exceptionally dry.  great presentation, but short on the edibility scale.\n\ni had the <mark>Santa Quiteria</mark> with the meal.  it was so-so and the portion was among the smallest pour of any wine i had while in las vegas.\n\ni don't think this place really compares to rick bayless's restaurants or other top restaurants in las vegas.  but if you are near the city centre and want a quick, small bite, this is a good place to go.",

            "it hurts to write this review because i have been to jose andres' restaurants in washington dc and i have absolutely loved them and had great experiences with his food. \nhowever, china poblano was absolutely terrible. my husband and i tried items from the mexican and the chinese menu and while the mexican was slightly better, everything we tried was awful. everything on the menu is tapas sized, so you are expected to order 3-4 items per person. luckily we decided to start slow..we had a number of different tacos (lobster, fried fish and mushroom) and all were greasy and tasteless. the guacamole and chips (which was $15!!) was ok. little did we know that it would be the only truly edible thing we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>! we then decided to try some chinese items and got some traditional shu mail dumplings and mongolian beef stir fry. the dumplings had a bizarre raw pork flavor to them that was so disgusting that i actually couldnt even swallow the dumpling and the mongolian beef stir fry was completely bizarre... tiny little chunks of grisly beef stir fried with pieces of romaine lettuce?! and then the icing on the cake was the bill.. i know this is las vegas and i certainly wasnt expecting a budget dinner, but since we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> very little food (4 tacos, an order of guac, the dumplings and the beef) and only or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> two agua frescas and no alcohol i was absolutely floored when i saw that the bill was over $100! \n\ndefinitely skip china poblano-- if you want to try jose andres' fabulous food-- go to washington dc... because you certainly won't find it here at china poblano!",

            "china poblano is an asian/mexican fusion restaurant that has good intentions but i think misses the mark on communicating their vision and does not get you good bang for your buck.  \n\ni went here for brunch, as the cosmopolitan is limited on breakfast options.  the group i went with was also not very familiar with the fusion concept.  when we were looking through the menu, many of them were confused because the menu wasnt clearly communicating what was a \"traditional\" asian item, \"traditional\" mexican item & \"fusion\" item.  they also didn't have a good enough description as to what was in a taco, on a tortilla or what was a soup/ceviche on their brunch menu.  most of my party had no idea what they or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> until it arrived.\n\ni thought it was too expensive for what you got.  first, chips, guacamole, salsa were all extra costs.  our salsa literally looked like a splash of salsa in the bowl.  if you're going to charge me for it, it better be a bowl of salsa.  many of the items were about $5-$10 and you literally got (1) taco with no sides of beans or rice.  you would have to spend about $20 each to get a decent meal.\n\ni got the chilaquiles, which are normally my favorite brunch item.  when they arrived, it was not what i qualify as a good chilaquiles.  the chips barely had any sauce on them, it was too cheesy and chorizo was just plopped down on top of it.  i basically had chili cheese nachos and was disappointed.",

            "i was one of the few people up bright and early after a night of partying and decided to trek the strip with one of the girls. we came upon this restaurant and got lured in by the window displaying noodles being made. i suppose this isn't so much an \"asian fusion\" restaurant; it merely serves both chinese and mexican food \"side-by-side\" as it advertises, which doesn't seem that great, does it? i mean, one side is going to suck, right? \n\nand it's not that great. granted, i only tried the mexican food, but at 13 bucks for some shiu-mai, i'm not that much of a sucker. so my friend and i went for the tacos.  i got the barbacoa and was told the mushroom was highly recommended. at 4.50 a pop, i'm expecting some high quality stuff. but alas, all i got was some pretty ho-hum tacos on a nice looking frosty plate. my friend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the cochinta, and said she'd come back for that again \n\nwe also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> off the brunch menu. i forget the name, but it's akin to a glamorized version of nachos topped with fried egg. extremely forgettable.  \n\ni will give them this though - service was amazing. these were some of the nicest fellows ever and really made us feel quite comfortable. unfortunately, i don't think the food is up to par.",

            "stopped in the cosmopolitan and were looking for a different style restaurant to try and we came across china poblano. we had looked into jose andres' other restaurant but it exceeded our budget a bit and we saw this place we thought it would be a fun place to try. hostess was really nice and made us a reservation for later that night. we did have to wait a little bit for our table when it didn't look particularly crowded later on when we came back, but nothing to really complain over. \n\nservice: was good. nothing extremely noteworthy but i felt like they checked in on us frequently enought and the food was out in a reasonable amount of time. our waiter sugessted some of his favorites and overall i think the service was nice. \n\ncocktails: i had the lemon drop which is a \"noodle\" inspired cocktail that comes with chopsticks. i didn't love it and for $12 a pop i wanted to love it. after a few sips the noodles got to be annoying and it was a little too sweet for my taste and i like sweet. \n\nfood: we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> some appetizers. got the <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark>. i liked them but i wish the lamb had a bit more flavor to it. needed more seasoning of some sort. for my entree i got the ocean nest which is scallops/shrimp/king crab/lobster/pan-fried egg noodles/ seasonal vegetables. heads are on the shrimp so if that freaks you out its good to know before hand. i really loved the broth of the dish and the whole thing all together, but it was really difficult to eat. by that i mean you can't look cute eating what looks like a birds nest of tightly wound noodles, especially with chopsticks. \n\ni like the setting of the restaurant. it's a nice space. i would come back again but maybe try the mexican half of the menu.", 
            "the tacos are delicious! \n\nmy favorite is the carnitas - braised baby pig and spicy salsa verde w/ pork rinds!!! the <mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> was pretty good too. \n\nthe langosta (lobster) taco's were ok. i don't think it was worth it for the price. \n\nthe tacos are the size of mexican street tacos so order a few to taste. \n\nthe <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles is a yummy cold noodle dish w/ veggies. i found it refreshing. the avocados on top were a good mix. \n\ni also had the har gau dumplings. the outside of the dumpling was good, dumplings must be freshly made, but i thought the inside could use a little more taste. \n\noverall, this is a pretty good place for higher end china/mex. it's tough to find a china mex restaurant anyway.", 
            "i was always curious what kind of restaurant this was because of their cool looking art work in front. this restaurant is a fusion of chinese and mexican. my girlfriends and i decided to get some tacos to go. i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a carnita and a pollo a la parrilla taco. the tacos are really small but it came in these cute brown to go boxes. the carnita would definitely have to be my favorite out of the two. it comes with braised baby pork, pork rinds, and spicy  salsa verde cruda. yum! not sure if i want to come back here again since it gave me a stomach ache afterwards. :(", 
            "i enjoyed the stylish atmosphere, however the food was okay.\n\nthe music and decor created an upbeat, enjoyable atmosphere. although seating is limited in the dining room, they do offer seats at the bar(s). they have two sets of bars. \n\nthe menu is broken into two different sections: chinese and mexican. i chose two chinese items. \n\nthe lamb pot stickers were okay. the pot stickers presentation was nice. all four of the pot stickers were elegantly made together to appear like a pizza with four perforations that made separation from each other much easier. they had an odd smell and no real flavor. the pot stickers were simple there to eat. would i order them again? no. \n\nthe second item i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> was the <mark>Ocean's Nest</mark>. it had a wonderful medley of vegetables and seafood nestled on top of the crispy, fried noodles. although i expected soft noodles for the dish, the crispy noodles become soft as the lightly sauced dish saturated some of the noodles. i wasn't a big fan of the crispness of the noodles particularly when trying to cut the noodles so it was easier for me to eat. i thought the dish wasn't bad. i would have been happier with soft noodles, but the vegetables and seafood were tasty. would i order the item again? probably not.\n\ni did think the menu prices were quite reasonable for what i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>. overall, the atmosphere makes for nice conversation, but better food can be found elsewhere.", 
            "i'm really surprised by all the positive reviews of this place. i had 3 tacos: barbacoa, carnitas, and a cochinita. we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> guacamole for the table. \n\nthe tacos are literally street tacos. the ones you can finish in 2 bites. i didn't think any of the tacos had much flavor or kick to it. being priced at $5.50/taco, this is absurd!\n\nthe guacamole you can rave about, but it is $15 for a small order. really? we needed two for our table.\n\ni don't even consider this place a fusion. it just serves both mexican or  chinese food on the menu.\n\nthis is my first jose andres restaurant and probably my last.",

            "when i first saw china poblano, i thought it was just some gussied up chinese joint at the cosmopolitan.  when i looked a little closer, i realized it was some kind of combo mexican-chinese restaurant.  when i checked them out on my phone, i learned they were a jose andres creation.  when my friends suggested them for lunch, i was game.  when we were done, i was sorely unimpressed.\n\nnow, it's probably my fault for assuming, but looking at the place, i was under the impression that china poblano offered a fusion of chinese and mexican food.  in reality, they mostly offer chinese and mexican food.  as in, one and the other.  not as in, a melding of two very different cuisines.  disappointing enough already, but that also meant having to get two things in order to try both sides of the menu.  after asking the waiter for suggestions, i took his advice and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a couple of tacos to go with my noodle dish (he warned that the portions were \"small-ish\"):\n\n- <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gj_bxupv672ywng4tnejog?select=1znpnnpui4mude6ntxrxea) - underwhelming.  the noodles themselves were okay and i liked how the pork sauce was actually spicy, but the dish seemed salty.  really, the only flavors i could really get out of it was spiciness and saltiness.  i didn't expect much and they still fell short.\n- carnitas taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gj_bxupv672ywng4tnejog?select=bqntt9gfks5ol5gszhwr2a) - fail.  unlike my noodle dish, i actually had hopes for this one.  rather than crispy, grilled meat, i was greeted with a mound of shredded pork dripping with oil (check out the ends of the wrapper) and a topping of deep fried fat (think pork rinds but worse).  no bueno.\n- pescado frito (fried fish) taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gj_bxupv672ywng4tnejog?select=ilju8hdfd1exvl_ezkffea) - by default, it was the best thing i had.  on its own, it was only decent.  the fish and pickled onions worked, but i thought the flavor was too muted.  if it was a little stronger, i would have liked it more.\n\ngiven the celebrity chef owner and china poblano's location on the strip, the meal wasn't cheap.  to charge $5.50 for that carnitas taco (and to a lesser extent, $6.50 for that pescado taco) is practically criminal though.  with just the $12 i spent on the tacos, i can find a better chinese noodle dish and tacos, and still have change to tip.  unless you're a big jose andres fan, you're better off going elsewhere (like holstein's next door).", 
            "food was good (both the asian and mexican dishes we had), but the small portions in conjunction with the high prices mean that i won't be going back.\n\ni also agree with those saying this is not consi<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> fusion really.  i was expecting something more like chino bandido (an asian/mexican fusion place in arizona) or something like that.", 
            "this dining experience was amazing! we came here for lunch and weren't really expecting much as we were just wandering around trying to find a place to eat within the cosmo. we stumbled across this place which is a little hard to find and were pleasantly surprised. the ambiance was so unique. sort of asian/hipster combination. there are bike wheels on the ceilings and pictures of monumental figures on the wall that change with time. there are two bar areas to sit and order food or drinks.\n\nthere is an amazing place to wait if there is no room immediately for a table. it is really unique!!! the food was excellent and so diverse. i loved the chinese/mexican fusion. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the langosta taco's, <mark>Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll</mark>, chips & salsa (seasoned so well), vegetable jaiozi dumplings (dim sum), my fiance had the chicken lettuce wraps, and we split the churros. the churros come with a chocolate milk sort of dip it's not solely chocolate. i wish they served it with just chocolate as traditional churros are typically serviced with. they were also a little too sugary. i also wish that they had more dipping sauces. they only have soy sauces. i don't like soy sauce so i was hoping they would have a lighter sauce or some type of orange sauce but they did not have it. they also do not have coffee. if they work out some of those issues, this is a 5 star restaurant :)\n\nall and all we will definitely dine here. we really enjoyed it for lunch although it can get quite busy. make a reservation or pop in and sit in the cool waiting area. this is a great lunch option at the cosmo! for dinner i'm sure that it is probably a different scene and i'm not sure what that may be! we will definitely check it out next time.", 
            "my brother wanted to try this place out and rightfully so.  i mean how many places serve chinese and mexican food under one roof?  notwithstanding the concept, the bright lights and artistic decor you felt like something was a bit off.  i expected to see a fusion of dishes on the menu, but instead it was more like two restaurants on one menu.  although i feel like its a novel concept, the prices are high for what it normally costs.  now granted maybe it costs more to maintain this kind of a restaurant, but the general knowledge of mexican and chinese food, is that it shouldn't be extremely expensive without some fancy hard to find, hard to spell, impossible to make dish that's tagged for $$$ dollars \n\nor<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>:\n<mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> $4 (the chips were good and the salsa was fire roasted)\n\nthe unruly monk - hand-cut noodles/ wild wood ear mushrooms/ poached egg/spicy sauce $17.88  (very good, although i've had this at a standard chinese restaurant at very good tastes for half the price.)\n\nlengua  - beef tongue/salsa pasilla $4 (fantastic melted in your mouth)\n\n<mark>Viva China</mark> - soft beef tendon/ kumamoto oyster/scallions/ sichuan peppercorn sauce $5.50 (one of the strangest things i've ever tasted, i'm still not sure if i liked it or not.  the consistency of the oyster just makes the whole thing a little off.)\n\nso in summary, this restaurant is an interesting idea, although i don't think its implemented quite right.  pre established bargain cuisine, such as chinese and mexican, can certainly throw someone well versed in that universe into a frenzy with prices.  although our waiter was great, the service just didn't justify the prices.\n\nif you don't plan to eat much, then it's $$, but if you plan to actually eat a meal, then make it $$$.  \n\nwould i go back?  sorry, but my dollars will be going elsewhere", 
            "ate here this past sunday night. the best i can categorize it was strange.  the atmosphere is very casual - felt more like a <mark>Cafe</mark> than a fine dining experience. long tables with backless chairs, mexican pottery and artwork on the walls. no bar to wait for your table so we went to another restaurant's bar while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. the menu is not chinese-mexican fusion it's basically half chinese and half mexican and all small servings (like tapas). our group of 4 started with guacamole which was the most expensive item on the menu. it was truly delicious and was served with homemade tortillas which brought me back to mexico in one bite.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> as well which were very good. on the chinese side we went with traditional sui mai, lamb pot stickers, and 2 noodle dishes. everything was good but not outrageous. plus i'm accustomed to dipping sauces with sui mai and pot stickers that are usually seasoned with garlic, ginger and a touch spicy. the sauces here seemed just to be soy sauce. we finished off with a few more mexican choices - <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>, scallop ceviche and barbeque beef tacos. all were very good but again not amazing. also the offerings at the bar are very limited unless you're drinking tequila which i wasn't because i had to start drinking at the bar next door so i started with sky raspberry vodka which i couldn't get at china poblano. plain vodka only here. also only chinese or mexican beer. i probably wouldn't return unless i happened to be in the cosmopolitan and was really hungry.", 
            "pleasantly bizarre. i guess that's how i would sum this place up.  watch the video on their website if you want to get a feel for the vibe of the restaurant.  if you are looking for a more classy, quiet, date-night kind of place you are better off going to one of the eateries on the third floor.  this place was rocking on the saturday night we were there, electrified by the massive crowd just outside the door waiting to get into the club.  but i was in a good mood and enjoyed the music and people watching while we waited for our table perched high above everyone else on what appeared to be a mod style version of a mayan pyramid... except that there were golden buddha statues on top.  yeah.  so now you are starting to get it when i say this place is weird but cool? did i mention that there was a digital painting on the wall that alternated between a portrait of frida khalo and the dalai lama? and a sculpture roughly in the shape of a human head protruding from the back wall onto which they projected digital images of kim jong-il?  ok, so you got it now, right?\n\ni agree with the other reviewers that i wish they had more fusion dishes.  i was disappointed that the majority of the menu items were either chinese or mexican but not both.  and most of the food was just average.  good but not great.  and yes, ridulously over priced. but at a hip restaurant in what is arguably the hottest casino hotel on the strip right now, that is to be expected. so now, for those of you still reading this, here is a rundown of what we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>.\n\nguacamole - my husband made the comment that this was not even the best guac that he had eaten that day.  i am not a big fan of the stuff in general but i would have like to see some kind of twist to make something that is so easy to make at home worth ordering here.  maybe a little five spice powder or some ginger for that asian influence.  are you listening jos\\u00e9 andr\\u00e9s? and you really need to serve it with chips.  those tortillas were pretty darn good but it is a texture thing.\n\npot stickers - beautiful presentation.  really, just gorgeous. i even took a picture.  i truly enjoyed the flavors and it was a cool twist to get lamb instead of the traditional pork.  but where was the sauce? everyone knows the best part about eating pot stickers is the sauce. that was another little thing that just made the dish seem lacking and also a missed opportunity to bring in a fusion experience (how about a little chimichurri or mole sauce for dipping? hello?)\n\ncoctel de camarones - i was so disappointed in this dish, i can't even tell you.  for those of you who have ever had true cocteles at an authentic mexican seafood place just don't bother.  if you are the type that enjoys salsa out of a jar, then you might like it.  once again, though, they were missing the accompaniment. <mark>Traditional</mark>, this dish is either served with saltine crackers or tostada shells. however, when we asked our waitress if we could get some chips or something to eat it with she said we were supposed to eat it with the spoon, like gazpacho. wtf?\n\nchilaquiles - this dish was not authentically mexican either but i really enjoyed it.  my husband, who had apparently or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> it without reading the description, did not. he was expecting red sauce instead of green but i loved the tangy tomatillo salsa and the cheese was delish. but i agreed with him that there really should have been meat or eggs on there. and the chips were not really cooked into the dish, it was more like nachos than anything else.\n\nmole tacos - we both liked these though they were a little bland.  i guess not everyone likes spicy but i was expecting at least a little heat.  gourmet tacos like these are pretty common where we live so i wasn't surprised by the price or size but meh, i've had better.\n\npalmitos - this salad saved the day for me.  it was truly special.  i love hearts of palm but these weren't the limp white tubes you get out of a jar.  crisp and fresh, mixed with other equally fresh julienned vegetables, it was a hearty and satisfying salad.  but the dressing is what really blew my mind.  sweet and sour with a strong tamarind flavor.  it tasted like those mexican tamarindo candies... except more crisp and organic.  the whole dish was just so clean and brisk.  i know not everyone's palate is the same and someone else might find it too strong, there was a lot of fresh lime juice in there and definitely some kind of chile.  but that is perfect for me. i may return to this place just for that salad... or if i in the mood for some ethnic vegas style kitsch.", 
            "a lot of people worship at the altar of jose andres. not me. i'd eaten at jaleo in dc before and was underwhelmed, so his much-heralded arrival in vegas was greeted with a bit of a shrug from me.\n\ni had no interest in going to the western outpost of jaleo (when there are so many better tapas options in town) but i was intrigued by the concept of china poblano. and it did not disappoint.\n\njoined by two friends, we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a sampling of dishes from both sides of the menu - but the thing that sticks in my mind the most is the cocktail i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>, the \"lemon drop soup.\" vodka, citrus and noodles. yes, noodles. in a drink. the \"salt air\" margarita was no less creative, and the \"cold tea\" of green tea, tequila and beer is just out there.\n\nthe absolute best dish i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> here was the guacamole - it's $15 for an order (served with warm, fresh corn tortillas) but oh emm gee it's good. special trip good. take out window late at night good. and they'll make it as spicy as you want - always a plus for me.\n\nof all the dishes i've had, the only one i didn't love was the rainbow congee. aside from that, pure unadulterated awesomesauce. the mongolian beef is a new york strip. the sui mai dumplings contain gold leaf. the mole poblano tacos are morsels of joy. \n\nbut mostly that guacamole.",

            "we atually avoided this place for a while, because the concept of chinese/mexican fusion seemed so alien to us! however, we were passing by and happened to see a bunch of dim sum steamers through the window and that totally changed our minds! we are suckers for dim sum. \n\nthe restaurant is a unique fusion of chinese and mexican cuisine and it does it right! the set up of the restaurant is unusual with bench \"comunal table\" type seating or bar style. the first thing we noticed was the very high prices, especially for dim sum!!! we come from la and the oc, where dim sum is plentiful and cheap. the dim sum menu here is pretty small, and many things are $13 a plate! that seemed crazy, but we thought it might be worth trying just once. and it was- we were not disappointed!\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>:\n-<mark>Golden Pigs</mark> (pork buns) which comes with in-house condensed milk for dipping. these are petite char sui bao that have been deep fried. it was very pricey but it comes with so much flavor and many layers of textures; from the crunchy outer layer to the soft insides to the sweet and salty porky center, all dipped in th sweet and creamy condensed milk sauce. it was a very fresh look at a classic dim sum dish.\n-chicken shumai. these were very small but very tasty and moist and full of flavor and topped with a goji berry. \n\nafter two dim sum dishes we decided to share an entre from the mexican side of the menu: shrimp with a pepper sauce. these were very tender and a bit spicy but good altogether. \n\nthe best part of it all, dessert! mango with sweet rice....the best we both have had anywhere!! it had a ton of flavor in every single bite. this restaurant is probably getting that 5th star just because of this amazing dessert. it is like nothing you have ever had, i promise. first, the rice is cooked in coconut milk and reduced to a near liquid, and is then whipped into a light and airy mousse like texture. at the center is a mound of icy, sweet, mango granitas and the whole thing is topped with cramalized rice crispies and chunks of mango.\n\nthe service was also very personalized. the wait staff and even the bar tender chimed in with their favorites when it was obvious we couldn't make up our minds. \n\ni'm not going to lie. the portions, at least of what we had, are somewhat small, and the price is high, but i think the quality and ingenuity of the fusion menu make this an experience not to be missed.",

            "i tried china poblano for the first time on a thursday night. the menu sounded good but something stuck out right away. it says in bold type at the top, \"what brings mexico and china together?\", and goes on to briefly answer this question. now, to me, it would seem there was an effort to blend the two cuisines. however, looking over the menu i could see this was not the case, save a couple of dishes. this isn't necessarily a bad thing but the menu intro suggests fusion when in reality it's more like co-habitation. \nwe sat at the bar where you can see the tortillas being made fresh constantly. the ambiance was noisy but not over-bearing and the lack of a dj certainly helped things unlike some other cosmopolitan eatery that rhymes with coal screens. the service was prompt and i felt the server was very good at explaining menu items that may have been spicy, contained raw foods, or were otherwise out of the ordinary. \ni or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a carnitas taco and a <mark>Viva China</mark> taco. the tortillas are about 6 inches in diameter and not overstuffed so be prepared for this before you go. this is not tacqueria (insert name here) that serves heaping piles of food with beans and rice on the side. the tacos are served by themselves and any sides are extra. that being said, the tacos i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> were very good. the <mark>Viva China</mark> taste is a bit dominated by the raw oyster. the carnitas taco was top notch. both tacos seemed a little on the greasy side but most of it was the sauce/salsa leaking out the bottom. \nand now to the price. yes, this place is expensive compared to an actual street vendor but it's in a casino. the menu is posted outside the restaurant and freely available online. do a little research ahead of time and you can decide for yourself if the price is fair. \nchina poblano is great if you just need a quick bite to eat before a show or before heading out for the night. the take out window is a nice amenity if you're just passing through and need a bit of sustenance. i would not recommend china poblano for a big meal simply because the a la carte nature of the menu can add up quickly. you can easily spend $50 and still leave hungry.", 
            "i've passed by this place quite a few times, but finally decided to dine in today. the service was very attentive, but i felt like they didn't go beyond what they teach you in table-waiting 101. our server asked if we were ready for drinks, entrees, then desserts and let us know her personal favorites for each course, but didn't actually describe any of them. i honestly didn't have any problems with the service though, it's the food/prices that leave me less than satisfied. \n\nguacamole ($15): although it was pretty pricey, it was probably my favorite dish of the night. there were a lot of large chunks of avocado, which is something i could never complain about and it was very fresh and flavorful. the only thing that i didn't like was that the waitress asked if we were done with it once the chips ran out, even though we still had about a third of it left. it was just kind of annoying that she was trying to take the plate away, rather than offering us more chips.\n\nlarge pot of <mark>Jasmine Downy Pearls</mark> ($8.88) - very aromatic and tasty. i would probably come here just for the tea.  \n\n<mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> ($4): i hardly touched the salsa, but i ate all the nice and crisp chips with the guacamole. definitely worth the four bucks.\n\npescado frito ($6.50): not very flavorful and not very \"fried.\" if i'm going to pay $6.50 for one taco, i expect it to be pretty damn good. \n\ndancing eggplant ($9.88) - the waitress seemed a little reluctant when we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> this. she made sure to warn us there were bonito flakes on it and the eggplant was boiled. i had the feeling she didn't like that at all. we thought it was just okay.\n\ntraditional sui mai ($13.88): i really loved the crisp water chestnuts they added in the sui mai. the edible gold flakes on each piece also gave it a unique presentation. \n\n<mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> (hot and sour soup) $8.88: this was the most disgusting hot and sour soup i have every had. it seriously ruined my palette. the whole bowl of soup just reeked and tasted like hot red wine. i have never tasted hot and sour soup like that before. i couldn't take more than two bites of it without feeling sick because of the strong wine flavor it had. don doesn't even like hot and sour soup, but he could still taste how much worse it was than others. \n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> ($8.88): way too salty and saucy. and for a whopping $8.88, this was definitely not worth it. \n\njericalla ($11) - have you ever had abuelita hot chocolate? it comes in a package like this: http://beautifulspitup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/abuelita-mexican-hot-chocolate1.jpg containing tablets of compressed cocoa, sugar, and cinnamon: http://beautifulspitup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cut-abuelita.jpg. well, the small amount of custard on the bottom of the cup was covered in what seemed to be ground up tablets of abuelita hot chocolate: http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v1zh1nc2vaskonusyjs5ja/l.jpg and no, that was not a good thing. i felt like ai was just munching on hot chocolate powder. i mean, the custard and sorbet alone were good, but i couldn't eat those without eating all the powder. plain and simple, it sucked. \n\noverall, i loved the presentation of all the dishes, however the flavors just didn't match. the hot and sour soup really killed it for me. the only thing i think was worth coming here for was probably the tea, but that's still not something i would drive over here for.\n\nwarning: if you look at your bank statement a day or two after coming here and the amount charged is a lot higher than what you actually paid, it's because they like to \"pre-authorize\" themselves for a 30% tip, but it goes down to whatever you actually paid them when the transaction clears. why anyone would give this place a 30% tip is beyond me...",

you know how those \"pre-charges\" are immediately returned to your account once you complete your gas purchase? well, china poblano treats its customers' like gas pumpers at the good ol' gas 'n' goods.\n\nhold on. let me back up and write a review for the actual dining experience before i get into the real reason for my 1-star review.\n\nmy actual dining rating is probably closer to a 3-star in terms of food taste and ambiance. i had eaten at china poblano before, while on a date. the food was good and the drinks were well made. i didn't care at the time what the prices were because my date insisted i get whatever i wanted. so the overpriced menu wasn't an issue until my return visit with friends. \n\nduring my return visit i chose items a little more conservatively. only one cocktail, some guacamole and some duck something-or-other. my total bill including the automatic tip of 20% (for parties of 6+) was only $39. not bad at all really, even though i realized i should have just or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> twice as much guacamole and skipped the duck-whatever. i love duck and always order it when it makes it onto a menu. this wasn't watery-mouth duck. it was over-cooked, barely-recognizable duck. the food isn't so amazing that i would suggest it for large groups in which only one person pays. it is more of a cute place for a date or a place for a group of friends who are paying separately. it isn't even really a fusion restaurant, per se, so if you are craving mexican or chinese you should probably just go to the restaurant you crave.\n\na fusion restaurant usually makes it a point to fuse two types of cuisine into one dish. this restaurant merely offers items from two different cuisines in separate sections.\n\nanyway, the restaurant is cute. the decor is different. the only chairs that have backs to them are the booths. the servers are lazy. oh wait, what's that? lazy servers at an overrated restaurant that serves undersized and overpriced food? no way!\n\nnow for a better explanation of why this restaurant went from a 4-star on my first visit to a 1-star on my second/third visit:\n\nafter my friends and i ate our meal and paid for the meals individually with our debit/credit cards, we spent the rest of the night enjoying some mario kart in the room and some hot-tub lounging because well, we were staying in vegas a full week and this was already night #5. it seemed like a great night all around.\n\nthen when we woke in the morning, one of my friends decided to check his account charges on his phone app. he panicked when he saw that china poblano had charged an extra 30%. he too had paid $39 including tip and suddenly had a $51.70 charge. granted, that wasn't an insane amount of money. only $11.70. however, when you consider that the total bill for the table was over $200, that 30% upcharge now looks more like a hefty $60+ charge spread out over all of our accounts. we all checked our accounts and since we have all been servers in restaurants before and realize that sometimes shady/desperate servers like to add-on a little extra tip and hope that no one notices, we stormed over to china poblano determined to fix the issue and get our money back into our accounts. we at least wanted a genuine apology.\n\nwhen we arrived at the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager about the extra charge, the hostess stated \"oh, yeah we get this all the time.\" ummmmm, what? you get this complaint all the time?\n\nwell, the manager explained to us that the [cheap ass] credit card processing company they use temporarily charges an extra 20-30% for transactions to guarantee that the funds are available. just like a gas station. the only difference is, at a gas stati<mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> are pre-paying for something in which the final price is unbeknownst to you until you are done pumping. at a restaurant (especially when the tip is included in the bill) you know exactly how much you are paying right then and there when you sign the receipt. the server then enters it into the computer and there is no more need for any extra charges. \n\nwe tried to explain to her that this is the only restaurant that we have ever encountered that has such ridiculous practices. not only do they give their customers a small panic attack when they check their account balances (imagine if you were someone who went to a special dinner and reluctantly threw down $500 for a nice dinner out with your family and when you look at your account there is a charge for $650 instead) but on top of that they don't seem to think it is a big deal or let customers know of this extra temporary charge ahead of time. on top of all that, the manager was very condescending, smug and without an apologetic bone in her body.", 
            "if not for the out-of-this-world carnitas tacos (yay for pork rinds!) i think i would have given this place only 2 stars.  it advertises itself as \"chinese/mexican fusion\", but the menu is really just split up into various mexican dishes and chinese dishes (mostly of the dim sum variety). as an overall note, i think that the mexican dishes were much tastier than the chinese items, so if you are wrestling b/w the two, i would go with mexican. here's what we tried:\n\ntacos\ncarnitas - yum yum yum.  definitely order this if you order nothing else.  and get two, so that you won't have to share. a+\n\n<mark>Viva China</mark> - this is a kumamoto oyster/beef tendon/sichuan peppercorn sauce taco.  the combo of the tendon and oyster was underwhelming, and if you really love that peppercorn taste, you're not going to find much of it here. c-\n\nbarbacoa - we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> this because it came with \"cactus paddle\".  still have no idea what cactus paddle is, but it's an awesome name!  the beef was alright, though a bit salty, and the cactus unfortunately didn't really taste like anything at all. c-\n\nfried fish taco - the fish was fried nicely, and i liked the pickled onions that came with it, but it was close to 7 bucks for two tiny tacos and pinky sized pieces of fish, so probably wouldn't order it again.  b-\n\nchinese\n\nfire phoenix - this was pretty much a variation of popcorn chicken, with pork rinds on the side.the sichuan peppercorn salt was really good, and fried chicken never tastes bad when it's fres, but there really wasn't anything that special about this dish.  c\n\nmexican\n\n<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> - comes on a bed of ice and looks delectable.  tastes pretty a-ok too. i think they put soy sauce in here, which gives it a nice depth of flavor.  a-\n\ncoctel de camarones - this was pretty much like a cold cocktail of shrimp, crab, and avocado, mixed with what is essentially a cocktail sauce.  i love lump crab meat and i love shrimp, but i didn't come here to eat those things with cocktail sauce.  i can get that for 3.99 anywhere else.  c\n\n<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> - this actually did taste like a fusion dish, though it was a bit heavily sauced.  the shrimp are nice and garlic-y, with a hint of spice from the poblano peppers.  good, but could have used a side of rice or something.  b-\n\nin a nutshell:  i'd recommend just stopping in and sitting at the counter and ordering some tacos (especially the carnitas ones), and then going somewhere else for dinner.  as a disclaimer, we didn't order the famous \"twenty ingredient <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>\" that was featured on food network, but i'm taiwanese, and i just don't feel right paying 20 bucks for <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>.", 
            "usually i read lots of reviews before eating anywhere, but seeing as we were on vacation, my wife and i took a risk and went into china poblano blind.  good thing, because had i trusted yelp's 3-star review, i might have missed out on a memorable meal.\n\ntrendy and quirky beyond belief, this restaurant exudes cool (or hipster, depending <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> view, but i took it as cool).  it has booths and community tables, and the dishes are all small plates from mexican and chinese cuisine... not much fusion, but it's nice to mix and match.  my wife and i shared <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>, with hot, fresh chips and a smoky chipotle salsa with just the right amount of kick.  i got a carnitas taco, which was succulent and had homemade pork rinds on top.  my wife liked her barbacoa taco as well.\n\nfor our \"main courses\" (although remember, it's small plates, so that doesn't really apply), i had the lemon tree shrimp, which was unbelievably good.  the shrimp tasted fresh, and the sauce was redolent with black pepper and celery, and the occasional chunk of citrus fruit.  my wife had the <mark>Beijing Glass</mark>, a noodle dish that was not to my taste, but it looked beautiful, with all the components (noodles and tons of different asian veggies) sectioned out in the bowl, waiting to be mixed.  she loved it.\n\nsome people are complaining about the size of the dishes.  well, it's small plates, and you're supposed to order 2-3 items.  the wait staff tells you that.  our waitress even asked us during lunch if we were satisfied with the amount of food we had or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> -- and we were.  far too many restaurants go for quantity over quality, but china poblano serves properly sized meals.  two or three dishes really should be enough to fill up one person.  if not, i dunno, go to one of the millions of buffets on the strip instead.  if i'm going to spend $30 on a meal, i'd honestly rather have high-quality food than \"all-you-can-eat.\"",

            "yesterday was actually \"take two\" for us here, since we planned on meeting a friend for dinner.  he got called in to work and couldn't make it, but it wasn't necessarily a \"tragic evening\", because the food here is pretty amazing.\n\na quirky but compelling mix of chinese and mexican cuisine (but not on the same plate, thank gawd!), you're free to mix-and-match however you please, just like the decor, which i can only describe as \"big trouble in little chinese tijuana.\"\n\nwe started off with <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>. i am a sucker for fresh, warm chips and these pretty much ruled.  most with a palate for something a little kickier will find the salsa wanting, but having been burned by too many muy caliente sauces in the past, i found this one just right.\n\nbear kicked it off with one of the tacos as well - i don't remember which, but the blissful look on his face was recommendation enough for me.  i decided to mix it up with two tacos: the chicken and mole poblano and the bbq pork with marinated onions, along with \"<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\": four delicately steamed buns filled with more bbq pork.  bear had the \"special 8\" dim sum - (probably not getting the name right, but i won't forget that taste!) - delicate, tasty jewels of meat, spices and veggies swathed in very light wrappers. i had bites of the chicken and pork...which i will have to definitely try in the future!\n\nit was all a-mazing. paired with rum-and-cokes for me (<mark>Negra Modelo</mark> for bear), the tastes of each item are light and exquisite - tender meats, flavorful but not overpowering sauces, but don't sit brick-like in your stomach as most chain-restaurant style chinese and/or mexican foods have a tendency to do.  \n\nbecause i'd really had a taste for some pho noodles all week (nursing a pretty wicked cold earlier), i knew i wouldn't get them here, but when i saw \"dan-<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>\" noodles on the menu, i knew i wasn't leaving until i had some, which i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> in lieu of dessert.  i love good \"dan-dan\" as much as the next chinese food enthusiast, but these? not saying it wasn't a healthy sized portion, but these bad boys made me wish for a kiddie-pool sized bowl that i could jump into and do the backstroke in. oh, yeah.  they are that. freakin'. good.\n\nbear had a dessert i did have a bite of - mangos with a light creamy sauce and maybe pine nuts? - that i made a mental note to have next time we visit.\n\nto sum it up - awesome food, great service from everyone, but most especially from our bartender/server casey. however, i only have one 'caveat' to present.  when the bill arrived, it did give me one of those \"ruh-roh, raggy!\" moments when i saw the total.  not saying you have to be mark cuban or steve wynn to eat here, but if you have a more-than-healthy appetite - and we do, you may want to put china <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> \"special occasions only\" list.  it's just that all that wonderful food does add up (all tacos, dim sum and other items are priced separately), so you may want to have a \"point guard\" with you to keep an eye on the rising tab. \n\nother than that, i would dare say that we'll be back!",

            "i like jose andres, chinese food and mexican food.  put them all together you'd get something spectacular, right?  well, at least that's i hoped for.\n\nthe service at china poblano was good.  i loved the interior.  images of mao, frida kahlo, the dalai lama, etc. projected on screen on the walls - nice touch.\n\ni had the <mark>Jasmine Downy Pearls</mark> tea and it was amazing.  it was fragrant and it tasted good.  it was a neat idea that they give you a timer so you get to enjoy the perfect tea whether you like it mild, medium or strong.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a bun of different things from the menu:\n\n<mark>Golden Pigs</mark>:\n4 fried bbq pork buns with a side of condensed milk.  dipping pork buns on condensed milk might seem pretty odd but it works.  sweet and savory just go well together.  5/5\n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>:\na braised pork sandwich.  the bread tastes just like biscuits but the filling's saaaalty. if you look at the menu, you'll see \"<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>\" in a box which will make you think that's their specialty.  honestly, i hated it. 1/5\n\ntacos (carnitas, langosta, <mark>Viva China</mark>, pescado frito):\nthe carnitas came with pork rinds on top but the pork in the taco was dripping in oil.  just let the oil drip off your taco and you're all set. great taco variety. 4/5\n\n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>:\n4 steamed bbq pork buns. yep, that's all i can say about that.  nothing special. 3/5\n\nlucky six siu mai:\n2 scallop siu mai, 2 beef siu mai and 2 traditional siu mai topped with itty bitty pieces of gold leaf. 3/5\n\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with mole:\ni wanted fries with my sandwich.  i had to pick between mole and <mark>XO Sauce</mark>.  fries + <mark>XO Sauce</mark> just doesn't seem appetizing so i went with mole.  the mole was overpowering.  there was a scant amount of mexican cream and queso fresco.  i can usually finish an order of fries but not this one. 2/5\n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> with chorizo:\nagain, nothing special. 3/5\n\nmango sticky rice:\nthis was the best thing on the menu.  instead of using sticky rice, they used puffed rice so you get that nice crunch with a nice creamy coconut sauce and semi-sweet mangoes. 5/5\n\nchocolate terra cotta warriors:\nthe name \"warriors\" is misleading because you only get one warrior made of chocolate filled with chocolate mousse on top of cookie crumbs and ginger ice cream.  it looks like something just died on my plate complete with dirt and flowers.  the presentation was just too funny but this chocoholic wasn't 100% pleased with the taste but the creativity was there. 4/5\n\ncajeta flan:\na flan made with goat's milk served with salted caramel ice cream and pineapple chunks.  the flan was mild and the salted caramel ice cream was just lovely. 4/5\n\nso why 3 stars?  for the amount and type of food you get vs. the price, not worth it.  it's like they grabbed the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> from viva zapatas, steamed bbq pork buns and siu mai from spring mountain, fish tacos from rubio's for like $3 each and decided to serve it to you for double or triple the price.  part of what makes chinese and mexican food great is that they're inexpensive.", 
            "first off, we were robbed. apart from the way overpriced food, i was surprised to see that someone forged a generous and undeserved 30% tip on my credit card bill, when i clearly left 15% on the receipt. second, the food was mediocre at best. we started out with a couple of their signature cocktails which were fun and creative but not worth refilling our glasses with. the waiter was kind and willing, however his recommendations all fell flat on the palate. while the food was beautifully presented the taste was not impressive at all. we started with the carnitas tacos which were bland and extremely oily. next came the lamb potstickers. the lamb filling was also not seasoned. lastly we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the food network recommended 20 vegetable dish and added shrimp. again the protein was bland and unseasoned. while the rice was somewhat tasty, it was not something to rave about. at the conclusion of our meal, we were somewhat shocked to see an $85 bill for the amount and quality of food that was or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> for 2 people. despite the disappointing food, our waiter was nice and returned to our table multiple times to check on us. i believe this was mainly due to the fact that our order took a long time to arrive. nevertheless i tipped 15% and clearly wrote the total of $100 on the receipt. well, when i checked my bank, i noticed the 30% charge instead. i will be calling the restaurant today to dispute the issue. china poblano is overrated and overpriced. coupled with the billing issue, the overall experience was very disappointing. needless to say we will not be giving it a second try.", 
            "kinda surprised at the low rates for this place.  this restaurant is actually really good.  if you're looking for lots of delicious small bites... this is it.  \ncame here with a bunch of friends.. and gotta say.. almost everything exceeded my expectations.  i can't remember everything we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>... but here's a few highlights\n<mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> - really really good.  delicate and delicious. \nshrimp won ton - was good, not the best in the world .  but.. i had a hangover and this really hit the spot.  \nsui mai - not your typical dim sum sui mai... better.  \n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> - steamed pork buns.  delicious, perfectly cooked.\n\nokay.. everything is a little pricey... but hey... its good.",

            "i cannot believe china poblano has such a low rating.  i have always loved jose andres and have never been disappointed by any of his restaurants.  china poblano was no different and is now my favorite of all of his restaurants (i've previously been to zatinya, oyamel and jaleo in dc).  i went in december of 2012 while staying at the cosmopolitan.  it is a very casual place with a fun, relaxed vibe.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> (lightly fried bbq pork buns served with condensed milk) and har gau for appetizers.  my boyfriend was skeptical of the milk being served with the buns but they were delicious!  the perfect combination of sweet, savory and salty.  for our entrees we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> one carnitas and one lengua taco which were both perfect in every way.  the waitstaff was quick and friendly, the food amazing and the prices extremely reasonable for vegas.  i am returning to vegas in july and this is the first place i am seeking out for lunch.  i would highly suggestion that every one give it a try.  you will not be let down.",

            "i was a little unsure of this place and the chinese/mexican fusion combo made me ask why???.  when i visted their website and saw that it is a chef jose andreas establishment i figured it must be amazing so i said what the hell and made a reservation. i am a mexican food lover so i stuck with things on the miexican portion of the menu, a few different tacos(barbacoa and carnitas) both of which were amazing, the beef just melts in your mouth it is so tender. i also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> some <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> and some <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> to share with the table.  one of the people in my party went the chinese route and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, i tried a few bites and it was amazing, and could be a meal in itself. i will go back and next time i will order the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> for myself. \n\nprices were actually low in my opinion, not cheap but i would have paid more for the quality of food.  rreat value for the quality of food and location inside of the cosmopolitan. all in all i would recommend china poblano to anyone visiting vegas.",

            "we were seated pretty quickly as a table for 7 at 7pm without having a reservation by two very hospitable staff. after 4 days in vegas, the first positive vibe i picked up on was that the front of house staff were very humble, gracious and genuine - a welcome change to the a few of the other restaurants we ate at. \n\ndespite the warm welcome, we were left sitting without a visit from a server for at least 10 minutes. and at most restaurants, this would be fine if not just slightly annoying. but here's why it was a much bigger problem at china poblano: the menu and how/what you should order isn't easily decipherable without a bit of guidance (or having been there before). \n\ni'd suggest to the managers of cp to have the staff who seats you stick around for an extra :15 and give a one or two line spiel on how the menu is divided, portion sizes, what's shareable/not shareable, and recommended quantity of order per person. we all started to confuse each other and actually started to discuss leaving to go to somewhere that was a bit easier on our we're-in-vacation-mode brains. \n\nour server came by just in time before we left and explained how it all worked, but then left and proceeded to give us another 10 minutes to ponder our life as well as our food order. he didn't take a drink order. so in the end, we sat for 20 minutes before we even get a drink order in. it's almost impossible to sit anywhere in vegas for that long without being offered a drink. \n\norders go in and the food starts rolling out pretty much immediately. highlights for me were:\n\n- <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>\n- lucky 6 siu mai\n- gan pung ji chicken (table fave)\n- carnitas taco\n- chipotle salsa\n\nlowlights:\n\n- <mark>Viva China</mark> taco\n- lamb pot stickers \n- guacamole (tasty enough, but poor value)\n\nthere were a few mix-ups with the service - some people didn't get their tacos till the rest of the table was pretty much done their food. i chalked that up to the shared-plates approach, but a bit more attention could have easily saved one upset and ignored diner. we were also missing a side of the \"monk chilli sauce\" which was or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> because we were - and still are - very curious as to wtf it would actually be. \n\nloved the decor of the restaurant and felt that the music was very well selected. not really sure about the choice to project a picture of frida kahlo up at the same time as chairman mao. when you take into account his political decisions were responsible for like 40-70 million unnecessary deaths,...  maybe it's art or irony, i dunno. it certainly sparked a conversation at the table where we concluded that the designer was probably more into the superficiality of the icon of mao, like che, rather than the politics and the fact that he's pretty much one of the greatest modern mass mur<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>. and we're looking at him while eating. in las vegas. ok, maybe it is irony. unintentional irony? moving along...\n\ntl;dr version: interesting spot, food was generally tasty, i found it priced pretty reasonably with a few exceptions. the menu could use a bit more explanation - ideally, immediately upon arrival - and the table service could be a bit tighter and attentive. \n\ni also think this menu would benefit from being slimmed down by a few items, and then perhaps divided by portion size.", 
            "it was 10:30pm and we needed to eat asap.  we really wanted to eat at wicked spoon but sadly, we got there at 10:03 and they close at 10pm.  so we walked around for 20 minutes through the cosmopolitan trying to find anything that sounded good.  we found this place and it looked and sounded decent enough.  and who doesn't like a place where you can order both asian and mexican?\n\nafter a short wait, we were seated and it seemed to take awhile to see our waiter and then get our orders in.  in the meantime, i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>.  it was super tasty but for $14, it was kind of teeny.  especially when it seems the foam takes up 1/3 of the glass.  but it was a really superb margarita.\n\nmy friend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the fried buns with the condensed milk glaze.  i wasn't sure about them but they were actually kind of amazing.  i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the chicken poblano taco and the lobster taco.  the poblano taco was really good.  i should've just or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> two or three of those and been done but the lobster taco sounded so enticing.  um, not so much.  it wasn't great and at $10, it was highway robbery.  all the other reviews are right.  these tacos are all crazy overpriced and they're tiny.\n\nwe ended with the sticky rice and mango dessert.  not at all what i imagined but we still ate every last bite.\n\nthis place isn't bad, it was just a let-down.  i had high hopes looking at the menu and was a bit underwhelmed by the food and overwhelmed by the prices.  i wouldn't say not to eat here, just know what to expect.", 
            "yes yes and yes. i have been craving this place since eating here with my bf. it is astonishing to me that there are only 3 stars on the company profile. jose andres can do no wrong in my book.\nstarted our meals out with a few yummy cocktails. i got the margarita with a \"salt air topping\" wow. i could have had 4 of these, but decided i actually wanted to remember my meal so i refrained. its your typical margarita with tequila and fresh lime juice and agave, but topped with a salt foam. great presentation i may add.\nwe had no clue what to order so we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a few items to share. we had a friend join us so between 3 people, this is what we had\nensalada gaspacho estilo de morelia; an amazing salad consisting of pineapple, dragonfruit, mango, jicama, queso fresco, and a  chile pequ\\u00edn \n<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> minus the pecans \ncctel de camarones; =shrimp, jumbo lump crab meat, tomato, and diced avocado \n<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> shrimp in a sweet black garlic sauce with roasted poblano peppers \n\n....and the best thing ive ever eaten\n\n20 vegetable with friend rice. omg. this is a vegan dream with so many different veggies all grilled served over rice that seriously melted in my mouth. i cant wait to go back to this restaurant and have 2 orders of this...\n\nthis restaurant has a very interesting concept. asian fusion meets mexican. i really enjoyed these two combined. the service was impeccable, i wish i could remember my servers name but he was so awesome. with so many restaurants in the cosmo to choose from, i highly recommend trying this place.", 
            "i think china poblano is a very solid 3 stars, i gave it a fourth star because our second visit was on the busiest night in vegas...nye and we had no reservation. they accommodated us quickly, although it was at the outside tables but that's fine by me...more people to watch. \nour server was great, i have no complaints about the service. \nmy husband & i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> chips & salsa which were great, good seasoned chips, salsa was smokey and far from any pico de gallo. we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> 4 tacos...2 fish, 1 cochinita (bbq pork) and 1 carnitas. we've had the fish tacos before and they were delish...this time they were totally different. the fish wasn't very battered, and the salsa was way different. definitely not as good this time around but still very decent. the other tacos were full of flavor but very small! we both said we could eat 4 more! so after the chips & salsa & 2 tacos each we were still hungry so we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> dim sum. a 4 piece order of <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> and they were a knock out. very good. \nnow, a part of me wants to take a star off because of the high prices. this dinner was over $70 and i really couldn't justify paying more than $35-$40. you can't call this a full dinner. it was more like a lite bite before a concert type thing. \nthe kicker was the 2 cokes my husband or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> during dinner. they came in glass bottles and are imported from mexico. i've seen them at my local grocery store...they sell them 10 for $10. for all of you yelpers that are not math geniuses, that's $1 ea. china poblano charges $5.88 each!! holy coca cola! $12 on two cokes?! that's a little unreal. in a separate visit we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>--as featured on one of those television food shows--and it was good not amazing. this is not a place i need to return to. but it's also not a place i would stay away from. although, i might smuggle in my own mexican coca cola next time.", 
            "located in the cosmopolitan is a bright great ambiance restaurant. mexican and chinese served together, tapas style . earlier in the day i saw them making everything from scratch before the restaurant was open.\n\n perfect for a group so you can taste a little bit of everything. service is great we had our water up to the top the entire time.\nthere is a good selection on the menu so it's hard to decide what to try. we started with the chips with salsa. chips have a great seasoning on them and the salsa was a chipotle type. (both delicious.) i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> it comes four pieces and is a soft bread with bbq pork inside served with a side of condensed milk to dip it in.  sounds odd but the mix is delicious, we had the cochinita taco and the chorizo fundido which comes with fresh tortillas the quesidilla chicarron was good too.\n\nmy one complaint would be the imported coca cola from mexica at 5.88 in original bottle. \nall and all it was a great experience with delicious food and great service.", 
            "i am always amazed with this restaurant.  this time i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> from the weekly specials menu because there was an item i've seen before and heard about before but, had not tried, and it is only on this menu on occasion. i believe it was added to the specials menu because it is a traditional mexican treat that is designed with the colors of the mexican flag, which are green red and white.  mexican independence day is this week.\n\nit's the chiles en nogada!  \n\nthe dish consists of a poblano chili stuffed with a \"picadillo,\" which is usually meat spice and fruit.  in this case, it was pork.  the whole thing is covered with a creamy walnut sauce and topped with pomegranate seeds!  it was the best meal i've had all week!", 
            "my work group of 5 had a reservation for a friday afternoon and there was no wait time. i love the color scheme and the fact that everyone spoke to us as we walked in. i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> chilaquiles, which had an authentic taste and just the right heat. two of my co-workers or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the infamous <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>. i was a little hesitant because i am not a big fan of <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, but it was amazing! very distinct flavors. \n\na major advantage to this restaurant is the vegetarian options. the only disadvantage, which has nothing to do with the food is the seating options. although most people are in vegas on vacation and wearing casual to club wear, it was a little difficult to get in and out of the bench style seating in a *work appropriate* length dress :(.\n\non a positive note, our waiter josue' was very attentive to our needs and made excellent recommendations.", 
            "not crazy about the seating arrangements.  it is the unfortunate long wall bench seat with several small tables in front and small ottoman types seats on the opposite side of the table.  the decor is nice to look at the wall is covered kabuki masks and oaxaca animals.  we started with a taco each my friend had the pollo con mole poblano and i had the <mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>.  we both like them very much.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> to share.  it was smoking and very well executed. we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> which sounds either odd or no big deal.  it was my favorite dish i would go back just to order that.  my friend said he would go back just to have the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> again.  now for the drinks, we both or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Margarita Bandera Flight</mark> which had three minis consisting of the salt air, a pomegranate salt air, and the blood orange chili.  i like the blood orange chili the best since it has the balance with citrus  and heat.  the salt air is basically a salt foam on top.  which makes the drink too salty.  but the pomegranate version is very good.  i would recommend giving it try especially since the dishes are served family styled and meant to be shared.", 
            "avoid this restaurant at all costs - because that is all it will do cost.  we went with a group of eight and the bill was insane for insanely small portions.  i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> with chicken.  the vegetables must have been diced to a miniscule size, because i couldn't find all those vegetables  and at $34 with tax and tip - not worth it.  the tacos are also so small- 2 bites.  our friends or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> dessert and i laughed out loud when the waiter put it down.  it was a tablespoon sized portion.  the total bill came to about $400 and we were still hungry.  i've had amazing meals at commes ca and milos both at the cosmopolitan.  this restaurant was embarrassingly expensive and of inferior quality and can't even be discussed in the same breath.  oh by the way everyone at our table had no problem spending a lot on a good mean, which we did the following night at milos.  we just don't like being robbed for a shit meal.", 
            "way over-priced. i hate the feeling of being gypped. that's how i felt after eating at china poblano. it's pricey and food was blah to say the least. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the happy family potstickers $13 for 6 pieces. the frozen bag from my local asian market tasted way better. we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Ten Treasure</mark> soup $18 - can you say bland? the last thing we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> was <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> - $14 for a small steamed bun with bbq pork - tasty but so small, it was gone in three bites. for these prices, i would have been ok if taste was good, but we were neither satisfied, nor happy. we actually had to eat a couple slices of pizza after just to feel full. i'm not a big girl - 5'2\" and 110 pounds. are you paying for the name of the chef or a meal?? nope. we're not going back - ever!", 
            "very delicious tacos, albeit more expensive than your standard food truck taco. ambience is very casual. jose andres is a god of spanish cuisine having introduced jamon iberico to the u.s. and innovated via molecular gastronomy but chino poblano did not deliver against my expectations.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> many dishes. the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> were one of the more memorable non-taco dishes. the carnitas with chicarrones wet yummy and the lobster tacos were a novelty. there are many restaurants in las vegas on the strip that provide a more memorable atmosphere and food.", 
            "although they provide great service, i have always thought this place is overrated. i tried it a second time a couple of weeks ago to give it another chance. my first experience with their food left me questioning how they can get away with these outrageously high prices and the food being just average. \n\nthis time around we opted out of ordering tacos as i get way better tacos at tacos el gordo for half the price. i was craving soup so we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> posole as a starter as well as chips & salsa, chicken flautas, 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, and dan dan noodles. the posole was salty and the soup thick. i had to ask for more lime to offset the saltiness. the vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> is good but not at $19. \n\ni don't think i can see myself coming back unless there is nothing else available if i'm staying at the cosmopolitan.",

            "i discovered this restaurant after viewing a recommendation by anthony bourdain, so while a friend was in town we decided to come check it out. it's located inside the cosmopolitan hotel which is one of my favorite places on the strip. upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly hostess and offered our choice of the bar (which allows you to watch them work on tortillas from the open kitchen) or a table.  i felt for vegas fine dining this place was pretty affordable.\nmiller d was our server he was quick to greet us with a smile and i believe could tell we were unclear on if we should try a drink. he recommended the sueno cocktail which comes with a spicy salt rim. he was kind enough to do half/half in case we were a fan of the spicy kick it offered. both my friend and i really enjoyed the drink.\n\nthe main thing i was dying to try was this taco that i read about called the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco , but we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a <mark>Happy Family Jiaozi</mark>  (delicious pot stickers with amazing flavoring)and <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> ( fried pork buns) and some <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles(cold noodle dish with avocado and jicama for an interesting twist). overall i loved everything except that taco i wanted so badly to try. when it first arrived i took a bite of the beef tendon alone and it was delicious but when taking a bite of the taco all together with the oyster on top i felt like the ocean had thrown up in my mouth. it just wasn't a good combo for my pallet. maybe i got a bad oyster i don't know but overall it was an experience i will not quickly forget.\n\neveryone at the restaurant was super friendly and our drinks were always full. the only reason i have to deduct a star is i somehow was overcharged $20 on my bill. thankfully my friend encouraged me to keep my receipt and i am dealing with that situation but i definitely feel like this place is worth checking out! i left feeling satisfied and excited to go back to try some more cool fusions.", 
            "i was looking forward to seeing what this place had to offer as i've walked by it a lot but never had a chance to try it.  the place didn't really live up to the expectations.  i had the <mark>Ten Treasure</mark> noodle soup which was nice to have after a night of drinking in the vegas desert.  i also tasted the cheese fondido with chorizo but it was just an overly salty goop.  my friend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> and it was adequate but nothing to write home about. the pork steamed buns were overly sweet and really on the small side. \n\nprobably not worth a second visit given all the choices in town.",

            "there's no mexican-asian fusion going on in this restaurant, except that the 2 menus and decor are intertwined. it's almost like someone could not decide if they wanted to open a mexican restaurant or chinese restaurant, so they decide to open both in the same space, with separate kitchens. i love both mexican food and chinese food, but this is neither here nor there. two cuisines that are normally best in a hole-in-the wall spot, and inexpensive - this is just the opposite: overpriced and mediocre.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> everything family style and tried to get a good mix of both mexican & chinese food:\n\n<mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark> ($15) - i liked this margarita a lot. i don't care for the taste of tequila, and the blood orange seemed to mask this well. it had a spicy kick to it, but not so spicy that it was undrinkable.\n\nguacamole & chips ($15) - handmade, and delicious, but the price is about double what i would expect to pay for fresh guacamole. chips were light, crispy and fresh.\n\ntacos (about $5 each) - i'm used to dollar tacos (maybe $2) at a taco truck. i got the <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> and it was good, but unless i'm expensing my meal to work, i would pass on this - much too expensive for tacos.\n\n<mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> ($12.88) - 6 pieces - this was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. the lamb inside was tasty and i liked the crispy lace (sweet onions) design on the dish. would recommend this.\n\nsui mai ($13.88) - 6 pieces - the only cool thing about this were the gold flakes on top. the rest was just okay, and tasted heavy on the ginger. at a normal dim sum restaurant, you can get 4 sui mai's for $4 that taste better.\n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> ($12) - wheat noodles and spicy pork sauce - this was definitely spicy, nothing that blew me away though. at least the price was reasonable for the portion-size.\n\ncol de bruselas ($12) - these are on the acidic side - tasted really limey. i wouldn't get this again.\n\n<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> ($18) - 8 pieces of shrimp = $2.25 per piece of shrimp. sauce was good, not too spicy, this was one of the better dishes we had.\n\nbistec con mole amarillo y hongos ($20) - grilled hanger steak with mole - there were about 6 sliced pieces of steak - again, with the small portions. it was one of the better tasting dishes we had, but expensive.\n\nall in all, it's an interesting concept and i was there for work so i was able to expense my meal. with tip and tax, it was $60 per person - quite honestly, i would rather eat at a mexican food truck or a hole-in-the-wall chinese place for 1/4 of the price and more authentic food. with so many other options in vegas, i'll be going elsewhere.", 
            "a chinese & mexican restaurant? it sounded like the perfect place for my husband (hispanic) and i (chinese), but it ended up to be a very disappointing meal. my husband has been there once. he warned me about the food wasn't that good, but we felt like i had to try at least once. \n\nwe started with the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>. chips were fresh and crispy. the salsa was fine, but nothing special. we have had much better salsa in other places. \n\nwe had three tacos. the homemade corn tortillas were great. lengua (beef tongue) was very delicious. the tongue was tender and the salsa was refreshing. best thing of the night. silencio (duck tongue) was disappointing. it was a taco with chinese cooking style and flavors. sadly, the flavors just didn't go well with the tortilla. kind of weird. pescado a la plancha (fish) was ok. just a fish taco. nothing amazing. \n\nfor dim sum, we got the traditional siu mai. $13.88 for 6 siu mai? they better be good! my husband liked them, but they were just ok for me. the filling were a bit loose. the siu mai fell apart easily after one bite. i felt that i am paying for the gold flakes more than anything. please take away the gold flakes and give me some decent and cheap siu mai! we also had the <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark>. i was very exciting about pot stickers, especially lamb one. not only we can't taste the lamb, the spice seasoning overpowered everything. the spice didn't taste anything like chinese or mexican food. it was more like indian flavors. other than the crispy skins, we didn't like these at all. \n\nwe also got the 18 <mark>18 Monk Noodle</mark>. i think they have switched this out of the menu now. but it was very tasty. i like hand cut noodles, because they are usually al dente. and these noodles were. the flavors were earthy and savory. we enjoyed it. \n\nat the end, we paid about $65 (without tax & tips). all the food we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> were nothing fancy. you can get all these food in a mexican or chinese restaurant for just half the price. i have nothing against fusion food. i love kogi. but the food in here is just not good and it is way over price! if you are thinking to come here, i urge you to go somewhere else. jos\\u00e9 andr\\u00e9s' magic just doesn't work here.",

            "i'm really surprised this place has only three stars. the boy and i came here on our last night in vegas and it was easily the best meal we'd had all weekend. since i imagine a lot of vacationers are frequenting this spot, i'll break down what we had:\n\nsalt and <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>: probably the best margarita i've ever had\n\ntaro chips: unbelievable. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> these for our ceviche, but i was gobbling them up on their own. insanely crisp and delicious.\n\n<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>: delicious. and quite a large portion for the price. the only complaint i might have is that by the bottom of the bowl, the tuna was completely overpowered by the dregs of citrus juice, but to be fair we ate this quite slowly interspersed with other dishes. might've had more time than normal for the tuna to get over marinated.\n\nsiu mai w/ <mark>Quail Egg</mark>: the best dish of the night, and easily the best siu mai i've ever had. and trust me, i live in queens in nyc, i know my asian food. the meat was soft, insanely flavorful, and the eggs just bursts with a creamy eggy-ness in your mouth.\n\npork buns (<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>): disappointing. i wouldn't be able to tell the difference between these and any old pork bun i come across. not necessarily bad, but not great.\n\nduck tongue taco (silencio): i am a fan of trying absolutely anything and everything, but this was just downright weird. i commend them for getting the tongue that soft, but the flavor wasn't appealing. \n\nbeef tendon taco (<mark>Viva China</mark>): outstanding. the beef tendon is crispy and packs an amazing amount of flavor. the sauce is delicious. \n\ncarnitas taco: my absolute favorite. i've never had such good meat in a carnitas taco. \n\ntwenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>: this one was interesting. first of all, i should mention that my boyfriend can't stand onions, so i sadly had to get this sans any kind of onions or scallions. i bet that would really add to the flavor. however, even without onions, this dish got a hold of me. at first i thought \"meh, it's <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>,\" but with each subsequent bite, i began to realize, \"wait, this is the best <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> i've ever had.\" every bite had a new vegetable. and the boy literally licked the bowl clean. \n\nchocolate teracotta warrior: really, we got this because we wanted our special dinner to end with some kind of dessert. the presentation is stunning, and the ginger ice cream mixed with the chocolate crumbles is delicious, but i could've done without this one. i have a feeling their other desserts are probably better.\n\nthe service throughout the meal was great, our waiter was very attentive and helpful in giving us tips on what we might want to order. and the vibe of the place was very nice. casual, but upscale. and not crowded. i would definitely come here again.", 
            "my friend talked up chef jose andres so much on a (sorta) recent trip to dc that the name stuck, and after seeing it tagged to china poblano at the cosmopolitan, i figured it was destiny calling and just had to try it. \n\ni'm not really of the belief that culinary experiences, however life-changing they may be, should break the bank and i'll just tell you now that for two people, drinks, four small plates and dessert, came in at about a couple dollars over 100--but make an exception for this place because it was pretty effing good. \n\njust know what to order. \n\nthe 18 <mark>18 Monk Noodle</mark> was so amazing. you don't even realize the noodles are whole wheat, because they're just so good with the sauce and the shitakes. our waiter suggested we opt for the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> as opposed to the ceviche pargo and i could've, no wait--should've hugged him for it. the tuna was so fresh. the soy it was bathed in and amaranth seeds that topped it really enhanced the fish in a way that is pretty indescribable. \n\nwe also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, and the xo scallops in <mark>XO Sauce</mark>. i wouldn't recommend either because you didn't really come here for melted cheese and i don't want you to pay $18.88 for two golf-sized scallops, respectively. that was our mistake--but don't make it yours! a side note, they were both good, but not great and your hard earned dollars deserve great, okay?\n\nafter dollar signs kept racing through my head as i tried to figure out the damage, i wasn't really up to pay another double-digit figure for dessert, but the lady next to us devoured her mango sticky rice in a matter of minutes, so we thought, we'd come this far. #yolo \n\nanyways, it was so incredibly good! it's not your traditional thai-place-msr by any means. it's so light and airy and everything in it just works so well that as i write this all i really want to do is drive down to the cosmopolitan in my jammies and order it. \n\nas far as the service, and given it was a tuesday night, we got seated right away. our waiter, miller, was awesome! he didn't shy away from putting his two-cents when he knew we were making potentially catastrophic mistakes trying to decide what to eat and god bless him for it.",

            "the food here was fantastic. it is designed to be eaten as small plate, family style dining, so we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> 7 plates for 3 people for dinner. that was a perfect amount of food for the three of us (all girls, but one big eater!). plus we split two desserts, but could have easily done one.  everything was delicious, but the standouts were the golden pig steamed buns, dan dan noodles, mango sticky rice and the duck tongue tacos. \ncocktails were tasty. reasonable for vegas, although definitely pricey if you are going to eat a full meal with cocktails, mains, and dessert. \nmy one huge complaint was the service, and only very specifically in regards to the hostess. when we arrived, we checked in and were told without a reservation the wait could be 45 minutes to an hour, but since we were willing to sit anywhere that was first available (bar or table) usually something would open in about 20 minutes. we were escorted to the waiting area, and a server came by very quickly to offer us drinks. then we were basically ignored for an hour and a half, when everyone around us (also without a reservation) was seated first, despite having similarly sized groups. when the hostess did acknowledge us, every time she promised that we were next to be seated and we were just waiting for a table to open up. except that each time, she indicated a different table that we were waiting for.  when bar seats finally did open up an hour into our wait, she told us that we were just waiting for a table to leave - that they had already paid, and then showed another group to that table. when a table finally did open up, there was a huge miscommunication among the staff about who was going to get it, which arrangement and so on.  i feel like if we had not been persistent about being seated, we would have been completely ignored. \ni wouldn't have been so cranky about the wait time if my expectations had been properly managed from the beginning-customer service 101. when, 40 minutes in, she kept telling us that we would be seated right away, we just got more irritated every time that turned out to be untrue. if we were honestly kept apprised of the situation, we likely would have elected to come back another night with a reservation. \nsince we had been basically repeatedly misinformed, my friend asked if we could please have a complimentary guacamole for the wait. the hostess was super reluctant to help us and said she would have to ask her boss, but as soon as our server came to the table, the server offered to bring us some on the house. after we were in the server's hands, the dinner was fantastic. food came out really fast and the servers were friendly and efficient.  the hostess was likely enough to keep me from returning, at least for awhile, and definitely not without a reservation. when i pay $180 for a meal, i expect to treated with at least honesty and courtesy by every staff member, especially the \"face\" of the restaurant.",

            "i'm a las vegas food and wine writer by trade, so i learned a long time ago to take the good with the bad and focus on writing about the positives of a dining experience while ignoring the variables that can sometimes detract from an otherwise solid establishment. however, i feel that my most recent unpleasant experience at china poblano requires me to issue a warning to future diners, and that is to stay away. seriously, avoid this place and save your money. i used to absolutely love this place, the food was fabulous and unique, the drinks were delicious and creative, and the ambiance was festive and hip. the service has always been aloof and full of bad attitude (save for a delightful bartender named steve who was there when they opened but has since moved on to more hospitable pastures.), but i chalk that up to the general attitude of the cosmopolitan - which generally has the worst service on the strip across the board. since they opened, i've chosen to overlook that and make this my go to for entertaining clients and out of town guests in a casual setting as it really did have top notch food and a cozy atmosphere. alas, that is no more. it's been a couple of months since i dined with them, and apparently there has been an overhaul on the menu. the dishes are still tasty, however they have downsized many of them to tapas-like portions while keeping the prices the same (they were once reasonable, now they're typical strip mark-up). this was irritating, but not shun-worthy. that was reserved for the service that has gone from disinterested to disdainful. our server, richard, i admit had a sweet personality and an adorable smile - that is for the two minutes when he greeted us and took our order. once he did that we literally never saw him again until he brought us our check. this was not his fault, he was clearly the only bartender on duty. why they had him waiting tables as well while the bar was busy was beyond me. my companion and i each or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> salads. her, the beet and avocado (which was my favorite until now - it's been pared down to a tiny fraction of what it once was.) and i the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> (which could have been excellent had it not been drowning in an over abundance of lemon and soy). the pathetic excuse for a beet salad came out a full 10 minutes before my ceviche did. i waited for our server to notice, even attempting to flag him down, but he never bothered to come over. i finally stopped the tall, bald corpse of a manager (you'll know exactly who i mean if you see him) to ask if perhaps i might get my lunch before my companion finished. his response was a dippy 'well, ya know we have two kitchens so stuff doesn't always come out together, your server should have told you that'. that is the single worst excuse i've ever heard, and frankly, as i learned as a server many years ago it is unacceptable to ever take out only part of a table's order. not only was the service terrible but the manager was so annoyed that his diners would dare to ask to receive their food at the same time that he couldn't contain his disdain. i feel just awful that i inconvenienced him so by intruding upon his establishment to order food. i felt that unwelcome. no matter - i will never take another guest there again and i hope to save many a dear yelp reader from wasting their hard earned dollar on such nasty service and portions of food fit to starve a hamster. i will happily (and very vocally) never ever darken china poblano's door ever again.",

            "we were running late on a concert night at the cosmo and it was a rare show where we actually cared about the opening act, so time was of the essence.   while doing a yelp search from the elevator we decided upon china poblano as:\n\n1) \"tacos sound kinda good right now\"\n2) \"it's jose andres!   that dude's been on bourdain and top chef so he's legit\"\nand\n3) \"it gets 3 stars on yelp!  that means it's gotta be....   wait, 3 stars?!?\"  \n\nso we went anyway even though a straight up 3 is typically below my snooty yelp threshold of place to visit.   i'm glad we did.    we started by looking at some signature cocktails presented to us that arent on the main menu.   i wanted the aviation which has been one of my go-to drinks lately, and my lady friend wanted something i don't remember the name of, but it was something that didnt sound very \"manly\" like \"the snow willow\"   or \"the kitten's purr\"   it had cucumber as a main fixture and didn't sound appealing at all to me.    naturally my friend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> my drink for me and forced me to order the other one.   i tried both and all i'll say is, the aviation was delicious! quick wait service update:  after we put in the drink order, our waiter disappeared for what i felt was a long time.   we sat without drinks and without placing our order for i'd say a good 12 minutes.   we were definitely looking left and right for a trace of him as if we were trying to jaywalk across a busy intersection.   \n\nso given that we had a bit of a break, i went to yelp to try to find some recommendations.   i went with 4 tacos (they're small and i'm big).   and my dining companion went with <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark>.    as long as we had to wait to get our drinks and orders in, the wait for the food was exceptionally as short.   it seemed like only 5 minutes had passed before a few of my tacos from my order arrived, and only a few minutes after that the <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark> showed up.   \n\nfor my 2nd list of the review, here are all 4 tacos i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> and ate\n\n1)  lengua (beef tongue) -  delicious as beef tongue usually is.   melt in your mouth, well seasoned.  \n2)  <mark>Viva China</mark> (beef tendon/oysters) - disappointed in this one as the reviews seemed highly favorable.   i must admit i'm not a huge oyster fan, but to me the flavors of the oysters and the tendon just didn't co-mingle well.   \n3) carnitas - my favorite.   the pork was tender and delicious and i loved the contrast the crunch and flavor of the pork rinds provided.\n4) i cant find the 4th one i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> on the menu.   either that or i had too much of that cucumber drink and lost my mind accordingly.   it was some sort of beef short rib with some sort of chile i thought.   it was tasty and the chile brought a lot of smoky flavor to it.   it didn't really offer up anything unique enough for me to want to order it again though\n\noverall i was very happy with my meal of tacos as a whole.   the tortillas are made to order and taste fantastic.   we actually or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> some on the side to go with the <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark>.  as for that dish i thought i was a bit underwhelming.   the beef was flavorful and it tastes exactly how its described in the menu with the ginger/soy/vinegar components, but there just wasn't any extra oomph to justify spending nearly $20 on it.   the tacos, albeit small, are well worth the $5.50 a piece they generally command.   i like the idea that you could just come in here, grab a drink and a few tacos and be in and out in a reasonable time (if your waiter doesnt take an extended break like ours seemed to) for about $20, or go all out and share a bunch of dishes for an extravagant (and expensive) meal.   not many places, especially at the cosmo, give you that option.",

            "we'd always been curious to try this place since we're regular cosmopolitan guests.  suffice it to say our first visit to china poblano will be our last.  unfortunately we didn't read the yelp reviews before going there. when the average is 3 stars, and people seem to say the guacamole is the best thing about the place, it should be avoided.  \n\nall we had were two <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>, which our server told us were 'amazing' house specialties.  they were different for sure, but not amazing. ours arrived in small glasses with nearly half of it covered in a salty foam.  some may view this as culinary genius, while others may view it as a way to get away from using alcohol.  it tasted like lime and salt and that was it.  they were gone in three small sips ... no joking.  all that was left was foam.i seriously wonder if there was any alcohol in it at all, and they came to over $30 with tax!  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the margaritas right off the bat (big mistake... i know), and the server said, \"i'll be back with your drinks and then i can explain our menu to you.\"  it was a little weird that a place has to explain the menu, but china poblano does, apparently.\n\nhe said the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> was featured on a food network show, and then added some tidbits of info about certain dishes.  nothing seemed all that great, and we looked around and observed other guests who were either confused or unhappy.  it's not so much a fusion menu as a confusion menu.  and guacamole for $15?  seriously?  the waiter tried way too hard to sell the menu, and it was a complete turn-off.  \n\nthe cosmo has some nice restaurants.  this isn't one of them.", 
            "so when i heard chinese mexican fusion i expected something different than what it was. however, i wasn't disappointed when i saw the menu. it's broken up into mexican style dishes and chinese style dishes. our server said it was similar to a \"tapas\" place with small plates that were meant to be shared, or to order two plates per person for a full meal. i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the mexican asparagus and the chinese dancing eggplant. the asparagus was amazing and i devou<mark>Ichtegem's Flemish Red Ale</mark> of it. honestly would have been okay with just that because it was a pretty decent portion. the eggplant wasn't really what i expected. it's covered in a soy sauce glaze and these fish flakes (i forget the actual name, but they smell and taste really fishy). the eggplant was not the texture i expected. was hoping for something i would have to chew rather than something that just slid down my throat. the taste was okay but i couldn't do the slimy-ish texture. we had them bring <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> for the table and both were really good. i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the classic margarita and was not disappointed. if i ever make it back i really want to try the <mark>Margarita Bandera Flight</mark>, as a friend did and said it was amazing. our server was great, answe<mark>Ichtegem's Flemish Red Ale</mark> of our questions and ma<mark>Ceviche de Peje Sol</mark> great recommendations around the table that were raved about. he had no trouble dealing with the 14 rambunctious girls there for a bachelorette party and all of our food came out fairly quickly!\n\nmy gripe with this place is that even though it seems like there are a lot of choices, i had a tough time finding something to order other than my asparagus (which i was really excited about). i wish i would have or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the tacos because they looked really good. a friend had the dan dan and said it was pretty spicy, but lost or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> off the mexican portion of the menu.",

            "we stayed at the cosmo a few years ago and have wanted to try this place ever since.  we walked up at about 6 on a sunday night. they said they could seat us right away at the bar.  after a long day of traveling we were ok with that.  the bar stools are wooden so a little uncomfortable.  we started with the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> which are fantastic.  i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a pomegranate margarita and my husband or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a coke.  the margarita was some kind of \"air\" margarita so it was different but good.  for our entrees we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the \"<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\" which are pulled pork type dumpling rolls, carnitas taco, another beef taco(can't remember the name) and a beet salad.  portions are a bit small for the price.  that's the only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5.  it was all delicious and service was good!", 
            "terrible: courses arrived at different times (explanation was that there are 3 kitchens so of course we should understand), the advertised shredded chicken came in big pieces including cartilage and a hunk of boiled skin (explanation was that the chef says the skin adds flavor), lots of unnecessary fat in the dishes we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>, and all this with high prices.  go somewhere else.",

            "spent our 24th anniversary at china poblano and we were so, so satisfied.  but be warned this is a trendy \"small plate\" big price restaurant which means both your wallet and your stomach could be left empty. however, the food is delicious, the atmosphere fun and the service impeccable, if a bit pretentious (each food runner describes the dish you just or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> as they deliver it to your table in case you are so drunk on their incredible tequila offerings that you need reminding). \n\nchina poblano offers both mexican and chinese dishes side by side, hence the name.  i was hoping for more of a fusion concept but dove in with all tastebuds firing. \n\nnumber one: get the carnitas taco.  at $5.50 it is moist, flavorful and meaty!  yes there should be at least 2 if not 3 tacos for that price but trust me, ignore the price and just order a lot of these! \n\nthe guacamole and warm tortillas are delicious and filling.  the <mark>Quail Egg</mark> shumai are great and you get 6 of them in one order.  the pozole is good and satisfying, not the best i've had but good.  the dan dan noodles were earthy tasting and not my favorite although the actual noodles were wonderful, the topping tasted of pungent, ground earth, maybe not bad, but not my taste.\n\nfor dessert, we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the churros with oaxacan chocolate.  this was off.  the churros were flavorless and not sweet enough although the texture was right.  the chocolate was bad.  the flavor was mingled with an unrecognizable savory, spice that we didn't care for at all.  \n\nhad a fabulous 1.5 oz. pour of tequila.  their tequila menu is extensive and organized by highland and lowland brands.  also their take on the classic margarita is really fun with a salty foam topping that is delicious for those who enjoy a salted margarita.  \n\nthe prices are ridiculous which is why i am not giving the place 5 stars. but it's the new vegas and long gone are the crappy $1.99 buffets about which i am certainly not complaining.  however, it seems we've moved to the opposite end of the spectrum, serving higher quality food while gouging people with prices 4 times the actual cost of the ingredients.  i hope in my lifetime, we see a happy balance between the two.\n\nbut if you're willing to blithely open your pocketbook, you're in for a great meal!",

            "my friends arrived on a later flight and hadn't eaten their dinner yet, so this was the first restaurant we found here just by walking around the second floor of the cosmo. the place looked interesting with it's very casual atmosphere, and so, although i was kind of skeptical about a place serving chinese and mexican food, we decided to keep an open mind as it looked pretty decent. but boy, was it a bad mistake coming here.\n\nthe hostess was nice enough to seat us right away even though the place looked relatively full. the server came over and welcomed us and asked us what we'd like to drink.....but i had a hard time understanding her as it sounded like she had laryngitis or something. anyway, we decided to try a mix of dishes since the server recommended we perhaps try 2 chinese dishes and 2 mexican dishes just to mix it up. we  didn't want to order too much since it was pretty late so went ahead and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the chips & salsa, <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles, dancing eggplant.....then we looked over at the next table and the dish they or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> looked interesting so we asked them how and what it was? ...it was the gan pung ji chicken and they told us it was very good! so ok, we went ahead and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> it just to try something different.\n\noh boy. the eggplant dish had a thick black sauce over it that totally overpowered the eggplant ....kind of tasted like and overly sweet hoisin sauce, but whatever it was, we didn't like it at all. the eggplant itself was cooked ok, but would have been tasteless without something on it, but not that strong. next, was the <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles which is more like a small noodle salad where you have to mix all the ingredients together yourself. something tasted off about these noodles, and again, we didn't like it at all. next was the chicken dish. it's basically a fancied up lemon chicken type dish. sauce was starchy and way too sweet.\n\ni think the best part of the dinner was the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> which tasted fresh...and together with our coronas and red wine....somewhat made us forget about the chinese food we had just ate. \n\ni can't say i will ever come back to this place as there are so many better places to eat in vegas. and the prices of the dishes here are not cheap for what you get! next time i think we'll stick to a real chinese restaurant for real chinese food.",

            "i must have amnesia because i really don't know why i keep coming back here. my first time was when it first opened a few years ago, and i believe i have a review for \"the worst thing i've ever eaten\" see: beef tendon taco w/ bad oyster. about a year and a half ago i went back, and was again taken aback by the incredibly mediocre food and astronomical prices. \n\na few weeks ago a friend and i were prowling the town, looking for a fun spot to grab a bite before we headed to drais for chromeo (woo!), and she'd never been, and again, i guess i blacked out momentarily from hunger, because i was like \"okay! let's go here!\". wrong. it was empty per usual... even though it was 9pm on a friday night. we each or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a <mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark> at $15 a pop, and they didn't even have the courtesy to fill them to top of the glass. we split the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, and there was nothing fun about it. it was a glop of starchy melted cheese. a 5 year old could make it by literally putting a block of monterey jack in the microwave. a very expensive block of $10 cheese. \n\ni had the special, a pork belly taco w/ pineapple at $4 which was nothing special at all, and the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> noodles for $13 which were spicy, excessively sweet, and quite glue-y. she had a bowl of noodles as well, and somehow our bill came to almost $100 w/ tip. what. \n\njose andres- what are you doing. you are amazing, jaleo is amazing (the one in dc is 10x better), bazaar is amazing, this restaurant is a stain <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> reputation. the only pros are the service, which is always great, the manager did come over to see how things were, and we said great, because it's not her fault the food sucks. the servers are attentive as well. the first time i was there i saw mario batali eating in the back in his famous orange crocs, so i suppose that's cool. all this experience did was remind me why i avoid strip celebrity-name restaurants.",

            "i came in with decent expectations. walking in, they were lowered a little bit. very gaudy, flashy decor. but once you look at the menu, it speaks for itself.  \n\nthe food isn't really fusion. they have a mexican side and an asian side. the cocktails are made with agave-based spirits and they have some agua frescas too.\n\ni started with a horchata. it was good.. a little chalky compared to others i've had, but not too sweet. my friend got the mango and it was delicious. \n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> many small things to share, starting with the lengua taco.\n\nbest lengua taco i've ever had. meat was seasoned, tender and simply garnished with radish, onion and cilantro. you can tell the corn tortillas are fresh and made in house (you can watch some ladies making them as you walk in).\n\nnext we had the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark>. similar to chinese pork buns but deep fried. the dough was slightly sweet and delicious. they're served with a side of house made condensed milk. yum! \n\nthe fries came next.. they were loaded with mole (perfectly balanced), crema and queso fresco. fries are hand cut. they were yummy. a carnitas taco came out too. again, best carnitas taco i've had. it was garnished with salsa verde and pork rinds.\n\nthe duck tongue taco and a chinese pork <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> were last. the duck tongue was glazed in some delicious sweet sauce, garnished with fresh lychee... a bit hard to get over the mental block, but i still gave it a shot. the pork sandwich was very full of flavor. chopped pork braised with 5 spice. \n\noverall, everything was very well executed. they mentioned almost everything was made in house. service was fantastic. definitely recommending this place to friends visiting vegas! it won't break the bank either.", 
            "usually when the concept of the restaurant is fusion (especially of the unexpected sort), the idea works better than the blending within the food itself. that is not the case here--china meets mexico and they made beautiful food babies! \n\nthese dishes were the most distinct to me: \n\non my first sitting i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the carnitas tacos and the duck tongue taco. i found the ingredients to be unexpected and was curious of the result of such flavor combinations. on the count  of texture, taste, and quality, these completely succeeded and i offered the perfect teaser for us to delve into a more serious entree. \n\nnext came the pork and <mark>Quail Egg</mark> sui mai which completely blew me away!! the delicate unbroken yolk of the <mark>Quail Egg</mark> perfectly cooked on top of the soft pork sui mai generated the most winning flavor with the light soy sauce. \n\nthis place was so creative on both decor and food. the carnitas and duck tongue taco, the <mark>Quail Egg</mark> sui mai are a must try. i'm thoroughly impressed!", 
            "i was a little apprehensive about trying this place because of the mixed reviews and the prices... \n\nwe deliberated for a little while, but decided to try with the knowledge that 1) this is not really a fusion place and 2) we probably weren't going to be full.\n\nthe place is decorated really cute and fun and the service is very friendly and attentive. i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the wild mushroom taco, the 20-vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, and the <mark>Open Sesame</mark> cold noodles. my companions or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Lotus Chips</mark>, lengua taco, some kind of taco with oyster, and pozole rojo.\n\nthat wild mushroom taco was so delicious!!!! i have never had anything like it. priced at $5.50, it is rather expensive for a teeny tiny taco but i loved it and that makes it totally worth it. i thought that the noodles and <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> were also pricey, but really good and surprisingly filling. try counting 20 vegetables in the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>... try it! j really enjoyed the pozole. i'm sure he wished it came in a larger portion too. the <mark>Lotus Chips</mark> were thin and crispy, not greasy at all.\n\nso in conclusion, it's no lie that this place is super expensive. however, i still think it is worth the splurge because in the end, if the food and dining experience can exceed my expectations, then i am glad that i tried it. trust me, i have paid close to the same dollar amount for sub-par food and service.", 
            "we where pretty hungry and wanted to eat something different but light for lunch . the staff was friendly especially the hostess asking us about our stay etc etc .... the waiter was very attentive and friend as well . the menu is a bit strange mixing mexican  cuisine and chinese but it was a nice twist to let us each try a differ choice without having to go to a buffet. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the recommend <mark>Chicken Ji Song</mark> (4pc. lettuce leaf cups / fried sweet potatoes 16.88) is was very good no over powering flavored but very tasteful !! we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the fish ceviche which was also very good it had a bed of guacamole on the bottom and the fish on top , it also had a nice flavorful kick to it as well . i'm not a spicy kind of person but i was able to eat enough to enjoy the meal . the also had a good beer selection which we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the westmalle trappist ale, never tried it before but it was delicious.",

            "we were in vegas for the first time and felt this place was a good place with good reviews for the money. we were so pleased after dinner that it was the best place we had eaten. i am also gluten free and the waiter had great knowledge about the gluten free options. the best part was that he or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> us dessert for our anniversary and it was also gluten free and i didn't even have to ask. this place is a must visit place!!!!!",

            "i have such fond experiences of eating here with my girlfriends when it first opened a few years ago, but my most recent visit wasn't nearly as delicious as i remembered. i don't know whether my taste has improved since my starving college student years or whether the restaurant has changed, but it was no longer the mind-blowing food i recalled. \n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark>, the beef shumai, lobster tacos, and for dessert, mango sticky rice and churros (we like dessert). the pigs were basically donuts filled with bbq pork, and they were quite tasty when drenched with the accompanying condensed milk. the shumai weren't really anything to write home about, but the lobster tacos were the real disappointment! as my coworker put it, \"for $10 a taco, i expected them to taste good.\" the lobster was completely overwhelmed by an abundance of lime and grapefruit, making the tacos quite acidic and sour. the mango sticky rice was an interesting twist on the classic thai dessert, as the rice was puffed and sprinkled on top of mango and ice cream which was covered in quite a lot of whipped cream. it was light and interesting, and i enjoyed it. the churros were nice but not particularly special. \n\noverall i'm a bit disappointed in <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark>, and i hope they will start putting more effort into the food here.",

            "if i could give this place ten stars, i would! was just in vegas for a bachelorette party this weekend, but my buddy and i snuck off from the activities  so we could try this place. it was sooo worth it! i love everything about china poblano, the ambience, the staff, and of course, the food. i am so sick of fusion places, so this was a breath of fresh air. they managed to bring together two  unique cuisines under one roof, and they did it in a very elegant way.\n\nour server was very attentive and very knowledgable of their menu, he gave the best recommendations and checked-in on us regularly. i was quite impressed at how each dish was explained to us as they were being served.\n\nas for the food, we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the pork belly tacos, <mark>Gan Pung Ji Chicken Wings</mark>, 21 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> and golden pork buns with condensed milk. each was a winner, but my friend and i both agreed that the golden pork buns were little pieces of heaven. i would drive back to vegas anytime if it means i could have this dish again.\n\noverall, do not pass up on china poblano, it's one of the most memorable meals i've had for this whole weekend!",

            "we had a very enjoyable experience here. the service was outstanding and the food was delicious. admittedly, though, we did not venture into any dishes on the china side of the menu. we opted to sit at the taco bar, which was kinda nice. \n\nfor cocktails, we had the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> and mexican mimosa. with the mexican mimosa, we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the first one with papaya juice (good, but a little boring) and the second one with guava juice (amazing). the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> was particularly exceptional. such a great and innovative way to do a margarita - and it definitely tasted far better than your typical margarita.\n\nwe started off with the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>. the fresh tortillas were fantastic, but the queso itself was a bit of a let down. while it was good (and we certainly ate all of it), it didn't have a lot of flavor to it. basically, we were expecting more.\n\nwe then shared two sets of two tacos - the barbacoa and <mark>Viva China</mark>. the barbacoa were incredibly delicious! so many great flavors, and just the right amounts of juiciness and crunch. the <mark>Viva China</mark> were interesting, but were quite salty. and the two <mark>Viva China</mark> tacos actually tasted different - one meatier and saltier, and one crispier and less salty. a good and interesting flavor experience, but we probably wouldn't order them again.\n\nfor dessert we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the flan. it was unlike any flan we have experienced before. it was served with ice cream and these awesome seared-like pineapple squares. all the flavors together (flan, ice cream, and pineapple) were absolutely incredible! and it was all even better when paired with the guava mexican mimosa. one of the best desserts we've had in a long time.\n\nit was a little pricey (especially $6 for a bottle of coke), but everything we had was delicious (so it was worth it). and the service was exceptional. our server was very attentive and knew the menu well. one of the better service experiences we've had in awhile. and the space and decor is neat. overall, great casual dining experience.", 
            "while wandering around looking for a place to eat, my friends and i stumbled upon china poblano.  once someone pointed out to me that it is a jose andres restaurant, i knew i had to try it.  although i didn't think it was his best, i enjoyed every dish i had for one reason or another.\n\nlike most of his restaurants, china poblano is more of a tapas-style place in that they serve up smaller plates intended to be shared amongst a group.  eating in this manner, i was able to try three different dishes. the first were the lamb pot stickers which were small in size, but surprisingly filling.  i enjoyed the \"crispy lace\" (in essence, extra fried bits from the pan, which is never a bad thing) and thought they were well made, but overall didn't find them different enough from anything i've had before.  on the other hand, the two types of tacos i tried were both tasty and very original.  the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco has soft beef tendon, kumamoto oyster, and a touch of a slightly spicy sauce on top.  the oyster was the real standout here, as the softness of it complemented the texture of the tendon, while the natural saltiness of it really added a punch to the dish.  the other taco i tried was the <mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark>, which is slow-cooked pork belly and pineapple.  if you know me, you know i love pork belly, so this was a big winner.  the saltiness of the tender pork belly balanced so well with the sweetness of the pineapple and made for a great dish.\n\nwe also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> some drinks.  i shared the cold \"tea\" for two, which was a mixture of green tea, tequila, and beer.  the presentation was nice, as it comes out in a tea pot and is served in a couple nice glasses, but flavor was a bit off.  although i found it a refreshing drink, i thought they added a bit too much lemon to it and wished there was more of a green tea flavor.  another friend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the lemon drop \"soup,\" a lemon vodka drink with lemon \"noodles\" made out of a gelatin-like substance.  it also seemed very refreshing, and the \"noodles\" were an interesting touch.\n\noverall, i really enjoyed my lunch at china poblano.  although it was a little expensive for a normal lunch, spending $25 to share 3 dishes and a drink at a jose andres restaurant seemed pretty reasonable.  although it wasn't quite good enough to break into 4 star territory (felt like more of a 3.5 to me) i would definitely recommend checking it out if you are a fan of his, or if you are just looking for something different to try.", 
            "this place is fun and i love the concept, but the execution culinary-wise is not quite up to snuff.\n\nthis is an interesting concept: take the best of both culinary cultures, and blend some to create unique dishes. it's fusion, but not totally, since some of the dishes remain faithful to the traditional recipes.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> and shared family style, so that meant we sampled a bunch of tacos and noodles. some were nice hits, some were really bad misses.\n\nhighlights:\nhuitlacoche noodles - i've always wanted to try huitlacoche (corn smut fungus), and it integrates seamlessly into this chinese-styled dish. however, they skimped on how much huitlacoche they gave. also it takes on flavors so well that i couldn't tell what was the corn itself or if it just absorbed the black bean sauce. still very tasty though.\npozole - i love pozole already and it's funny because there's tons of hominy in this dish (whereas the huitlacoche was lacking). the twist is that they give chinese shrimp crackers to dip instead. yum.\ndim sum - in general all the dim sum was good, but not great here.\n\nlowlights:\nunholy monk soup - the blandest, blandest soup evar. don't monks usually deprive themselves of earthly pleasures? eat this and you'll feel like a monk too - this dish deprives you of all flavor. don't give alms to this one.\n<mark>Viva China</mark> tacos - this has oysters. i pretty much only like oysters fresh & raw with lemon. when oysters get messed with any more than that, they tend to taste funky. the rest of the taco - very good. the oyster part - bad.\n\nso while this place has a great concept, some of the dishes just aren't very good. i like how they maintain both traditional and want to mix it up too. the bad dishes were very bad, the good dishes were pretty good. i guarantee that you'll have fun here though.", 
            "there are certain dos and don'ts when planning a trip to jose andres' chinese/mexican restaurant china poblano, located inside the cosmopolitan of las vegas.\n\ndo: pronounce the name right.\nit's china, like chee-nah, poh-blah-no. next person i hear calling it \"chai-nah\" is getting chopsticks straight up the culo.\n\ndo: realize its chinese/mexican, not fusion.\nif you're looking for wacky dishes like orange chicken tacos, it's not happening, bub. although they have a few plates that play with both sides of the aisle (like the <mark>Viva China</mark> tacos), the \"fusion,\" as it were, is in the juxtaposition of the cuisines. how many times have you been eating a taco and thought, \"this is brilliant! now if i only had a wonton to go with it...\" i mean, if i only had a nickel for every time, right?\n\ndo: go in a big group.\nfood at china poblano is served dim sum style, which means you'll be ordering lots of small plates. get a group of about 5 or 6 and have people try to order different items, and you could have a veritable cornucopia of food at your fingertips. dim sum is most fun when you have a lot of people anyway.\n\nhere's the problem with china poblano (which i believe is spanish for \"chinese poblano\") -- there's a list of don'ts as well.\n\ndon't: go in famished.\nin fact, don't even go in quite hungry. for china poblano's menu is mostly \"dim sum\" style, which is chinese for \"frackin' small.\" if you're going in for a hearty meal, i'd pass right on and head down the hall to holstein's. if you're ready to proverbially eat a horse, you'll have to get three plates in before you even register a proverbial hoof.\n\ndon't: go in on a budget.\nyou're going to break it. i promise. the dishes range from $8 to $25. yeah. for dim sum. i had a plate of 6 wontons, and two fish tacos. add a <mark>Diet Coke</mark> and i was up in the $26 range. for two dishes and a soda. again, if i had gone down the hall to holstein's, i could have had a huge burger, fries and a beer for less.\n\nchina poblano is not a bad restaurant. the food was tasty (although i've had better chinese and mexican food -- thank you emily), the atmosphere was kitschy, and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. plates usually showed up less than five minutes after you order them too, which is a nice touch. but in the end, one of the most hyped-up restaurants in the resort drops the ball somewhere along the way.\n\nif you really must have chinese and mexican on the same plate on the las vegas strip, there's a panda express that shares the same space with chipotle next to harrah's.", 
            "picky eaters do not apply. to enjoy this place, you have to be an adventurous eater.  if you just get chips, <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, or a pork bun, you will not be happy.  \n\nfor foodies who won't turn their nose up at a beef tendon taco, this is the place for you!  super creative food and a great bargain for what you get.  \n\nwe started out with the pozole rojo ($9) which is a spicy shredded pork soup with chickpeas, cabbage, pork rinds, chopped onions, radish, and avocado.  this was a really good portion size for $9 and so tasty.  you can get it with a shot of tequila for an extra $3 but our server didn't recommend it unless we just wanted to do a tequila shot. apparently the tequila is offered for hangovers.  hair of the dog, you know.\n\nnext we tried the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco ($5.50 each) which has beef tendon, a kumamoto oyster, and sichuan sauce.  yes, beef tendon in a taco.  this was extremely tasty.  i could eat ten of these.\n\nwe also tried the cochinita taco ($4.50 each).  it's pretty much pork and pickled onions.  pretty good, but the carnitas taco topped with pork rinds is so much better.\n\nanother great dish was the papas with <mark>XO Sauce</mark> ($6).  french fries covered in a dried scallop sauce.  they serve it with lime, which you think would be awful.  but it's actually really, really good!\n\nthe big surprise of the night was the gaspacho morelia ($10).  this is a huge plate of very fresh, very tasty fruit covered in freshly squeezed orange juice.  some of the fruit had some spicy seasoning on it, which enhanced the flavor of the fruit.  pineapple, watermelon, mango, jicama, dragonfruit, strawberries, and queso fresca. very good and light.\n\nthe cocktails are also very inventive.  i don't think i can ever have a normal margarita again after having the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> ($12) served here.  the salt foam is a perfect compliment to the margarita and doesn't have the harsh taste of salt on the rim.  my husband had the <mark>Lychee Sour</mark> ($12) which was also very good.  \n\n$63 before tip and we were very, very full.  service was impeccable and very friendly.  just focus on the more creative dishes.  yeah, you can get a pork bun in chinatown for cheaper.  of course you can get a carne asada taco at a taco truck for cheaper.  come here for the creative dishes that you can't get anywhere else.", 
            "i really enjoyed our dining experience here. if i could live on a diet of  just <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>, i would.  what a delightful concoction! we went for more of a mexican feast than chinese, so here is the breakdown.\n\nthe tacos: \n<mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark> (slow-cooked pork belly/ pineapple) - great play on flavors. the pork belly had good crispness to it and complemented the pineapple. \n\n<mark>Viva China</mark>* (soft beef tendon/ kumamoto oyster/scallions/ sichuan peppercorn sauce) - my husband's favorite. great fusion taco. the tendon was cooked just right. \n\nsilencio (duck tongue/ fresh lychee) - neither of us had tried duck tongue before, so we had to try it. fantastic! the sauce had a bit of spice to it that really made work. \n\n<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> (oaxacan-style barbeque beef/guajillo chile/ pickled cactus paddle) - the was a big taco filled with flavorful barbacoa and nopales. i'm not sure if it was worth the price, but it was tasty. \n\ncarnitas (braised baby pig/pork rinds/ spicy salsa verde cruda) - this was the favorite of the night. the carnitas were perfect, but the addition of the pork rinds really made this taco off the chain! we could have eaten 10 of these. \n\nthe rest:\nhuitlacoche noodles (wild mushrooms/ fresh mexican corn truffle/ knife-shaved noodles) - the huitlacoche actually worked well in this dish. i wasn't sure going in, but felt adventurous. the noodles were cooked perfectly. this is a dish that is big enough to share. this dish was surprisingly spicy, so beware. \n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> (melted chihuahua cheese/tequila blanco/fresh tortillas...with chorizo) - tasty! maybe a bit expensive. it reminded me of being with family in mexico and eating fresh tortillas off of the comal with cheese. \n\nmango sticky rice - the was actually a cream of sweet rice on top of mango shave ice topped with crispy rice (think rice krispies) and fresh mango. very refreshing! \n\nour server was attentive and the manager even came by the see if we were satisfied. overall, we had a pleasant dining experience.",

            "it was a saturday night and we met up with my bro-in-law and his friends.  they were eating at the counter, first come first serve (i think).  luckily, 5 minutes after chatting, 2 people got up so that we could sit.

            "we ended up here about twice in just as many days, because there was almost too much to try in one sitting.  they've got a couple open kitchen stations - one for some of the mexican items and another with a huge steamer for the chinese dumplings, plus an area for making noodles.  i have to say that at the rather odd hours we were in, we didn't see much more than a few egg rolls being wrapped, however.\n\nthey have a fairly large cocktail menu with some interesting, though confusing things, and notably have a couple chinese beers by the bottle that i had not seen before.\n\nwe tried a couple tacos - silencio, with duck tongue and lychee, was quite good, the duck tongue being very approachable.  <mark>Viva China</mark>, with tendon and oyster, was similarly unthreatening.  in general, though the flavors were good and the textures were decent, these tacos put so many different components together that they often got lost in each other.\n\nlamb potstickers were good, and reasonably, but again not emphatically, lamby.\n\nhuitlacoche noodles were a little disappointing.  the noodles had a nice texture, but we had a hard time detecting much huitlacoche flavor.\n\nthe braised pork sandwich ( <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> ) was awesome, but about two bites.\n\nwe came back specifically to try the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>.  expensive at $17.88, it is possible that they did in fact include 20 vegetables, cut into very small cubes, somewhere within the rather small portion.  but in the end it was just that:  <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>.\n\nwe were hoping to see a lot more fusion on the menu, but most dishes were segregated onto one side or the other.  we enjoyed both our experiences - the servers were accommodating, though very casual, and there was a lot to look at in the space, from the cooking going on to the walls of offbeat art.  overall, and keeping in mind that this is in a fancy hotel casino in the middle of the desert, the food is remarkably good for the location.", 
            "chinese mexican... hmmm... big miss... decor an service were excellent... i tried different tacos, and they all were marginal... please do not order <mark>Viva China</mark> taco.... tortillas are the only thing i was impressed with from the expensive tacos. who knows maybe the chinese menu taste better",

            "my brother wanted to try this place out and rightfully so.  i mean how many places serve chinese and mexican food under one roof?  notwithstanding the concept, the bright lights and artistic decor you felt like something was a bit off.  i expected to see a fusion of dishes on the menu, but instead it was more like two restaurants on one menu.  although i feel like its a novel concept, the prices are high for what it normally costs.  now granted maybe it costs more to maintain this kind of a restaurant, but the general knowledge of mexican and chinese food, is that it shouldn't be extremely expensive without some fancy hard to find, hard to spell, impossible to make dish that's tagged for $$$ dollars \n\nor<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>:\n<mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> $4 (the chips were good and the salsa was fire roasted)\n\nthe unruly monk - hand-cut noodles/ wild wood ear mushrooms/ poached egg/spicy sauce $17.88  (very good, although i've had this at a standard chinese restaurant at very good tastes for half the price.)\n\nlengua  - beef tongue/salsa pasilla $4 (fantastic melted in your mouth)\n\n<mark>Viva China</mark> - soft beef tendon/ kumamoto oyster/scallions/ sichuan peppercorn sauce $5.50 (one of the strangest things i've ever tasted, i'm still not sure if i liked it or not.  the consistency of the oyster just makes the whole thing a little off.)\n\nso in summary, this restaurant is an interesting idea, although i don't think its implemented quite right.  pre established bargain cuisine, such as chinese and mexican, can certainly throw someone well versed in that universe into a frenzy with prices.  although our waiter was great, the service just didn't justify the prices.\n\nif you don't plan to eat much, then it's $$, but if you plan to actually eat a meal, then make it $$$.  \n\nwould i go back?  sorry, but my dollars will be going elsewhere",

            "if not for the out-of-this-world carnitas tacos (yay for pork rinds!) i think i would have given this place only 2 stars.  it advertises itself as \"chinese/mexican fusion\", but the menu is really just split up into various mexican dishes and chinese dishes (mostly of the dim sum variety). as an overall note, i think that the mexican dishes were much tastier than the chinese items, so if you are wrestling b/w the two, i would go with mexican. here's what we tried:\n\ntacos\ncarnitas - yum yum yum.  definitely order this if you order nothing else.  and get two, so that you won't have to share. a+\n\n<mark>Viva China</mark> - this is a kumamoto oyster/beef tendon/sichuan peppercorn sauce taco.  the combo of the tendon and oyster was underwhelming, and if you really love that peppercorn taste, you're not going to find much of it here. c-\n\nbarbacoa - we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> this because it came with \"cactus paddle\".  still have no idea what cactus paddle is, but it's an awesome name!  the beef was alright, though a bit salty, and the cactus unfortunately didn't really taste like anything at all. c-\n\nfried fish taco - the fish was fried nicely, and i liked the pickled onions that came with it, but it was close to 7 bucks for two tiny tacos and pinky sized pieces of fish, so probably wouldn't order it again.  b-\n\nchinese\n\nfire phoenix - this was pretty much a variation of popcorn chicken, with pork rinds on the side.the sichuan peppercorn salt was really good, and fried chicken never tastes bad when it's fres, but there really wasn't anything that special about this dish.  c\n\nmexican\n\n<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> - comes on a bed of ice and looks delectable.  tastes pretty a-ok too. i think they put soy sauce in here, which gives it a nice depth of flavor.  a-\n\ncoctel de camarones - this was pretty much like a cold cocktail of shrimp, crab, and avocado, mixed with what is essentially a cocktail sauce.  i love lump crab meat and i love shrimp, but i didn't come here to eat those things with cocktail sauce.  i can get that for 3.99 anywhere else.  c\n\n<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> - this actually did taste like a fusion dish, though it was a bit heavily sauced.  the shrimp are nice and garlic-y, with a hint of spice from the poblano peppers.  good, but could have used a side of rice or something.  b-\n\nin a nutshell:  i'd recommend just stopping in and sitting at the counter and ordering some tacos (especially the carnitas ones), and then going somewhere else for dinner.  as a disclaimer, we didn't order the famous \"twenty ingredient <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>\" that was featured on food network, but i'm taiwanese, and i just don't feel right paying 20 bucks for <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>.", 
            "this is one of a kind - unique chinese x mexican restaurant in town. i know this place is expensive for mexican and chinese,,, but i keep visiting there.\n\nto start with, i always order a drink with <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>. i have eaten scallop ceviche, but tuna is way better than scallops, i think.\n\ni would recommend the chinese inspired taco, <mark>Viva China</mark>. they are very tasty. fish taco was really good, too.\n\nfor dim sum, i recommend \"<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\", its a bbq pork buns. delicious (its a bit sweet side, tho).\n\nall the sui mai is very good. gold leaf on sui mai??? funny but they are good.\n\nhowever, noodles in the lower price range, <mark>Kao Lao Lao</mark> and <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> are my least favorite. the taste is flat - too greasy and boring. i dont recommend. i guess you get what you pay for. \n\nsoup,,, they are ok.\n\nbartender was super nice and explained everything i asked.", 
            "i really liked it. their service was top notch, very attentive and courteous staff who can definitely handle chaos. being the only 2 casual eateries not counting the hidden pizza place in otherwise expensive restaurant land cosmopolitan, they are slammed all the time. i passed by everyday staying there and it was like a street mob scene. regardless, they had hired a bunch of cool cats who handled the situation well which i really liked because feeding hunger after walking around all day is one serious business.\n\nthe food was superb. very very fine for street food. i loved it. of course it was also because i expected nothing at all* bah! jose andres? oh no, not another jose andres joint, tacos? dim sum? oh whatever. so thats how i went in. but blow me down, i was dead wrong. they executed very well for what was just mindless street food in an expensive hotel. i shared  their beef tongue taco (excellent, low fat) , har kow (nice twist), <mark>Viva China</mark> taco (didn't like this one, too fried), cochinita taco (good), lobster taco (not special enough), <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> (good enough) and that was about it. i really loved the quality of their meat cuts. \n\npricey? yes, because tacos, dim sum etc. are not usually, thats the problem. but was it worth it? yes again.\n\natmosphere-- casual. so after all the partying and dressing up for great dinners, this is a welcome change. people are happy all around, not high and drunk like the other casual eateries because they don't serve up cheap fruit punch cocktails here. \n\njust too cool for that.", 
            "good food and fun ambiance, but very pricey for what you get. my friends and i wanted just some small bites before going out and this place seemed like it would fit the bill. i'd been to jose andres' bazaar in la so i knew this place would be pricey but probably worth a try. the dishes are actually pretty straightforward and tasty upscale versions of chinese and mexican street food. by upscale i mean gold leaf flakes on the dumplings, oyster in a taco, etc. and tiny portions.\n\nour group got to share:\n- sui mai (traditional 6pc  shrimp/pork/water chestnuts/mushrooms/peanuts)\n- <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> (hand-cut wheat noodles/spicy pork sauce/peanuts)\n- c\\u00f3ctel de camarones (fresh shrimp/jumbo lump crab meat/tomato/avocado)\n- <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> (fried potatoes with mole poblano/mexican cream/queso fresco)\n\nand i got for myself in addition:\n- <mark>Viva China</mark> (soft beef tendon/kumamoto oysters/scallions/sichuan peppercorn sauce)\n- china paloma (tequila reposado/house-made grapefruit lavender syrup/soda)\n\ni'd have to say my fave item was that <mark>Viva China</mark> taco! the beef tendon was perfectly crispy/chewy/fatty and the oyster added an extra dimension to the flavors--very good! all told with others ordering a drink of their own everyone's share came to about $35, which is pretty dang pricey for small bites. the service was also decent so i thought it was worth a try, but next time i'll probably save my $$ for other places.", 
            "i'm shocked by how low the average rating here is, this is one of my favorite places to eat when i'm in vegas.  we discovered it totally by accident while roaming through the newest building on the strip, looking for a fun meal. the initial outside appearance of the restaurant made me think it was a food court, but once i saw the name jose andres, i knew we were in for something special,  and i wasn't disappointed.\n\nthat was over a year ago, since then we have been back several times.  the highest compliment that i can pay to the food is that every time i leave china poblano, i leave energized, excited, and euphoric.\n\nwhen china poblano gets it right, they get it very right, witness the <mark>Viva China</mark>, beef tendon and kumamoto oyster taco.  it's simple, yet enthralling, an amazing contrast of texture, temperature, and flavor.  every time i have one, it's just as good as the first.\n\nthere are a number of other shining stars, like the barbacoa and silenco (spicy duck tongue and lychee!) tacos, and several of the desserts (i still dream about the tres lychees, why did they have to take it away?!?!?!).  the noodles i've tried were quite good (especially the spicy <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>), but not quite up to the level of the zany tacos.\n\ni have sampled a few things that i'd classify as merely \"good\" like the chocolate terra cotta warrior, and the fried wantons, and there is a large swath of the menu that i've yet to try.\n\nyes, it can be a bit pricey for the quantity of food/drink, but consider the location, and more importantly consider the creative, meticulously prepared food.  you get what you pay for.\n\nhowever, those items that i love make china poblano a destination entirely on their own, not to mention the fun atmosphere and excellent service.  on that note, our servers have always been not just friendly and accommodating, but very knowledgeable about the food as well, and i think that really makes a difference in the overall experience.\n\ni'm always happy to be coming back to china poblano.  it's a great place to start or end your vegas trip, or perhaps even for a late night in the middle.  this last trip, we did all three!", 
            "i like jose andres, chinese food and mexican food.  put them all together you'd get something spectacular, right?  well, at least that's i hoped for.\n\nthe service at china poblano was good.  i loved the interior.  images of mao, frida kahlo, the dalai lama, etc. projected on screen on the walls - nice touch.\n\ni had the <mark>Jasmine Downy Pearls</mark> tea and it was amazing.  it was fragrant and it tasted good.  it was a neat idea that they give you a timer so you get to enjoy the perfect tea whether you like it mild, medium or strong.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a bun of different things from the menu:\n\n<mark>Golden Pigs</mark>:\n4 fried bbq pork buns with a side of condensed milk.  dipping pork buns on condensed milk might seem pretty odd but it works.  sweet and savory just go well together.  5/5\n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>:\na braised pork sandwich.  the bread tastes just like biscuits but the filling's saaaalty. if you look at the menu, you'll see \"<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>\" in a box which will make you think that's their specialty.  honestly, i hated it. 1/5\n\ntacos (carnitas, langosta, <mark>Viva China</mark>, pescado frito):\nthe carnitas came with pork rinds on top but the pork in the taco was dripping in oil.  just let the oil drip off your taco and you're all set. great taco variety. 4/5\n\n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>:\n4 steamed bbq pork buns. yep, that's all i can say about that.  nothing special. 3/5\n\nlucky six siu mai:\n2 scallop siu mai, 2 beef siu mai and 2 traditional siu mai topped with itty bitty pieces of gold leaf. 3/5\n\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with mole:\ni wanted fries with my sandwich.  i had to pick between mole and <mark>XO Sauce</mark>.  fries + <mark>XO Sauce</mark> just doesn't seem appetizing so i went with mole.  the mole was overpowering.  there was a scant amount of mexican cream and queso fresco.  i can usually finish an order of fries but not this one. 2/5\n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> with chorizo:\nagain, nothing special. 3/5\n\nmango sticky rice:\nthis was the best thing on the menu.  instead of using sticky rice, they used puffed rice so you get that nice crunch with a nice creamy coconut sauce and semi-sweet mangoes. 5/5\n\nchocolate terra cotta warriors:\nthe name \"warriors\" is misleading because you only get one warrior made of chocolate filled with chocolate mousse on top of cookie crumbs and ginger ice cream.  it looks like something just died on my plate complete with dirt and flowers.  the presentation was just too funny but this chocoholic wasn't 100% pleased with the taste but the creativity was there. 4/5\n\ncajeta flan:\na flan made with goat's milk served with salted caramel ice cream and pineapple chunks.  the flan was mild and the salted caramel ice cream was just lovely. 4/5\n\nso why 3 stars?  for the amount and type of food you get vs. the price, not worth it.  it's like they grabbed the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> from viva zapatas, steamed bbq pork buns and siu mai from spring mountain, fish tacos from rubio's for like $3 each and decided to serve it to you for double or triple the price.  part of what makes chinese and mexican food great is that they're inexpensive.", 
            "definitely get the addictive <mark>Lotus Chips</mark> and playful, flavorful silencio (ha!) duck tongue taco. the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco with oyster and beef tendon wasn't bursting with flavor, and the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> steamed buns were dry and would have benefitted from more filling. and if you're feeling lucky, cross your fingers that a sampler of dumplings accidentally gets dropped at your table by a server who immediately disappears, because it's going to be your favorite dish of the night.\n\nthe changing wall art of iconic/iconoclast figures gives the small space a lot of personality, and i just loved the warm colors and rustic feel. it's vegas, so it's a little bit put-on, but isn't everything?", 
            "really really really wanted to love this. i came in with high expectations, especially because i am a fan of jose andres's style. he is creative and has a vision that is unique in the restaurant world. the kitchen needs to see his same vision. \n\nthe layout of the restaurant is stunning. two bars upon entry (left and right) and your in direct sight of the dimsum preparation and steamers. there are creative cocktails to choose from, & the bar has an embedded part of the design to hold a spoon...then dissapointment began. \nwithout being longwinded,  salty! over priced! really dissapointing! \n\nthis was the order: <mark>Viva China</mark>* soft beef tendon/ kumamoto oysters/scallions/ sichuan peppercorn sauce -- it was one tiny taco, this was my only tasty thing but the price was a serious turn off for the size. pescado frito fried fish/ ancho chile pickled onions taco-- again just okay, doesn't justify the cost. beef 6pc beef/lime/ daikon/ watermelon radish --dimsum, i've had better. and the clincher <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> 8 pc shrimp/sweet black garlic/roasted poblano peppers--salty\n\ni don't know if the kitchen was off that day but i rarely send things back and the salt content was so powerful we just had to say something. we got the dish made fresh again and sad to say, nothing changed.\n\nour bill was approximately $110 and it left us starved for a second meal that wasn't going to leave us with high blood pressure. i understand that good quality will justify higher priced cuisine but these portion sizes were abnoxious. they should even slightly up the price and give us two tacos instead! eating with your eyes is the first step to the dining experience and that left us hungry. \n\ni will definitely continue to visit jose andres's other projects but will stay away from china poblano in the cosmo when blue ribbon sushi satisfies me a lot more in the same price range!!", 
            "while i was skeptical of the whole fusion concept, some of the dishes were pretty inventive, i'll give them that!\n\nthe <mark>Viva China</mark> (oysters + soft beef tendon+ peppercorn sauce) taco was quite tasty as was the huitlacoche noodles with mushrooms and mexican corn truffles. the best cold dish has to be the palmitos (hearts of palm + grapefruit salad) which was ideal to combat the vegas heat. \n\nno matter what the server suggests, the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> (shrimp + fermented garlic sauce) is not worth it for the tiny bits of shrimp. it's something a chinese mama could make for a lot less. \n\ndrinks were amazing; mexican mojitos, mimosas and what have you. they do magic with mezcal here!\n\nfor what it is, this resto does solid lunch and dinners, and the drinks aren't too bad. drop in if you're stuck outside marquee or just for a quick bite before checking into your room.", 
            "my friends and i decided to eat here for dinner before heading to marquee which was nice because the restaurant was straight across from the entrance. my boyfriend and i got some tacos and only one stood out.... i think it was called <mark>Viva China</mark>. other then that the food was meh.... the famous <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> was just ok... \n\nalso... unless you love vinager, do not order the huitlacoche noodles! my friend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> this dish and she mixed it, tried it, hated it... passed it around and we all tried it and it literally tasted like stuff soaked in vinegar. she told the waiter that she did not enjoy it and that we all tasted it and felt the same and the waiter told the manger who came by our table. the manager asked my friend, did you mix it?  and she said yes and he said something a long the lines of if you didn't know how to eat it, why did you order it and said there was nothing he could do.... really?!?!?!?!? we were a party of like 16 spending a lot of money at your restaurant and he said he couldnt do anything for us???? wow.... \n\n2 stars for convenience being right across from where we had to be/getting reservations for a large party 2 hours before showing up.... and 1 star for the <mark>Viva China</mark>... but i'd rather give 0 stars for the horrible customer service.", 
            "we were seated pretty quickly as a table for 7 at 7pm without having a reservation by two very hospitable staff. after 4 days in vegas, the first positive vibe i picked up on was that the front of house staff were very humble, gracious and genuine - a welcome change to the a few of the other restaurants we ate at. \n\ndespite the warm welcome, we were left sitting without a visit from a server for at least 10 minutes. and at most restaurants, this would be fine if not just slightly annoying. but here's why it was a much bigger problem at china poblano: the menu and how/what you should order isn't easily decipherable without a bit of guidance (or having been there before). \n\ni'd suggest to the managers of cp to have the staff who seats you stick around for an extra :15 and give a one or two line spiel on how the menu is divided, portion sizes, what's shareable/not shareable, and recommended quantity of order per person. we all started to confuse each other and actually started to discuss leaving to go to somewhere that was a bit easier on our we're-in-vacation-mode brains. \n\nour server came by just in time before we left and explained how it all worked, but then left and proceeded to give us another 10 minutes to ponder our life as well as our food order. he didn't take a drink order. so in the end, we sat for 20 minutes before we even get a drink order in. it's almost impossible to sit anywhere in vegas for that long without being offered a drink. \n\norders go in and the food starts rolling out pretty much immediately. highlights for me were:\n\n- <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>\n- lucky 6 siu mai\n- gan pung ji chicken (table fave)\n- carnitas taco\n- chipotle salsa\n\nlowlights:\n\n- <mark>Viva China</mark> taco\n- lamb pot stickers \n- guacamole (tasty enough, but poor value)\n\nthere were a few mix-ups with the service - some people didn't get their tacos till the rest of the table was pretty much done their food. i chalked that up to the shared-plates approach, but a bit more attention could have easily saved one upset and ignored diner. we were also missing a side of the \"monk chilli sauce\" which was or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> because we were - and still are - very curious as to wtf it would actually be. \n\nloved the decor of the restaurant and felt that the music was very well selected. not really sure about the choice to project a picture of frida kahlo up at the same time as chairman mao. when you take into account his political decisions were responsible for like 40-70 million unnecessary deaths,...  maybe it's art or irony, i dunno. it certainly sparked a conversation at the table where we concluded that the designer was probably more into the superficiality of the icon of mao, like che, rather than the politics and the fact that he's pretty much one of the greatest modern mass mur<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>. and we're looking at him while eating. in las vegas. ok, maybe it is irony. unintentional irony? moving along...\n\ntl;dr version: interesting spot, food was generally tasty, i found it priced pretty reasonably with a few exceptions. the menu could use a bit more explanation - ideally, immediately upon arrival - and the table service could be a bit tighter and attentive. \n\ni also think this menu would benefit from being slimmed down by a few items, and then perhaps divided by portion size.", 
            "china poblano is a bright, fun, casual restaurant. seriously, it is a carpeted wall away from being an ecstasy-lover's dream. chinese and mexican small plates is the name of the game here. they have a healthy list of tacos. being a self-appointed taco aficionado, this was a welcomed sight. unfortunately, the two i tried (<mark>Viva China</mark> & carnitas) missed a mark a bit, but were still solid. however, when you are dropping five bucks on a taco, you are looking for a bulls-eye. the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>, on the other hand, was dynamite. i am not a huge ceviche fan, but the server recommended it, so we gave it a whirl. marcus was dead-on with this suggestion. we also tried the 20 vegatable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, which was alright. overall, the dishes were interesting and varied in tastiness. the food was quality and intriguing enough to warrant another visit sometime in the future.", 
            "i discovered this restaurant after viewing a recommendation by anthony bourdain, so while a friend was in town we decided to come check it out. it's located inside the cosmopolitan hotel which is one of my favorite places on the strip. upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly hostess and offered our choice of the bar (which allows you to watch them work on tortillas from the open kitchen) or a table.  i felt for vegas fine dining this place was pretty affordable.\nmiller d was our server he was quick to greet us with a smile and i believe could tell we were unclear on if we should try a drink. he recommended the sueno cocktail which comes with a spicy salt rim. he was kind enough to do half/half in case we were a fan of the spicy kick it offered. both my friend and i really enjoyed the drink.\n\nthe main thing i was dying to try was this taco that i read about called the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco , but we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a <mark>Happy Family Jiaozi</mark>  (delicious pot stickers with amazing flavoring)and <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> ( fried pork buns) and some <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles(cold noodle dish with avocado and jicama for an interesting twist). overall i loved everything except that taco i wanted so badly to try. when it first arrived i took a bite of the beef tendon alone and it was delicious but when taking a bite of the taco all together with the oyster on top i felt like the ocean had thrown up in my mouth. it just wasn't a good combo for my pallet. maybe i got a bad oyster i don't know but overall it was an experience i will not quickly forget.\n\neveryone at the restaurant was super friendly and our drinks were always full. the only reason i have to deduct a star is i somehow was overcharged $20 on my bill. thankfully my friend encouraged me to keep my receipt and i am dealing with that situation but i definitely feel like this place is worth checking out! i left feeling satisfied and excited to go back to try some more cool fusions.", 
            "i'm really surprised this place has only three stars. the boy and i came here on our last night in vegas and it was easily the best meal we'd had all weekend. since i imagine a lot of vacationers are frequenting this spot, i'll break down what we had:\n\nsalt and <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>: probably the best margarita i've ever had\n\ntaro chips: unbelievable. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> these for our ceviche, but i was gobbling them up on their own. insanely crisp and delicious.\n\n<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>: delicious. and quite a large portion for the price. the only complaint i might have is that by the bottom of the bowl, the tuna was completely overpowered by the dregs of citrus juice, but to be fair we ate this quite slowly interspersed with other dishes. might've had more time than normal for the tuna to get over marinated.\n\nsiu mai w/ <mark>Quail Egg</mark>: the best dish of the night, and easily the best siu mai i've ever had. and trust me, i live in queens in nyc, i know my asian food. the meat was soft, insanely flavorful, and the eggs just bursts with a creamy eggy-ness in your mouth.\n\npork buns (<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>): disappointing. i wouldn't be able to tell the difference between these and any old pork bun i come across. not necessarily bad, but not great.\n\nduck tongue taco (silencio): i am a fan of trying absolutely anything and everything, but this was just downright weird. i commend them for getting the tongue that soft, but the flavor wasn't appealing. \n\nbeef tendon taco (<mark>Viva China</mark>): outstanding. the beef tendon is crispy and packs an amazing amount of flavor. the sauce is delicious. \n\ncarnitas taco: my absolute favorite. i've never had such good meat in a carnitas taco. \n\ntwenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>: this one was interesting. first of all, i should mention that my boyfriend can't stand onions, so i sadly had to get this sans any kind of onions or scallions. i bet that would really add to the flavor. however, even without onions, this dish got a hold of me. at first i thought \"meh, it's <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>,\" but with each subsequent bite, i began to realize, \"wait, this is the best <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> i've ever had.\" every bite had a new vegetable. and the boy literally licked the bowl clean. \n\nchocolate teracotta warrior: really, we got this because we wanted our special dinner to end with some kind of dessert. the presentation is stunning, and the ginger ice cream mixed with the chocolate crumbles is delicious, but i could've done without this one. i have a feeling their other desserts are probably better.\n\nthe service throughout the meal was great, our waiter was very attentive and helpful in giving us tips on what we might want to order. and the vibe of the place was very nice. casual, but upscale. and not crowded. i would definitely come here again.", 
            "this is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in las vegas. every time i go, i tried to order something new exciting and different to me. i have my staples that i order every time such as the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco which includes crispy beef tendon and lightly poached oysters. delicious. the carnitas are very tender and flavorful, and served with a salsa cruda and pork rind on top. this visit my fiancee and i tried the steamed pork buns and <mark>Quail Egg</mark> shu mai for the first time, and both were immediate favorites! the buns were filled with sweet and slightly spiced barbecue pork, perhaps a little too sweet, but the toothy chewy dough made a great balance. the shu mai is something i will order again and recommend heavily.. there was delicious and delicate minced filling in a tender dumpling with a just very slightly steamed <mark>Quail Egg</mark> nestled right in the top of each one. it made for one epic mouth experience, salty and creamy with an appealing texture. the agua fresca was a perfect compliment.", 
            "we were running late on a concert night at the cosmo and it was a rare show where we actually cared about the opening act, so time was of the essence.   while doing a yelp search from the elevator we decided upon china poblano as:\n\n1) \"tacos sound kinda good right now\"\n2) \"it's jose andres!   that dude's been on bourdain and top chef so he's legit\"\nand\n3) \"it gets 3 stars on yelp!  that means it's gotta be....   wait, 3 stars?!?\"  \n\nso we went anyway even though a straight up 3 is typically below my snooty yelp threshold of place to visit.   i'm glad we did.    we started by looking at some signature cocktails presented to us that arent on the main menu.   i wanted the aviation which has been one of my go-to drinks lately, and my lady friend wanted something i don't remember the name of, but it was something that didnt sound very \"manly\" like \"the snow willow\"   or \"the kitten's purr\"   it had cucumber as a main fixture and didn't sound appealing at all to me.    naturally my friend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> my drink for me and forced me to order the other one.   i tried both and all i'll say is, the aviation was delicious! quick wait service update:  after we put in the drink order, our waiter disappeared for what i felt was a long time.   we sat without drinks and without placing our order for i'd say a good 12 minutes.   we were definitely looking left and right for a trace of him as if we were trying to jaywalk across a busy intersection.   \n\nso given that we had a bit of a break, i went to yelp to try to find some recommendations.   i went with 4 tacos (they're small and i'm big).   and my dining companion went with <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark>.    as long as we had to wait to get our drinks and orders in, the wait for the food was exceptionally as short.   it seemed like only 5 minutes had passed before a few of my tacos from my order arrived, and only a few minutes after that the <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark> showed up.   \n\nfor my 2nd list of the review, here are all 4 tacos i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> and ate\n\n1)  lengua (beef tongue) -  delicious as beef tongue usually is.   melt in your mouth, well seasoned.  \n2)  <mark>Viva China</mark> (beef tendon/oysters) - disappointed in this one as the reviews seemed highly favorable.   i must admit i'm not a huge oyster fan, but to me the flavors of the oysters and the tendon just didn't co-mingle well.   \n3) carnitas - my favorite.   the pork was tender and delicious and i loved the contrast the crunch and flavor of the pork rinds provided.\n4) i cant find the 4th one i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> on the menu.   either that or i had too much of that cucumber drink and lost my mind accordingly.   it was some sort of beef short rib with some sort of chile i thought.   it was tasty and the chile brought a lot of smoky flavor to it.   it didn't really offer up anything unique enough for me to want to order it again though\n\noverall i was very happy with my meal of tacos as a whole.   the tortillas are made to order and taste fantastic.   we actually or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> some on the side to go with the <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark>.  as for that dish i thought i was a bit underwhelming.   the beef was flavorful and it tastes exactly how its described in the menu with the ginger/soy/vinegar components, but there just wasn't any extra oomph to justify spending nearly $20 on it.   the tacos, albeit small, are well worth the $5.50 a piece they generally command.   i like the idea that you could just come in here, grab a drink and a few tacos and be in and out in a reasonable time (if your waiter doesnt take an extended break like ours seemed to) for about $20, or go all out and share a bunch of dishes for an extravagant (and expensive) meal.   not many places, especially at the cosmo, give you that option.", 
            "if you read my review of jaleo, you will find that i love, love, love jose andres and everthing he touches. china poblano is one of my go-to restaurants every time my mom comes into town and asks me where i want to eat (i mean, it is pricy, so i only get to go on my mom's dime ;) ) everything is so delicious, the service is always on point, and both are consistent. \n\nyes, it is expensive (their menu is online available through the cosmopolitan website with all prices clearly listed). yes, the portions are small. yes, it is really more chinese food + mexican food than it is fusion (the food comes from two separate kitchens, after all). \n\nwe always try to order the more rare / odd items .. can't seem to bring myself to pay $14 for a tiny order of siu mai that would probably be better at a dirty hole in the wall dim sum restaurant (sidenote: can anyone recommend a good dim sum restaurant nearby?)\n\n--\nfavorite items:\nguacamole with <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> - $15. handmade at the table, deliciously chunky. bypass if trying to save money, get it if you're splurging\n\n<mark>Viva China</mark> taco - $5.50. rich, chewy, juicy, salty, gooey. bypass if you do not like foods with \"weird\" textures. \n\n<mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> - $12.88. pretty, deliciously crispy on the outside and moist, tender lamb on the inside. must have\n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - $12.88. love the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the sauce. could be spicier. have never had authentic dan dan noodles, so i could not tell you if these are authentic or not, but delicious nonetheless. must have. \n\n<mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> - $11.88. this is the biggest portion of hot and sour soup i've ever seen in my life. definitely meant for at least 4 people. not a traditional hot and sour soup. is pretty thick. very good. \n\ndiscontinued items?:\nthey had this chile-relleno type item once with pomegranate seeds on it. it did not look appetizing but was delicious. it looks like a frog with red warts on it. i no longer see it on the menu so it may have been a special, but if you see it, i recommend it!\n\nthey also used to have scallop ceviche - super untraditional and really expensive for what you are getting, but really fun. tiny little lime with a slice of raw scallop and some brown sugar in between. sprayed with tequila. you are meant to pop the scallop in your mouth and bite into the lime in one fell swoop. i no longer see it on the menu, though. \n--\ndrinks:\n<mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> - $14. what fun! yummy, boozy fun. \n<mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark> - $15 / glass. yummy, but be careful, it's pretty spicy! \n--\n\nnot such a fan of:\nthey always push the 20-vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> because johnny iuzzini said it was his favorite dish on the show \"best thing i ever ate.\" i find it bland, boring, and wayyyyy overpriced.\n\ndancing eggplant - really pretty! i don't really like eggplant in general, though. \n--\n\ncons about the restaurant itself:\nthe restaurant is literally right outside of marquee. at lunch in the summer, it's overrun by trashy girls in swimsuits without coverups and douchey bros trying to get into the dayclub. at dinner time, it's overrun by girls in skimpy dresses wobbling in their heels and douchey bros with popped collars trying to get into the nightclub. luckily, if you have a reservation, you never have to wait for long, and sometimes they will have you wait inside on the steps rather than out in the throng. \n\nthe chairs in the middle of the restaurant have no backs. i'm a sloucher anyway, but sometimes after a big meal you want to lean back and pat your belly, but if you try to do that you will just topple over. there are no purse hooks under the table, and since the chairs don't have backs, you either have to hold your bag in your lap or, if you are lucky enough to be a group with an odd number of people, on the spare seat.", 
            "expensive !!!\nexpect to be paying about $5.50-$10 for one taco.\n\ni mean don't get me wrong, the tacos are pretty good, but dammm its expensive for such a small portion. they don't even use special taco shells, its just regular tortilla tacos.\n\n<mark>Viva China</mark> taco\n(beef tendon/kumamoto oysters) $5.50\n\nthis taco was really unique. the beef tendon was dried and had the texture of really thin beef jerky. it was glazed in an asian flavor sauce. served with one semi-raw oyster and seaweed. it was different but good.\n\ncarnitas taco $5.50\n(braised baby pig, pork rinds, spicy salsa verde cruda)\n\nthis taco was basically filled with pulled pork. topped with a spicy salsa that resembled spicy guacamole with chopped onions. then two small pieces of pork rinds. it was good as well.\n\n18 <mark>18 Monk Noodle</mark> $14.88\n(hand cut wheat noodles, shiitake, crispy sweet potato, soy sauce)\n\nhonestly, these noodles were kind of disgusting. first of all, it was a really tiny portion served in a large bowl. the noodles were completely over-sauced and drenched in soy sauce which made it salty. it was definitely not worth the price tag and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone!\n\noverall, we bought one bowl of noodles, and three tacos, and the bill came out to about $50. not coming back here again.", 
            "if it is authenticity you are looking for, obviously, you are setting yourself up for failure the second you step into this beautiful fusion restaurant. however, as a quintessential angeleno, i much much more prefer fusion rather than those so-called authentic food. and china poblano is the very reason why: it combines the distinctive taste of both worlds. plus, it's jos\\u00e9 andr\\u00e9s (see my reviews on \"saam\" or \"jaleo!!\") \n\nso, after bf and i sat down, without any hesitation, we immediately or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> \"<mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark>.\" on an average meal, we each can drink 2 to 4 cocktails easily, and $32 for 4 cocktails that's paired with the dishes we are about to order? who in their right mind would've missed that?\n\nas for food, we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>: langosta (seared lobster taco, i love how they served this dish out first and the grapefruit on the taco worked like an \"amouse bouche\" and ) <mark>Viva China</mark> (beef tendon/kumamoto oysters taco, the thinly sliced tendon was deep fried to the point like ultra thinned cristino! ) <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> (this is probably bf and my favorite of the entire meal; juicy minced lamb wrapped inside of dumplings that's topped with crispy fried pancake. an absolute culinary success,) traditional siu mai (with edible gold on top,) <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> (i love how surprisingly spicy this noodle dish was,) <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> (my favorite second dish, not to be confused with jaleo's garlic shrimp, the mojo sauce was actually blacken,) tres leches cake (by far the best tres leches i've ever tasted, and trust me i've tasted tons of them,) and churros (this dish was served fresh, so when i bit into the churro i can taste the exterior crunchiness as well as the soft and moist interior, not to mention they were served with a cup of hot chocolate as dipping sauce.)\n\nchina poblano embodies attentive and friendly staffs, delicious food, drinks, and dessert, plus, modern and \"fusionized\" d\\u00e9cor. it also was the first restaurant we went to after we arrived and checked into cosmopolitan. thus, the impeccable dining experience at china poblano set the bar up pretty high for the rest of this trip. if i do have to nitpick, i only wish they had more items on their menu. please be advised this place serves \"tapas style.\" i honestly do not think it's fair for people to give it such a low rating based on the size of the portion.\n\ni truly hope for those who haven't experienced china poblano's uniqueness would give it a try. as for bf and me, we cannot wait to go back to cosmopolitan again and pay this cute place another visit!!", 
            "i was intriged by the concept of this restaurant, chinese and mexican but not fusion only two cuisines sharing the same room but is unavoidable like anything else that you put together for a long period of time it will eventually somehow mix to create some kind of a new twist of the two....enter the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco.\n <mark>Viva China</mark> taco, beef tendon and kumamoto oysters is one item that i found that had some kind of asian and mexican mix. i thought it was ok, the tendons are thinly sliced and fried and raw oysters placed on top. te texture was not what i expected though, soft on the outside, crispy and crunchy on the inside...next!\n silencio tacos, made with duck tongue, another chinese delicacy that talked its way into the tortilla,  tasty and sweet because of the fresh lychee that tops the taco but nothing too memorable, something i would only eat once in a lifetime and now is done and over with. \nafter the less than stellar appearances of the <mark>Viva China</mark> and silencio tacos i decided to stick with the tried and true. i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the carnitas, baby braised pork topped with chicharrones and a green sauce, also i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the baja style fish taco which ended up being the best of the tacos i tried that night but at 6.50 a taco it was expected, those two bites had better be packed with memories. \nthis may be a chinese and mexican restaurant, two of the most economic cuisines, but being this another creation by the famous spanish chef jose andres, be prepared to drop a heavy peseta.\nservice was awesome, everyone from the hostes to the servers were very attentive and efficient...definitely not chinese service. the room is nicely decorated, very modern, very colorful and fun, not the typical mexican sombrero on the wall...it is more of an asian theme. \n next time i'm here i'll try some of their chinese dishes or maybe i'll try some of the other mexican plates or why not, i might just be in the mood for some chinacan and order both.", 
            "upon entering this welcome dojo of culinary flair i was welcomed by the gm on the floor as he could sense my haste. i was sat directly at the high top bar on the right of the entrance front and center(ish). i enjoy sitting here as you get to feel the heat from the center burners and watch your meal being prepared (depending on what you order).  you also have front row seats to how they prepare their fresh guacamole. it's a lot of fresh avocados and a whole lot of smashing / whisking. i usually order tacos as they fire quick and the flavor profiles are robust. this trip i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> two silencio (duck tongue with lychee) and one <mark>Viva China</mark> (beef tendon with an oyster). the flavors of the duck tongue and lychee compliment each other quick nicely and leave me craving more. the beef tendon has a very intricate prep where each bite you take (3 should be norm) you are left with thin crispy salty crunch bombs that are mixed with the oyster's natural sea water flavor.  overall extremely umami and it's hard for me to order anything else when i come back....and i will."

            "had an amazing lunch here.  first off the decor is really neat.  you can sit at tables or one of two bars.  we sat at one of the bars and were able to watch the ladies make the dim sum.  our waiter was really nice and helpful, he walked us through the menu, explaining that the food was not fusion, it was just both mexican and chinese.  i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>.  i am very picky about margaritas and i must say that this was the best one i have ever had.  the salt foam was fantastic.  ok, so yes, the food is expensive but it is delicious, and its from a celebrity chef at a las vegas restaurant so what do you expect.  i still think it is worth the high price.  my husband and i each or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a taco and shared two appetizers.  this was a perfect amount of food.  we each loved our tacos, i had the <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> which was awesome, kinda like a gourmet breakfast burrito.  my husband had the silencio, which was a duck tongue taco, he said it was great and the tongues had perfect texture.  we shared the <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> dim sum which was a good steamed pork bun.  we also had the chilaquiles, it was great and even better since we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a side of habanero salsa, it was super spicy and awesome.  i would eat here again for sure!", 
            "there's no mexican-asian fusion going on in this restaurant, except that the 2 menus and decor are intertwined. it's almost like someone could not decide if they wanted to open a mexican restaurant or chinese restaurant, so they decide to open both in the same space, with separate kitchens. i love both mexican food and chinese food, but this is neither here nor there. two cuisines that are normally best in a hole-in-the wall spot, and inexpensive - this is just the opposite: overpriced and mediocre.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> everything family style and tried to get a good mix of both mexican & chinese food:\n\n<mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark> ($15) - i liked this margarita a lot. i don't care for the taste of tequila, and the blood orange seemed to mask this well. it had a spicy kick to it, but not so spicy that it was undrinkable.\n\nguacamole & chips ($15) - handmade, and delicious, but the price is about double what i would expect to pay for fresh guacamole. chips were light, crispy and fresh.\n\ntacos (about $5 each) - i'm used to dollar tacos (maybe $2) at a taco truck. i got the <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> and it was good, but unless i'm expensing my meal to work, i would pass on this - much too expensive for tacos.\n\n<mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> ($12.88) - 6 pieces - this was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. the lamb inside was tasty and i liked the crispy lace (sweet onions) design on the dish. would recommend this.\n\nsui mai ($13.88) - 6 pieces - the only cool thing about this were the gold flakes on top. the rest was just okay, and tasted heavy on the ginger. at a normal dim sum restaurant, you can get 4 sui mai's for $4 that taste better.\n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> ($12) - wheat noodles and spicy pork sauce - this was definitely spicy, nothing that blew me away though. at least the price was reasonable for the portion-size.\n\ncol de bruselas ($12) - these are on the acidic side - tasted really limey. i wouldn't get this again.\n\n<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> ($18) - 8 pieces of shrimp = $2.25 per piece of shrimp. sauce was good, not too spicy, this was one of the better dishes we had.\n\nbistec con mole amarillo y hongos ($20) - grilled hanger steak with mole - there were about 6 sliced pieces of steak - again, with the small portions. it was one of the better tasting dishes we had, but expensive.\n\nall in all, it's an interesting concept and i was there for work so i was able to expense my meal. with tip and tax, it was $60 per person - quite honestly, i would rather eat at a mexican food truck or a hole-in-the-wall chinese place for 1/4 of the price and more authentic food. with so many other options in vegas, i'll be going elsewhere.", 
            "i think this will most likely be a letdown for most people. given the breadth of variety and quality of dining options in vegas, i would skip it. if you are a jose andres faithful and you just absolutely must, get the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>. \n\nfirst of all, the outside seating is not fun. you're basically sitting on glorified wooden crates and when we got up to leave everyone's rear was a little sore. this makes me sound like such a pansy. not a dealbreaker on it's own, but just a note. also, as others have mentioned, this restaurant is not a fusion restaurant. not a big deal if you don't expect it, but just know that there's definitely no culinary cultural mash up to be had here. \n\nanyway, i went with two friends and we were pretty hungry and pretty comprehensive in our order. we got an item from each section of the menu except for soups and salads, because that's what the real pansies order. here's what we got and what i thought.   \n\ntacos: <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> - i mean it's decent, but it's not what we were expecting. not anything special at all. also, teeny tiny. very little chorizo. i know the chorizo is calling your name but don't do it. you end up with a $5 mouthful of regret. pass. \n\ndim sum: <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> - ugh. i didn't plan on this review being such a downer, but if i'm being honest, this is another pass. this tasted fine, but it was a steamed pork bun! for $14! we love steamed pork buns so we went for it, but expected some tender fall off the bone flavorful magic for this price. but like, it was totally standard and not special at all. pass.  \n\nnoodles: <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - this was pretty good. i'm a fan and if i came back i would get this again. it had a nice kick to it and the noodles had a nice al dente texture. i need to note that even though this is the one thing i will vouch for, it was a little on the salty side. but i'd do it again. play. \n\nfrom china: twenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> - i am a sucker for any sort of endorsement ever. the waiter says travel channel liked it? yes, ok, yes please. and then out comes this extra small portion of <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> that is so not worth $20 and then you feel like, maybe the waiter played you like a fiddle. pass.\n\nfrom mexico: <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> - i really didn't like this at all but to be fair i'm in the .001% of the nations's population that doesn't particularly care for fries. also i never really like mole sauce because it feels misleading. you can't bill yourself as a chocolate sauce and not taste anything like chocolate. and sometimes i forget it doesn't taste chocolatey at all and i try it again and it's like ugh fleeced again. but that's neither here nor there. pass.\n\nin hindsight, this really makes it sound like i hated it. which i totally didn't, i was just very underwhelmed. as i'm originally from the dc area, i've tried several of jose andres' restaurants and have always been absolutely obsessed with all his creations. so maybe i've set the bar high because i've had such good things from his places before, or maybe i'm just extra judgey because i grew up eating both these cuisines so i've had much better at cheaper prices before? dunno. either way, despite being very hungry, all of us were just kind of like, meh, this is so not on par with his other restaurants. again, nothing is terrible, it's just not very good. i think it just isn't worth the prices when there are so many more incredible options just a few steps away down the strip.", 
            "as a vegas regular visitor i'd have to say this was easily in the top 3 most memorable and delicious lunches i've had on the strip at any price point. we got the 18 <mark>18 Monk Noodle</mark>, beef sui mai, <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> taco, pescado a la plancha taco and mango sticky rice and it was a nice sized meal for two. \n\nthe mango sticky rice was the standout - crispy rice puffs sprinkled over light fluffy cream, with ripe, cold mango chunks at the bottom\n\nthere was a 15 minute wait for a table for 2 on a holiday weekend saturday afternoon so very accessible.", 
            "my first unpleasant dining experience in vegas. \n\nservice was great but what's going on with the food, the pricing, and the portions. \n\nthe food started off great! chips included with the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> were delicious and fresh. the chipotle salsa not so much. \n\nthee 18 <mark>18 Monk Noodle</mark> was fine. noodles were very good but the soy sauce was way overpowering. \n\nmongolian beef wasn't great either. actually it was terrible besides the fact that the beef was cooked perfectly and served over romaine lettuce. the sauce was overpowering and not pleasant at all. \n\nthe tacos are expensive, bland, and contain little fillings  \n\n<mark>Tinga Poblana</mark>, carnitas tacos are very bland. the only thing you could taste is the corn tortilla. \n\nwe also had the spicy pork noodles. the sauce was not good at all and made me not want to continue eating. \n\noverall a very expensive, bland and unpleasant dining experience. \n\ni would strongly suggest you not waste your money here.", 
            "overall disappointed. the portion sizes were terrible for the price and the bartender (since we sat at the bar) failed to tell us that the dish we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> and appetizer would not be enough for a lunch for two. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the pigs on horseback due to its hype. they were definitely the best thing we had though they were on the dry side and lacked something i think a crisp vinegar style dipping sauce could have easily fixed. we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles which promised to be a light vegetarian dish to compliment our heavy pork break appetizer. the noodles came out and the whole dish was a little larger than my fist. more of a si<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>. it seemed like they had marinated everything in sesame oil and had little other flavor. since we were still hungry we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a couple of tacos thinking the other side of the menu would be good. wrong. the <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> was really flavorless and the cochinita was even worse. the pork had a bland dipped-in-a1 taste and the onions didn't add anything to the dish other than filler that distracted me from the taco. the service was terrible. our bartender was attentive to our waters but failed to help us decide anything and generally acted aloof and a bit shady. the decor was enjoyable and the idea i think is awesome. i really hope they step their game up. probably the worst restaurant to eat at in the cosmo. i will not be returning."

            "my husband and i spent a lot of time at the aria when we were in vegas last.  for dinner before a show we ended up at china poblano intrigued by the combination of two of our favorite foods.  after all, what could be better than a restaurant that serves both chinese and mexican food?  how amazing would it be to gorge myself on salsa and crab wontons?  \n\ni was a little disappointed in our magical adventure into chinese/mexican fusion, mostly because the mexican far outshined the chinese.  we enjoyed the fresh made chips, salsa, various tacos, and homemade margarita mix.  in my opinion, the number one item on the menu was the <mark>Refried Bean Taco</mark>.  whatever they did to the refried beans made them super smooth and full of flavor, i actually ended up ordering another after my first.  \n\nthe chinese portion of our meal fell very short.  usually one of our favorite dishes, the hot and sour soup was so gelatinous that we barely even ate any and the pork buns lacked flavor and were not cooked well.  \n\noverall it isn't a place i would visit if it were in my hometown and we definitely wont go back on our next trip to vegas.", 
            "stopped in here to munch before having cocktails at the chandalier. <mark>Lotus Chips</mark> and habanero salsa are a match made in heaven. fish tacos and <mark>Refried Bean Taco</mark> were good... glass noodle salad is refreshing but overpriced and not filling.\n\nthis is tapas style, so be prepared to order a lot to feel satisfied... which gets pricey ( but it's vegas, so you knew that, right?) great snacks or appetizer option before hitting the town!", 
            "we loved china polano!!  it was perfect for our group of 4.  we thought it would be a fusion of chinese and latin foods, but it was pretty much split down the middle of half chinese foods and half latin foods.  we went for the pork, ribs and <mark>Refried Bean Taco</mark> (loved them all, especially the pork and <mark>Refried Bean Taco</mark>!).  our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs because we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the fresh guacamole and chips, beans, cheese, chips, pork bao, and the mongolian beef.  there were lots of ooos and ahhs from our table as these foods were comforting and all so tasty!  we were so impressed!  i can't wait to come back here again next time i am in vegas!!",

            "first trip to vegas in 18 years.  we ate here twice during our stay.  i am mostly vegan and this place had a nice variety of vegetarian food.  first night we had the guacamole and chips.  crazy good.  guacamole is made fresh.  or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> again the second time.  i had a black <mark>Refried Bean Taco</mark> and <mark>Open Sesame</mark> noodles the first night. my husband had a pork taco and the hot and sour soup.  everything was so good.  the second time i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a fish taco and 18 <mark>18 Monk Noodle</mark>. amazing!  the noodles were hand cut.  my husband got the mongolian beef salad.  we rave about this place.  our servers were so friendly. miller and megan.  thank you!", 
            "outstanding service, ambiance and vegetarian food options. i had lunch and dinner here. they have a separate vegetarian menu and can accommodate vegans and those who don't want eggs. they have fresh fruit based drinks (aqua frescas) that change daily - be sure to try this. they guacamole is made fresh & was very good. the <mark>Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll</mark> are very good - not very oily & with a good variety of vegetables. the tacos are unique, soft  wrapped, light & full of flavor. i enjoyed both the hongos taco & the <mark>Refried Bean Taco</mark>. the chips are cooked in the morning in vegetable oil before any meat items are cooked. finally, the terra cotta chocolate desert was very good. bottom line - great vegetarian food with taste & creativity. the service was very very good. the atmosphere is nice. for a party of 2, i would get 2 tacos, the <mark>Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll</mark>, & the guacamole, adding on another taco or two if hungry, along with the aqua fresca."

            "i discovered this restaurant after viewing a recommendation by anthony bourdain, so while a friend was in town we decided to come check it out. it's located inside the cosmopolitan hotel which is one of my favorite places on the strip. upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly hostess and offered our choice of the bar (which allows you to watch them work on tortillas from the open kitchen) or a table.  i felt for vegas fine dining this place was pretty affordable.\nmiller d was our server he was quick to greet us with a smile and i believe could tell we were unclear on if we should try a drink. he recommended the sueno cocktail which comes with a spicy salt rim. he was kind enough to do half/half in case we were a fan of the spicy kick it offered. both my friend and i really enjoyed the drink.\n\nthe main thing i was dying to try was this taco that i read about called the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco , but we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a <mark>Happy Family Jiaozi</mark>  (delicious pot stickers with amazing flavoring)and <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> ( fried pork buns) and some <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles(cold noodle dish with avocado and jicama for an interesting twist). overall i loved everything except that taco i wanted so badly to try. when it first arrived i took a bite of the beef tendon alone and it was delicious but when taking a bite of the taco all together with the oyster on top i felt like the ocean had thrown up in my mouth. it just wasn't a good combo for my pallet. maybe i got a bad oyster i don't know but overall it was an experience i will not quickly forget.\n\neveryone at the restaurant was super friendly and our drinks were always full. the only reason i have to deduct a star is i somehow was overcharged $20 on my bill. thankfully my friend encouraged me to keep my receipt and i am dealing with that situation but i definitely feel like this place is worth checking out! i left feeling satisfied and excited to go back to try some more cool fusions."

            "went here close to a month ago and just getting around to posting a review. we've tried several other restaurants at the cosmo and have become fans of the resort and it's food offerings. <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark> started off not so great, with the hostess service a bit frenzied and disorganized. there was no one at the hostess area and a bunch of us milling by the entrance not sure what was going on. once seated, everything changed. the server was awesome...cheerful, knowledgeable and attentive. the service seemed a bit rushed at times. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> six different things and the time in between servings was sometimes not enough. i have no problem with the portions, which are on the small side and for the most part really aren't suitable for sharing unless you order a bunch of things.   i'm always about quality and not quantity, and the quality was excellent. these dishes, sauces, etc. aren't just slapped together. they are creative, complex and well executed. the prices for small plates is high, but again, cosmo on the strip, what do you expect.  now for the food: \n\n<mark>Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll</mark> - delicious, but nothing really set it apart from all the other good <mark>Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll</mark>. \n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - wheat noodles in a spicy pork sauce. omg. it's been a month and i still can't stop thinking about it. \n\n20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>. the price will blow you away, but have to say we really enjoyed it. the time and effort that goes into this dish is incredible and you can literally identify all 20 vegetables finely chopped in perfect proportions. \n\ncarnitas taco - awesome. the spicy verde cruda sauce...i asked for a side dish of it and almost drank it. \n\n<mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark>. had never tried pork belly, and the combination with pineapple was intriguing. good, but not my favorite. \n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> - outstanding, with a nice slightly burnt top to the cheese, perfect texture and great tortillas.\n\nthe beer was cold but could have been colder.\n\nwill definitely be back.",

            "i love oyamel and jaleo, so i was eager to see jose andres' latest creation, and i had really high expectations for china poblano.  i had this idea that mexican-chinese fusion would be the love child of two of my favorite restaurants, oyamel and myers+chang (a funky pan-asian restaurant in boston).  we decided to try the asian side of the menu at china poblano, after we realized that there weren't that many fusion dishes on the menu.\n\nthe good: the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> was great - the soy sauce did not make me think of sashimi at all! overall, it was a flavor combination that i wouldn't have thought of, and i liked the texture of the ceviche with the walnuts.  the monk's noodles had a nice texture, and i was pleasantly surprised by the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> - it really distinguished itself from your average <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>.  as far as drinks go, i had a margarita with sea salt \"foam\" (standard at oyamel, still tasty here).  the lemon drop with \"noodles\" was clever, and it tasted like your standard lemon drop.  yes, i bought into the cutesy presentation, and i enjoyed it.\n\nalso good: the service.  the host table seemed a bit confused but once we were seated, everyone was great.  our waitress had recommended the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> to us over the scallop ceviche, since she thought the scallop portion was too small, and i always like candor from the waitstaff.  there was also a mistake at the bar, and when she saw a drink about to go to waste she brought it over to me (yay!)  the entire staff was very attentive.\n\nthe bad: we had the \"<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\" pork steam buns, and something about the texture of the bao was off.  even worse though, the meat was underseasoned.  the same thing goes for the <mark>Ten Treasure</mark> noodle soup and the monk's noodles - they looked great but the broth was underwhelming.  it's difficult to get the broth just right (tampopo, anyone?) but if you can't, maybe you shouldn't offer so many noodle soups <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> menu.\n\ni'm willing to give china poblano the benefit of the doubt, as the restaurant was only two weeks old when we visited.  i will probably eat here again... but there are so many restaurants to try on the strip, so i'm not sure when or if i'll be back.  the bottom line is, jose andres does a fantastic job with mexican cuisine and tapas, so if you're going to visit, maybe that's what you should stick with.  my visit to china poblano just left me craving a visit to myers+chang and oyamel.  i didn't take the ceviche and tacos at oyamel for granted before, but i will certainly appreciate them a lot more on my next visit.", 
            "let down. \n\nthe concept is basically glorifying street food from china and mexico, and by glorifying i mean marking the price up 200% and decreasing the size portions to basically nibbles.  the funny thing is, the whole concept behind street food is that it is really good and really cheap and you don't have to pay $4 for a taco the size of your pinky for it to be delicious. this place turns that truth on its head by doing exactly the opposite -- charging you a ton of money for mediocre \"tastes\" of food. i couldn't help but feel like the owners of this place are bleeding the patrons white, that is the bottom line people.  \n\nfor the price of food and all the press i was expecting this place to be upscale.  it's not that either. avoid at all costs.  \n\n**this review is based upon trying the following:\n--pomegranate margarita (didn't like at all, too tart)\n--<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\n--dan dan noodles\n--lengua tacos\n--pork belly tacos with pineapple\n--carnitas\n\ncan you believe all of this was $100+? avoid. \n\n**disclosure: i am a big jose andres fan, live in dc, and eat at all his restaurants.",

            "i like jose andres, chinese food and mexican food.  put them all together you'd get something spectacular, right?  well, at least that's i hoped for.\n\nthe service at china poblano was good.  i loved the interior.  images of mao, frida kahlo, the dalai lama, etc. projected on screen on the walls - nice touch.\n\ni had the <mark>Jasmine Downy Pearls</mark> tea and it was amazing.  it was fragrant and it tasted good.  it was a neat idea that they give you a timer so you get to enjoy the perfect tea whether you like it mild, medium or strong.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a bun of different things from the menu:\n\n<mark>Golden Pigs</mark>:\n4 fried bbq pork buns with a side of condensed milk.  dipping pork buns on condensed milk might seem pretty odd but it works.  sweet and savory just go well together.  5/5\n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>:\na braised pork sandwich.  the bread tastes just like biscuits but the filling's saaaalty. if you look at the menu, you'll see \"<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>\" in a box which will make you think that's their specialty.  honestly, i hated it. 1/5\n\ntacos (carnitas, langosta, <mark>Viva China</mark>, pescado frito):\nthe carnitas came with pork rinds on top but the pork in the taco was dripping in oil.  just let the oil drip off your taco and you're all set. great taco variety. 4/5\n\n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>:\n4 steamed bbq pork buns. yep, that's all i can say about that.  nothing special. 3/5\n\nlucky six siu mai:\n2 scallop siu mai, 2 beef siu mai and 2 traditional siu mai topped with itty bitty pieces of gold leaf. 3/5\n\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with mole:\ni wanted fries with my sandwich.  i had to pick between mole and <mark>XO Sauce</mark>.  fries + <mark>XO Sauce</mark> just doesn't seem appetizing so i went with mole.  the mole was overpowering.  there was a scant amount of mexican cream and queso fresco.  i can usually finish an order of fries but not this one. 2/5\n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> with chorizo:\nagain, nothing special. 3/5\n\nmango sticky rice:\nthis was the best thing on the menu.  instead of using sticky rice, they used puffed rice so you get that nice crunch with a nice creamy coconut sauce and semi-sweet mangoes. 5/5\n\nchocolate terra cotta warriors:\nthe name \"warriors\" is misleading because you only get one warrior made of chocolate filled with chocolate mousse on top of cookie crumbs and ginger ice cream.  it looks like something just died on my plate complete with dirt and flowers.  the presentation was just too funny but this chocoholic wasn't 100% pleased with the taste but the creativity was there. 4/5\n\ncajeta flan:\na flan made with goat's milk served with salted caramel ice cream and pineapple chunks.  the flan was mild and the salted caramel ice cream was just lovely. 4/5\n\nso why 3 stars?  for the amount and type of food you get vs. the price, not worth it.  it's like they grabbed the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> from viva zapatas, steamed bbq pork buns and siu mai from spring mountain, fish tacos from rubio's for like $3 each and decided to serve it to you for double or triple the price.  part of what makes chinese and mexican food great is that they're inexpensive.",

            "had an amazing lunch here.  first off the decor is really neat.  you can sit at tables or one of two bars.  we sat at one of the bars and were able to watch the ladies make the dim sum.  our waiter was really nice and helpful, he walked us through the menu, explaining that the food was not fusion, it was just both mexican and chinese.  i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>.  i am very picky about margaritas and i must say that this was the best one i have ever had.  the salt foam was fantastic.  ok, so yes, the food is expensive but it is delicious, and its from a celebrity chef at a las vegas restaurant so what do you expect.  i still think it is worth the high price.  my husband and i each or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a taco and shared two appetizers.  this was a perfect amount of food.  we each loved our tacos, i had the <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> which was awesome, kinda like a gourmet breakfast burrito.  my husband had the silencio, which was a duck tongue taco, he said it was great and the tongues had perfect texture.  we shared the <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> dim sum which was a good steamed pork bun.  we also had the chilaquiles, it was great and even better since we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a side of habanero salsa, it was super spicy and awesome.  i would eat here again for sure!", 
            "i think china poblano is a very solid 3 stars, i gave it a fourth star because our second visit was on the busiest night in vegas...nye and we had no reservation. they accommodated us quickly, although it was at the outside tables but that's fine by me...more people to watch. \nour server was great, i have no complaints about the service. \nmy husband & i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> chips & salsa which were great, good seasoned chips, salsa was smokey and far from any pico de gallo. we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> 4 tacos...2 fish, 1 cochinita (bbq pork) and 1 carnitas. we've had the fish tacos before and they were delish...this time they were totally different. the fish wasn't very battered, and the salsa was way different. definitely not as good this time around but still very decent. the other tacos were full of flavor but very small! we both said we could eat 4 more! so after the chips & salsa & 2 tacos each we were still hungry so we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> dim sum. a 4 piece order of <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> and they were a knock out. very good. \nnow, a part of me wants to take a star off because of the high prices. this dinner was over $70 and i really couldn't justify paying more than $35-$40. you can't call this a full dinner. it was more like a lite bite before a concert type thing. \nthe kicker was the 2 cokes my husband or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> during dinner. they came in glass bottles and are imported from mexico. i've seen them at my local grocery store...they sell them 10 for $10. for all of you yelpers that are not math geniuses, that's $1 ea. china poblano charges $5.88 each!! holy coca cola! $12 on two cokes?! that's a little unreal. in a separate visit we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>--as featured on one of those television food shows--and it was good not amazing. this is not a place i need to return to. but it's also not a place i would stay away from. although, i might smuggle in my own mexican coca cola next time.",

            "i think this will most likely be a letdown for most people. given the breadth of variety and quality of dining options in vegas, i would skip it. if you are a jose andres faithful and you just absolutely must, get the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>. \n\nfirst of all, the outside seating is not fun. you're basically sitting on glorified wooden crates and when we got up to leave everyone's rear was a little sore. this makes me sound like such a pansy. not a dealbreaker on it's own, but just a note. also, as others have mentioned, this restaurant is not a fusion restaurant. not a big deal if you don't expect it, but just know that there's definitely no culinary cultural mash up to be had here. \n\nanyway, i went with two friends and we were pretty hungry and pretty comprehensive in our order. we got an item from each section of the menu except for soups and salads, because that's what the real pansies order. here's what we got and what i thought.   \n\ntacos: <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> - i mean it's decent, but it's not what we were expecting. not anything special at all. also, teeny tiny. very little chorizo. i know the chorizo is calling your name but don't do it. you end up with a $5 mouthful of regret. pass. \n\ndim sum: <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> - ugh. i didn't plan on this review being such a downer, but if i'm being honest, this is another pass. this tasted fine, but it was a steamed pork bun! for $14! we love steamed pork buns so we went for it, but expected some tender fall off the bone flavorful magic for this price. but like, it was totally standard and not special at all. pass.  \n\nnoodles: <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - this was pretty good. i'm a fan and if i came back i would get this again. it had a nice kick to it and the noodles had a nice al dente texture. i need to note that even though this is the one thing i will vouch for, it was a little on the salty side. but i'd do it again. play. \n\nfrom china: twenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> - i am a sucker for any sort of endorsement ever. the waiter says travel channel liked it? yes, ok, yes please. and then out comes this extra small portion of <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> that is so not worth $20 and then you feel like, maybe the waiter played you like a fiddle. pass.\n\nfrom mexico: <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> - i really didn't like this at all but to be fair i'm in the .001% of the nations's population that doesn't particularly care for fries. also i never really like mole sauce because it feels misleading. you can't bill yourself as a chocolate sauce and not taste anything like chocolate. and sometimes i forget it doesn't taste chocolatey at all and i try it again and it's like ugh fleeced again. but that's neither here nor there. pass.\n\nin hindsight, this really makes it sound like i hated it. which i totally didn't, i was just very underwhelmed. as i'm originally from the dc area, i've tried several of jose andres' restaurants and have always been absolutely obsessed with all his creations. so maybe i've set the bar high because i've had such good things from his places before, or maybe i'm just extra judgey because i grew up eating both these cuisines so i've had much better at cheaper prices before? dunno. either way, despite being very hungry, all of us were just kind of like, meh, this is so not on par with his other restaurants. again, nothing is terrible, it's just not very good. i think it just isn't worth the prices when there are so many more incredible options just a few steps away down the strip.",

            "china poblano is my favorite restaurant in las vegas. i make a point to come here every time i'm there (i travel to vegas for work about 4 times a year).\n\nsummary (on a scale of 1 to 5 stars):\nfood: 5 stars\ndrinks: 5 stars\natmosphere: 5 stars\nservice: 5 stars\nprice: 4 stars\n\nthe food is a marriage of mexican and asian cuisine. it's unique, and it's delicious. my favorites are the guacamole (medium style has just the right amount of kick); <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> (steamed pork buns); <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> (shrimp with sweet black garlic and roasted poblano peppers); pork belly taco, lobster taco, <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>, and, the all-star, the chocolate terra cotta warrior. it's a chocolate mouse filled warrior-shaped chocolate with ginger ice cream, cookie crumbs, and caramelized banana. it is the most unique dessert i have ever had. yes, ever. you have to order it. and you won't be disappointed.\n\ndrinks: food: the margaritas are phenomenal. you should get a pitcher.\n\natmosphere: vibrant, lively, and fun. \n\nservice: 5 starts. all the servers i've had have been knowledgeable and attentive. food starts coming out almost right away and continues to come out as it's ready. the hostesses are friendly too.\n\nprice: it's not a cheap place, but it's worth the extra $ because the food is so good. just not a place to come if you're on a budget. definitely a place to come if you value a great meal.\n\ncan't wait for my next trip.", 
            "now ... at first blush this is kind of weird.  as you walk toward this place you see two windows ... one clearly offering mexican fare; the other offering asian.   you may see people seated outside, along with a hostess stand, and a single door into the dining area.  as you get closer, you can either order at the window (presumably carry out) or you can see the hostess to sit inside or outside the entrance.  wife and i sat outside.  here came the menu, and you can order (yes, that's right) mexican or asian) we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> ... ... fresh made guac and \"<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\" which are asian buns.  food was delicious, portions are adequate, not huge, but good tasting food.  would definitely go back to try more, particularly on a friday or saturday night around the witching hour for the nightclub as the people watching was worth paying for in and of itself.",

            "i really should have read the reviews before we stopped by. the food was not bad, but it was not great either. definitely overpriced for what we got. we tried the <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> pork buns, the lucky 6 siu mai, the <mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> hot and sour soup, and the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> with an order of homemade tortillas. the only items worth eating were the shrimp and the hot and sour soup. we made little shrimp tacos and it was actually tasty. the pork buns weren't too bad either. i ended up coming back to la and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> real dim sum since my experience here was so lackluster. the restaurant was confusing and i was not feeling the concept. i would honestly skip this place. there are so many better restaurants out there that i would not waste my calories here. not like i have been counting or anything, because i really have not. the staff was attentive though.."

            "really wonderful, adventurous casual dining on the strip.  \n\nwhile i am not a fan of the cosmopolitan's brand of chrome and disco decorating, i was immediately taken with the bright colors and fusion of elements in the china poblano restaurant.  immediately one becomes aware of two contrasting cuisines.  as you enter there are two bar areas where diners can watch various food preparations.  one side is devoted to mexican food and the other to chinese food.  \n\nthis dichotomy is reflected in the menu as well which is divided up largely by types of dishes and the two cuisines.  a closer look shows a comingling of cuisines within though.  \n\nthe 20 vegetable vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> was so yummy.  as full of vegetables as its name suggests.  the lamb pot stickers were served under a dome of incredibly thin and delicate pastry.  there was the hint of cumin lurking around the dish that was a beautiful almost haunting harmony with the delicious pot stickers.  one of my favorite dishes while i was in vegas!\n\nwe also enjoyed the guacamole and <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> (fried and steamed pork dumplings that were served with a sweet condensed milk sauce, a wonderful balance between sweet and salty flavors).\n\nfinally a jericalla which was described as an oaxacan chocolate custard with  passion fruit and chocolate sorbet.  this was an amazingly light and lovely dish.  beautifully layered as a parfait with solid chocolate in with the creamy elements and contrasting in texture.  just an amazing combination of tangy fruitiness and deep chocolate flavor.  really worthwhile.\n\nwhile this is slightly expensive for casual dining, the quality of ingredients, thoughtful food combinations, beautiful presentations and wonderful service made it a terrific choice for us.  i will brave the overstuffed glamor of the cosmopolitan for a repeat visit.", 
            "we atually avoided this place for a while, because the concept of chinese/mexican fusion seemed so alien to us! however, we were passing by and happened to see a bunch of dim sum steamers through the window and that totally changed our minds! we are suckers for dim sum. \n\nthe restaurant is a unique fusion of chinese and mexican cuisine and it does it right! the set up of the restaurant is unusual with bench \"comunal table\" type seating or bar style. the first thing we noticed was the very high prices, especially for dim sum!!! we come from la and the oc, where dim sum is plentiful and cheap. the dim sum menu here is pretty small, and many things are $13 a plate! that seemed crazy, but we thought it might be worth trying just once. and it was- we were not disappointed!\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>:\n-<mark>Golden Pigs</mark> (pork buns) which comes with in-house condensed milk for dipping. these are petite char sui bao that have been deep fried. it was very pricey but it comes with so much flavor and many layers of textures; from the crunchy outer layer to the soft insides to the sweet and salty porky center, all dipped in th sweet and creamy condensed milk sauce. it was a very fresh look at a classic dim sum dish.\n-chicken shumai. these were very small but very tasty and moist and full of flavor and topped with a goji berry. \n\nafter two dim sum dishes we decided to share an entre from the mexican side of the menu: shrimp with a pepper sauce. these were very tender and a bit spicy but good altogether. \n\nthe best part of it all, dessert! mango with sweet rice....the best we both have had anywhere!! it had a ton of flavor in every single bite. this restaurant is probably getting that 5th star just because of this amazing dessert. it is like nothing you have ever had, i promise. first, the rice is cooked in coconut milk and reduced to a near liquid, and is then whipped into a light and airy mousse like texture. at the center is a mound of icy, sweet, mango granitas and the whole thing is topped with cramalized rice crispies and chunks of mango.\n\nthe service was also very personalized. the wait staff and even the bar tender chimed in with their favorites when it was obvious we couldn't make up our minds. \n\ni'm not going to lie. the portions, at least of what we had, are somewhat small, and the price is high, but i think the quality and ingenuity of the fusion menu make this an experience not to be missed.", 
            "i like jose andres, chinese food and mexican food.  put them all together you'd get something spectacular, right?  well, at least that's i hoped for.\n\nthe service at china poblano was good.  i loved the interior.  images of mao, frida kahlo, the dalai lama, etc. projected on screen on the walls - nice touch.\n\ni had the <mark>Jasmine Downy Pearls</mark> tea and it was amazing.  it was fragrant and it tasted good.  it was a neat idea that they give you a timer so you get to enjoy the perfect tea whether you like it mild, medium or strong.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a bun of different things from the menu:\n\n<mark>Golden Pigs</mark>:\n4 fried bbq pork buns with a side of condensed milk.  dipping pork buns on condensed milk might seem pretty odd but it works.  sweet and savory just go well together.  5/5\n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>:\na braised pork sandwich.  the bread tastes just like biscuits but the filling's saaaalty. if you look at the menu, you'll see \"<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>\" in a box which will make you think that's their specialty.  honestly, i hated it. 1/5\n\ntacos (carnitas, langosta, <mark>Viva China</mark>, pescado frito):\nthe carnitas came with pork rinds on top but the pork in the taco was dripping in oil.  just let the oil drip off your taco and you're all set. great taco variety. 4/5\n\n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>:\n4 steamed bbq pork buns. yep, that's all i can say about that.  nothing special. 3/5\n\nlucky six siu mai:\n2 scallop siu mai, 2 beef siu mai and 2 traditional siu mai topped with itty bitty pieces of gold leaf. 3/5\n\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with mole:\ni wanted fries with my sandwich.  i had to pick between mole and <mark>XO Sauce</mark>.  fries + <mark>XO Sauce</mark> just doesn't seem appetizing so i went with mole.  the mole was overpowering.  there was a scant amount of mexican cream and queso fresco.  i can usually finish an order of fries but not this one. 2/5\n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> with chorizo:\nagain, nothing special. 3/5\n\nmango sticky rice:\nthis was the best thing on the menu.  instead of using sticky rice, they used puffed rice so you get that nice crunch with a nice creamy coconut sauce and semi-sweet mangoes. 5/5\n\nchocolate terra cotta warriors:\nthe name \"warriors\" is misleading because you only get one warrior made of chocolate filled with chocolate mousse on top of cookie crumbs and ginger ice cream.  it looks like something just died on my plate complete with dirt and flowers.  the presentation was just too funny but this chocoholic wasn't 100% pleased with the taste but the creativity was there. 4/5\n\ncajeta flan:\na flan made with goat's milk served with salted caramel ice cream and pineapple chunks.  the flan was mild and the salted caramel ice cream was just lovely. 4/5\n\nso why 3 stars?  for the amount and type of food you get vs. the price, not worth it.  it's like they grabbed the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> from viva zapatas, steamed bbq pork buns and siu mai from spring mountain, fish tacos from rubio's for like $3 each and decided to serve it to you for double or triple the price.  part of what makes chinese and mexican food great is that they're inexpensive.", 
            "definitely get the addictive <mark>Lotus Chips</mark> and playful, flavorful silencio (ha!) duck tongue taco. the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco with oyster and beef tendon wasn't bursting with flavor, and the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> steamed buns were dry and would have benefitted from more filling. and if you're feeling lucky, cross your fingers that a sampler of dumplings accidentally gets dropped at your table by a server who immediately disappears, because it's going to be your favorite dish of the night.\n\nthe changing wall art of iconic/iconoclast figures gives the small space a lot of personality, and i just loved the warm colors and rustic feel. it's vegas, so it's a little bit put-on, but isn't everything?",

            "i cannot believe china poblano has such a low rating.  i have always loved jose andres and have never been disappointed by any of his restaurants.  china poblano was no different and is now my favorite of all of his restaurants (i've previously been to zatinya, oyamel and jaleo in dc).  i went in december of 2012 while staying at the cosmopolitan.  it is a very casual place with a fun, relaxed vibe.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> (lightly fried bbq pork buns served with condensed milk) and har gau for appetizers.  my boyfriend was skeptical of the milk being served with the buns but they were delicious!  the perfect combination of sweet, savory and salty.  for our entrees we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> one carnitas and one lengua taco which were both perfect in every way.  the waitstaff was quick and friendly, the food amazing and the prices extremely reasonable for vegas.  i am returning to vegas in july and this is the first place i am seeking out for lunch.  i would highly suggestion that every one give it a try.  you will not be let down.", 
            "let me start by warning you it's very over priced. lol. 1 taco is at least $5.50 i think. food is kinda hit or mess. we had the cochinita taco, not bad but salty. the carnitas was way better. i believe that one is their best seller. we also shared the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark>. i was skeptical about eating a fried pork bun but it went really well with the condensed milk sauce. the other dish we tried was the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>. this dish was the most disappointing to me. the portion is pretty small, i didn't like the flavor and it was way too salty! we sat outside the restaurant and service was pretty good. they refilled water and kept checking on us and clearing plates. not sure i would go back for the food though. too pricey and not tasty enough when i feel like i can get better tacos and dim sum in cali for way cheaper.",

(both delicious.) i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> it comes four pieces and is a soft bread with bbq pork inside served with a side of condensed milk to dip it in.  sounds odd but the mix is delicious, we had the cochinita taco and the chorizo fundido which comes with fresh tortillas the quesidilla chicarron was good too.\n\nmy one complaint would be the imported coca cola from mexica at 5.88 in original bottle. \nall and all it was a great experience with delicious food and great service.", 
            "i discovered this restaurant after viewing a recommendation by anthony bourdain, so while a friend was in town we decided to come check it out. it's located inside the cosmopolitan hotel which is one of my favorite places on the strip. upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly hostess and offered our choice of the bar (which allows you to watch them work on tortillas from the open kitchen) or a table.  i felt for vegas fine dining this place was pretty affordable.\nmiller d was our server he was quick to greet us with a smile and i believe could tell we were unclear on if we should try a drink. he recommended the sueno cocktail which comes with a spicy salt rim. he was kind enough to do half/half in case we were a fan of the spicy kick it offered. both my friend and i really enjoyed the drink.\n\nthe main thing i was dying to try was this taco that i read about called the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco , but we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a <mark>Happy Family Jiaozi</mark>  (delicious pot stickers with amazing flavoring)and <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> ( fried pork buns) and some <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles(cold noodle dish with avocado and jicama for an interesting twist). overall i loved everything except that taco i wanted so badly to try. when it first arrived i took a bite of the beef tendon alone and it was delicious but when taking a bite of the taco all together with the oyster on top i felt like the ocean had thrown up in my mouth. it just wasn't a good combo for my pallet. maybe i got a bad oyster i don't know but overall it was an experience i will not quickly forget.\n\neveryone at the restaurant was super friendly and our drinks were always full. the only reason i have to deduct a star is i somehow was overcharged $20 on my bill. thankfully my friend encouraged me to keep my receipt and i am dealing with that situation but i definitely feel like this place is worth checking out! i left feeling satisfied and excited to go back to try some more cool fusions.", 
            "are you looking for authentic chinese and/or mexican food? do you enjoy unique fusion combos? is it important for you to get good value in terms of quality/quantity vs price? if you answered yes to any of these questions, do not bother eating at this place.\n\nthe decor and service are top notch, i will give them that. but a restaurant is about food first and foremost, and those things should be there to complement <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark>, not make up for bad food. i had the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark>, the lamb pot stickers, the har gau, and the <mark>Swallow a Cloud</mark>. the portions were ridiculously tiny: i could've fit all six pieces of har gau in one bite. the noodle soup was really bland. \n\neverything about the restaurant looks unique, fancy, and pricy: all usually good indications. but not here. here, \"unique, fancy, and pricy\" are the indications of pretentiousness. don't be drawn in.",

            "our first visit, the menu and concept looked interesting and good. we had a great experience. the service from start to finish was great, our server had good suggestions and the manager stopping by a couple times was super friendly. the beef and lettuce entre was very good, tender and seasoned quite well i thought. sui mai was very good. a fun selection of tacos, carnitas, fish and lobster tacos were great and try the silencio, unique and delicious. the kumamoto oyster in a taco with lychee and beef tendon was an awesome concept! my only thing on it was too much of the beef tendon, maybe could be done a little differently but still liked. i'm a tequila lover and loved the tequila selection, great place to try some of the higher end tequilas with their flights. and a creative list of drinks and margaritas, they know how to make one. the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> i believe they were called, fried pork buns -- awesome. almost like desert. we'll be back to try more from the menu for sure. thank you!", 
            "i came in with decent expectations. walking in, they were lowered a little bit. very gaudy, flashy decor. but once you look at the menu, it speaks for itself.  \n\nthe food isn't really fusion. they have a mexican side and an asian side. the cocktails are made with agave-based spirits and they have some agua frescas too.\n\ni started with a horchata. it was good.. a little chalky compared to others i've had, but not too sweet. my friend got the mango and it was delicious. \n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> many small things to share, starting with the lengua taco.\n\nbest lengua taco i've ever had. meat was seasoned, tender and simply garnished with radish, onion and cilantro. you can tell the corn tortillas are fresh and made in house (you can watch some ladies making them as you walk in).\n\nnext we had the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark>. similar to chinese pork buns but deep fried. the dough was slightly sweet and delicious. they're served with a side of house made condensed milk. yum! \n\nthe fries came next.. they were loaded with mole (perfectly balanced), crema and queso fresco. fries are hand cut. they were yummy. a carnitas taco came out too. again, best carnitas taco i've had. it was garnished with salsa verde and pork rinds.\n\nthe duck tongue taco and a chinese pork <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> were last. the duck tongue was glazed in some delicious sweet sauce, garnished with fresh lychee... a bit hard to get over the mental block, but i still gave it a shot. the pork sandwich was very full of flavor. chopped pork braised with 5 spice. \n\noverall, everything was very well executed. they mentioned almost everything was made in house. service was fantastic. definitely recommending this place to friends visiting vegas! it won't break the bank either.", 
            "i have such fond experiences of eating here with my girlfriends when it first opened a few years ago, but my most recent visit wasn't nearly as delicious as i remembered. i don't know whether my taste has improved since my starving college student years or whether the restaurant has changed, but it was no longer the mind-blowing food i recalled. \n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark>, the beef shumai, lobster tacos, and for dessert, mango sticky rice and churros (we like dessert). the pigs were basically donuts filled with bbq pork, and they were quite tasty when drenched with the accompanying condensed milk. the shumai weren't really anything to write home about, but the lobster tacos were the real disappointment! as my coworker put it, \"for $10 a taco, i expected them to taste good.\" the lobster was completely overwhelmed by an abundance of lime and grapefruit, making the tacos quite acidic and sour. the mango sticky rice was an interesting twist on the classic thai dessert, as the rice was puffed and sprinkled on top of mango and ice cream which was covered in quite a lot of whipped cream. it was light and interesting, and i enjoyed it. the churros were nice but not particularly special. \n\noverall i'm a bit disappointed in <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark>, and i hope they will start putting more effort into the food here.", 
            "a creative concept, but execution is mediocre.\n\nhonestly, the idea of a chinese and mexican restaurant usually would have me running in the opposite direction (i hate fusion places), but the jose andres connection really drew me in. this place isn't a fusion restaurant, it's really just a bunch of mexican and chinese options. \n\nmy sister and i got: chips & salsa, 2 tacos (hongos & <mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark>), 1 order of <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>, 1 order of <mark>Swallow a Cloud</mark> (wonton noodle soup), and 1 order of <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> (fried pork buns with condensed milk dipping sauce).\n\nthe <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> were okay - salty chips but good chipotle salsa. the tacos were also okay; the hongos (mushrooms) one was way too citrus-y and could've used more guac to balance out, and the pancitas <mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark> (pork belly) was good because of the pineapples in it. my sister did say that the pork belly could have been a lot more tender, though. <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> was not good. the noodles were off, and the peanut sauce was salty and too spicy even after adding the vinegar brown sauce on the side. the <mark>Swallow a Cloud</mark> wonton soup was also mediocre because of the bland noodles. i think the winning dish was <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> - who would have thought condensed milk to dip fried pork buns into is actually really yummy? \n\nthe concept is creative because there are a lot of options, and the drinks menu looked good, but the food itself was just mediocre. maybe coming from california set the standard high for asian and mexican food, but this place was a little too expensive for just the mediocrity.", 
            "chinese-mexican fusion sounded like a really interesting concept when my sister and i were trying to find a place for dinner. in my mind, either this place was going to wow me or it will leave me disappointed. well...it was the latter. \n\nwe came mid afternoon so there weren't many people in the restaurant at all. we were seated quickly, and our waitress was attentive during our entire meal - big plus (service upped this place to the three stars i gave it). \n\nin terms of food, nothing really stood out. while looking at the menu, the only thing that sort of stood out to me were the taco combinations. other than that, everything else on the menu was very much either a chinese dish or a mexican fish. not much fusion going on with the menu items. my sister and i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> more than enough for the both of us. i'd say we tried a little bit of each type of dish offered. i was not impressed by any of it. the only thing that i remember was the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> entree, which consisted of fried bbq pork buns served with condensed milk. strange combination with the condensed milk but it worked really well. \n\ni wouldn't recommend this place but if you're dying to give it a try, i'd suggest going with different tacos if you want the whole chinese mexican fusion experience."

            "conceptually \"chinese mexican fusion,\" china poblano is billed as a blending of the two rich cultures.  located on the 2nd floor of the cosmopolitan somewhat hidden in the back, the restaurant is certainly eye catching.  with an entryway shaped like buddha and \"mexican takeout\" windows on either side the campy feel is palpable, but acceptable.  with an interior of communal and separate dining tables, a noodle making station, and wall decorations ranging from chinese opera masks and lanterns to luchador masks and oaxacan carvings the interior was colorful to say the least.  in addition to the fixed objects there were also large morphing murals - projections of famous and peasant chinese and mexican individuals.  to see the restaurant is to love it-or perhaps to hate it-it is certainly over the top.\n\narriving in warm soft shells and approximately three bites each the first tastes of taco would come from langosta.  described as meaty lobster/mango/arbol <mark>Monk Chile Sauce</mark> ($16 for 2 now, $6/e prev) the flavors were good, but unfortunately the lobster was slightly overcooked and i felt the <mark>Monk Chile Sauce</mark> overwhelmed the subtleties of the sweet crustacean.\n\nsilencio tacos - duck tongue/rambutan fruit ($4.5/e.)  unfamiliar with rambutan until this time i was impressed by the fleshy sweet fruit and its ability to temper the salty, savory, and somewhat chewy tongues.  while not as nuanced as some of the other tacos, these are definitely worth checking out if only to experience the ingredients at a relatively cheap price.\n\nthe cochinita tacos, described as yucatan-style pit barbeque pork/marinated onions ($4/e) were good, but rather expected and unidimensional.   savory and sweet the pork and onions melded nicely, but in total the flavor was no better or worse than a good pork taco anywhere else.\n\ncarnitas braised baby pig/pork rinds/spicy salsa verde cruda ($4/e prev.)  with the braised baby pig perfectly done-supple, moist and flavorful-the addition of pork rinds added a lovely degree of crunch and saltiness.  tempering the other two dishes and adding a bit of spice plus vegetal acidity the salsa was spicy without being overly so-in my opinion they should serve this salsa instead of the chipotle version with the tortilla chips.\n\ncoctel de camarones fresh shrimp/jumbo lump crab meat/tomato/avocado ($12.)  essentially a whole lot of underwhelming salsa in a bowl with a couple of snappy sweet shrimp, thin shreds of crab, and chunks of avocado plus tortillas for dunking it was almost as if someone forgot to add salt, or spice, or vinegar, or really anything other than the listed ingredients which simply were not of all that impressive quality.\n\nlove is in the air heirloom tomatoes/sugar air ($8.88) was much simpler in ingredients and much more complex in flavor.  nicely presented in a large bowl with what must have been two fresh whole tomatoes and a splash of vinegar the dish was topped with an \"mg\" manufactured foam full of delicate sweetness that acted only to enhance the natural flavors of the tomatoes beneath.\n\n<mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> vegetables/crispy lace ($11.88 now, $8.88 at our visit) delivered five pockets of lamb, cabbage, radish, and smoky seasonings inside a crispy lace shell.  while slightly oily, the lamb itself was impressively cooked and not a bit gamey-with the m\\u00e9lange of vegetables elevated by the cumin and black pepper this dish was clever and tasty with obvious contributions from both hispanic and chinese cultures.\n\nocean nest scallops/crab/shrimp/pan-fried egg noodles/seasonal vegetables ($10 at our visit and now $22 w/ king crab/lobster) would be a successful yet rather ordinary dish.  with crispy noodles resting in a gentle fish broth at the base and three head-on shrimp, three scallops, and a few chunks of crab interspersed with bok choy, spinach, and onions the flavors all worked and the textures were nicely done-at $10 the dish was a steal, but lobster or not i don't think i'd recommend it at the current price point unless there was a good deal more seafood.\n\nthe unruly monk with hand-cut noodles/bok choy/wild wood ear mushrooms/poached egg ($16) was served in an enormous bowl with perhaps a half liter of broth, boiled bok choy, a single egg, and a plethora of mushrooms the dish would be a nearly mirror experience of the ocean nest-a nicely executed dish, but no better than could be made at a local chinese restaurant in most mid-sized us cities.\n\nin the end i think the verdict is still out on china poblano - i'm not willing to rule it out, but i'm also not ready to say the \"concept\" (which is exactly what it is) \"works.\"  while certain dishes worked to great effect, others merely represented decent versions of americanized ethnic food, and some were simply underwhelming.  looking at the menu only 2 weeks after my visit i already see many changes and given andres' propensity for exploration i've no doubt the menu will continue to evolve as they find what works and doesn't.", 
            "i love oyamel and jaleo, so i was eager to see jose andres' latest creation, and i had really high expectations for china poblano.  i had this idea that mexican-chinese fusion would be the love child of two of my favorite restaurants, oyamel and myers+chang (a funky pan-asian restaurant in boston).  we decided to try the asian side of the menu at china poblano, after we realized that there weren't that many fusion dishes on the menu.\n\nthe good: the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> was great - the soy sauce did not make me think of sashimi at all! overall, it was a flavor combination that i wouldn't have thought of, and i liked the texture of the ceviche with the walnuts.  the monk's noodles had a nice texture, and i was pleasantly surprised by the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> - it really distinguished itself from your average <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>.  as far as drinks go, i had a margarita with sea salt \"foam\" (standard at oyamel, still tasty here).  the lemon drop with \"noodles\" was clever, and it tasted like your standard lemon drop.  yes, i bought into the cutesy presentation, and i enjoyed it.\n\nalso good: the service.  the host table seemed a bit confused but once we were seated, everyone was great.  our waitress had recommended the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> to us over the scallop ceviche, since she thought the scallop portion was too small, and i always like candor from the waitstaff.  there was also a mistake at the bar, and when she saw a drink about to go to waste she brought it over to me (yay!)  the entire staff was very attentive.\n\nthe bad: we had the \"<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\" pork steam buns, and something about the texture of the bao was off.  even worse though, the meat was underseasoned.  the same thing goes for the <mark>Ten Treasure</mark> noodle soup and the monk's noodles - they looked great but the broth was underwhelming.  it's difficult to get the broth just right (tampopo, anyone?) but if you can't, maybe you shouldn't offer so many noodle soups <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> menu.\n\ni'm willing to give china poblano the benefit of the doubt, as the restaurant was only two weeks old when we visited.  i will probably eat here again... but there are so many restaurants to try on the strip, so i'm not sure when or if i'll be back.  the bottom line is, jose andres does a fantastic job with mexican cuisine and tapas, so if you're going to visit, maybe that's what you should stick with.  my visit to china poblano just left me craving a visit to myers+chang and oyamel.  i didn't take the ceviche and tacos at oyamel for granted before, but i will certainly appreciate them a lot more on my next visit.", 
            "barbacoa tacos were amazing.\n\nwe have an asian fusion restuarant in minneapolis that fuses the 2 cuisines a little better than this place.  c.p. has 2 distinct menus for the regions, not as much of a hybrid as i'm used to.\n\ngreat decor, free wifi, and rewards <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> identity membership :)  we were trashy and even brought our own drinks in since we were gambling downstairs and got them from the cocktail servers.  didn't seem to phase our server though, so it was apprecaited.", 
            "stopped in the cosmopolitan and were looking for a different style restaurant to try and we came across china poblano. we had looked into jose andres' other restaurant but it exceeded our budget a bit and we saw this place we thought it would be a fun place to try. hostess was really nice and made us a reservation for later that night. we did have to wait a little bit for our table when it didn't look particularly crowded later on when we came back, but nothing to really complain over. \n\nservice: was good. nothing extremely noteworthy but i felt like they checked in on us frequently enought and the food was out in a reasonable amount of time. our waiter sugessted some of his favorites and overall i think the service was nice. \n\ncocktails: i had the lemon drop which is a \"noodle\" inspired cocktail that comes with chopsticks. i didn't love it and for $12 a pop i wanted to love it. after a few sips the noodles got to be annoying and it was a little too sweet for my taste and i like sweet. \n\nfood: we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> some appetizers. got the <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark>. i liked them but i wish the lamb had a bit more flavor to it. needed more seasoning of some sort. for my entree i got the ocean nest which is scallops/shrimp/king crab/lobster/pan-fried egg noodles/ seasonal vegetables. heads are on the shrimp so if that freaks you out its good to know before hand. i really loved the broth of the dish and the whole thing all together, but it was really difficult to eat. by that i mean you can't look cute eating what looks like a birds nest of tightly wound noodles, especially with chopsticks. \n\ni like the setting of the restaurant. it's a nice space. i would come back again but maybe try the mexican half of the menu.", 
            "as a good friend to the empire said, \"the beautiful people didn't all disappear - they just all went into hiding at the cosmopolitan\".  man, she couldn't have been more right.  everywhere i looked it was style over substance, women trolling for a golden ticket, men trying way too hard to look pensive in staged photographs, popped collars for miles....and absolutely no sign of that furball that creates the one-thing entourage of my daughter's deadbeat boyfriend.  let's face it, that beast has no sense of style.  chewie's idea of suiting up is picking the birds that got trapped in his fur out of his natty ass backhair.\n\nfortunately for me, black is always in, so i had no trouble getting into china poblano - which, on its surface, presents the awesome combination of mexican and chinese food all in one place.  why has nobody in the entire galaxy thought of this before?\n\ni will say this:  what we got was absolutely delicious.  i will also say this:  there really, really should have been more of it.  look, i get that part of being one of the \"beautiful people\" is only pretending to eat your food, so i'm sure for the regulars of that hotel, the 2 bite meals are more than sufficient.  let's face it, though:  nobody would ever claim that i needed to eat a damn sammich.  and if i'm going to pay 20 dollars for a damn 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, it should be substantial enough to where i have more than 1 little bit of each kind of vegetable.  12 dollars for an object i could eat in one bite?  jesus christ, even the water was small.  no, seriously, tiny glasses, and they never even completely filled them on refills.  what the hell is it with this kind of philosophy?  made me want to go out and force choke a kitten....or at least the beloved marie osmond.  but my quarrel was with this restaurant, not the flamingo hilton.\n\nsorry, but you're claiming a combination of mexican and chinese cuisine, both of which historically consist of larger portion sizes.  so why try to integrate tapas style sizes with steakhouse-like prices?\n\nmaybe the owner should focus more on balancing the value of his cuisine instead of kowtowing to perpetually pouty-lipped 20-something gold miners looking for someone with enough mastery of the force to use jedi mind tricks on the jimmy choo salespeople for free shoes.  my recommendation?  the recipe for the superb 20 veg <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> is readily available online...i almost never say this, but make it <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> own spaceship and save yourself the expense.\n\n3 deathstars.", 
            "went here with my parents awhile back. they were very accommodating for our situation, as my brother is in a wheel chair so we needed some extra room.\n\ndon't get me wrong, 3 stars is good! it was great! i enjoyed all of the food, but the prices were high. it is expected though, i mean come <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark>'re in vegas and when are you going to have chinese mexican fusion? all of the items were delicious and our palates were satisfied.\n\ni would recommend this place to someone as i want them to try the food out. not sure if i'd come back again, but i'm glad i came!", 
            "chinese food and mexican food in one - what more could you ask for?\n\ni'm honestly pretty shocked about the lack of positive reviews for china poblano.  it's vegas - everything is expensive and probably not big enough (insert double entendre here).  stop your whining and realize it's tapas-style.  if you have 10 hungry bachelorette party girls like we were, order two of each type, eat family style, order a strong drink, and shut your trap.\n\nfor vegas shu mai, i thought it was pretty good.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> two servings of the lucky 8, which i recommend so you can get a taste of each type of shu mai they serve. all were tasty and topped with something interesting, like radish or goji berry. the har gau was ok; i have had better. the <mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> hot and sour soup had a wonderful kick of spices. drinks or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> included the singapore sling and the <mark>Lychee Sour</mark>, both of which were flavorful and interesting. i myself had vodka with fresh cantaloupe juice, which snuck up <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> and hit you like an unruly child. other dishes or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> at our table included a caesar salad (with way too much parmesan), <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>, shrimp, and numerous tacos. as far as pork buns go, the <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> was a little meh. i like the pork to be red and drier than this was.\n\nthe coup de grace of my palate was the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco. this is definitely the best non-traditional taco i've ever had. a taco with beef tendon and oyster - the crispiness of the tendon punctuated with the creamy oyster was mind-blowing. \n\nlots of good tastes, a few mediocre tastes. but definitely deserving of a higher rating than the uno estrellas some other folks are giving. i'd go back.  <mark>Viva China</mark> poblano!", 
            "you know how when you go to a gas station and pay using a credit/debit card before pumping gas? and you know how the gas station \"pre-charges\" you for a certain amount to guarantee you can actually pay for those 21 gallons of gas your gas-hog vehicle guzzles up? you know how those \"pre-charges\" are immediately returned to your account once you complete your gas purchase? well, china poblano treats its customers' like gas pumpers at the good ol' gas 'n' goods.\n\nhold on. let me back up and write a review for the actual dining experience before i get into the real reason for my 1-star review.\n\nmy actual dining rating is probably closer to a 3-star in terms of food taste and ambiance. i had eaten at china poblano before, while on a date. the food was good and the drinks were well made. i didn't care at the time what the prices were because my date insisted i get whatever i wanted. so the overpriced menu wasn't an issue until my return visit with friends. \n\nduring my return visit i chose items a little more conservatively. only one cocktail, some guacamole and some duck something-or-other. my total bill including the automatic tip of 20% (for parties of 6+) was only $39. not bad at all really, even though i realized i should have just or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> twice as much guacamole and skipped the duck-whatever. i love duck and always order it when it makes it onto a menu. this wasn't watery-mouth duck. it was over-cooked, barely-recognizable duck. the food isn't so amazing that i would suggest it for large groups in which only one person pays. it is more of a cute place for a date or a place for a group of friends who are paying separately. it isn't even really a fusion restaurant, per se, so if you are craving mexican or chinese you should probably just go to the restaurant you crave.\n\na fusion restaurant usually makes it a point to fuse two types of cuisine into one dish. this restaurant merely offers items from two different cuisines in separate sections.\n\nanyway, the restaurant is cute. the decor is different. the only chairs that have backs to them are the booths. the servers are lazy. oh wait, what's that? lazy servers at an overrated restaurant that serves undersized and overpriced food? no way!\n\nnow for a better explanation of why this restaurant went from a 4-star on my first visit to a 1-star on my second/third visit:\n\nafter my friends and i ate our meal and paid for the meals individually with our debit/credit cards, we spent the rest of the night enjoying some mario kart in the room and some hot-tub lounging because well, we were staying in vegas a full week and this was already night #5. it seemed like a great night all around.\n\nthen when we woke in the morning, one of my friends decided to check his account charges on his phone app. he panicked when he saw that china poblano had charged an extra 30%. he too had paid $39 including tip and suddenly had a $51.70 charge. granted, that wasn't an insane amount of money. only $11.70. however, when you consider that the total bill for the table was over $200, that 30% upcharge now looks more like a hefty $60+ charge spread out over all of our accounts. we all checked our accounts and since we have all been servers in restaurants before and realize that sometimes shady/desperate servers like to add-on a little extra tip and hope that no one notices, we stormed over to china poblano determined to fix the issue and get our money back into our accounts. we at least wanted a genuine apology.\n\nwhen we arrived at the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager about the extra charge, the hostess stated \"oh, yeah we get this all the time.\" ummmmm, what? you get this complaint all the time?\n\nwell, the manager explained to us that the [cheap ass] credit card processing company they use temporarily charges an extra 20-30% for transactions to guarantee that the funds are available. just like a gas station. the only difference is, at a gas stati<mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> are pre-paying for something in which the final price is unbeknownst to you until you are done pumping. at a restaurant (especially when the tip is included in the bill) you know exactly how much you are paying right then and there when you sign the receipt. the server then enters it into the computer and there is no more need for any extra charges. \n\nwe tried to explain to her that this is the only restaurant that we have ever encountered that has such ridiculous practices. not only do they give their customers a small panic attack when they check their account balances (imagine if you were someone who went to a special dinner and reluctantly threw down $500 for a nice dinner out with your family and when you look at your account there is a charge for $650 instead) but on top of that they don't seem to think it is a big deal or let customers know of this extra temporary charge ahead of time. on top of all that, the manager was very condescending, smug and without an apologetic bone in her body.", 
            "usually i read lots of reviews before eating anywhere, but seeing as we were on vacation, my wife and i took a risk and went into china poblano blind.  good thing, because had i trusted yelp's 3-star review, i might have missed out on a memorable meal.\n\ntrendy and quirky beyond belief, this restaurant exudes cool (or hipster, depending <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> view, but i took it as cool).  it has booths and community tables, and the dishes are all small plates from mexican and chinese cuisine... not much fusion, but it's nice to mix and match.  my wife and i shared <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>, with hot, fresh chips and a smoky chipotle salsa with just the right amount of kick.  i got a carnitas taco, which was succulent and had homemade pork rinds on top.  my wife liked her barbacoa taco as well.\n\nfor our \"main courses\" (although remember, it's small plates, so that doesn't really apply), i had the lemon tree shrimp, which was unbelievably good.  the shrimp tasted fresh, and the sauce was redolent with black pepper and celery, and the occasional chunk of citrus fruit.  my wife had the <mark>Beijing Glass</mark>, a noodle dish that was not to my taste, but it looked beautiful, with all the components (noodles and tons of different asian veggies) sectioned out in the bowl, waiting to be mixed.  she loved it.\n\nsome people are complaining about the size of the dishes.  well, it's small plates, and you're supposed to order 2-3 items.  the wait staff tells you that.  our waitress even asked us during lunch if we were satisfied with the amount of food we had or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> -- and we were.  far too many restaurants go for quantity over quality, but china poblano serves properly sized meals.  two or three dishes really should be enough to fill up one person.  if not, i dunno, go to one of the millions of buffets on the strip instead.  if i'm going to spend $30 on a meal, i'd honestly rather have high-quality food than \"all-you-can-eat.\"",

            "yesterday was actually \"take two\" for us here, since we planned on meeting a friend for dinner.  he got called in to work and couldn't make it, but it wasn't necessarily a \"tragic evening\", because the food here is pretty amazing.\n\na quirky but compelling mix of chinese and mexican cuisine (but not on the same plate, thank gawd!), you're free to mix-and-match however you please, just like the decor, which i can only describe as \"big trouble in little chinese tijuana.\"\n\nwe started off with <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>. i am a sucker for fresh, warm chips and these pretty much ruled.  most with a palate for something a little kickier will find the salsa wanting, but having been burned by too many muy caliente sauces in the past, i found this one just right.\n\nbear kicked it off with one of the tacos as well - i don't remember which, but the blissful look on his face was recommendation enough for me.  i decided to mix it up with two tacos: the chicken and mole poblano and the bbq pork with marinated onions, along with \"<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\": four delicately steamed buns filled with more bbq pork.  bear had the \"special 8\" dim sum - (probably not getting the name right, but i won't forget that taste!) - delicate, tasty jewels of meat, spices and veggies swathed in very light wrappers. i had bites of the chicken and pork...which i will have to definitely try in the future!\n\nit was all a-mazing. paired with rum-and-cokes for me (<mark>Negra Modelo</mark> for bear), the tastes of each item are light and exquisite - tender meats, flavorful but not overpowering sauces, but don't sit brick-like in your stomach as most chain-restaurant style chinese and/or mexican foods have a tendency to do.  \n\nbecause i'd really had a taste for some pho noodles all week (nursing a pretty wicked cold earlier), i knew i wouldn't get them here, but when i saw \"dan-<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>\" noodles on the menu, i knew i wasn't leaving until i had some, which i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> in lieu of dessert.  i love good \"dan-dan\" as much as the next chinese food enthusiast, but these? not saying it wasn't a healthy sized portion, but these bad boys made me wish for a kiddie-pool sized bowl that i could jump into and do the backstroke in. oh, yeah.  they are that. freakin'. good.\n\nbear had a dessert i did have a bite of - mangos with a light creamy sauce and maybe pine nuts? - that i made a mental note to have next time we visit.\n\nto sum it up - awesome food, great service from everyone, but most especially from our bartender/server casey. however, i only have one 'caveat' to present.  when the bill arrived, it did give me one of those \"ruh-roh, raggy!\" moments when i saw the total.  not saying you have to be mark cuban or steve wynn to eat here, but if you have a more-than-healthy appetite - and we do, you may want to put china <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> \"special occasions only\" list.  it's just that all that wonderful food does add up (all tacos, dim sum and other items are priced separately), so you may want to have a \"point guard\" with you to keep an eye on the rising tab. \n\nother than that, i would dare say that we'll be back!",

            "there's no mexican-asian fusion going on in this restaurant, except that the 2 menus and decor are intertwined. it's almost like someone could not decide if they wanted to open a mexican restaurant or chinese restaurant, so they decide to open both in the same space, with separate kitchens. i love both mexican food and chinese food, but this is neither here nor there. two cuisines that are normally best in a hole-in-the wall spot, and inexpensive - this is just the opposite: overpriced and mediocre.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> everything family style and tried to get a good mix of both mexican & chinese food:\n\n<mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark> ($15) - i liked this margarita a lot. i don't care for the taste of tequila, and the blood orange seemed to mask this well. it had a spicy kick to it, but not so spicy that it was undrinkable.\n\nguacamole & chips ($15) - handmade, and delicious, but the price is about double what i would expect to pay for fresh guacamole. chips were light, crispy and fresh.\n\ntacos (about $5 each) - i'm used to dollar tacos (maybe $2) at a taco truck. i got the <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> and it was good, but unless i'm expensing my meal to work, i would pass on this - much too expensive for tacos.\n\n<mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> ($12.88) - 6 pieces - this was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. the lamb inside was tasty and i liked the crispy lace (sweet onions) design on the dish. would recommend this.\n\nsui mai ($13.88) - 6 pieces - the only cool thing about this were the gold flakes on top. the rest was just okay, and tasted heavy on the ginger. at a normal dim sum restaurant, you can get 4 sui mai's for $4 that taste better.\n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> ($12) - wheat noodles and spicy pork sauce - this was definitely spicy, nothing that blew me away though. at least the price was reasonable for the portion-size.\n\ncol de bruselas ($12) - these are on the acidic side - tasted really limey. i wouldn't get this again.\n\n<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> ($18) - 8 pieces of shrimp = $2.25 per piece of shrimp. sauce was good, not too spicy, this was one of the better dishes we had.\n\nbistec con mole amarillo y hongos ($20) - grilled hanger steak with mole - there were about 6 sliced pieces of steak - again, with the small portions. it was one of the better tasting dishes we had, but expensive.\n\nall in all, it's an interesting concept and i was there for work so i was able to expense my meal. with tip and tax, it was $60 per person - quite honestly, i would rather eat at a mexican food truck or a hole-in-the-wall chinese place for 1/4 of the price and more authentic food. with so many other options in vegas, i'll be going elsewhere.", 
            "a chinese & mexican restaurant? it sounded like the perfect place for my husband (hispanic) and i (chinese), but it ended up to be a very disappointing meal. my husband has been there once. he warned me about the food wasn't that good, but we felt like i had to try at least once. \n\nwe started with the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>. chips were fresh and crispy. the salsa was fine, but nothing special. we have had much better salsa in other places. \n\nwe had three tacos. the homemade corn tortillas were great. lengua (beef tongue) was very delicious. the tongue was tender and the salsa was refreshing. best thing of the night. silencio (duck tongue) was disappointing. it was a taco with chinese cooking style and flavors. sadly, the flavors just didn't go well with the tortilla. kind of weird. pescado a la plancha (fish) was ok. just a fish taco. nothing amazing. \n\nfor dim sum, we got the traditional siu mai. $13.88 for 6 siu mai? they better be good! my husband liked them, but they were just ok for me. the filling were a bit loose. the siu mai fell apart easily after one bite. i felt that i am paying for the gold flakes more than anything. please take away the gold flakes and give me some decent and cheap siu mai! we also had the <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark>. i was very exciting about pot stickers, especially lamb one. not only we can't taste the lamb, the spice seasoning overpowered everything. the spice didn't taste anything like chinese or mexican food. it was more like indian flavors. other than the crispy skins, we didn't like these at all. \n\nwe also got the 18 <mark>18 Monk Noodle</mark>. i think they have switched this out of the menu now. but it was very tasty. i like hand cut noodles, because they are usually al dente. and these noodles were. the flavors were earthy and savory. we enjoyed it. \n\nat the end, we paid about $65 (without tax & tips). all the food we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> were nothing fancy. you can get all these food in a mexican or chinese restaurant for just half the price. i have nothing against fusion food. i love kogi. but the food in here is just not good and it is way over price! if you are thinking to come here, i urge you to go somewhere else. jos\\u00e9 andr\\u00e9s' magic just doesn't work here.",

            "i must have amnesia because i really don't know why i keep coming back here. my first time was when it first opened a few years ago, and i believe i have a review for \"the worst thing i've ever eaten\" see: beef tendon taco w/ bad oyster. about a year and a half ago i went back, and was again taken aback by the incredibly mediocre food and astronomical prices. \n\na few weeks ago a friend and i were prowling the town, looking for a fun spot to grab a bite before we headed to drais for chromeo (woo!), and she'd never been, and again, i guess i blacked out momentarily from hunger, because i was like \"okay! let's go here!\". wrong. it was empty per usual... even though it was 9pm on a friday night. we each or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a <mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark> at $15 a pop, and they didn't even have the courtesy to fill them to top of the glass. we split the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, and there was nothing fun about it. it was a glop of starchy melted cheese. a 5 year old could make it by literally putting a block of monterey jack in the microwave. a very expensive block of $10 cheese. \n\ni had the special, a pork belly taco w/ pineapple at $4 which was nothing special at all, and the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> noodles for $13 which were spicy, excessively sweet, and quite glue-y. she had a bowl of noodles as well, and somehow our bill came to almost $100 w/ tip. what. \n\njose andres- what are you doing. you are amazing, jaleo is amazing (the one in dc is 10x better), bazaar is amazing, this restaurant is a stain <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> reputation. the only pros are the service, which is always great, the manager did come over to see how things were, and we said great, because it's not her fault the food sucks. the servers are attentive as well. the first time i was there i saw mario batali eating in the back in his famous orange crocs, so i suppose that's cool. all this experience did was remind me why i avoid strip celebrity-name restaurants."

            "pleasantly bizarre. i guess that's how i would sum this place up.  watch the video on their website if you want to get a feel for the vibe of the restaurant.  if you are looking for a more classy, quiet, date-night kind of place you are better off going to one of the eateries on the third floor.  this place was rocking on the saturday night we were there, electrified by the massive crowd just outside the door waiting to get into the club.  but i was in a good mood and enjoyed the music and people watching while we waited for our table perched high above everyone else on what appeared to be a mod style version of a mayan pyramid... except that there were golden buddha statues on top.  yeah.  so now you are starting to get it when i say this place is weird but cool? did i mention that there was a digital painting on the wall that alternated between a portrait of frida khalo and the dalai lama? and a sculpture roughly in the shape of a human head protruding from the back wall onto which they projected digital images of kim jong-il?  ok, so you got it now, right?\n\ni agree with the other reviewers that i wish they had more fusion dishes.  i was disappointed that the majority of the menu items were either chinese or mexican but not both.  and most of the food was just average.  good but not great.  and yes, ridulously over priced. but at a hip restaurant in what is arguably the hottest casino hotel on the strip right now, that is to be expected. so now, for those of you still reading this, here is a rundown of what we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>.\n\nguacamole - my husband made the comment that this was not even the best guac that he had eaten that day.  i am not a big fan of the stuff in general but i would have like to see some kind of twist to make something that is so easy to make at home worth ordering here.  maybe a little five spice powder or some ginger for that asian influence.  are you listening jos\\u00e9 andr\\u00e9s? and you really need to serve it with chips.  those tortillas were pretty darn good but it is a texture thing.\n\npot stickers - beautiful presentation.  really, just gorgeous. i even took a picture.  i truly enjoyed the flavors and it was a cool twist to get lamb instead of the traditional pork.  but where was the sauce? everyone knows the best part about eating pot stickers is the sauce. that was another little thing that just made the dish seem lacking and also a missed opportunity to bring in a fusion experience (how about a little chimichurri or mole sauce for dipping? hello?)\n\ncoctel de camarones - i was so disappointed in this dish, i can't even tell you.  for those of you who have ever had true cocteles at an authentic mexican seafood place just don't bother.  if you are the type that enjoys salsa out of a jar, then you might like it.  once again, though, they were missing the accompaniment. <mark>Traditional</mark>, this dish is either served with saltine crackers or tostada shells. however, when we asked our waitress if we could get some chips or something to eat it with she said we were supposed to eat it with the spoon, like gazpacho. wtf?\n\nchilaquiles - this dish was not authentically mexican either but i really enjoyed it.  my husband, who had apparently or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> it without reading the description, did not. he was expecting red sauce instead of green but i loved the tangy tomatillo salsa and the cheese was delish. but i agreed with him that there really should have been meat or eggs on there. and the chips were not really cooked into the dish, it was more like nachos than anything else.\n\nmole tacos - we both liked these though they were a little bland.  i guess not everyone likes spicy but i was expecting at least a little heat.  gourmet tacos like these are pretty common where we live so i wasn't surprised by the price or size but meh, i've had better.\n\npalmitos - this salad saved the day for me.  it was truly special.  i love hearts of palm but these weren't the limp white tubes you get out of a jar.  crisp and fresh, mixed with other equally fresh julienned vegetables, it was a hearty and satisfying salad.  but the dressing is what really blew my mind.  sweet and sour with a strong tamarind flavor.  it tasted like those mexican tamarindo candies... except more crisp and organic.  the whole dish was just so clean and brisk.  i know not everyone's palate is the same and someone else might find it too strong, there was a lot of fresh lime juice in there and definitely some kind of chile.  but that is perfect for me. i may return to this place just for that salad... or if i in the mood for some ethnic vegas style kitsch.", 
            "so, i agree with several of the 3 stars here and i am leaning on probably a 3.5 for here but, i can't quite put a 4 down. this has been on my list to  eat visit for awhile because of its odd asian/mexican fusion which does not seem to make sense. the place itself is like an acid trip with videos on the walls, stadium seating at bar, and bike wheels on ceiling. \nthe place is all small portion and sort of a tapas with large meal prices. \nmy meal\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> noodles $12- really good with great flavor, a great soba noodles and sauce.\nchilaquiles $13- which is basically tortilla chips, sour cream sauce, and a tomatillo type sauce. this is very close to a tradition version of this dish and it was good and rich.\n20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> $20- this was the best of them all, a great mix of veggies that i have eaten in such youthful form and great flavor.. however the size overall was probably 2 cups.\n\ndesert- mango rice $11- which was airy and very light with a cream rice flavor and cold mangos.\n\ndrinks-singapore sling- <mark>Traditional</mark> made and perfect! (where did these go america)\n\nsalt air margariita- crazy good with a salt flavored foam.\n\noverall a solid meal, however the bang for the buck is lacking. after tip this meal for 1 is over $90 and i can say i was not full in the end. so, the food is good but you are going to have to order 3 items per person to consider it a meal."

            "thought this might be fun to try on a our trip to vegas but i would definitely give this a miss. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a lot of the dumplings (not great, and i know dumplings!), plus some noodle dishes, a soup (bland broth) and the <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark> salad (the vinegar was overpowering and the sauce gluggy, as if it was out of a bottle).\n\nwe then had some tacos and these were much better (especially the carnitas and duck tongue). the cosmopolitan seems to be full of hen's weekends so the restaurant was full of big bridal shower groups, not our scene.", 
            "apparently my expectations were tooooooo high.  was told by foodies that this place was a must eat.  however my pool attendant said it wasn't.  first where is the \"fusion\"?  the menu had food from both places but nothing that mixed them.  the waiter said we had to have the best taco in the world...carnitas.  being from san diego it was just ok.  the salsa for it was worth the $5.  for the main course we got the <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark> and <mark>Kao Lao Lao</mark> loa noodles.  we were told it was family style so it would be plenty of food.  if you consider 5 small pieces of beef and a plate full of lettuce enough then you are in the right place.  the one piece off beef i had was good.  too bad they are too cheap to actually make it family style.  the worst part was the noodles.  when i order noodles i expect a plate full of noodles.  this was individual coils of noodles stood up on their end in a bamboo steam pot.  there was 20 noodles with a tiger dipping sauce.  i almost spit up up the sauce on the first bite.  was like dirty water.  way too much hype very little to actually eat.  i will never go back.", 
            "we returned to this restaurant during our december 2013 visit.  we were not disappointed.  \n\nwe shared <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, <mark>Beijing Glass</mark>, <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>, happy family, mongolioan <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark> and pato pasilla.  each dish was wonderful.\n\nthe waiter convinced the two birthday girls at the table to get the mango rice dessert.  it was amazing.  puffed rice, mango, whipped topping and other delights.  not a disappointed diner amongst us.", 
            "we were running late on a concert night at the cosmo and it was a rare show where we actually cared about the opening act, so time was of the essence.   while doing a yelp search from the elevator we decided upon china poblano as:\n\n1) \"tacos sound kinda good right now\"\n2) \"it's jose andres!   that dude's been on bourdain and top chef so he's legit\"\nand\n3) \"it gets 3 stars on yelp!  that means it's gotta be....   wait, 3 stars?!?\"  \n\nso we went anyway even though a straight up 3 is typically below my snooty yelp threshold of place to visit.   i'm glad we did.    we started by looking at some signature cocktails presented to us that arent on the main menu.   i wanted the aviation which has been one of my go-to drinks lately, and my lady friend wanted something i don't remember the name of, but it was something that didnt sound very \"manly\" like \"the snow willow\"   or \"the kitten's purr\"   it had cucumber as a main fixture and didn't sound appealing at all to me.    naturally my friend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> my drink for me and forced me to order the other one.   i tried both and all i'll say is, the aviation was delicious! quick wait service update:  after we put in the drink order, our waiter disappeared for what i felt was a long time.   we sat without drinks and without placing our order for i'd say a good 12 minutes.   we were definitely looking left and right for a trace of him as if we were trying to jaywalk across a busy intersection.   \n\nso given that we had a bit of a break, i went to yelp to try to find some recommendations.   i went with 4 tacos (they're small and i'm big).   and my dining companion went with <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark>.    as long as we had to wait to get our drinks and orders in, the wait for the food was exceptionally as short.   it seemed like only 5 minutes had passed before a few of my tacos from my order arrived, and only a few minutes after that the <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark> showed up.   \n\nfor my 2nd list of the review, here are all 4 tacos i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> and ate\n\n1)  lengua (beef tongue) -  delicious as beef tongue usually is.   melt in your mouth, well seasoned.  \n2)  <mark>Viva China</mark> (beef tendon/oysters) - disappointed in this one as the reviews seemed highly favorable.   i must admit i'm not a huge oyster fan, but to me the flavors of the oysters and the tendon just didn't co-mingle well.   \n3) carnitas - my favorite.   the pork was tender and delicious and i loved the contrast the crunch and flavor of the pork rinds provided.\n4) i cant find the 4th one i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> on the menu.   either that or i had too much of that cucumber drink and lost my mind accordingly.   it was some sort of beef short rib with some sort of chile i thought.   it was tasty and the chile brought a lot of smoky flavor to it.   it didn't really offer up anything unique enough for me to want to order it again though\n\noverall i was very happy with my meal of tacos as a whole.   the tortillas are made to order and taste fantastic.   we actually or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> some on the side to go with the <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark>.  as for that dish i thought i was a bit underwhelming.   the beef was flavorful and it tastes exactly how its described in the menu with the ginger/soy/vinegar components, but there just wasn't any extra oomph to justify spending nearly $20 on it.   the tacos, albeit small, are well worth the $5.50 a piece they generally command.   i like the idea that you could just come in here, grab a drink and a few tacos and be in and out in a reasonable time (if your waiter doesnt take an extended break like ours seemed to) for about $20, or go all out and share a bunch of dishes for an extravagant (and expensive) meal.   not many places, especially at the cosmo, give you that option.", 
            "i really wanted to like this place because we were starving and seriously craving some asian noodles after a night of drinking. we came down here to eat after we couldn't handle marquee day club anymore.\n\nthe three of us or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the dan dan mien, wonton noodle soup and the <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark> dish to share. my favorite was the <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark> dish, only because the other two were  disappointing. portions were pretty small overall, sadly. i really wanted soup, and the broth in the noodle soup was bland, but the wontons were yummy! there were barely any egg noodles.\n\nthe chewiness of the dan dan mien was perfect though! and the service was exceptional too. i also enjoyed the restaurant decor because it was really fun and cute, and loved the wallpaper and asian style decorations.\n\nthe food is ok, pretty overpriced, but the restaurant is fun and the service is great. it's really a toss up since this seems to be one of the only asian restaurants at the cosmopolitan.", 
            "after looking at other reviews i was skeptic of how this place would be, but gave it a try based on the menu. i'm glad i went despite others bad experiences because this was fantastic. we had the 18 noodle and the <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark>, both incredible. if you're looking to get full it's going to cost you a lot, but if you're looking to try a few things tapas style it's fantastic. i highly recommend it.", 
            "located in the cosmopolitan next to the entrance of marquee. it's a cute restaurant with chinese/mexican decor. on the outside, you can order food at the \"take out\" windows (left is chinese, right is mexican). the type of food you get is made in that specific kitchen so everything comes out at different times. the interior decor was just as good as the outside. mad props to the decorator. \n\nalso, came with a group of 12 without a reservation, though the place was busy they managed to seat us in 5 minutes on a saturday. the service inside was just as good. our waiter was very knowledgeable.\n\npretty much everything here is made to share, with the exception of the tacos. they suggest that each person have 2-3 plates to themselves. if you eat a lot like me and are on a budget, this place isn't for you or maybe just get a taco.\n\nhighlights:\n*canitas taco $5.50 - pretty good but was oily\n*<mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark> $18.88 - type of meat they used was great, lettuce was good with the sauce. highly suggest this dish.\n*pozole rojo with a shot of reposado tequila $15 (w/out shot $12) - they tell you to add the shot to the pozole but i suggest you don't and just take the shot straight. some people liked it in the soup, and others didn't\n*<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> $12.88 - not bad/pretty average.\n*<mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> $19.88 - really good! you can add meat for an additional price but it's great the way it is\n\nif you don't want to make a decision on individual items, they do offer 3 tasting menus (<mark>Chef's Experience</mark> $55/person - combination of china/mexico dishes, <mark>Jose's Way</mark> $75/person - more unique dishes, & <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark> $35 - 4 of their unique cocktails)"

            "the only thing bad about this place is the price.  i have no clue why they get only 3 stars.  this place politely served my wife and i the best brunch we have ever had.  i mean perfectly poached <mark>Quail Egg</mark> nesting on exquisite dumplings . . . . um yeah . . . i want some more!\n\ntheir cocktails were phenomenal and way out-of-the-box!  matcha tea in a cocktail, and it's amazing . . . this place gots it going on!!!", 
            "i'm really surprised this place has only three stars. the boy and i came here on our last night in vegas and it was easily the best meal we'd had all weekend. since i imagine a lot of vacationers are frequenting this spot, i'll break down what we had:\n\nsalt and <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>: probably the best margarita i've ever had\n\ntaro chips: unbelievable. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> these for our ceviche, but i was gobbling them up on their own. insanely crisp and delicious.\n\n<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>: delicious. and quite a large portion for the price. the only complaint i might have is that by the bottom of the bowl, the tuna was completely overpowered by the dregs of citrus juice, but to be fair we ate this quite slowly interspersed with other dishes. might've had more time than normal for the tuna to get over marinated.\n\nsiu mai w/ <mark>Quail Egg</mark>: the best dish of the night, and easily the best siu mai i've ever had. and trust me, i live in queens in nyc, i know my asian food. the meat was soft, insanely flavorful, and the eggs just bursts with a creamy eggy-ness in your mouth.\n\npork buns (<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>): disappointing. i wouldn't be able to tell the difference between these and any old pork bun i come across. not necessarily bad, but not great.\n\nduck tongue taco (silencio): i am a fan of trying absolutely anything and everything, but this was just downright weird. i commend them for getting the tongue that soft, but the flavor wasn't appealing. \n\nbeef tendon taco (<mark>Viva China</mark>): outstanding. the beef tendon is crispy and packs an amazing amount of flavor. the sauce is delicious. \n\ncarnitas taco: my absolute favorite. i've never had such good meat in a carnitas taco. \n\ntwenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>: this one was interesting. first of all, i should mention that my boyfriend can't stand onions, so i sadly had to get this sans any kind of onions or scallions. i bet that would really add to the flavor. however, even without onions, this dish got a hold of me. at first i thought \"meh, it's <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>,\" but with each subsequent bite, i began to realize, \"wait, this is the best <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> i've ever had.\" every bite had a new vegetable. and the boy literally licked the bowl clean. \n\nchocolate teracotta warrior: really, we got this because we wanted our special dinner to end with some kind of dessert. the presentation is stunning, and the ginger ice cream mixed with the chocolate crumbles is delicious, but i could've done without this one. i have a feeling their other desserts are probably better.\n\nthe service throughout the meal was great, our waiter was very attentive and helpful in giving us tips on what we might want to order. and the vibe of the place was very nice. casual, but upscale. and not crowded. i would definitely come here again.", 
            "went here on a saturday it was pretty full, so we took a seat at the bar. we were quickly approached by the bartender, she was very knowledgable about the tequila and various other spirits. her recommendations on he tequila she served us were right in the money. as for the food, we tried several different tacos pork, short rib, lobster, fish. they were small but very tasty. we also enjoyed the fish and chips as well as her recommendations of some shumai with <mark>Quail Egg</mark> on it. they were really really good. i love andres, and before you go in there, as a diner should always have an idea if what you're gonna pay; to me it was just about right.  the fusion of asian and spanish inspired dishes is interesting and something you don't see everywhere. of course i wish portions were bigger, but there is a lot of detail placed in these small plates. i would recommend everyone go to a jose andres restaurant at some point in their lives.", 
            "this is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in las vegas. every time i go, i tried to order something new exciting and different to me. i have my staples that i order every time such as the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco which includes crispy beef tendon and lightly poached oysters. delicious. the carnitas are very tender and flavorful, and served with a salsa cruda and pork rind on top. this visit my fiancee and i tried the steamed pork buns and <mark>Quail Egg</mark> shu mai for the first time, and both were immediate favorites! the buns were filled with sweet and slightly spiced barbecue pork, perhaps a little too sweet, but the toothy chewy dough made a great balance. the shu mai is something i will order again and recommend heavily.. there was delicious and delicate minced filling in a tender dumpling with a just very slightly steamed <mark>Quail Egg</mark> nestled right in the top of each one. it made for one epic mouth experience, salty and creamy with an appealing texture. the agua fresca was a perfect compliment.",

            "spent our 24th anniversary at china poblano and we were so, so satisfied.  but be warned this is a trendy \"small plate\" big price restaurant which means both your wallet and your stomach could be left empty. however, the food is delicious, the atmosphere fun and the service impeccable, if a bit pretentious (each food runner describes the dish you just or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> as they deliver it to your table in case you are so drunk on their incredible tequila offerings that you need reminding). \n\nchina poblano offers both mexican and chinese dishes side by side, hence the name.  i was hoping for more of a fusion concept but dove in with all tastebuds firing. \n\nnumber one: get the carnitas taco.  at $5.50 it is moist, flavorful and meaty!  yes there should be at least 2 if not 3 tacos for that price but trust me, ignore the price and just order a lot of these! \n\nthe guacamole and warm tortillas are delicious and filling.  the <mark>Quail Egg</mark> shumai are great and you get 6 of them in one order.  the pozole is good and satisfying, not the best i've had but good.  the dan dan noodles were earthy tasting and not my favorite although the actual noodles were wonderful, the topping tasted of pungent, ground earth, maybe not bad, but not my taste.\n\nfor dessert, we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the churros with oaxacan chocolate.  this was off.  the churros were flavorless and not sweet enough although the texture was right.  the chocolate was bad.  the flavor was mingled with an unrecognizable savory, spice that we didn't care for at all.  \n\nhad a fabulous 1.5 oz. pour of tequila.  their tequila menu is extensive and organized by highland and lowland brands.  also their take on the classic margarita is really fun with a salty foam topping that is delicious for those who enjoy a salted margarita.  \n\nthe prices are ridiculous which is why i am not giving the place 5 stars. but it's the new vegas and long gone are the crappy $1.99 buffets about which i am certainly not complaining.  however, it seems we've moved to the opposite end of the spectrum, serving higher quality food while gouging people with prices 4 times the actual cost of the ingredients.  i hope in my lifetime, we see a happy balance between the two.\n\nbut if you're willing to blithely open your pocketbook, you're in for a great meal!", 
            "chinese food, mexican food, and jose andres. three of my favorite things in the entire world. combine them all together and it creates this harmonious bliss of magnificent food and dining.\n\ni am so sad that we only came here for lunch so i only was able to sample a few items. thankfully, vegas is only 5 hours away from san diego and i will be sure to  eat at china poblano the next time i visit!\n\nfirstly, i just love the ambiance of jose andres' restaurants. they are worldly, fun and adult at the same time. between courses i was entertained by watching the pictures on the wall change from chinese and south american peasants to mao zedung.\n\nthe margaritas we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> were spectacular. while i was tempted to order the margarita with the salt air (to brag about the pretentious \"salt air\" lol) i went with the <mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark>. it was balanced, but super strong. one was enough to start my vegas party blood pumping!\n\nmy friends and i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a variety of tacos, which were all fantastic. i am a sucker for carnitas. while i have no shortage of those tacos in san diego, none of them are topped with chicarrones like the ones at china poblano! it added the perfect crunch to the perfectly cooked and tender pork. the carnitas weren't overly salty as they can be at other restaurants.\n\nwe split the dan dan noodles that came with black vinegar (oh black vinegar, how i love thee) and were so delicious. the guacamole was rich and flavorful. i love that it was served with tortillas and not just chips. \n\nmy favorite dish was the siu mai with <mark>Quail Egg</mark>. i have grown up eating siu mai - it is among my top favorite dim sum dishes...holy crap china poblano's siu mai was amazing! the <mark>Quail Egg</mark> on top was so perfect (see my picture). the yolk was runny and gave the already delectable siu mai flavors an extra kick. \n\nchina poblano, i will be back!",

            "my friend talked up chef jose andres so much on a (sorta) recent trip to dc that the name stuck, and after seeing it tagged to china poblano at the cosmopolitan, i figured it was destiny calling and just had to try it. \n\ni'm not really of the belief that culinary experiences, however life-changing they may be, should break the bank and i'll just tell you now that for two people, drinks, four small plates and dessert, came in at about a couple dollars over 100--but make an exception for this place because it was pretty effing good. \n\njust know what to order. \n\nthe 18 <mark>18 Monk Noodle</mark> was so amazing. you don't even realize the noodles are whole wheat, because they're just so good with the sauce and the shitakes. our waiter suggested we opt for the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> as opposed to the ceviche pargo and i could've, no wait--should've hugged him for it. the tuna was so fresh. the soy it was bathed in and amaranth seeds that topped it really enhanced the fish in a way that is pretty indescribable. \n\nwe also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, and the xo scallops in <mark>XO Sauce</mark>. i wouldn't recommend either because you didn't really come here for melted cheese and i don't want you to pay $18.88 for two golf-sized scallops, respectively. that was our mistake--but don't make it yours! a side note, they were both good, but not great and your hard earned dollars deserve great, okay?\n\nafter dollar signs kept racing through my head as i tried to figure out the damage, i wasn't really up to pay another double-digit figure for dessert, but the lady next to us devoured her mango sticky rice in a matter of minutes, so we thought, we'd come this far. #yolo \n\nanyways, it was so incredibly good! it's not your traditional thai-place-msr by any means. it's so light and airy and everything in it just works so well that as i write this all i really want to do is drive down to the cosmopolitan in my jammies and order it. \n\nas far as the service, and given it was a tuesday night, we got seated right away. our waiter, miller, was awesome! he didn't shy away from putting his two-cents when he knew we were making potentially catastrophic mistakes trying to decide what to eat and god bless him for it.", 
            "as a vegas regular visitor i'd have to say this was easily in the top 3 most memorable and delicious lunches i've had on the strip at any price point. we got the 18 <mark>18 Monk Noodle</mark>, beef sui mai, <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> taco, pescado a la plancha taco and mango sticky rice and it was a nice sized meal for two. \n\nthe mango sticky rice was the standout - crispy rice puffs sprinkled over light fluffy cream, with ripe, cold mango chunks at the bottom\n\nthere was a 15 minute wait for a table for 2 on a holiday weekend saturday afternoon so very accessible.",

            "when i first saw china poblano, i thought it was just some gussied up chinese joint at the cosmopolitan.  when i looked a little closer, i realized it was some kind of combo mexican-chinese restaurant.  when i checked them out on my phone, i learned they were a jose andres creation.  when my friends suggested them for lunch, i was game.  when we were done, i was sorely unimpressed.\n\nnow, it's probably my fault for assuming, but looking at the place, i was under the impression that china poblano offered a fusion of chinese and mexican food.  in reality, they mostly offer chinese and mexican food.  as in, one and the other.  not as in, a melding of two very different cuisines.  disappointing enough already, but that also meant having to get two things in order to try both sides of the menu.  after asking the waiter for suggestions, i took his advice and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a couple of tacos to go with my noodle dish (he warned that the portions were \"small-ish\"):\n\n- <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gj_bxupv672ywng4tnejog?select=1znpnnpui4mude6ntxrxea) - underwhelming.  the noodles themselves were okay and i liked how the pork sauce was actually spicy, but the dish seemed salty.  really, the only flavors i could really get out of it was spiciness and saltiness.  i didn't expect much and they still fell short.\n- carnitas taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gj_bxupv672ywng4tnejog?select=bqntt9gfks5ol5gszhwr2a) - fail.  unlike my noodle dish, i actually had hopes for this one.  rather than crispy, grilled meat, i was greeted with a mound of shredded pork dripping with oil (check out the ends of the wrapper) and a topping of deep fried fat (think pork rinds but worse).  no bueno.\n- pescado frito (fried fish) taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gj_bxupv672ywng4tnejog?select=ilju8hdfd1exvl_ezkffea) - by default, it was the best thing i had.  on its own, it was only decent.  the fish and pickled onions worked, but i thought the flavor was too muted.  if it was a little stronger, i would have liked it more.\n\ngiven the celebrity chef owner and china poblano's location on the strip, the meal wasn't cheap.  to charge $5.50 for that carnitas taco (and to a lesser extent, $6.50 for that pescado taco) is practically criminal though.  with just the $12 i spent on the tacos, i can find a better chinese noodle dish and tacos, and still have change to tip.  unless you're a big jose andres fan, you're better off going elsewhere (like holstein's next door).", 
            "while i'd never discourage someone from making their own discoveries our food experience was borderline horrible. \n\nthe cocktails (margaritas are topped with salted air which were refreshing and unique) and beers were spot on and the service polished and sharp. however the overpriced food was hit and miss. sui mai should be avoided (weird spongy texture and off tasting) as well as the weird tasting <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> and the ugly dancing eggplant. \n\nbright spots were the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> (awesome), unruly monk, guacamole, <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> and the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>. tacos are 2 bites and are $5.50 for one which i couldn't swallow the price tag so we skipped the tacos. bill was $240+ tip for 3 people. we left buzzed and full but we'd have a hard time going back except for drinks and maybe a few of the bright spots mentioned above.\n\nif you want killer dumplings and regional chinese food go to chinatown. for mexican food there are loads of more affordable and tastier options off strip.", 
            "a strange combination, but one that works. personally, i would say the chinese half of the menu outshines the mexican portion, but both are filled with many good choices that are more than enough to fill you up.\n\nfirst off, the specialty cocktails here are great, and should not be avoided it you can help it.  the highlights from each of the menus would have to be: '<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>' (char siu bao) from the chinese manu, and the carnitas tacos from the mexican menu.  the beef sui mai is also good, but i would avoid the traditional sui mai which is a bit bland.  the lamb potstickers, mongolian beef, and <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> are also great, along with <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> and <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> from the mexican side of the menu.\n\nlike it's neighbor holstein's, this place is definitely best for lunch, but you'll be perfectly happy having dinner here as well.\n\nchina poblano takes a very novel idea, and executes it well enough.  is it the best chinese or mexican food you'll find on the strip? no, but its very good, and when combined into one restaurant, you have a very unique place to eat that doesn't disappoint.", 
            "as far as chinese food goes, they're making an effort. there's the \"kitchen\" in front that you can watch through a window from outside as a few chefs who given their appearance are most likely direct chinese imports, acquired to boost authenticity both visually and gustatorially. there is the real kitchen that you don't see though, and most likely all the food that isn't a steamed bun is created back there by who knows who.\n\nfitting the cosmopolitan hotel, the digs are stylish and interesting and modern. service is excellent and the menu has great variety, but prices are steep. i was surprised to see that they had rou jia mou on the menu, being somewhat obscure here in the united states to the average person, but i didn't order it. my friend did, and my initial reservation about the price to size assessment were correct. a typical rou jia mou is something like sauced pork in a flatbread sandwich about five inches in diameter (to simplify the explanation). this one was sized accurately and slipped into a protective waxed paper pocket to keep fingers clean. $8.88 is much too steep for such a \"snack,\" even in the somewhat stylish surroundings. the meat in the rou jia mou had the same shortcomings that i've seen in other restaurants in the same dish and in beef rolls. the sauce is correct, but the meat is flavorless-if it is done properly, the sauce flavor permeates the meat instead of just covering it.\n\ni had the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>, the noodles being very good, but the sauce had no kick, no spice. that seemed to be a re-occuring theme throughout our table's dishes- weak flavor.\n\ni'm tempted to return simply because i hadn't explored the mexican side of the menu, especially because that is one thing that this country does \"right\" more often, but my reservations continue to be about price. perhaps if i'm in the casino again and flush with winnings, i'll return. otherwise, there's much more culinary turf to explore in the city.", 
            "located in the cosmopolitan - i have to say what first caught my eye about this place was their viewing window where i could see them making pork buns, and also the fact it said there was take out. pork buns + take out = win! (not quite what happened but probably would have gotten more stars had that been the case.) \n\nchinese cuisine + mexican cuisine = china poblano. i'd say this is a fusion of the two but on the menu literally its two separate cuisines you can order from, no mingling at least not that my eyes could see. \n\norder consisted of: \n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> (4 pieces) - steamed pork buns $13.88\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - wheat noodles with spicy pork sauce $12.00\n<mark>Lychee Sour</mark> - yummy drink $12.00 \n\nso our waitress warned us that portions were small and that we should most likely order multiple things hence my pork buns and noodle dish. the pork buns to me were correctly portioned, i split the order with a friend thankfully because she had or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a single $10 lobster taco and $14 <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>. the waitress really wasn't lying on small portions i give her credit for her honesty. \n\nthe food was overall pretty good. i loved the flavor of the meat in the pork buns but was a little turned off by the meat being lukewarm/cold. my noodle dish was the kind of spicy i enjoy but i had to \"pace\" myself with the small dish swimming in a large bowl (i didn't understand this presentation, the lets make our portions look even smaller with using larger serving bowls?). the <mark>Lychee Sour</mark>, was probably my favorite part of the whole meal. it was a different type of cocktail, tangy yet sweet, and oh how i love lychee.\n\noverall a bit pricey for my taste given it wasn't anything overly special or wow factor. perhaps i'd order the steamed pork buns again from the take out window given i could request the meat be a little more on the warm side.", 
            "yesterday was actually \"take two\" for us here, since we planned on meeting a friend for dinner.  he got called in to work and couldn't make it, but it wasn't necessarily a \"tragic evening\", because the food here is pretty amazing.\n\na quirky but compelling mix of chinese and mexican cuisine (but not on the same plate, thank gawd!), you're free to mix-and-match however you please, just like the decor, which i can only describe as \"big trouble in little chinese tijuana.\"\n\nwe started off with <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>. i am a sucker for fresh, warm chips and these pretty much ruled.  most with a palate for something a little kickier will find the salsa wanting, but having been burned by too many muy caliente sauces in the past, i found this one just right.\n\nbear kicked it off with one of the tacos as well - i don't remember which, but the blissful look on his face was recommendation enough for me.  i decided to mix it up with two tacos: the chicken and mole poblano and the bbq pork with marinated onions, along with \"<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\": four delicately steamed buns filled with more bbq pork.  bear had the \"special 8\" dim sum - (probably not getting the name right, but i won't forget that taste!) - delicate, tasty jewels of meat, spices and veggies swathed in very light wrappers. i had bites of the chicken and pork...which i will have to definitely try in the future!\n\nit was all a-mazing. paired with rum-and-cokes for me (<mark>Negra Modelo</mark> for bear), the tastes of each item are light and exquisite - tender meats, flavorful but not overpowering sauces, but don't sit brick-like in your stomach as most chain-restaurant style chinese and/or mexican foods have a tendency to do.  \n\nbecause i'd really had a taste for some pho noodles all week (nursing a pretty wicked cold earlier), i knew i wouldn't get them here, but when i saw \"dan-<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>\" noodles on the menu, i knew i wasn't leaving until i had some, which i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> in lieu of dessert.  i love good \"dan-dan\" as much as the next chinese food enthusiast, but these? not saying it wasn't a healthy sized portion, but these bad boys made me wish for a kiddie-pool sized bowl that i could jump into and do the backstroke in. oh, yeah.  they are that. freakin'. good.\n\nbear had a dessert i did have a bite of - mangos with a light creamy sauce and maybe pine nuts? - that i made a mental note to have next time we visit.\n\nto sum it up - awesome food, great service from everyone, but most especially from our bartender/server casey. however, i only have one 'caveat' to present.  when the bill arrived, it did give me one of those \"ruh-roh, raggy!\" moments when i saw the total.  not saying you have to be mark cuban or steve wynn to eat here, but if you have a more-than-healthy appetite - and we do, you may want to put china <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> \"special occasions only\" list.  it's just that all that wonderful food does add up (all tacos, dim sum and other items are priced separately), so you may want to have a \"point guard\" with you to keep an eye on the rising tab. \n\nother than that, i would dare say that we'll be back!",

(i dig the giant walk-through buddha in lieu of a door.)  it's one of chef jose andres' casual joints, in contrast to the fancier jaleo and \\u00e9 upstairs.  the place fills up fast at lunchtime, but i was lucky enough to score a seat at the bar without waiting at around 11:30am on a saturday.\n\nthe menu is divided into chinese and mexican small plates.  everything is served tapas-style.  nothing is particularly authentic, but what do you expect in a las vegas hotel-casino?\n\ni started with one of the specials of the day -- elote and squash blossoms.  loved the flavors and textures, especially the crunchy bits of elote sprinkled throughout.  everything was very fresh, light, and enjoyable.\n\nnext, i had the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> (wheat noodles with spicy pork sauce and peanuts).  this was a good complement to the elote, because its profile of flavors and textures was the diametric opposite.  the noodles were rich and heavy -- probably too heavy for most people.  the spicy pork sauce was almost like thick clay in consistency.  i didn't mind, but i'm also not sure if that was intentional or not.\n\ni washed my lunch down with china poblano's specialty beverage of the house -- the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> (spiked with pomegranate).  this was a unique take on a classic cocktail, with a salty foam on top in lieu of the traditional salt rim.  very refreshing.\n\nbar service is very upbeat and friendly -- and so are the other patrons!  everyone eating here seems to be coming or going in an alcohol-induced haze, so expect revelry.\n\nprices are definitely high.  i'm still smarting over that $14 margarita.  \n\nthat said, i'd go back.  the menu is just too tempting to resist!",

            "i think this will most likely be a letdown for most people. given the breadth of variety and quality of dining options in vegas, i would skip it. if you are a jose andres faithful and you just absolutely must, get the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>. \n\nfirst of all, the outside seating is not fun. you're basically sitting on glorified wooden crates and when we got up to leave everyone's rear was a little sore. this makes me sound like such a pansy. not a dealbreaker on it's own, but just a note. also, as others have mentioned, this restaurant is not a fusion restaurant. not a big deal if you don't expect it, but just know that there's definitely no culinary cultural mash up to be had here. \n\nanyway, i went with two friends and we were pretty hungry and pretty comprehensive in our order. we got an item from each section of the menu except for soups and salads, because that's what the real pansies order. here's what we got and what i thought.   \n\ntacos: <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> - i mean it's decent, but it's not what we were expecting. not anything special at all. also, teeny tiny. very little chorizo. i know the chorizo is calling your name but don't do it. you end up with a $5 mouthful of regret. pass. \n\ndim sum: <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> - ugh. i didn't plan on this review being such a downer, but if i'm being honest, this is another pass. this tasted fine, but it was a steamed pork bun! for $14! we love steamed pork buns so we went for it, but expected some tender fall off the bone flavorful magic for this price. but like, it was totally standard and not special at all. pass.  \n\nnoodles: <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - this was pretty good. i'm a fan and if i came back i would get this again. it had a nice kick to it and the noodles had a nice al dente texture. i need to note that even though this is the one thing i will vouch for, it was a little on the salty side. but i'd do it again. play. \n\nfrom china: twenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> - i am a sucker for any sort of endorsement ever. the waiter says travel channel liked it? yes, ok, yes please. and then out comes this extra small portion of <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> that is so not worth $20 and then you feel like, maybe the waiter played you like a fiddle. pass.\n\nfrom mexico: <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> - i really didn't like this at all but to be fair i'm in the .001% of the nations's population that doesn't particularly care for fries. also i never really like mole sauce because it feels misleading. you can't bill yourself as a chocolate sauce and not taste anything like chocolate. and sometimes i forget it doesn't taste chocolatey at all and i try it again and it's like ugh fleeced again. but that's neither here nor there. pass.\n\nin hindsight, this really makes it sound like i hated it. which i totally didn't, i was just very underwhelmed. as i'm originally from the dc area, i've tried several of jose andres' restaurants and have always been absolutely obsessed with all his creations. so maybe i've set the bar high because i've had such good things from his places before, or maybe i'm just extra judgey because i grew up eating both these cuisines so i've had much better at cheaper prices before? dunno. either way, despite being very hungry, all of us were just kind of like, meh, this is so not on par with his other restaurants. again, nothing is terrible, it's just not very good. i think it just isn't worth the prices when there are so many more incredible options just a few steps away down the strip.", 
            "on the outside (which is inside the cosmopolitan), it resembles that of a truck/street vendor, but don't be fooled: here lies a 2-in-1 deal so unique.\n\nto the right is the mexican food, to the left is the chinese food. your choice, choose wisely.  \n\ni decided to go with carb overload and steer towards the noodles.  <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> they're called: wheat noodles with spicy pork bits.  it was incredible. when it arrived, my first thought was \"this is freakin' tiny\".  i thought i could eat five of them!  so yes, small portion...but wowww is it tasty.  \n\nalso went with the salt and <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>, which my bartender creatively added a touch of hibiscus tequila to it.  i give her props too, because she could give a tequila lesson to anyone who could listen. the salt \"air\" was <mark>Swallow a Cloud</mark> of ecstasy.  yum.\n\nso yeah... a little expensive but unique dishes.", 
            "china poblano is such a waste of money. do not come here! as i was walking through cosmopolitan, i didn't really pay much attention to this little asian-mexican joint because it looked like an unappetizing fast food spot, but what did catch my eye was jose andres' name plastered in front of the restaurant.  i've fallen in love with jose andres ever since my enjoyable experience at the bazzar so i just had to try it.  of course i knew it wasn't going to be the same, but this just wasn't even good... for any type of standard.  i wanted to try an item from both sides so i opted for the lobster taco and their <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> noodles.  the lobster taco was about $10 and the noodles were around $16?  both were extremely overpriced for what i got and i honestly don't mind forking out the cash for good food, but this did not even come close.  the portions were extremely small for both, not to mention that my lobster taco was soggy.  the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> noodles were supposed to be one of their more popular items and i can tell you that there are about a million places in 626 that do it better for about $6.  i regret coming here and should've just gone to secret pizza.  china poblano, how dare you taint jose andres' reputation like that!!", 
            "it's a shame that this place doesn't have better food. chinese/mexican concept is great because i'm a fan of both, but the execution just didn't work. the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> didn't have much flavor other than an overwhelming taste of salt. the gan pung ji chicken was dry, and the lucky sui mai tasted like frozen dim sum that was simply heated. the only positive memory i have was that their guacamole was good. the ambience of the restaurant and its location inside the cosmopolitan really has a lot of potential. if only the food didn't suck.", 
            "this is what food is about. a perfect confluence of cultures and flavors. fresh, fast and varied. the menu hits all the sweet spots while still being inventive. definitely order an item from each category: taco, dim sum and noodles. our favorites on this visits: chilorio <mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> (taco: short rib, padilla negro, cumin, cilantro) and <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> ( wheat noodles, spicy pork sauce/peanuts). \n\nthe aesthetic of place: surreal mixture of hispanic meets asian. funky and fun like a street art house. \n\ncome and enjoy...as we have, did and will\ndo.", 
            "if you read my review of jaleo, you will find that i love, love, love jose andres and everthing he touches. china poblano is one of my go-to restaurants every time my mom comes into town and asks me where i want to eat (i mean, it is pricy, so i only get to go on my mom's dime ;) ) everything is so delicious, the service is always on point, and both are consistent. \n\nyes, it is expensive (their menu is online available through the cosmopolitan website with all prices clearly listed). yes, the portions are small. yes, it is really more chinese food + mexican food than it is fusion (the food comes from two separate kitchens, after all). \n\nwe always try to order the more rare / odd items .. can't seem to bring myself to pay $14 for a tiny order of siu mai that would probably be better at a dirty hole in the wall dim sum restaurant (sidenote: can anyone recommend a good dim sum restaurant nearby?)\n\n--\nfavorite items:\nguacamole with <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> - $15. handmade at the table, deliciously chunky. bypass if trying to save money, get it if you're splurging\n\n<mark>Viva China</mark> taco - $5.50. rich, chewy, juicy, salty, gooey. bypass if you do not like foods with \"weird\" textures. \n\n<mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> - $12.88. pretty, deliciously crispy on the outside and moist, tender lamb on the inside. must have\n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - $12.88. love the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the sauce. could be spicier. have never had authentic dan dan noodles, so i could not tell you if these are authentic or not, but delicious nonetheless. must have. \n\n<mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> - $11.88. this is the biggest portion of hot and sour soup i've ever seen in my life. definitely meant for at least 4 people. not a traditional hot and sour soup. is pretty thick. very good. \n\ndiscontinued items?:\nthey had this chile-relleno type item once with pomegranate seeds on it. it did not look appetizing but was delicious. it looks like a frog with red warts on it. i no longer see it on the menu so it may have been a special, but if you see it, i recommend it!\n\nthey also used to have scallop ceviche - super untraditional and really expensive for what you are getting, but really fun. tiny little lime with a slice of raw scallop and some brown sugar in between. sprayed with tequila. you are meant to pop the scallop in your mouth and bite into the lime in one fell swoop. i no longer see it on the menu, though. \n--\ndrinks:\n<mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> - $14. what fun! yummy, boozy fun. \n<mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark> - $15 / glass. yummy, but be careful, it's pretty spicy! \n--\n\nnot such a fan of:\nthey always push the 20-vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> because johnny iuzzini said it was his favorite dish on the show \"best thing i ever ate.\" i find it bland, boring, and wayyyyy overpriced.\n\ndancing eggplant - really pretty! i don't really like eggplant in general, though. \n--\n\ncons about the restaurant itself:\nthe restaurant is literally right outside of marquee. at lunch in the summer, it's overrun by trashy girls in swimsuits without coverups and douchey bros trying to get into the dayclub. at dinner time, it's overrun by girls in skimpy dresses wobbling in their heels and douchey bros with popped collars trying to get into the nightclub. luckily, if you have a reservation, you never have to wait for long, and sometimes they will have you wait inside on the steps rather than out in the throng. \n\nthe chairs in the middle of the restaurant have no backs. i'm a sloucher anyway, but sometimes after a big meal you want to lean back and pat your belly, but if you try to do that you will just topple over. there are no purse hooks under the table, and since the chairs don't have backs, you either have to hold your bag in your lap or, if you are lucky enough to be a group with an odd number of people, on the spare seat.", 
            "first of all, this place isn't really fusion, it's chinese and mexican side-by-side. but that's okay. the chinese food was definitely better than the tacos we tried (which were good i'm from california and my standards for tacos are very high). this place is worth it for the chinese food. the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> was to die for. our dumplings were excellent too. i would go back for the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> alone! \n\nthe ambiance is good. festive, and the decor is interesting to look at. i do wish more of the seats had backs on them, though.\n\nservice was excellent.", 
            "first off, the service was superb!  our waitress and busboys were moving like lightning with a packed restaurant.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the day of the dead tasting menu for a party of seven and had:\n\n-<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\n-siu mai\n-taquitos\n-guacamole in small pasta cups\n-lamb pot stickers\n-<mark>Fried Wonton</mark>\n-<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>\n-<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>\n-<mark>Chicken Ji Song</mark>\n-col de asparagus\n-<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>\n-dessert with coffee ice cream, bananas and chocolate\n\nit wasn't cheap at $65/person, but dang there was a lot of food.  the food was good, not great, sometimes a little bland.  that, and the fact that a tiny margarita costs $13, lost them the fifth star.  once again, great service!",

            "the dishes were surprisingly small so we ended up ordering quite a few. pricey, but nothing unusual for vegas. i didn't find anything really memorable. the food was okay. none of us were sure what to order, so we went with the waiter's suggestions.\n\nthe meal started off great. the chips and house made guacamole were really good. i couldn't stop eating the chips. sodium was a absolute treat tonight. i could definitely taste all this good stuff.\n\neach of the dishes, served tapas style, was definitely small and probably meant to be shared. i had the six dishes below. most of them lacked flavor. maybe it was the chef's off night. the best dishes though were definitely the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> and the <mark>Gan Pung Ji Chicken Wings</mark>.\n\n*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*\n\nthe <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> - not the most appealing to look at, but each piece was delectable. we should of just or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> more of this.\n\n<mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> - at the very least, taste like something, please!\n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - what exactly am i eating? there's so little pork that i only taste wheaty noodles and peanut sauce.\n\n<mark>Chicken Ji Song</mark> - this looked like it was going to be good, if only we were able to find where the chef had hidden all the flavor.\n\nbistec con mole amarillo y hongos - the grilled hanger steak, another dish that looked great, but alas, it too suffered from blanditis.\n\nthe <mark>Gan Pung Ji Chicken Wings</mark> - the only other dish worth ordering. so tasty...and so spicy too.\n\n*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*\n\nservice was excellent. our waiter was attentive, did his best with the suggestions and came back often to ask if everything was okay.\n\nprobably a place to visit for something out of the ordinary. it's a fusion place after all, but i wouldn't come hungry. this place didn't really hit the spot. at least you'll have room for late night eats!", 
            "i must have amnesia because i really don't know why i keep coming back here. my first time was when it first opened a few years ago, and i believe i have a review for \"the worst thing i've ever eaten\" see: beef tendon taco w/ bad oyster. about a year and a half ago i went back, and was again taken aback by the incredibly mediocre food and astronomical prices. \n\na few weeks ago a friend and i were prowling the town, looking for a fun spot to grab a bite before we headed to drais for chromeo (woo!), and she'd never been, and again, i guess i blacked out momentarily from hunger, because i was like \"okay! let's go here!\". wrong. it was empty per usual... even though it was 9pm on a friday night. we each or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a <mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark> at $15 a pop, and they didn't even have the courtesy to fill them to top of the glass. we split the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, and there was nothing fun about it. it was a glop of starchy melted cheese. a 5 year old could make it by literally putting a block of monterey jack in the microwave. a very expensive block of $10 cheese. \n\ni had the special, a pork belly taco w/ pineapple at $4 which was nothing special at all, and the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> noodles for $13 which were spicy, excessively sweet, and quite glue-y. she had a bowl of noodles as well, and somehow our bill came to almost $100 w/ tip. what. \n\njose andres- what are you doing. you are amazing, jaleo is amazing (the one in dc is 10x better), bazaar is amazing, this restaurant is a stain <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> reputation. the only pros are the service, which is always great, the manager did come over to see how things were, and we said great, because it's not her fault the food sucks. the servers are attentive as well. the first time i was there i saw mario batali eating in the back in his famous orange crocs, so i suppose that's cool. all this experience did was remind me why i avoid strip celebrity-name restaurants.",

            "we were very impressed with china poblano. to start with, you might like to read this informative story about the ideas behind the place: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/dining/13andres.html the decor is very intriguing, with design coming from seed. the hybridity of mexico and china is reflected in the interesting visuals--mao next to frida kahlo and other variations. the entrance includes a fast-food looking window (chinese food), complete with noodle bar, and a second fast-food window (mexican food) with a tortilla bar. the visual design elements heighten the diner's sense that something hybrid is at play here. we really enjoyed our server who was very informative about the choices. we sampled the love is in the air (a molecular gastronomic take on an heirloom tomato salad). we found the play between salty and sweet to be incredible. the sugar foam is very interesting and i found my taste buds unable to determine, at any one moment, whether it was salty or sweet. the <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> was perhaps the best noodle dish that we have had. it was outstanding in every respect. dancing eggplant is a visual dish that includes bonito flakes that move up and down due to the steam rising from the cooked eggplant. again, an outstanding dish with perfectly cooked eggplant and a delicious sauce. the only down side was the taco (chicen mole). as other reviewers have offered, there is nothing to write home about in terms of the tortillas. they don't seem to replicate street food quality. the chicken was tender, but not the best mole. perhaps they can work out those kinks. overall, you shouldn't miss this place. <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark> and food is intriguing. jose andres is a true genius and artist.", 
            "2.5 stars\n\nunfortunately, i was ultimately disappointed.  the service was actually quite excellent, but the food ultimately fell short, considering the price.  \n\nit was interesting to see that in the front of house, there were two kitchens.  a mexican kitchen and a chinese kitchen on opposite ends.  i was hoping for more fusion entr\\u00e9es, but there were only a few.  the menu was predominantly mexican or chinese.  \n\nsetas tacos: mushroom tacos.  nothing special.  it felt it needed some kind of fresh vegetable in there to add some crunch.\n\n<mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>: actually pretty good with an amazing variety of vegetables in it.  good flavors, season well.  is it worth paying $16 for <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>...however good it may be?  questionable.\n\nthe unruly monk: hand-cut noodle soup.  when it came out, it smelled absolutely amazing and then it went downhill from there.  the hand-cut noodles were overcooked and mushy.  the broth lacked flavor.\n\n<mark>Beijing Glass</mark>: my friend had this one.  it actually had a nice crunch and was refreshing.  i'd call this dish a success.\n\nguacamole: this was really good guacamole with just a hint of heat.  but $12 for only one cup of guac????  c'mon...that's crazy talk. \n\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with <mark>XO Sauce</mark>: interesting concept, but wow...that <mark>XO Sauce</mark> is extremely overpowering and extremely greasy.  i had about 4 fries, but after that, it was too much.\n\nhappy buddha giggling taking a bath: it seemed like a pretty fun dessert.  how can you not like a jello mold of buddha sitting in lychee foam??  it was fun to squeeze his cheeks to make his mouth move, but it was pure novelty and not worth the $10. \n\nall-in-all, it was some hits, but more misses.  great service kinda made up for it.", 
            "the first thing that went wrong was on the wall. at first, i liked the decor --a casual, colorful blend of chinese and mexican motifs --chinese opera masks, oaxacan wood carvings, red glass lanterns, bicycle wheels on the ceiling (not sure the country, but cool). they also had portraits that were actually large projections, that switched every few minutes. so you had frida kahlo, the dalai lama (not chinese, by the way!) and random peasants.\n\nwhat pissed me off before our food even came out was that they were projecting a photo of mao. if you were running a german restaurant, would you put up a picture of hitler? because that's basically who mao was in china. i know it's consi<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> hip and trendy to use mao's image as a cultural icon, but this must stop. \n\nokay, on to the food. the next thing that went wrong was they brought out the wrong order --we'd or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> duck tongue tacos, they brought the beef tendon with kumamoto oyster. my husband took a bite and realized the mistake --and also that the oyster was really off. i could smell it across the table, and no way should a fresh oyster smell that strong. kumamotos are my favorite oyster so i am very familiar with a fresh, sweet specimen. this was wrong. \n\nour server was very friendly and seemed sharp, she took it away with an apology and we got the duck tongue. i took a bite and it was pretty tasty. however, i couldn't get over the fact that i was chewing on a tongue, and tender and flavorful as it was, i couldn't take another bite. \n\nhowever, the salsa that came with the tacos was delicous. i was eating it with a spoon (since i didn't want any more tongue). one of the best salsas i've had, it ranks up there with papalote's in sf and cancun's in berkeley. really amazing. \n\nthe <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> was fresh and healthy --a big mixture of chilled glass noodles and veggies. it was underdressed, however, and finally we asked for extra dressing which helped a lot. \n\nthe gazpacho was a big surprise --we expected the traditional soup presentation, but instead, got a bowl of cut fruit, and a server squeezed orange over it, tableside. it was delicious, with jicama and dragonfruit in the mix. \n\nwe also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the scallop ceviche at the recommendation of our server and this was a huge disappointment. for the price (about $12, i think) we got 4 bay scallops (tiny). the concept was cool --they were served on top of limes that had chiles and sugar on top. you popped the scallop and followed with a squeeze of sugary, spicy lime juice. it just underwhelmed because the scallops were so diminutive and less than stellar. for that price and with that presentation, you expect stellar and full-sized diver freshness. \n\nthe dessert we got was great --tres lychees (a play on tres leches cake). the lychees came three ways --in a milk-soaked cake, whole, on top of the cake, and as a foam. \n\nour whole lunch bill came to about $75, and i was still a little hungry afterwards. if you go, i recommend being extremely judicious with your ordering, read reviews to see what's good, and maybe stash a snack in your purse.\n\nsome people have complained that there isn't enough \"fusion\" on the menu --but most of the dishes (even if they're listed as \"mexican\" or \"chinese\" only) have a twist. we discovered that the twists are not necessarily explained on the menu, and you may get some big surprises (like our gazpacho). so i appreciate what the restaurant is trying to do --blend two disparate traditions in a delicious way, surprise with ingredients, and use molecular techniques when it enhances the food.", 
            "i seriously have no idea why the average is so low for this restaurant. i have been to china poblano twice now, and it can't get better than this!  i am a foodie and know good food when i eat it, so please take this review to heart!\n\nchina poblano is a \"nice casual\" chinese/mexican fusion restaurant at the beautiful cosmopolitan hotel in las vegas.  i have never stayed here, but i can just imagine how beautiful the rooms must be, given the interior of the hotel's main floor.  china is a very eclectically designed restaurant, definitely great for striking up some interesting conversation topics.\n\nallow me to rate what i have eaten there.  everything has been amazing!!\n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> - this is a must if you like cheese.  one of the best queso dishes i have ever tried, complete with handmade, fresh tortillas!\nchilaquiles - delicious and filling...not necessarily sure you need to get this if you are getting the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, as it is the same cheese.\n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> - awesome \"dim sum\" style pork buns...yum!\n<mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles - wonderful cold noodle dish, sort of like a noodle salad...that might not sound that intriguing, but this is a must try as well\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with mole poblano, mexican cream, and queso fresco - a great fries dish not to be missed!\n<mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> - this is what they are famous for.  it's good, but not my fave of what i have tried.\n\npeople i have gone with tried the pork <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>...they were underwhelmed.  they also tried the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> noodles.  i had a bite and they were really good!  i have also heard that the guacamole is just okay (like any other table side guacamole), but i still plan to try it one day.\n\nthis is my go-to restaurant for friday nights in vegas...definitely give this one a try!", 
            "the tacos are delicious! \n\nmy favorite is the carnitas - braised baby pig and spicy salsa verde w/ pork rinds!!! the <mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> was pretty good too. \n\nthe langosta (lobster) taco's were ok. i don't think it was worth it for the price. \n\nthe tacos are the size of mexican street tacos so order a few to taste. \n\nthe <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles is a yummy cold noodle dish w/ veggies. i found it refreshing. the avocados on top were a good mix. \n\ni also had the har gau dumplings. the outside of the dumpling was good, dumplings must be freshly made, but i thought the inside could use a little more taste. \n\noverall, this is a pretty good place for higher end china/mex. it's tough to find a china mex restaurant anyway.", 
            "stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for something new on the strip. we succeeded!  first, the decor is pretty funky....a good fusion of mexican and asian crafts and art. i loved the \"staircase\" waiting area with cushions and the metallic art on the walls of lizards and ancient masks.  the food wasn't the best i've had but definitely hit the spot. some dishes were top notch: <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles, twenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> (little salty).  others were good: carnitas tacos and lucky 8 sui mai. the \"<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\" steam buns were so-so, at least when compared to traditional dim sum.  i was not a big fan of the dan dan noodles which are one of my favorite dishes when traveling in china.  service was excellent...at least our waitress...even though we got there right before the kitchen closed we never felt rushed.  bottom line, don't come here expecting traditional chinese dim sum, but you will get a good meal if you choose wisely from the menu.  ask your server for suggestions...but beware of the \"upsell\". i would definitely go back!", 
            "mexican-chinese fusion, really?! - that was definitely my first thought when entering jose andres' vegas restaurant. i mean how could beans and rice mesh well with peking duck? the answer is that it can go quite well together.\n\ntwo dishes were particularly amazing. \n\n<mark>Beijing Glass</mark>: a chinese noodle dish accompanied by mexican vegetables such as jicama and avocado. the sauce soaked into the glass noodles making the whole dish an amazing melange of flavors! plus, the portion was large and easy to share among several friends.\n\nsilencio: a sweet barbecue taco composed of duck tongues. andres has always been one to test his diner's culinary limits (just check out my entry for his dc restaurant) and at first eating a bunch of little tongues can be unnerving. but after a few bites, you will not be able to put down this dose of deliciousness.\n\nother dishes were less memorable; however, they were all good. my biggest complaint were the prices. with the exception of <mark>Beijing Glass</mark>, portions were a little small for sharing. you had to order more which raised the price a bit high!", 
            "usually i read lots of reviews before eating anywhere, but seeing as we were on vacation, my wife and i took a risk and went into china poblano blind.  good thing, because had i trusted yelp's 3-star review, i might have missed out on a memorable meal.\n\ntrendy and quirky beyond belief, this restaurant exudes cool (or hipster, depending <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> view, but i took it as cool).  it has booths and community tables, and the dishes are all small plates from mexican and chinese cuisine... not much fusion, but it's nice to mix and match.  my wife and i shared <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>, with hot, fresh chips and a smoky chipotle salsa with just the right amount of kick.  i got a carnitas taco, which was succulent and had homemade pork rinds on top.  my wife liked her barbacoa taco as well.\n\nfor our \"main courses\" (although remember, it's small plates, so that doesn't really apply), i had the lemon tree shrimp, which was unbelievably good.  the shrimp tasted fresh, and the sauce was redolent with black pepper and celery, and the occasional chunk of citrus fruit.  my wife had the <mark>Beijing Glass</mark>, a noodle dish that was not to my taste, but it looked beautiful, with all the components (noodles and tons of different asian veggies) sectioned out in the bowl, waiting to be mixed.  she loved it.\n\nsome people are complaining about the size of the dishes.  well, it's small plates, and you're supposed to order 2-3 items.  the wait staff tells you that.  our waitress even asked us during lunch if we were satisfied with the amount of food we had or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> -- and we were.  far too many restaurants go for quantity over quality, but china poblano serves properly sized meals.  two or three dishes really should be enough to fill up one person.  if not, i dunno, go to one of the millions of buffets on the strip instead.  if i'm going to spend $30 on a meal, i'd honestly rather have high-quality food than \"all-you-can-eat.\"", 
            "interesting blend of chinese and mexican food.  very unique and a little fancy at times.\n\nwe had the following dishes - click on the menu above:\n\ndont <mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark>\n hot and sour soup, pork, tofu, bamboo shoots, dried mushrooms \ngood soup.\n\n<mark>Beijing Glass</mark>\n bean sprouts, jicama, avocado, cellophane noodles, carrot, chinese cabbage, sesame dressing\ni liked this one - it's like a noodle salad.  the jicama gives it a bit of a crunch.\n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>\n hand-cut wheat noodles, spicy pork sauce\nnot bad dan dan noodles - with peanuts\n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>\n red braised pork\nit's the chinese pau with this most delicious tender pork.  a winner!\n\n<mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>\n fresh vegetables, <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>\ni can see lots of vege all finely chopped in this delectable dish.\n\n<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>\n oaxacan-style barbeque beef, guajillo chile, pickled cactus paddle\nneat taco!  i like the flavours!\n\ncarnitas\n braised baby pig, pork rinds, spicy salsa verde cruda \nvery good taco!  \n\ni wanted to give this place a try because of the unique blends of 2 cuisines.  will i come back?  sure!", 
            "dang. the vegas crowd is harsh - or at least very conservative with their stars.  came here over the weekend with a bachelorette party and i think everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food and drinks.\n\nbetween me and two other girls, we split: <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> (fries with rich mole sauce), <mark>Open Sesame</mark> (chilled noodle salad), <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> (cellophane noodles in soup), tuna cevhiche (veeeerrrrry interesting crunch), and dan dan mien (noodles with a spicy kick).\n\ni had a mexican mimosa and other people in the group had the <mark>Lychee Sour</mark> cocktail and <mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark>.\n\nseriously no complaints about the food except that the portions are tiny.  however, considering how many dishes we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> for three girls (we eventually cancelled our order for 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>), i think we did just fine.  sure, it was a little pricey, but you're in vegas and you're at the cosmopolitan.  the strip is littered with panda expresses if you want something cheap.\n\nnow that i've returned from vegas, and my coworker (who recommended china poblano to me) and i are discussing the different dishes that we've eaten here, i'm itching to go back.", 
            "i discovered this restaurant after viewing a recommendation by anthony bourdain, so while a friend was in town we decided to come check it out. it's located inside the cosmopolitan hotel which is one of my favorite places on the strip. upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly hostess and offered our choice of the bar (which allows you to watch them work on tortillas from the open kitchen) or a table.  i felt for vegas fine dining this place was pretty affordable.\nmiller d was our server he was quick to greet us with a smile and i believe could tell we were unclear on if we should try a drink. he recommended the sueno cocktail which comes with a spicy salt rim. he was kind enough to do half/half in case we were a fan of the spicy kick it offered. both my friend and i really enjoyed the drink.\n\nthe main thing i was dying to try was this taco that i read about called the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco , but we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a <mark>Happy Family Jiaozi</mark>  (delicious pot stickers with amazing flavoring)and <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> ( fried pork buns) and some <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles(cold noodle dish with avocado and jicama for an interesting twist). overall i loved everything except that taco i wanted so badly to try. when it first arrived i took a bite of the beef tendon alone and it was delicious but when taking a bite of the taco all together with the oyster on top i felt like the ocean had thrown up in my mouth. it just wasn't a good combo for my pallet. maybe i got a bad oyster i don't know but overall it was an experience i will not quickly forget.\n\neveryone at the restaurant was super friendly and our drinks were always full. the only reason i have to deduct a star is i somehow was overcharged $20 on my bill. thankfully my friend encouraged me to keep my receipt and i am dealing with that situation but i definitely feel like this place is worth checking out! i left feeling satisfied and excited to go back to try some more cool fusions.", 
            "we returned to this restaurant during our december 2013 visit.  we were not disappointed.  \n\nwe shared <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, <mark>Beijing Glass</mark>, <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>, happy family, mongolioan <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark> and pato pasilla.  each dish was wonderful.\n\nthe waiter convinced the two birthday girls at the table to get the mango rice dessert.  it was amazing.  puffed rice, mango, whipped topping and other delights.  not a disappointed diner amongst us.", 
            "overall disappointed. the portion sizes were terrible for the price and the bartender (since we sat at the bar) failed to tell us that the dish we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> and appetizer would not be enough for a lunch for two. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the pigs on horseback due to its hype. they were definitely the best thing we had though they were on the dry side and lacked something i think a crisp vinegar style dipping sauce could have easily fixed. we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles which promised to be a light vegetarian dish to compliment our heavy pork break appetizer. the noodles came out and the whole dish was a little larger than my fist. more of a si<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>. it seemed like they had marinated everything in sesame oil and had little other flavor. since we were still hungry we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a couple of tacos thinking the other side of the menu would be good. wrong. the <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> was really flavorless and the cochinita was even worse. the pork had a bland dipped-in-a1 taste and the onions didn't add anything to the dish other than filler that distracted me from the taco. the service was terrible. our bartender was attentive to our waters but failed to help us decide anything and generally acted aloof and a bit shady. the decor was enjoyable and the idea i think is awesome. i really hope they step their game up. probably the worst restaurant to eat at in the cosmo. i will not be returning.", 
            "my friends arrived on a later flight and hadn't eaten their dinner yet, so this was the first restaurant we found here just by walking around the second floor of the cosmo. the place looked interesting with it's very casual atmosphere, and so, although i was kind of skeptical about a place serving chinese and mexican food, we decided to keep an open mind as it looked pretty decent. but boy, was it a bad mistake coming here.\n\nthe hostess was nice enough to seat us right away even though the place looked relatively full. the server came over and welcomed us and asked us what we'd like to drink.....but i had a hard time understanding her as it sounded like she had laryngitis or something. anyway, we decided to try a mix of dishes since the server recommended we perhaps try 2 chinese dishes and 2 mexican dishes just to mix it up. we  didn't want to order too much since it was pretty late so went ahead and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the chips & salsa, <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles, dancing eggplant.....then we looked over at the next table and the dish they or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> looked interesting so we asked them how and what it was? ...it was the gan pung ji chicken and they told us it was very good! so ok, we went ahead and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> it just to try something different.\n\noh boy. the eggplant dish had a thick black sauce over it that totally overpowered the eggplant ....kind of tasted like and overly sweet hoisin sauce, but whatever it was, we didn't like it at all. the eggplant itself was cooked ok, but would have been tasteless without something on it, but not that strong. next, was the <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles which is more like a small noodle salad where you have to mix all the ingredients together yourself. something tasted off about these noodles, and again, we didn't like it at all. next was the chicken dish. it's basically a fancied up lemon chicken type dish. sauce was starchy and way too sweet.\n\ni think the best part of the dinner was the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> which tasted fresh...and together with our coronas and red wine....somewhat made us forget about the chinese food we had just ate. \n\ni can't say i will ever come back to this place as there are so many better places to eat in vegas. and the prices of the dishes here are not cheap for what you get! next time i think we'll stick to a real chinese restaurant for real chinese food.", 
            "my family recently dined here, on our last night of our vegas family trip for the holiday. we ate practically every meal in the cosmopolitan (where we were staying) and we were so pleased with every restaurant we had dined at. our expectations were high for this one, and we wanted our last night's meal to be special. alas, it was not.\n\nthe restaurant d\\u00e9cor was cool, and our waiter was great. after having an amazing meal at jaleo the night prior, we were really into the \"tapas-style\" of dining, where you get to sample lots of dishes. we were excited to try this asian-mexican fusion menu! the first few dishes we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>, the waiter told us they were out of them that night (ex. aguachile de cayo, which i really wanted to try) . so we started with the <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodle dish. the family liked this dish but i found it too spicy (i'm a wimp when it comes to spiciness, i freely admit it). the happy buddah <mark>Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll</mark> were the typical fried <mark>Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll</mark> i've had a million times before. good, but not unique or special in any way. the palmitos was a strange \"ensalada\": i did not like this dish at all; it was so bitter and had an off after-taste. the kids weren't keen on it either, but hubby said it was ok and he ate it. the family or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a few other dishes (i forget the names) that were way too spicy for me (and a bit too spicy for them as well). \n\ni hardly ate anything so i asked the waiter, what was the least spicy item on the menu, and i said i did like seafood and fish, and he recommended the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>. omg, it was crazy spicy for me, i got rather ill afterwards (i only had one shrimp, too, and i had to scrape off the black peppered sauce). the kids also said it was spicy but they were able to tolerate it ok. even my hubby, who has a very high spice tolerance, admitted it was quite spicy. \n\nso either the chef this particular night was super-liberal with the peppers and spice and we just hit this restaurant on an off-night, or this place just serves really spicy food in general. be forewarned."

            "an odd combo of mexican and chinese on each side of the restaurant.  we decided to share four dishes just for a taste and here is what we had:  \n\n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> - small pork buns with lots of pork inside\n<mark>Kao Lao Lao</mark> - oat noodles with a cilantro sauce, the sauce was good but oat noodles ok\n<mark>Chicken Ji Song</mark> - was good and tasty\npollo con mole poblano taco - good\n\njust don't expect to get too full on these.", 
            "this is one of a kind - unique chinese x mexican restaurant in town. i know this place is expensive for mexican and chinese,,, but i keep visiting there.\n\nto start with, i always order a drink with <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>. i have eaten scallop ceviche, but tuna is way better than scallops, i think.\n\ni would recommend the chinese inspired taco, <mark>Viva China</mark>. they are very tasty. fish taco was really good, too.\n\nfor dim sum, i recommend \"<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\", its a bbq pork buns. delicious (its a bit sweet side, tho).\n\nall the sui mai is very good. gold leaf on sui mai??? funny but they are good.\n\nhowever, noodles in the lower price range, <mark>Kao Lao Lao</mark> and <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> are my least favorite. the taste is flat - too greasy and boring. i dont recommend. i guess you get what you pay for. \n\nsoup,,, they are ok.\n\nbartender was super nice and explained everything i asked.", 
            "i am pretty surprised by the negative reviews because i had a terrific experience at china poblano.  maybe it's because i took a lot of the waiter's recommendations, but every dish i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> was at hit.  (and lest you think, he was trying to pad the bill, i told him i was torn between two dishes and he steered me towards the less-expensive one.)\n\ni would highly recommend the <mark>Kao Lao Lao</mark>, which are described as steamed noodles, but were more like rolled tortilla strips served with a flavorful dipping sauce, and the carnitas taco, with tender meat and a wonderful contrast of textures with its crispy toppings.\n\ni also had the lamb pot stickers, which were beautifully presented (although perhaps a little greasy) and the dancing eggplant, which was roasted until creamy.\n\nthe service was great and the decor is very cute.  everything was all really flavorful and beautiful on the plate.  i look forward to returning.", 
            "apparently my expectations were tooooooo high.  was told by foodies that this place was a must eat.  however my pool attendant said it wasn't.  first where is the \"fusion\"?  the menu had food from both places but nothing that mixed them.  the waiter said we had to have the best taco in the world...carnitas.  being from san diego it was just ok.  the salsa for it was worth the $5.  for the main course we got the <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark> and <mark>Kao Lao Lao</mark> loa noodles.  we were told it was family style so it would be plenty of food.  if you consider 5 small pieces of beef and a plate full of lettuce enough then you are in the right place.  the one piece off beef i had was good.  too bad they are too cheap to actually make it family style.  the worst part was the noodles.  when i order noodles i expect a plate full of noodles.  this was individual coils of noodles stood up on their end in a bamboo steam pot.  there was 20 noodles with a tiger dipping sauce.  i almost spit up up the sauce on the first bite.  was like dirty water.  way too much hype very little to actually eat.  i will never go back.", 
            "to be honest, i was really skeptical when my friends told me we were going to a chinese-mexican fusion restaurant. i like them mutually exclusively & never got on the fusion food bandwagon. i went in a party of 6, and we shared everything family style - that's the way to go! \n\nsitting on the \"patio\" is a great place for people watching, as it's across the way from marquee and the other restaurants in the cosmopolitan. \n\nsome highlights from our meal:\n- <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>: absolutely delicious and strongly scented of sesame.\n- chilaquiles: the menorita cheese was so melty, salty and perfect\n- <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>: light spice. i like the addition of the black garlic\n- <mark>Kao Lao Lao</mark>: little rolled noodle sheets served with a fermented vegetable sauce. very rich, umami flavor\n- i didn't personally get the duck tongue tacos, but those that did were blown away!\n\nmy only gripe was the price of alcohol. on a whim, we decided to order a pitcher of margarita & a few a la carte drinks - which pushed our $200 meal to well over $300. oopsies, should have looked at the price beforehand. they were mediocre, so pre-party elsewhere.\n\nyes, there will be haters that say the prices are too high, but this is vegas. it's food by jose andres, for heavens sake...", 
            "i love love love china poblano!! the (mexican) menu is similar to oyamel in dc and every bit as delicious..add some amazing chinese food. the ceviche is my absolute favorite!! nothing compares--the crispy texture of the amaranth with the soft, fresh fish is a force to be reckoned with. i love the cocktails--lychee is the best one!! the pork tacos are amazing. the <mark>Kao Lao Lao</mark> noodles, with dragon sauce, are my favorite item on the menu...aside from the ceviche. the service never disappoints. the servers know and love the menu. i absolutely love china poblano and i will continue to make a stop on every visit to vegas!"

            "i love oyamel and jaleo, so i was eager to see jose andres' latest creation, and i had really high expectations for china poblano.  i had this idea that mexican-chinese fusion would be the love child of two of my favorite restaurants, oyamel and myers+chang (a funky pan-asian restaurant in boston).  we decided to try the asian side of the menu at china poblano, after we realized that there weren't that many fusion dishes on the menu.\n\nthe good: the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> was great - the soy sauce did not make me think of sashimi at all! overall, it was a flavor combination that i wouldn't have thought of, and i liked the texture of the ceviche with the walnuts.  the monk's noodles had a nice texture, and i was pleasantly surprised by the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> - it really distinguished itself from your average <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>.  as far as drinks go, i had a margarita with sea salt \"foam\" (standard at oyamel, still tasty here).  the lemon drop with \"noodles\" was clever, and it tasted like your standard lemon drop.  yes, i bought into the cutesy presentation, and i enjoyed it.\n\nalso good: the service.  the host table seemed a bit confused but once we were seated, everyone was great.  our waitress had recommended the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> to us over the scallop ceviche, since she thought the scallop portion was too small, and i always like candor from the waitstaff.  there was also a mistake at the bar, and when she saw a drink about to go to waste she brought it over to me (yay!)  the entire staff was very attentive.\n\nthe bad: we had the \"<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\" pork steam buns, and something about the texture of the bao was off.  even worse though, the meat was underseasoned.  the same thing goes for the <mark>Ten Treasure</mark> noodle soup and the monk's noodles - they looked great but the broth was underwhelming.  it's difficult to get the broth just right (tampopo, anyone?) but if you can't, maybe you shouldn't offer so many noodle soups <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> menu.\n\ni'm willing to give china poblano the benefit of the doubt, as the restaurant was only two weeks old when we visited.  i will probably eat here again... but there are so many restaurants to try on the strip, so i'm not sure when or if i'll be back.  the bottom line is, jose andres does a fantastic job with mexican cuisine and tapas, so if you're going to visit, maybe that's what you should stick with.  my visit to china poblano just left me craving a visit to myers+chang and oyamel.  i didn't take the ceviche and tacos at oyamel for granted before, but i will certainly appreciate them a lot more on my next visit.", 
            "i was very disappointed with this place. i was so excited about the concept, but severely let down.  $5 for a coke!!! unreal!!  the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> was ok. a little on the pricey side.\n\ni ate the <mark>Ten Treasure</mark>- fresh shrimp/ham/ seasonal vegetables/wide cellophane noodles/good fortune it was $17.  wow, only 3 shrimp and 2 pieces of small ham. not impressed.\n\nwe also had the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> melted chihuahua cheese/tequila blanco/fresh tortillas $9- not impressed with the amount of cheese i paid $9 for. \n\noverall...boo, not a vegas worthy place to eat.", 
            "i loved this place! the atmosphere is fun and exciting. ok, for all of you complaining about prices...really? you expect to spend $1.50 on a taco in the cosmopolitan? seriously? this is not the place. the prices are not outrageous for cosmopolitan prices. you pay for location.\n\nmust haves:\n<mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>!!!! these were divine. the salt foam is interesting in a good way. our table could not stop ordering them.\nsui mai! small, but delicious and they have gold flakes. come on!\ngaucamole - spicy, but exceptional quality great with tortillas or the chips\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> was good, but not over the top delicious\n<mark>Viva China</mark> taco\nscallop ceviche! these come out as little scallop shooters on half limes. you shoot the scallop and squeeze the lime with the spices on it. so good. along with the margaritas these were our favorite of the evening.\n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> - great pork buns, better than most dim sum i've had. not too much bread.\n\nmeh:\nlobster taco - didn't care for it\nporkbelly taco - too much sauce!\n<mark>Ten Treasure</mark> - too little flavor compared to everything else\n\noverall great place even just for a drink (margarita) and a snack. i would love to come back and order the scallop ceviche again!", 
            "we came here to eat before going to the marquee pool cause we were starving. i know i know, we're going to have a full belly right before we have to be in our swim suits.. but we can't go hungry! this is not the yelp way! deciding between chinese/mexican and burgers, since they were the only two restaurants right next to marquee, we decided on the first. when in vegas and you want a decent, quick meal without spending a ton of money, i'd say this place was pretty good! one thing i did not like -1 star is that they charged me wrong! i looked at my signed receipt and the amount charged on my card and noticed a $15 difference! it's too small to even complain about but that wasn't cool...\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>: \nsilencio taco - duck tongue, definitely interesting. the lychee flavor wasn't very strong though\n<mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark> taco - pork belly, had too much sauce\nrainbow congee - not the normal items that you usually see in a congee, but still tasty to me\nunruly <mark>18 Monk Noodle</mark> soup - this was way too salty\n<mark>Ten Treasure</mark> noodle soup - yum!\nlike water chocolate - fried <mark>Quail Egg</mark> and dragon fruit - definitely a unique mix but worth a try!", 
            "way over-priced. i hate the feeling of being gypped. that's how i felt after eating at china poblano. it's pricey and food was blah to say the least. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the happy family potstickers $13 for 6 pieces. the frozen bag from my local asian market tasted way better. we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Ten Treasure</mark> soup $18 - can you say bland? the last thing we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> was <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> - $14 for a small steamed bun with bbq pork - tasty but so small, it was gone in three bites. for these prices, i would have been ok if taste was good, but we were neither satisfied, nor happy. we actually had to eat a couple slices of pizza after just to feel full. i'm not a big girl - 5'2\" and 110 pounds. are you paying for the name of the chef or a meal?? nope. we're not going back - ever!", 
            "i was looking forward to seeing what this place had to offer as i've walked by it a lot but never had a chance to try it.  the place didn't really live up to the expectations.  i had the <mark>Ten Treasure</mark> noodle soup which was nice to have after a night of drinking in the vegas desert.  i also tasted the cheese fondido with chorizo but it was just an overly salty goop.  my friend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> and it was adequate but nothing to write home about. the pork steamed buns were overly sweet and really on the small side. \n\nprobably not worth a second visit given all the choices in town."

(for premade flan and tapioca pudding!) the pineapple garnishes came out of a can. \n\n<mark>Swallow a Cloud</mark>: bland broth, small portions, and mediocre wontons. we asked for a side of chili to enhance the flavor and was charged $3. \n\n\"recomended\" noodle dish: too much vinegar! \n\nyes, while vegas restaurants are pricey, flavor is expected.\n\nwaters were not refilled on promptly. servers incorrectly and rudely cleared the table while the party was still dinning. \n\nsave your money and eat elsewhere.",

            "a creative concept, but execution is mediocre.\n\nhonestly, the idea of a chinese and mexican restaurant usually would have me running in the opposite direction (i hate fusion places), but the jose andres connection really drew me in. this place isn't a fusion restaurant, it's really just a bunch of mexican and chinese options. \n\nmy sister and i got: chips & salsa, 2 tacos (hongos & <mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark>), 1 order of <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>, 1 order of <mark>Swallow a Cloud</mark> (wonton noodle soup), and 1 order of <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> (fried pork buns with condensed milk dipping sauce).\n\nthe <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> were okay - salty chips but good chipotle salsa. the tacos were also okay; the hongos (mushrooms) one was way too citrus-y and could've used more guac to balance out, and the pancitas <mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark> (pork belly) was good because of the pineapples in it. my sister did say that the pork belly could have been a lot more tender, though. <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> was not good. the noodles were off, and the peanut sauce was salty and too spicy even after adding the vinegar brown sauce on the side. the <mark>Swallow a Cloud</mark> wonton soup was also mediocre because of the bland noodles. i think the winning dish was <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> - who would have thought condensed milk to dip fried pork buns into is actually really yummy? \n\nthe concept is creative because there are a lot of options, and the drinks menu looked good, but the food itself was just mediocre. maybe coming from california set the standard high for asian and mexican food, but this place was a little too expensive for just the mediocrity."

            "the people working there are really nice! but the food sucks, we got the monk..something, <mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark>, the mongolian beef. \n\nthe mongolian beef with lettuce looked like dog food, actually dog food looks better.\na few pieces of diced beef (the size of half a penny) thrown on lettuce. bland and overpriced.\n\nmy friend didn't finish her <mark>18 Monk Noodle</mark> soup. bland and overpriced.\n\nthe hot and sour soup is good.", 
            "after reading the reviews, i guess i was expecting more.  we started with the setas, which were very good.  but the caldo tlalpe\\u00f1o was much more soupy than what i expected.  unfortunately, it was followed by the <mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> (hot and sour) soup.  although that is what we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>, the dishes come out from the kitchen as they are ready.  it would have been better if the setas had been served between the caldo and the soup.\n\nbut the big disappointment came at desert.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the chocolate terra cotta warriors which are described as \"caramelized bananas / sesame.\"  but what came out was three thin cross sections of a banana and a chocolate \"terra cotta warrior\" on a bed of dry oreo cookie crumgs.  the chocolate was filled with a chocolate creme and there were two dollops of vanilla ice cream on the plate, but despite all of that, the desert was exceptionally dry.  great presentation, but short on the edibility scale.\n\ni had the <mark>Santa Quiteria</mark> with the meal.  it was so-so and the portion was among the smallest pour of any wine i had while in las vegas.\n\ni don't think this place really compares to rick bayless's restaurants or other top restaurants in las vegas.  but if you are near the city centre and want a quick, small bite, this is a good place to go.", 
            "i've passed by this place quite a few times, but finally decided to dine in today. the service was very attentive, but i felt like they didn't go beyond what they teach you in table-waiting 101. our server asked if we were ready for drinks, entrees, then desserts and let us know her personal favorites for each course, but didn't actually describe any of them. i honestly didn't have any problems with the service though, it's the food/prices that leave me less than satisfied. \n\nguacamole ($15): although it was pretty pricey, it was probably my favorite dish of the night. there were a lot of large chunks of avocado, which is something i could never complain about and it was very fresh and flavorful. the only thing that i didn't like was that the waitress asked if we were done with it once the chips ran out, even though we still had about a third of it left. it was just kind of annoying that she was trying to take the plate away, rather than offering us more chips.\n\nlarge pot of <mark>Jasmine Downy Pearls</mark> ($8.88) - very aromatic and tasty. i would probably come here just for the tea.  \n\n<mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> ($4): i hardly touched the salsa, but i ate all the nice and crisp chips with the guacamole. definitely worth the four bucks.\n\npescado frito ($6.50): not very flavorful and not very \"fried.\" if i'm going to pay $6.50 for one taco, i expect it to be pretty damn good. \n\ndancing eggplant ($9.88) - the waitress seemed a little reluctant when we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> this. she made sure to warn us there were bonito flakes on it and the eggplant was boiled. i had the feeling she didn't like that at all. we thought it was just okay.\n\ntraditional sui mai ($13.88): i really loved the crisp water chestnuts they added in the sui mai. the edible gold flakes on each piece also gave it a unique presentation. \n\n<mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> (hot and sour soup) $8.88: this was the most disgusting hot and sour soup i have every had. it seriously ruined my palette. the whole bowl of soup just reeked and tasted like hot red wine. i have never tasted hot and sour soup like that before. i couldn't take more than two bites of it without feeling sick because of the strong wine flavor it had. don doesn't even like hot and sour soup, but he could still taste how much worse it was than others. \n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> ($8.88): way too salty and saucy. and for a whopping $8.88, this was definitely not worth it. \n\njericalla ($11) - have you ever had abuelita hot chocolate? it comes in a package like this: http://beautifulspitup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/abuelita-mexican-hot-chocolate1.jpg containing tablets of compressed cocoa, sugar, and cinnamon: http://beautifulspitup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cut-abuelita.jpg. well, the small amount of custard on the bottom of the cup was covered in what seemed to be ground up tablets of abuelita hot chocolate: http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v1zh1nc2vaskonusyjs5ja/l.jpg and no, that was not a good thing. i felt like ai was just munching on hot chocolate powder. i mean, the custard and sorbet alone were good, but i couldn't eat those without eating all the powder. plain and simple, it sucked. \n\noverall, i loved the presentation of all the dishes, however the flavors just didn't match. the hot and sour soup really killed it for me. the only thing i think was worth coming here for was probably the tea, but that's still not something i would drive over here for.\n\nwarning: if you look at your bank statement a day or two after coming here and the amount charged is a lot higher than what you actually paid, it's because they like to \"pre-authorize\" themselves for a 30% tip, but it goes down to whatever you actually paid them when the transaction clears. why anyone would give this place a 30% tip is beyond me...", 
            "chinese food and mexican food in one - what more could you ask for?\n\ni'm honestly pretty shocked about the lack of positive reviews for china poblano.  it's vegas - everything is expensive and probably not big enough (insert double entendre here).  stop your whining and realize it's tapas-style.  if you have 10 hungry bachelorette party girls like we were, order two of each type, eat family style, order a strong drink, and shut your trap.\n\nfor vegas shu mai, i thought it was pretty good.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> two servings of the lucky 8, which i recommend so you can get a taste of each type of shu mai they serve. all were tasty and topped with something interesting, like radish or goji berry. the har gau was ok; i have had better. the <mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> hot and sour soup had a wonderful kick of spices. drinks or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> included the singapore sling and the <mark>Lychee Sour</mark>, both of which were flavorful and interesting. i myself had vodka with fresh cantaloupe juice, which snuck up <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> and hit you like an unruly child. other dishes or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> at our table included a caesar salad (with way too much parmesan), <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>, shrimp, and numerous tacos. as far as pork buns go, the <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> was a little meh. i like the pork to be red and drier than this was.\n\nthe coup de grace of my palate was the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco. this is definitely the best non-traditional taco i've ever had. a taco with beef tendon and oyster - the crispiness of the tendon punctuated with the creamy oyster was mind-blowing. \n\nlots of good tastes, a few mediocre tastes. but definitely deserving of a higher rating than the uno estrellas some other folks are giving. i'd go back.  <mark>Viva China</mark> poblano!", 
            "interesting blend of chinese and mexican food.  very unique and a little fancy at times.\n\nwe had the following dishes - click on the menu above:\n\ndont <mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark>\n hot and sour soup, pork, tofu, bamboo shoots, dried mushrooms \ngood soup.\n\n<mark>Beijing Glass</mark>\n bean sprouts, jicama, avocado, cellophane noodles, carrot, chinese cabbage, sesame dressing\ni liked this one - it's like a noodle salad.  the jicama gives it a bit of a crunch.\n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>\n hand-cut wheat noodles, spicy pork sauce\nnot bad dan dan noodles - with peanuts\n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>\n red braised pork\nit's the chinese pau with this most delicious tender pork.  a winner!\n\n<mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>\n fresh vegetables, <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>\ni can see lots of vege all finely chopped in this delectable dish.\n\n<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>\n oaxacan-style barbeque beef, guajillo chile, pickled cactus paddle\nneat taco!  i like the flavours!\n\ncarnitas\n braised baby pig, pork rinds, spicy salsa verde cruda \nvery good taco!  \n\ni wanted to give this place a try because of the unique blends of 2 cuisines.  will i come back?  sure!", 
            "this was my second visit to china poblano, although my first visit was last year and it was limited to a couple dumplings and some drinks.  this time my wife and i came for lunch while the cosmopolitan was getting our room ready.  the restaurant has one of the cooler buildouts in town - stylish and chic yet still comfortable.  the design aesthetic borrows from chinese and mexican traditions, much like the menu.  what was interesting to us was that we didn't sense much \"fusion\" between the two traditions - they menu is segregated between chinese and mexican dishes.  we had a mix, but no single dish we had really fused the two cusines.\n\nlet's start off with a story.  just after we sat down, a party of 4 sat next to us.  after a quick look at the menu they asked the server why they didn't see quesadillas and burritos.  the server explained that china poblano's mexican fare comes from the cuisine of southern mexico, while they were thinking more about the food along the us border.  the server expertly encouraged them to give the place a try, and they wouldn't be disappointed.  no dice - they got up and left anyway.  the server told us that happens a lot.\n\nthat was their loss.  we started with the special chicken tinga tacos with chorizo, onions and potatoes, which my wife and i loved.  the potatoes in particular made the tacos, and they went great with the sauce, one of my favorites in the mexican lexicon.\n\nwe also really enjoyed the <mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> hot and sour soup.  this was not your traditional chinese hot and sour soup - the color was much darker, the sesame flavor really popped, as did the cilantro.  it had much more depth than we expected and was almost smoky.  \n\nof the lucky 6 sui mai, we liked the scallop sui mai the best, then the beef and then the traditional shrimp & pork.  all were delicious though, and sui mai is always a personal favorite, whatever anyone puts in it.  \n\nthe <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> was good too, but the shrimp was a little overwhelmed by the sweet black roasted garlic.  it was a good dish, but i'd have preferred a little bit more shrimp flavor. \n\nfun place with good food, but you have to like chinese and southern mexican flavors, which my wife and i absolutely do.", 
            "if you read my review of jaleo, you will find that i love, love, love jose andres and everthing he touches. china poblano is one of my go-to restaurants every time my mom comes into town and asks me where i want to eat (i mean, it is pricy, so i only get to go on my mom's dime ;) ) everything is so delicious, the service is always on point, and both are consistent. \n\nyes, it is expensive (their menu is online available through the cosmopolitan website with all prices clearly listed). yes, the portions are small. yes, it is really more chinese food + mexican food than it is fusion (the food comes from two separate kitchens, after all). \n\nwe always try to order the more rare / odd items .. can't seem to bring myself to pay $14 for a tiny order of siu mai that would probably be better at a dirty hole in the wall dim sum restaurant (sidenote: can anyone recommend a good dim sum restaurant nearby?)\n\n--\nfavorite items:\nguacamole with <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> - $15. handmade at the table, deliciously chunky. bypass if trying to save money, get it if you're splurging\n\n<mark>Viva China</mark> taco - $5.50. rich, chewy, juicy, salty, gooey. bypass if you do not like foods with \"weird\" textures. \n\n<mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> - $12.88. pretty, deliciously crispy on the outside and moist, tender lamb on the inside. must have\n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - $12.88. love the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the sauce. could be spicier. have never had authentic dan dan noodles, so i could not tell you if these are authentic or not, but delicious nonetheless. must have. \n\n<mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> - $11.88. this is the biggest portion of hot and sour soup i've ever seen in my life. definitely meant for at least 4 people. not a traditional hot and sour soup. is pretty thick. very good. \n\ndiscontinued items?:\nthey had this chile-relleno type item once with pomegranate seeds on it. it did not look appetizing but was delicious. it looks like a frog with red warts on it. i no longer see it on the menu so it may have been a special, but if you see it, i recommend it!\n\nthey also used to have scallop ceviche - super untraditional and really expensive for what you are getting, but really fun. tiny little lime with a slice of raw scallop and some brown sugar in between. sprayed with tequila. you are meant to pop the scallop in your mouth and bite into the lime in one fell swoop. i no longer see it on the menu, though. \n--\ndrinks:\n<mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> - $14. what fun! yummy, boozy fun. \n<mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark> - $15 / glass. yummy, but be careful, it's pretty spicy! \n--\n\nnot such a fan of:\nthey always push the 20-vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> because johnny iuzzini said it was his favorite dish on the show \"best thing i ever ate.\" i find it bland, boring, and wayyyyy overpriced.\n\ndancing eggplant - really pretty! i don't really like eggplant in general, though. \n--\n\ncons about the restaurant itself:\nthe restaurant is literally right outside of marquee. at lunch in the summer, it's overrun by trashy girls in swimsuits without coverups and douchey bros trying to get into the dayclub. at dinner time, it's overrun by girls in skimpy dresses wobbling in their heels and douchey bros with popped collars trying to get into the nightclub. luckily, if you have a reservation, you never have to wait for long, and sometimes they will have you wait inside on the steps rather than out in the throng. \n\nthe chairs in the middle of the restaurant have no backs. i'm a sloucher anyway, but sometimes after a big meal you want to lean back and pat your belly, but if you try to do that you will just topple over. there are no purse hooks under the table, and since the chairs don't have backs, you either have to hold your bag in your lap or, if you are lucky enough to be a group with an odd number of people, on the spare seat.", 
            "came here for lunch yesterday... the dont <mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> hot and sour soup brought me back the next night.. seriously... we have tried a dozen items on menu including the spicy mango margarita... heaven!", 
            "this place has one heck of a menu.  the combination of mexican and asian cuisine took us a back a little bit at first, but there were so many options that everyone should be able to find something they like.  \n\nthe server told us that the format is more like a tapas restaurant where you order several small dishes.   i would challenge this statement as the dishes are by no means small.  \n\ni tried two dishes.  the deep fried wantons and the <mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> hot and sour soup.  both dishes were delicious.  the wantons were like an appetizer size, but the soup was definitely like a full meal.  the only drawback with the soup is that the pork was a little large to eat easily with the little spoon provided.  i ended up looking like a slob with bits of meat hanging out of my mouth more than once, but it was so tasty, that by that point i didn't care.", 
            "i really should have read the reviews before we stopped by. the food was not bad, but it was not great either. definitely overpriced for what we got. we tried the <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> pork buns, the lucky 6 siu mai, the <mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> hot and sour soup, and the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> with an order of homemade tortillas. the only items worth eating were the shrimp and the hot and sour soup. we made little shrimp tacos and it was actually tasty. the pork buns weren't too bad either. i ended up coming back to la and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> real dim sum since my experience here was so lackluster. the restaurant was confusing and i was not feeling the concept. i would honestly skip this place. there are so many better restaurants out there that i would not waste my calories here. not like i have been counting or anything, because i really have not. the staff was attentive though.."

            "i lived in dc for a while, so i am a frequent visitor to jose andres' restaurants and an avid fan.  i was really excited to try his new restaurant in vegas, and it did not disappoint!  i came here with a group of 4 people, and we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> 11 dishes i believe + 2 desserts.  they have a few chefs working at the front of the restaurant so people walking by can watch them make handmade tortillas and hand pulled noodles.  they also have two take out windows with a smaller menu that you can order from.  the decor is modern with chinese and mexican elements and made me think of something i would see in an urban outfitters catalog or on display at the moma.\n\nthe guacamole and hand made tortillas were to die for!  i could have just eaten guacamole for dinner.  and they have the best tortillas i've ever had.  my favorite presentation was the scallop ceviche, which they place on a carmelized key lime.  they lightly spray vodka on it, you eat the scallop, and then squeeze the lime into your mouth.  almost like taking a tequila shot.  i also thought the hand pulled noodles were amazing and cooked to perfection.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the unruly monk soup, and it was very light and refreshing, but at the same time, full of vegetables.  i would probably come here for lunch and order just that and maybe a small side dish.  we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> another soup, <mark>Caldo Tlalpeno</mark>, which i thought was more fusion, and i also enjoyed that soup as well.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the nice, but naughty dish with lotus root and pea shoots which doesn't taste very chinese because the pea shoots were somewhat raw but i enjoyed it nonetheless.  i also enjoyed the <mark>Chicken Ji Song</mark> and liked the presentation of it, especially with the fried sweet potato on top.  we tried a bunch of different tacos, and i think flavorwise, i liked the beef tendon and it was melt in your mouth tender, but also the greasiest taco out of all of them.  we didn't end up order any dim sum because i knew i could probably eat tastier (and cheaper) dim sum in chinatown.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the flan and the happy buddha giggling taking a bath.  the flan is deliciously creamy and easily one of the best flans i've ever had.  the happy buddha is really cute and he really is taking a bath!  it's one of the most entertaining desserts i've ever had.  it isn't your normal jello.  they make it from scratch with fresh strawberries and use seaweed extract instead of gelatin, and it has a very smooth flavor.  it's very refreshing at the end of a huge meal.\n\nthe dishes aren't that expensive but they do add up very quickly, and we ended up spending more than i wanted to, but it was definitely a fun and enjoyable experience, not to mention yummy!", 
            "try to make reservations beforehand, convenient that they text you when your table is ready and it's nice that it's right across the sports book.  overpriced tacos, but they are pretty good.  to be full you have to order at least a couple, and i'm not sure if they would do the job of prepping your stomach for a night of drinking.  this place serves small portions, even their traditional sui mai (6 pcs) looked really sad in its large container.  they were pretty small in size compared to what i'm used to at traditional chinese restaurants.  i had a soup since i was a bit under the weather, the <mark>Caldo Tlalpeno</mark> which had shredded chicken, rice, peas, carrots, avocado and chipotle.  it was a bit bland, but it was perfect for how i was feeling.  i don't think i'd go back to china poblano again, unless it was for that same soup, but it certainly wouldn't make me that full unless i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> tons more stuff.  the dinner definitely warranted another dinner #2 an hour or two later.", 
            "i've been here a few times, it's an interesting mix of mexican and chinese.  some of the items are really hit or miss.  \n\nthe last time we went we sat at the bar and sarah schooled us on tequila, that girl is full of tequila knowledge, some really interesting stuff.  we had a few tequila flights, very interesting taste testing.  \n\nthe <mark>Caldo Tlalpeno</mark> wasn't that good had a odd flavor.  the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> ($19.88)was just ok, until i added <mark>Monk Chile Sauce</mark>($2.88), it added some flavor to it. the <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> was pretty good, the pork was very sweet tasting.  now the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>, looked bad, but was very good.  \n\nwould i suggest this place, boy that's a tough one, the menu is such a mine field, maybe i would and suggest sticking to the tacos and tequila."

            "my traveling companions decided to go and get pampered at a hotel spa and rely on a trained professional to provi<mark>Ceviche de Peje Sol</mark> comfort into their lives, but i nixed that idea because for me comfort comes in the form of good food passing from my mouth to my belly.\n\ni found myself exploring the cosmopolitan on my own when i came upon this unique second floor restaurant which announced chinese food in one window and mexican food in another.  i stopped to study the menu and learned it was exactly what i thought it to be, a restaurant specializing in dim sum, noodles and tacos.\n\nsince i was dining alone i was seated at the dim sum bar where i had a front row seat watching the ladies prepare, fill and fold fresh dumplings (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gj_bxupv672ywng4tnejog?select=ze32bwjoqoazl4tmanlt3w) and roll out fresh hand-cut noodles.  i decided to order from both the chinese and mexican menus in order to sample the cuisine a little bit better.\n\nfor starters i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> one of two agua frescas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gj_bxupv672ywng4tnejog?select=w60p4p4whakzmhqhvyghmw) available at the time choosing one made of blood oranges and pomegranates.  from the dim sum menu i selected the sui mai scallops made up of ground pork, bamboo, mushrooms and peanuts and the har gau which combined shrimp and pork belly in its filling.  from the tacos menu i selected an individual carnitas taco and the pescado frito taco.  i agreed to have my selections brought out as they were prepared.\n\nthe pescado frito (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gj_bxupv672ywng4tnejog?select=8cip34h9um_xmdh4lajsug) taco arrived first.  on paper this was supposed to be fried fish and a mexican salsa, but the fish i had inside my taco certainly didn't seem fried.  no matter its preparation i liked it as the flaky fish was bursting with flavor and hot juices running amok.  this was a very simple but very good fish taco.\n\nthe carnitas taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gj_bxupv672ywng4tnejog?select=9wjy0kqq33m7dbvactabnw) was up next.  this was braised baby pork, creamy guacamole, chicharrones and lime at its best.  when the server told me this was her favorite it took me just one bite to understand why.  if i really wanted to pig out i could have easily devoured another three of these.\n\nthe dim sum were served in individual bamboo steamers with the lids left on until i was ready to enjoy.  this helped keep the little morsels hot and steamy while i worked on my tacos.\n\ni had the har gau (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gj_bxupv672ywng4tnejog?select=ugvecr8s4e13ak4f0t3p8w) first.  these were quite unique as there was actually a pocket of broth inside the chewy, translucent shell much like what is usually experienced with xiao lung baos.  the shrimp was so fresh it was crunchy and while i didn't notice anything special with the added pork belly the juicy har gau was delicious enough to stand on its own.\n\ni saved the sui mai scallops (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gj_bxupv672ywng4tnejog?select=og_yucnefs9wu0i9ejqqlg) for last.  these were easily some of the most eye-appealing sui mais i've ever had topped with a bit of tobiko and some micro greens.  in terms of flavor and originality it was another winner.  the soft peanuts mixed in with the pork and the mushrooms gave these a very pleasant earthiness.  i enjoyed each one slowly, and stayed in my seat contemplating the delicious food i just sampled until it was time to meet up with my friends again.\n\nuh, guys, i won't be joining you for dinner tonight.  i'm stuffed!!", 
            "so when i heard chinese mexican fusion i expected something different than what it was. however, i wasn't disappointed when i saw the menu. it's broken up into mexican style dishes and chinese style dishes. our server said it was similar to a \"tapas\" place with small plates that were meant to be shared, or to order two plates per person for a full meal. i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the mexican asparagus and the chinese dancing eggplant. the asparagus was amazing and i devou<mark>Ichtegem's Flemish Red Ale</mark> of it. honestly would have been okay with just that because it was a pretty decent portion. the eggplant wasn't really what i expected. it's covered in a soy sauce glaze and these fish flakes (i forget the actual name, but they smell and taste really fishy). the eggplant was not the texture i expected. was hoping for something i would have to chew rather than something that just slid down my throat. the taste was okay but i couldn't do the slimy-ish texture. we had them bring <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> for the table and both were really good. i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the classic margarita and was not disappointed. if i ever make it back i really want to try the <mark>Margarita Bandera Flight</mark>, as a friend did and said it was amazing. our server was great, answe<mark>Ichtegem's Flemish Red Ale</mark> of our questions and ma<mark>Ceviche de Peje Sol</mark> great recommendations around the table that were raved about. he had no trouble dealing with the 14 rambunctious girls there for a bachelorette party and all of our food came out fairly quickly!\n\nmy gripe with this place is that even though it seems like there are a lot of choices, i had a tough time finding something to order other than my asparagus (which i was really excited about). i wish i would have or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the tacos because they looked really good. a friend had the dan dan and said it was pretty spicy, but lost or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> off the mexican portion of the menu.", 
            "the absolute worst service i've ever had on the strip. from the hostess, server, all the way down to the manager that took our order stay away from this restaurant at all costs if these are the same conditions you're visiting. \n\ni took my grandmother that has recently lost her husband to walk the strip, the bellagio fountains and enjoy a nice meal. low and behold we end up at the cosmopolitan and i recommended this venue that i'd gotten tacos from once.\n\nwe weren't even really sat down - it was more \"oh are you planning on sitting there?\" and then while waiting around for service i had to get up and ask what seemed to be the manager if someone was available to take our order since the place was dead anyway. another 10 minutes later he comes out and says he'll take the order and he recommends some dishes that seem okay. \n\nthey come out pretty quickly which is probably the only redeeming quality about this place - applause kitchen staff. the lucky dim sum and wonton soup were pretty good too. but the beef and lettuce dish was too salty. i asked for the server who finally showed up to come switch it out and he comes out with a plate that just has less soy sauce. come on - i'm chinese my people might be cheap but we're not dumb. \n\ni specifically ask for a box and check and the guy comes out another five minutes later with water... at this point even my 74 year old grandmother is complaining because there was literally no one else in the restaurant. \n\nwhen he brings the check over he asks if i want change. and i say yes. in my opinion - that is one of the rudest things a server can ask. do you think you deserve a tip? and even so, it's not required. he huffed and puffed his whole way back to the cashier and ma<mark>Ceviche de Peje Sol</mark> racial remarks i'm sure about me and my grandmother being asian.\n\nand you know what? for a $53 - here you go mr. greedy server a $20 tip. maybe you'll learn next time not to judge your service based on the customer. \n\nif this is how it is on a slow day - just imagine when it gets busy."

            "i love oyamel and jaleo, so i was eager to see jose andres' latest creation, and i had really high expectations for china poblano.  i had this idea that mexican-chinese fusion would be the love child of two of my favorite restaurants, oyamel and myers+chang (a funky pan-asian restaurant in boston).  we decided to try the asian side of the menu at china poblano, after we realized that there weren't that many fusion dishes on the menu.\n\nthe good: the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> was great - the soy sauce did not make me think of sashimi at all! overall, it was a flavor combination that i wouldn't have thought of, and i liked the texture of the ceviche with the walnuts.  the monk's noodles had a nice texture, and i was pleasantly surprised by the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> - it really distinguished itself from your average <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>.  as far as drinks go, i had a margarita with sea salt \"foam\" (standard at oyamel, still tasty here).  the lemon drop with \"noodles\" was clever, and it tasted like your standard lemon drop.  yes, i bought into the cutesy presentation, and i enjoyed it.\n\nalso good: the service.  the host table seemed a bit confused but once we were seated, everyone was great.  our waitress had recommended the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> to us over the scallop ceviche, since she thought the scallop portion was too small, and i always like candor from the waitstaff.  there was also a mistake at the bar, and when she saw a drink about to go to waste she brought it over to me (yay!)  the entire staff was very attentive.\n\nthe bad: we had the \"<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\" pork steam buns, and something about the texture of the bao was off.  even worse though, the meat was underseasoned.  the same thing goes for the <mark>Ten Treasure</mark> noodle soup and the monk's noodles - they looked great but the broth was underwhelming.  it's difficult to get the broth just right (tampopo, anyone?) but if you can't, maybe you shouldn't offer so many noodle soups <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> menu.\n\ni'm willing to give china poblano the benefit of the doubt, as the restaurant was only two weeks old when we visited.  i will probably eat here again... but there are so many restaurants to try on the strip, so i'm not sure when or if i'll be back.  the bottom line is, jose andres does a fantastic job with mexican cuisine and tapas, so if you're going to visit, maybe that's what you should stick with.  my visit to china poblano just left me craving a visit to myers+chang and oyamel.  i didn't take the ceviche and tacos at oyamel for granted before, but i will certainly appreciate them a lot more on my next visit.", 
            "so expensive for such small portions...they must be high! that was the least filling $120 lunch i've ever had. there were 4 of us and it came out to $30 each.\n\n<mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>: i appreciate the warm chips. the salsa had and ok flavor, but lacked some freshness. maybe it needs cilantro or onion.\n\ntacos: we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> 3 different of their tacos(pancita, cochinita, and barbacoa). nothing special in the way of flavor. every taco had a chunk of fat in it. and at $9 for 2 tiny tacos that adds up. \n\nlamb potstickers: meh, not really anything better than you would get in the frozen bag. they were light on flavor. we asked for some sort of sauce and the waiter obliged, but reminded us that that sauce doesn't normally come with the order. the sauce added sssooo much. if it weren't for the sauce i would have had a hard time eating it.\n\ngazpacho something: a fruit salad. this was very good, but again a very small portion.\n\n<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>: i didn't eat this because i don't like tuna, but from what a heard one of the better dishes of our lunch.\n\n<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>: recommended by the host, it was pretty good, but really oily. \n\noverall: i wouldn't go back.", 
            "i'm glad i tried this place despite the 3 star average rating from the yelpers!   this place is great if you are in the mood to step out-side the box. \n\nwe came with a group of people (which i think is the key to really maximizing your enjoyment to this place) because you can order a larger variety of items and share in <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark>.  \n\n- <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>  - good\n- har gau (shimp/pork belly) - good\n- pozole rojo - i can make a better version\n- carnitas - omg a must try!\n- polla a la parilla - good\n- guacamole - it was on the spicy side - i liked it my table-mates didn't\n- <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> - pretty tasty\n- tres lychees (dessert) was so good!!!!\n\ni'm glad i tried this place.", 
            "who knew that chinese food and mexican food would go well together?  this \"collaboration\" (how our waitress puts it) is the genius of this place.  even though portions were small, each dish was very high quality.  if you're looking to get stuffed to the point where you want to vomit, then head to the never-ending selection of buffets in vegas.  if you want to be surprised and have a lively conversation with your dining partner(s) about the delicious food you're eating, then you have to try this place.  here's what we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>:\n\n-rou jia mou <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>:  wow!  so tasty and good.  the bread part reminded me of northern chinese scallion pancakes (minus the scallions) and the pork filling was so good.\n-<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>:  high quality dish with some surprising crunch.  i had to ask the waitress what gave the crunchy texture and it turned out to be amaranth seeds which i've never had before.\n-<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> tacos:  good.  nothing to complain about.\n-sui mai scallops dim sum:  yes, it's a traditional dim sum item you can get in any dim sum restaurant but done very well.\n-cajeta flan:  very creamy and smooth.  great dessert but i thought the addition of the ice cream was unecessary. \n-singapore sling:  so good, i had to drink 2 of them.  perfect before hitting the slots ;)", 
            "ok, this place is damn good. so damn good. the tacos were great, awesome combinations and ultimately this place is just very unexpected. the barbacoa and carnitas tacos are to die for...even the duck tongue was good(weird seeing little tongues in a tortilla but you get over it.) because there were 4 of us, we decided to really sample the menu and try a lot of items...lemon tree shrimp, silencio, barbacoa, carnitas and setas tacos and a few other things. the highlights for me besides the tacos were definitely the guacamole and <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>- i mean seriously, so friggin' good. tasted the salt air marg, eh whatever, not a big deal to me. \n\nthen, like everyone else, i agree...the bill came and i almost threw up all my food. $50 a person. we just got to vegas. shit. not a good start! next time, i will stick to one or two things and bring my own cocktail! snap!", 
            "a headache indeed. the menu items had weird names accompanied with descriptions that only baffled my friends and i even more. although the waitress who helped my table was more than helpful to recommend menu items, the food was small in portions (just like any other restaurant here in vegas) and were not good. \n\nthe 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> was okay. i'm of chinese ethnicity, so i feel like my mother's cooking could single-handedly run the chinese side of this chinese-mexican fusion (wtf?) restaurant out of business; the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> and carnitas were okay.", 
            "***3.5 stars***\n\nenjoyed it.  menu could still use a little refining - but amidst the overpriced nature of the strip - this place was exciting food at a reasonable price.\n\na few thoughts:\n-love the decor inside.  funky and fun - highlighted by the chinese fertility dolls in the middle/center, which are also where people sit while waiting for a table.\n\n-cocktails were great.  had the salt drink, as described by others, and it was phenomenal.\n\n-excellent service.  ali, our waiter, was attentive and just a very nice dude.\n\n\nand, food was a really unique mix of flavors.  loved the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> dish.  also the eggplant was really different (in a good way), loved the consistency of it.\n\nif i was to give this place a few suggestions it would be: a little less red meat/pork on the menu; tacos, as described by others, were a little greasy; and while the eggplant itself was cooked very well, the sauce on it was a little too heavy.\n\nlastly, get the <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>.  some of the best i've ever had.", 
            "some good - some not so good. guacamole was very good. <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> had some amazing flavors. tacos (langosta and carnitas) were just okay, dim sum was not very memorable.  very friendly service. i'd say they do the mexican much better than the chinese.  i realize you are going to pay more for on-strip, in casino dining -- but wasn't that impressed for the price. many other better restaurants.", 
            "finally! i made it to china poblano,  i had been wanting to go for so long.  like most of the reviews say,  the food is excellent,  but it adds up quickly with the small dishes.  if money were no object, i would go here once a week.  but at that price, its more of a special occasion.    the cocktails were fabulous,  and very tasty,  as were the pre-cocktails we had at chandelier bar.  \n\nmy favorite dish was the traditional shu mai,  the \"gold\" flecks were a nice touch.  they were moist and yummy and flavorful.   the 10 ingredient soup was a very unique blend of flavors.  good,  but next time i'll try a noodle soup.  \nthe guacamole was super yummy,  it had cucumber which i'll have to add to my next batch.  \n\nmy other favorites were the carnitas taco with green sauce and chicarones, mmmm and the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> with sesame.  \n\nfor the barbacoa taco,  i was expecting a traditional mexican slow roasted beef,  not something with bar-b-que sauce.  although i love nopalitos (cactus) on anything. \n\nnext time i'll have to have the queso, and more.....lunch anyone?", 
            "we had 14 people in our party and china poblano was excellent for a large group. it was a tuesday night and the restaurant was slammed, yet service was still very good.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> everything from beers to margaritas to tacos to pork buns to <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>. i tried a bite of everything. the stand outs for me were:\n\n-pollo con mole taco\n-cochinita taco\n-<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>\n\nour waitress was very accomodating and helpful. the restaurant also allowed us to bring in our own dessert for the occasion. \n\ni know some reviewers have commented on how expensive they think china poblano is for the food, but for us it was a great deal. our bill totaled a little over $700 for 14 people, including alcohol and gratuity, which averaged around $50/person. not bad at all considering it was a nice, fun meal with delicious food that lasted over 2 hours.\n\nit's not my favorite restaurant in the cosmo nor is it my go-to spot for tacos but for a fun, casual place to eat on that property i think china poblano is a very solid choice.", 
            "a strange combination, but one that works. personally, i would say the chinese half of the menu outshines the mexican portion, but both are filled with many good choices that are more than enough to fill you up.\n\nfirst off, the specialty cocktails here are great, and should not be avoided it you can help it.  the highlights from each of the menus would have to be: '<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>' (char siu bao) from the chinese manu, and the carnitas tacos from the mexican menu.  the beef sui mai is also good, but i would avoid the traditional sui mai which is a bit bland.  the lamb potstickers, mongolian beef, and <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> are also great, along with <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> and <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> from the mexican side of the menu.\n\nlike it's neighbor holstein's, this place is definitely best for lunch, but you'll be perfectly happy having dinner here as well.\n\nchina poblano takes a very novel idea, and executes it well enough.  is it the best chinese or mexican food you'll find on the strip? no, but its very good, and when combined into one restaurant, you have a very unique place to eat that doesn't disappoint.", 
            "chinese / mexican is a weird combination, but they appeared to make it work. the <mark>Chicken Ji Song</mark> was okay for chinese food. the <mark>Har Gow</mark> was disgusting. <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>? no. they don't. just steamed bbq pork buns. chinese takeout places here in sf sell better bbq pork buns than this place. conchinita taco? pretty good flavors. my pork wasn't shredded enough, but most people at the table said it was good. arrachera con salsa molcajete? damn good. skirt steak was a little rare, but i understand that you can't cook this too much. <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> - delicious! i've never had better ceviche. not in miami or sf. this was the best i've had. <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> was just okay.\n\nif i were to go again, here are the items i might order again:\n<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> - for sure!\n<mark>Chicken Ji Song</mark> - probably.\narrachera con salsa molcajete - maybe.\n\ni think i would try avoiding the chinese food more and going more for the mexican.", 
            "even i can't believe that i gave china poblano 4 stars but i did.  jose andres' perverse juxtaposition of mexican cuisine and chinese cuisine works.  who would have thought?\n\nlike many of jose andres' other restaurants, china poblano serves small plates.  thus it is possible to try many dishes in one sitting.  on my visit, i sampled, among other things, the steamed pork buns, the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>, the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>, cochinita taco, the barbacoa taco, and the lucky 8 sui mai beef.  \n\nthe <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>, and the cochinita taco were superb dishes that stood out above the rest.  the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> is wonderfully rich, as one would expect, and is accented well by the spicey chorizo.  the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> had a nice harmony of flavors between the garlic and the roasted poblano peppers.  and, the cochinita taco is everything you would hope a slow cooked pork taco would be.  \n\nwhile the three fore mentioned dishes deserve specific attention none of the dishes i tried were bad.  by mixing and matching between two very diverse cuisines, china poblano keeps things interesting and should have something that appeals to everyone's palate.", 
            "located in the cosmopolitan - i have to say what first caught my eye about this place was their viewing window where i could see them making pork buns, and also the fact it said there was take out. pork buns + take out = win! (not quite what happened but probably would have gotten more stars had that been the case.) \n\nchinese cuisine + mexican cuisine = china poblano. i'd say this is a fusion of the two but on the menu literally its two separate cuisines you can order from, no mingling at least not that my eyes could see. \n\norder consisted of: \n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> (4 pieces) - steamed pork buns $13.88\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - wheat noodles with spicy pork sauce $12.00\n<mark>Lychee Sour</mark> - yummy drink $12.00 \n\nso our waitress warned us that portions were small and that we should most likely order multiple things hence my pork buns and noodle dish. the pork buns to me were correctly portioned, i split the order with a friend thankfully because she had or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a single $10 lobster taco and $14 <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>. the waitress really wasn't lying on small portions i give her credit for her honesty. \n\nthe food was overall pretty good. i loved the flavor of the meat in the pork buns but was a little turned off by the meat being lukewarm/cold. my noodle dish was the kind of spicy i enjoy but i had to \"pace\" myself with the small dish swimming in a large bowl (i didn't understand this presentation, the lets make our portions look even smaller with using larger serving bowls?). the <mark>Lychee Sour</mark>, was probably my favorite part of the whole meal. it was a different type of cocktail, tangy yet sweet, and oh how i love lychee.\n\noverall a bit pricey for my taste given it wasn't anything overly special or wow factor. perhaps i'd order the steamed pork buns again from the take out window given i could request the meat be a little more on the warm side.", 
            "five girls for dinner, weren't  sure what we were getting into...waiter was very helpful, recommending everything from drinks to ordering family style. we still can't decide on our favorites. our top three are <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>, the beijing noodles and the pork belly shumai.", 
            "what a fun place...mexican and chinese on one menu. and, it's jose andres so you know it's good. \n\nwe tried five items:\n-<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>- fabulous! fresh and delicious which a hint of crunch. \n-traditional shu mei- light and flavorful. we loved these. \n-<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>- we love pork buns and these didn't disappoint. it's a pretty heavy dish though.\n-carnitas tacos- nice flavor on the pork. really good.\n-barbecoa tacos- good, but we liked the carnitas better.\n\nif you want to enjoy a leisurely meal, i'd recommend ordering one dish at a time. our server said he'd bring them out slowly for us (we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> all at once) and we were out of there in about an hour which is not a leisurely meal in my opinion. \n\nalso, many reviewers commented on small portions and high prices. i disagree on both comments. the portions were bigger than tapas and the prices were really fair (for vegas). \n\ni'd definitely go back!", 
            "if not for the out-of-this-world carnitas tacos (yay for pork rinds!) i think i would have given this place only 2 stars.  it advertises itself as \"chinese/mexican fusion\", but the menu is really just split up into various mexican dishes and chinese dishes (mostly of the dim sum variety). as an overall note, i think that the mexican dishes were much tastier than the chinese items, so if you are wrestling b/w the two, i would go with mexican. here's what we tried:\n\ntacos\ncarnitas - yum yum yum.  definitely order this if you order nothing else.  and get two, so that you won't have to share. a+\n\n<mark>Viva China</mark> - this is a kumamoto oyster/beef tendon/sichuan peppercorn sauce taco.  the combo of the tendon and oyster was underwhelming, and if you really love that peppercorn taste, you're not going to find much of it here. c-\n\nbarbacoa - we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> this because it came with \"cactus paddle\".  still have no idea what cactus paddle is, but it's an awesome name!  the beef was alright, though a bit salty, and the cactus unfortunately didn't really taste like anything at all. c-\n\nfried fish taco - the fish was fried nicely, and i liked the pickled onions that came with it, but it was close to 7 bucks for two tiny tacos and pinky sized pieces of fish, so probably wouldn't order it again.  b-\n\nchinese\n\nfire phoenix - this was pretty much a variation of popcorn chicken, with pork rinds on the side.the sichuan peppercorn salt was really good, and fried chicken never tastes bad when it's fres, but there really wasn't anything that special about this dish.  c\n\nmexican\n\n<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> - comes on a bed of ice and looks delectable.  tastes pretty a-ok too. i think they put soy sauce in here, which gives it a nice depth of flavor.  a-\n\ncoctel de camarones - this was pretty much like a cold cocktail of shrimp, crab, and avocado, mixed with what is essentially a cocktail sauce.  i love lump crab meat and i love shrimp, but i didn't come here to eat those things with cocktail sauce.  i can get that for 3.99 anywhere else.  c\n\n<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> - this actually did taste like a fusion dish, though it was a bit heavily sauced.  the shrimp are nice and garlic-y, with a hint of spice from the poblano peppers.  good, but could have used a side of rice or something.  b-\n\nin a nutshell:  i'd recommend just stopping in and sitting at the counter and ordering some tacos (especially the carnitas ones), and then going somewhere else for dinner.  as a disclaimer, we didn't order the famous \"twenty ingredient <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>\" that was featured on food network, but i'm taiwanese, and i just don't feel right paying 20 bucks for <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>.", 
            "this is one of a kind - unique chinese x mexican restaurant in town. i know this place is expensive for mexican and chinese,,, but i keep visiting there.\n\nto start with, i always order a drink with <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>. i have eaten scallop ceviche, but tuna is way better than scallops, i think.\n\ni would recommend the chinese inspired taco, <mark>Viva China</mark>. they are very tasty. fish taco was really good, too.\n\nfor dim sum, i recommend \"<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\", its a bbq pork buns. delicious (its a bit sweet side, tho).\n\nall the sui mai is very good. gold leaf on sui mai??? funny but they are good.\n\nhowever, noodles in the lower price range, <mark>Kao Lao Lao</mark> and <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> are my least favorite. the taste is flat - too greasy and boring. i dont recommend. i guess you get what you pay for. \n\nsoup,,, they are ok.\n\nbartender was super nice and explained everything i asked.", 
            "not worth your money and time. the atmosphere and decor is really cute but sad to say, that is not enough to bring me back. the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> was probably the most exciting thing there. the tanginess and these crunch lil things which i suspect is fried roe makes the dish! the tacos were blah and bland and most dissapointing of all was some wheat noodles with tiger sauce. we thought the sauce sounded exciting and exotic but it was just chinese fermented bean sauce. this sauce does nothing to boost the flavor of the horribly bland wheat noodles. totally disappointing and i will not be back!.", 
            "the first time i ate at this place, i went back twice on the same day.  and now every time i'm in vegas, i make sure to make the time to eat at this place at least once.  two favorite items on the menu are their <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> and <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>.  both are to die for.  i'm getting hungry just thinking about how delicious their food is.  an absolute 5 star experience.", 
            "yes yes and yes. i have been craving this place since eating here with my bf. it is astonishing to me that there are only 3 stars on the company profile. jose andres can do no wrong in my book.\nstarted our meals out with a few yummy cocktails. i got the margarita with a \"salt air topping\" wow. i could have had 4 of these, but decided i actually wanted to remember my meal so i refrained. its your typical margarita with tequila and fresh lime juice and agave, but topped with a salt foam. great presentation i may add.\nwe had no clue what to order so we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a few items to share. we had a friend join us so between 3 people, this is what we had\nensalada gaspacho estilo de morelia; an amazing salad consisting of pineapple, dragonfruit, mango, jicama, queso fresco, and a  chile pequ\\u00edn \n<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> minus the pecans \ncctel de camarones; =shrimp, jumbo lump crab meat, tomato, and diced avocado \n<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> shrimp in a sweet black garlic sauce with roasted poblano peppers \n\n....and the best thing ive ever eaten\n\n20 vegetable with friend rice. omg. this is a vegan dream with so many different veggies all grilled served over rice that seriously melted in my mouth. i cant wait to go back to this restaurant and have 2 orders of this...\n\nthis restaurant has a very interesting concept. asian fusion meets mexican. i really enjoyed these two combined. the service was impeccable, i wish i could remember my servers name but he was so awesome. with so many restaurants in the cosmo to choose from, i highly recommend trying this place.", 
            "what a spectacular experience! from beginning to end, we had nothing but a yummy and hospitable welcome from china poblano and its staff. this restaurant is located on the second floor of my very favorite vegas hotel, the cosmopolitan. the seating is comfy and somewhat communal with long benches and tables. the decor is chic and earthy. the drinks are spectacular...any of the cocktails are great. we loved the small dishes, especially the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> and the coctel de damarones. both of these dishes are unbelievable and the tuna and lump crab were plentiful! i was partial to the mexican side of the menu but enjoyed everything we had. the noodles are a great selection for the asian flavor. the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> was simple but packed with flavor. the food is sultry and inviting, just like the atmosphere. you usually don't have to worry about reserving a table way in advance. i can't recommend china poblano enough. you have to experience it for yourself. enjoy!", 
            "china poblano is a bright, fun, casual restaurant. seriously, it is a carpeted wall away from being an ecstasy-lover's dream. chinese and mexican small plates is the name of the game here. they have a healthy list of tacos. being a self-appointed taco aficionado, this was a welcomed sight. unfortunately, the two i tried (<mark>Viva China</mark> & carnitas) missed a mark a bit, but were still solid. however, when you are dropping five bucks on a taco, you are looking for a bulls-eye. the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>, on the other hand, was dynamite. i am not a huge ceviche fan, but the server recommended it, so we gave it a whirl. marcus was dead-on with this suggestion. we also tried the 20 vegatable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, which was alright. overall, the dishes were interesting and varied in tastiness. the food was quality and intriguing enough to warrant another visit sometime in the future.", 
            "the food was great and the service was good. we tried a little of everything, but the highlights were the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> (recommended by our waiter, and definitely one of our favorite dishes of the night), dancing eggplant (we thought an eggplant dish would be boring, but it was out of this world), and the lucky 6 sui mai. other highlights were the guacamole and the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> (both pretty unoriginal in terms of concept, but when prepared as perfectly as they were, you take notice). this restaurant does get expensive, especially for alcohol -- that accounted for half of our bill. i would recommend eating here, but drinking elsewhere.", 
            "i'm really surprised this place has only three stars. the boy and i came here on our last night in vegas and it was easily the best meal we'd had all weekend. since i imagine a lot of vacationers are frequenting this spot, i'll break down what we had:\n\nsalt and <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>: probably the best margarita i've ever had\n\ntaro chips: unbelievable. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> these for our ceviche, but i was gobbling them up on their own. insanely crisp and delicious.\n\n<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>: delicious. and quite a large portion for the price. the only complaint i might have is that by the bottom of the bowl, the tuna was completely overpowered by the dregs of citrus juice, but to be fair we ate this quite slowly interspersed with other dishes. might've had more time than normal for the tuna to get over marinated.\n\nsiu mai w/ <mark>Quail Egg</mark>: the best dish of the night, and easily the best siu mai i've ever had. and trust me, i live in queens in nyc, i know my asian food. the meat was soft, insanely flavorful, and the eggs just bursts with a creamy eggy-ness in your mouth.\n\npork buns (<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>): disappointing. i wouldn't be able to tell the difference between these and any old pork bun i come across. not necessarily bad, but not great.\n\nduck tongue taco (silencio): i am a fan of trying absolutely anything and everything, but this was just downright weird. i commend them for getting the tongue that soft, but the flavor wasn't appealing. \n\nbeef tendon taco (<mark>Viva China</mark>): outstanding. the beef tendon is crispy and packs an amazing amount of flavor. the sauce is delicious. \n\ncarnitas taco: my absolute favorite. i've never had such good meat in a carnitas taco. \n\ntwenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>: this one was interesting. first of all, i should mention that my boyfriend can't stand onions, so i sadly had to get this sans any kind of onions or scallions. i bet that would really add to the flavor. however, even without onions, this dish got a hold of me. at first i thought \"meh, it's <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>,\" but with each subsequent bite, i began to realize, \"wait, this is the best <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> i've ever had.\" every bite had a new vegetable. and the boy literally licked the bowl clean. \n\nchocolate teracotta warrior: really, we got this because we wanted our special dinner to end with some kind of dessert. the presentation is stunning, and the ginger ice cream mixed with the chocolate crumbles is delicious, but i could've done without this one. i have a feeling their other desserts are probably better.\n\nthe service throughout the meal was great, our waiter was very attentive and helpful in giving us tips on what we might want to order. and the vibe of the place was very nice. casual, but upscale. and not crowded. i would definitely come here again.", 
            "i was excited to try another of jose andres restaurants. of note, compared to many of his other restaurants, this one is a bit more casual. \n\nthe drink menu is excellent with many fresh and creative cocktails that are inspired by a fusion of chinese and mexican. they also have a large variety of different mescals. \n\nthis is definitely a small plate restaurant, so order at least 2-3 plates per person and share to experience as much as possible. the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> and tacos ( try the cochinita and lengua) were great!  the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> was more of a poke and less seafood ceviche, but still good. \n\na bit pricey compared to his other restaurants for the lesser experience but otherwise a fun place to have a casual bite.", 
            "my friend talked up chef jose andres so much on a (sorta) recent trip to dc that the name stuck, and after seeing it tagged to china poblano at the cosmopolitan, i figured it was destiny calling and just had to try it. \n\ni'm not really of the belief that culinary experiences, however life-changing they may be, should break the bank and i'll just tell you now that for two people, drinks, four small plates and dessert, came in at about a couple dollars over 100--but make an exception for this place because it was pretty effing good. \n\njust know what to order. \n\nthe 18 <mark>18 Monk Noodle</mark> was so amazing. you don't even realize the noodles are whole wheat, because they're just so good with the sauce and the shitakes. our waiter suggested we opt for the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> as opposed to the ceviche pargo and i could've, no wait--should've hugged him for it. the tuna was so fresh. the soy it was bathed in and amaranth seeds that topped it really enhanced the fish in a way that is pretty indescribable. \n\nwe also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, and the xo scallops in <mark>XO Sauce</mark>. i wouldn't recommend either because you didn't really come here for melted cheese and i don't want you to pay $18.88 for two golf-sized scallops, respectively. that was our mistake--but don't make it yours! a side note, they were both good, but not great and your hard earned dollars deserve great, okay?\n\nafter dollar signs kept racing through my head as i tried to figure out the damage, i wasn't really up to pay another double-digit figure for dessert, but the lady next to us devoured her mango sticky rice in a matter of minutes, so we thought, we'd come this far. #yolo \n\nanyways, it was so incredibly good! it's not your traditional thai-place-msr by any means. it's so light and airy and everything in it just works so well that as i write this all i really want to do is drive down to the cosmopolitan in my jammies and order it. \n\nas far as the service, and given it was a tuesday night, we got seated right away. our waiter, miller, was awesome! he didn't shy away from putting his two-cents when he knew we were making potentially catastrophic mistakes trying to decide what to eat and god bless him for it.", 
            "my only regret about china poblano is that i didn't go sooner. i've lived in vegas for a few years and finally made it here on national margarita day. i had their signature salt \"air\" margarita. it's not really air, but salty foam that floats on top of your drink. not only is it super cool and inventive, but it gives you a hint of salt in every sip. delicious!\n\neven though jose andres, the spanish chef behind china poblano, is world renowned, i was curious to see how he'd do mexican food. i grew up eating mexican food and am very picky. all my cynicism was gone as soon as i read the menu. the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, a melted cheese appetizer served by nearly every mexican restaurant, is made with queso menonita. most of you have probably never heard about it, but that's what <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> is supposed to be made with (not monterey cheese most restaurant use.) to know chef andres has it imported from mexico is really special. \n\nall the food we tried was great, especially the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>. the one thing we had that was kind of blah were the tacos. that's why i'm not giving it five stars. you can find way better tacos in nearly every taco shop at a fraction of the price. even the $10 lobster taco ($10 for one, little taco) was just okay. nevertheless, i can't wait to go back again for margaritas and queso!", 
            "i'm a las vegas food and wine writer by trade, so i learned a long time ago to take the good with the bad and focus on writing about the positives of a dining experience while ignoring the variables that can sometimes detract from an otherwise solid establishment. however, i feel that my most recent unpleasant experience at china poblano requires me to issue a warning to future diners, and that is to stay away. seriously, avoid this place and save your money. i used to absolutely love this place, the food was fabulous and unique, the drinks were delicious and creative, and the ambiance was festive and hip. the service has always been aloof and full of bad attitude (save for a delightful bartender named steve who was there when they opened but has since moved on to more hospitable pastures.), but i chalk that up to the general attitude of the cosmopolitan - which generally has the worst service on the strip across the board. since they opened, i've chosen to overlook that and make this my go to for entertaining clients and out of town guests in a casual setting as it really did have top notch food and a cozy atmosphere. alas, that is no more. it's been a couple of months since i dined with them, and apparently there has been an overhaul on the menu. the dishes are still tasty, however they have downsized many of them to tapas-like portions while keeping the prices the same (they were once reasonable, now they're typical strip mark-up). this was irritating, but not shun-worthy. that was reserved for the service that has gone from disinterested to disdainful. our server, richard, i admit had a sweet personality and an adorable smile - that is for the two minutes when he greeted us and took our order. once he did that we literally never saw him again until he brought us our check. this was not his fault, he was clearly the only bartender on duty. why they had him waiting tables as well while the bar was busy was beyond me. my companion and i each or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> salads. her, the beet and avocado (which was my favorite until now - it's been pared down to a tiny fraction of what it once was.) and i the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> (which could have been excellent had it not been drowning in an over abundance of lemon and soy). the pathetic excuse for a beet salad came out a full 10 minutes before my ceviche did. i waited for our server to notice, even attempting to flag him down, but he never bothered to come over. i finally stopped the tall, bald corpse of a manager (you'll know exactly who i mean if you see him) to ask if perhaps i might get my lunch before my companion finished. his response was a dippy 'well, ya know we have two kitchens so stuff doesn't always come out together, your server should have told you that'. that is the single worst excuse i've ever heard, and frankly, as i learned as a server many years ago it is unacceptable to ever take out only part of a table's order. not only was the service terrible but the manager was so annoyed that his diners would dare to ask to receive their food at the same time that he couldn't contain his disdain. i feel just awful that i inconvenienced him so by intruding upon his establishment to order food. i felt that unwelcome. no matter - i will never take another guest there again and i hope to save many a dear yelp reader from wasting their hard earned dollar on such nasty service and portions of food fit to starve a hamster. i will happily (and very vocally) never ever darken china poblano's door ever again.", 
            "tapas style mexican & chinese food (not fusion tho! they are not meshing the asian favors with the mexican flavors). i was recommended this place, but was iffy about trying it because it was two very different foods in the same restaurant... i wasn't sure if i'd like it, but i gave them a chance anyways and i'm so glad i did! my friend and i absolutely loved this place!!! we sat at the bar and started with an awesome pomegranate margarita topped with salted foam rather then the traditional salted rim. every dish we got we were completely satisfied with and we're looking forward to our next trip back to vegas so that we can eat here again! i highly recommend the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>, golden pig bbq pork buns, and the mango \"sticky rice\" dessert.  oh, another plus- our server was super friendly and outgoing :)",

            "odd. strange. weird. abnormal. disorientingly bonkers. that is how i would describe this jose andres' concocted \"fusion\" restaurant menu-melding both mexican and chinese fare.\n\nthere's actually two sides to the menu, mexican and chinese. this is not a fusion restaurant in the sense that the dishes are an amalgamation of both cultures and flavors, this is actually two cuisines co-existing on the same restaurant menu.\n\nwe came here for a dinner, pre-clubbing in vegas. the location at cosmopolitan is nice, easy to access (2nd floor pavilion near marquee night club). we had a big party of 10 and made a reservation, were seated within 15 minutes of our arrival. we had a few energetic waiters/servers and they explained the concept and threw out suggestions.  we all deiced to order and share...so people began ordering...mexican tacos, guacamole, <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>, empanadas...and chinese pot stickers, 20-veggie <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> (my choice), cold noodles, etc.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a lot of food. i think i tried everything, and you know what...nothing stood out...nothing was \"oh my god good\" and it was surprisingly bland, surprisingly meh, and surprisingly not all that filling. it just didn't do it for me.\n\nweird concept, bland food, confused and concerned taste buds and tummy, huge bill (like $600 huge), and we all didn't feel like we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> and ate $600 worth of food and drink.  it was suffice to say...a miss...and we should have gone to some other concept place like mesa grill, etc if we had really thought of it...only nice thing was proximity to our first club of the night...this was not what i have heard and experienced from jose andres' and we all left very disappointed.", 
            "let me start off by saying that i am shocked that this has a 3-star rating on yelp, i understand that the prices may be a little high, but remember 1) this is vegas and 2) this is in the cosmo, neither of which are known for being economical.  so come on people..\n\nmy rant is over...  after having eaten at china poblano, which my first jos\\u00e9 andr\\u00e9s dining experience, i will likely name my first child after him, then force my child to name their first born after him.  the food and drinks are playful and just flat out phenomenal.  i opened the night with his <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>, which has salt water foam on the top of it rather than a salted rim, and it was hands down one of the best margaritas i've had.  the bartender explained the jos\\u00e9 developed the idea after he was swimming in the sea and swallowed some salt water, then viola!  to kick off the food, i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> barbacoa and pescado tacos.  have you ever had food that is so good that you just smile after eating it?  well this does just that.  i then switched gears to the china portion of the menu and had <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>, which is 4 bbq pork steam buns.  the buns are light and doughy while the inside is a burst of unbelievable flavor.  last, but not least, i had to fuse the two worlds, so i had the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>, which was an interesting take on the classic by adding soy sauce and roasted amaranth seeds.  \n\ni was convinced the first time here would not be the last, but unfortunately i had scheduled work dinners throughout the week that screwed this plan up.  luckily, i was able to convince a group to take me here, and the second time was just as good as, if not better than, the first time.\n\nbravo, se\\u00f1or andr\\u00e9s.",

            "i seriously have no idea why the average is so low for this restaurant. i have been to china poblano twice now, and it can't get better than this!  i am a foodie and know good food when i eat it, so please take this review to heart!\n\nchina poblano is a \"nice casual\" chinese/mexican fusion restaurant at the beautiful cosmopolitan hotel in las vegas.  i have never stayed here, but i can just imagine how beautiful the rooms must be, given the interior of the hotel's main floor.  china is a very eclectically designed restaurant, definitely great for striking up some interesting conversation topics.\n\nallow me to rate what i have eaten there.  everything has been amazing!!\n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> - this is a must if you like cheese.  one of the best queso dishes i have ever tried, complete with handmade, fresh tortillas!\nchilaquiles - delicious and filling...not necessarily sure you need to get this if you are getting the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, as it is the same cheese.\n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> - awesome \"dim sum\" style pork buns...yum!\n<mark>Beijing Glass</mark> noodles - wonderful cold noodle dish, sort of like a noodle salad...that might not sound that intriguing, but this is a must try as well\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with mole poblano, mexican cream, and queso fresco - a great fries dish not to be missed!\n<mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> - this is what they are famous for.  it's good, but not my fave of what i have tried.\n\npeople i have gone with tried the pork <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>...they were underwhelmed.  they also tried the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> noodles.  i had a bite and they were really good!  i have also heard that the guacamole is just okay (like any other table side guacamole), but i still plan to try it one day.\n\nthis is my go-to restaurant for friday nights in vegas...definitely give this one a try!", 
            "chinese & mexican\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> red braised pork $8.88. a little salty and greasy but tasty. it has an interesting 'english muffin' type bread and a juicy pulled pork filling. be aware these portion sizes are itty bitty. i also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the 'fresh' squeezed papaya and mango juice. it tasted watered down and not sweet at all.", 
            "while staying at the cosmopolitan, we decided to venture away from the addicting \"secret\" pizza place that is on the same floor china poblano is on.  yes, this place is definitely pricey. newsflash to everyone: everything is overpriced in vegas and if you don't want to spend money, stay home. \n\nmy rating is based on service, selection and quality of food -not price.  \n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> \"cold tea for two\" that combined the flavors of green tea, tequila, and beer; this was very refreshing and interestingly delicious.  the green tea in it made me feel less guilty about drinking alcohol so early in the day. \n\nthen we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> their guacamole served with handmade tortillas -this guac is just like my mom's with generous slices of jalape\\u00f1os! best thing about the guac is that they make it to order from this huge mountain of avocados and you can choose how spicy to make it. the guac was a meal in itself -but i felt like a vegetarian pig and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> more.  \n\nthe <mark>Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll</mark> were delicious and our waiter was so attentive about my needs that he let me know that the sauce had fish in it and made an alternative soy sauce to dip them into.  i ended up dipping them into that guacamole and felt like i was eating asian taquitos... \n\nthen came the \"setas\" taco made with wild mushrooms on top of more guac! -supper yummy! my carnivore boyfriend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the \"rou ji <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>\" that looked more like a \"gordita\" with carnitas.  he said it was very tasty. \n\nyes, there's more... we decided to try their \"tres lychees\" dessert that took the concept of a traditional \"tres leches\" mexican cake and added lychees in three different forms: lychee ice cream, lychee whip cream, and fresh lychees on top. perfection!\n\ni will definitely return...", 
            "we ended up here about twice in just as many days, because there was almost too much to try in one sitting.  they've got a couple open kitchen stations - one for some of the mexican items and another with a huge steamer for the chinese dumplings, plus an area for making noodles.  i have to say that at the rather odd hours we were in, we didn't see much more than a few egg rolls being wrapped, however.\n\nthey have a fairly large cocktail menu with some interesting, though confusing things, and notably have a couple chinese beers by the bottle that i had not seen before.\n\nwe tried a couple tacos - silencio, with duck tongue and lychee, was quite good, the duck tongue being very approachable.  <mark>Viva China</mark>, with tendon and oyster, was similarly unthreatening.  in general, though the flavors were good and the textures were decent, these tacos put so many different components together that they often got lost in each other.\n\nlamb potstickers were good, and reasonably, but again not emphatically, lamby.\n\nhuitlacoche noodles were a little disappointing.  the noodles had a nice texture, but we had a hard time detecting much huitlacoche flavor.\n\nthe braised pork sandwich ( <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> ) was awesome, but about two bites.\n\nwe came back specifically to try the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>.  expensive at $17.88, it is possible that they did in fact include 20 vegetables, cut into very small cubes, somewhere within the rather small portion.  but in the end it was just that:  <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>.\n\nwe were hoping to see a lot more fusion on the menu, but most dishes were segregated onto one side or the other.  we enjoyed both our experiences - the servers were accommodating, though very casual, and there was a lot to look at in the space, from the cooking going on to the walls of offbeat art.  overall, and keeping in mind that this is in a fancy hotel casino in the middle of the desert, the food is remarkably good for the location.", 
            "while i'd never discourage someone from making their own discoveries our food experience was borderline horrible. \n\nthe cocktails (margaritas are topped with salted air which were refreshing and unique) and beers were spot on and the service polished and sharp. however the overpriced food was hit and miss. sui mai should be avoided (weird spongy texture and off tasting) as well as the weird tasting <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> and the ugly dancing eggplant. \n\nbright spots were the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> (awesome), unruly monk, guacamole, <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> and the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>. tacos are 2 bites and are $5.50 for one which i couldn't swallow the price tag so we skipped the tacos. bill was $240+ tip for 3 people. we left buzzed and full but we'd have a hard time going back except for drinks and maybe a few of the bright spots mentioned above.\n\nif you want killer dumplings and regional chinese food go to chinatown. for mexican food there are loads of more affordable and tastier options off strip.", 
            "i ate here again because i was staying in the cosmo and wanted to get something quick.  so i sat at the bar and the service there was good.  i remembered that the tacos were ok so i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the carnitas and the fish tacos.  i would have to say that the carnitas taco was super good.  the pork rinds on top put it over the top.  delicious.  the fish taco was less successful.  the pickled onions were too strongly flavored and completely overwhelmed the fish.  i also had the <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> - this is slow cooked pork belly (i think) on a crispy baked chinese flatbread.  omg - this was so good it's even beyond words.\n\nthe carnitas taco and the rou jia mo were so good that i had to go back one more time just before leaving vegas.  after my gambling losses, i needed a sure thing!", 
            "i have been wondering about this place for a while and have finally had the opportunity to stop by for lunch.\n\nthe menu was nice and simple so it wasn't hard to make choices and things come out in small portions, so it's best to order several things at once if possible.\n\nfirst up were the shumai: traditional (shrimp and pork), scallop (pork, bamboo, mushroom), and beef. the traditional and the scallop were good but similar in taste. the traditional had some gold leaf on top and the scallop was topped with tobiko. the beef wasn't too appetizing for me. the flavor combination of whatever was in the beef didn't work for me. \n\nnext up were some tacos and the chinese <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>. for the tacos we had fish barbacoa, carnitas and silencio. they were all just a little better than the tacos at a traditional taco stand. the duck tongue was a nice spicy treat that you don't usually see.\n\ndefinitely something you have to try once.", 
            "i've passed by this place quite a few times, but finally decided to dine in today. the service was very attentive, but i felt like they didn't go beyond what they teach you in table-waiting 101. our server asked if we were ready for drinks, entrees, then desserts and let us know her personal favorites for each course, but didn't actually describe any of them. i honestly didn't have any problems with the service though, it's the food/prices that leave me less than satisfied. \n\nguacamole ($15): although it was pretty pricey, it was probably my favorite dish of the night. there were a lot of large chunks of avocado, which is something i could never complain about and it was very fresh and flavorful. the only thing that i didn't like was that the waitress asked if we were done with it once the chips ran out, even though we still had about a third of it left. it was just kind of annoying that she was trying to take the plate away, rather than offering us more chips.\n\nlarge pot of <mark>Jasmine Downy Pearls</mark> ($8.88) - very aromatic and tasty. i would probably come here just for the tea.  \n\n<mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> ($4): i hardly touched the salsa, but i ate all the nice and crisp chips with the guacamole. definitely worth the four bucks.\n\npescado frito ($6.50): not very flavorful and not very \"fried.\" if i'm going to pay $6.50 for one taco, i expect it to be pretty damn good. \n\ndancing eggplant ($9.88) - the waitress seemed a little reluctant when we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> this. she made sure to warn us there were bonito flakes on it and the eggplant was boiled. i had the feeling she didn't like that at all. we thought it was just okay.\n\ntraditional sui mai ($13.88): i really loved the crisp water chestnuts they added in the sui mai. the edible gold flakes on each piece also gave it a unique presentation. \n\n<mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> (hot and sour soup) $8.88: this was the most disgusting hot and sour soup i have every had. it seriously ruined my palette. the whole bowl of soup just reeked and tasted like hot red wine. i have never tasted hot and sour soup like that before. i couldn't take more than two bites of it without feeling sick because of the strong wine flavor it had. don doesn't even like hot and sour soup, but he could still taste how much worse it was than others. \n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> ($8.88): way too salty and saucy. and for a whopping $8.88, this was definitely not worth it. \n\njericalla ($11) - have you ever had abuelita hot chocolate? it comes in a package like this: http://beautifulspitup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/abuelita-mexican-hot-chocolate1.jpg containing tablets of compressed cocoa, sugar, and cinnamon: http://beautifulspitup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cut-abuelita.jpg. well, the small amount of custard on the bottom of the cup was covered in what seemed to be ground up tablets of abuelita hot chocolate: http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v1zh1nc2vaskonusyjs5ja/l.jpg and no, that was not a good thing. i felt like ai was just munching on hot chocolate powder. i mean, the custard and sorbet alone were good, but i couldn't eat those without eating all the powder. plain and simple, it sucked. \n\noverall, i loved the presentation of all the dishes, however the flavors just didn't match. the hot and sour soup really killed it for me. the only thing i think was worth coming here for was probably the tea, but that's still not something i would drive over here for.\n\nwarning: if you look at your bank statement a day or two after coming here and the amount charged is a lot higher than what you actually paid, it's because they like to \"pre-authorize\" themselves for a 30% tip, but it goes down to whatever you actually paid them when the transaction clears. why anyone would give this place a 30% tip is beyond me...", 
            "i really liked it. their service was top notch, very attentive and courteous staff who can definitely handle chaos. being the only 2 casual eateries not counting the hidden pizza place in otherwise expensive restaurant land cosmopolitan, they are slammed all the time. i passed by everyday staying there and it was like a street mob scene. regardless, they had hired a bunch of cool cats who handled the situation well which i really liked because feeding hunger after walking around all day is one serious business.\n\nthe food was superb. very very fine for street food. i loved it. of course it was also because i expected nothing at all* bah! jose andres? oh no, not another jose andres joint, tacos? dim sum? oh whatever. so thats how i went in. but blow me down, i was dead wrong. they executed very well for what was just mindless street food in an expensive hotel. i shared  their beef tongue taco (excellent, low fat) , har kow (nice twist), <mark>Viva China</mark> taco (didn't like this one, too fried), cochinita taco (good), lobster taco (not special enough), <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> (good enough) and that was about it. i really loved the quality of their meat cuts. \n\npricey? yes, because tacos, dim sum etc. are not usually, thats the problem. but was it worth it? yes again.\n\natmosphere-- casual. so after all the partying and dressing up for great dinners, this is a welcome change. people are happy all around, not high and drunk like the other casual eateries because they don't serve up cheap fruit punch cocktails here. \n\njust too cool for that.", 
            "interesting blend of chinese and mexican food.  very unique and a little fancy at times.\n\nwe had the following dishes - click on the menu above:\n\ndont <mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark>\n hot and sour soup, pork, tofu, bamboo shoots, dried mushrooms \ngood soup.\n\n<mark>Beijing Glass</mark>\n bean sprouts, jicama, avocado, cellophane noodles, carrot, chinese cabbage, sesame dressing\ni liked this one - it's like a noodle salad.  the jicama gives it a bit of a crunch.\n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>\n hand-cut wheat noodles, spicy pork sauce\nnot bad dan dan noodles - with peanuts\n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>\n red braised pork\nit's the chinese pau with this most delicious tender pork.  a winner!\n\n<mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>\n fresh vegetables, <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>\ni can see lots of vege all finely chopped in this delectable dish.\n\n<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>\n oaxacan-style barbeque beef, guajillo chile, pickled cactus paddle\nneat taco!  i like the flavours!\n\ncarnitas\n braised baby pig, pork rinds, spicy salsa verde cruda \nvery good taco!  \n\ni wanted to give this place a try because of the unique blends of 2 cuisines.  will i come back?  sure!", 
            "the pros: food was delicious, nice ambience (it's in the cosmopolitan), very good service - my water glass was always full and waiter was attentive.\n\nthe cons: very pricey for what you get. i got a $5 tiny taco (equivalent to the $2 tacos ai had at bally's a few days earlier, lol) and a $8.88 \"<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>,\" which my friend said is normally $1-2 from food carts. my friend got the stuffed pepper, with pork and pomegranate seeds.\n\nboth were delicious but way out of our price range - the pepper was $16! we didn't know it was going to be such small portions.\n\ni guess the moral is go there if you have the money, but be warned it's all small plates. delicious small plates, but small nonetheless.", 
            "i like jose andres, chinese food and mexican food.  put them all together you'd get something spectacular, right?  well, at least that's i hoped for.\n\nthe service at china poblano was good.  i loved the interior.  images of mao, frida kahlo, the dalai lama, etc. projected on screen on the walls - nice touch.\n\ni had the <mark>Jasmine Downy Pearls</mark> tea and it was amazing.  it was fragrant and it tasted good.  it was a neat idea that they give you a timer so you get to enjoy the perfect tea whether you like it mild, medium or strong.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a bun of different things from the menu:\n\n<mark>Golden Pigs</mark>:\n4 fried bbq pork buns with a side of condensed milk.  dipping pork buns on condensed milk might seem pretty odd but it works.  sweet and savory just go well together.  5/5\n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>:\na braised pork sandwich.  the bread tastes just like biscuits but the filling's saaaalty. if you look at the menu, you'll see \"<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>\" in a box which will make you think that's their specialty.  honestly, i hated it. 1/5\n\ntacos (carnitas, langosta, <mark>Viva China</mark>, pescado frito):\nthe carnitas came with pork rinds on top but the pork in the taco was dripping in oil.  just let the oil drip off your taco and you're all set. great taco variety. 4/5\n\n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>:\n4 steamed bbq pork buns. yep, that's all i can say about that.  nothing special. 3/5\n\nlucky six siu mai:\n2 scallop siu mai, 2 beef siu mai and 2 traditional siu mai topped with itty bitty pieces of gold leaf. 3/5\n\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with mole:\ni wanted fries with my sandwich.  i had to pick between mole and <mark>XO Sauce</mark>.  fries + <mark>XO Sauce</mark> just doesn't seem appetizing so i went with mole.  the mole was overpowering.  there was a scant amount of mexican cream and queso fresco.  i can usually finish an order of fries but not this one. 2/5\n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> with chorizo:\nagain, nothing special. 3/5\n\nmango sticky rice:\nthis was the best thing on the menu.  instead of using sticky rice, they used puffed rice so you get that nice crunch with a nice creamy coconut sauce and semi-sweet mangoes. 5/5\n\nchocolate terra cotta warriors:\nthe name \"warriors\" is misleading because you only get one warrior made of chocolate filled with chocolate mousse on top of cookie crumbs and ginger ice cream.  it looks like something just died on my plate complete with dirt and flowers.  the presentation was just too funny but this chocoholic wasn't 100% pleased with the taste but the creativity was there. 4/5\n\ncajeta flan:\na flan made with goat's milk served with salted caramel ice cream and pineapple chunks.  the flan was mild and the salted caramel ice cream was just lovely. 4/5\n\nso why 3 stars?  for the amount and type of food you get vs. the price, not worth it.  it's like they grabbed the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> from viva zapatas, steamed bbq pork buns and siu mai from spring mountain, fish tacos from rubio's for like $3 each and decided to serve it to you for double or triple the price.  part of what makes chinese and mexican food great is that they're inexpensive.", 
            "my beef isn't so much the  actual taste of the food it's more like the portion and cost.  i know, i know after all this is las vegas so everything is priced three times what it usually should cost. it is completely beyond me how people can charge this much for food. during this particular visit i arrived with seven other guests three of which were menly men (like these boys could eat). one of them even asked which is your largest meal and the waiter responded with twenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>. judging by it's miniture size i doubt it actually had twenty vegetables it was probably named that cause it cost close to twenty dollars! \n\nnext up is the <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> it is braised red pork in a chinese flat bread. it was tasty but a bit on the salty side and was almost half the size of my iphone! \n\nthen my hunny and i split the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> per the waiter's recommendation. it was packed full or flavor and mouthwatering good. it was $16 for eight pieces.\n\nagain my complaint isn't towards the taste or quality of the food mainly the portions. the service was good we were seated within 10 minutes for a party of eight while other places had hour long wait times. the restaurant decor and arrangement was very chic and trendy. but after loosing my butt in the casino i doubt i'd be able to pay for a substantial lunch here!", 
            "this place should be avoided at all costs!  expensive, small portions and underwhelming flavor on all dishes.  only tried the asian food here, but everything was unacceptable!\n\nthe food-\nportions are tiny; consider everything you order as an appetizer sized.  \nflavor-where did it all go?\n\n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>-came out warm not hot.  no unique flavor to speak of.  \n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>-joke!-no flavor; nothing special;tiny\ndancing eggplant-1 asian eggplant-unimpressed sause\n<mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> -more like steamed rice.  no flavor.  worse than what your white friends can dish up\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>-soo bad bun was the best part\n\nservice-none to speak of.  couldn't fill my glass.  unattentive and clearly didn't give to be there.  \n\n\nthe good-\nview of people cooking?-if your into that\n\nok-\n\nbad-\neverything from the service to the food and flavor.  if you like tiny expensive unfavorable portions this place is for you", 
            "ok food the waiter described the restaurant as tapas style but his was just really small portions and really overpriced. not really fusion just sold both mexican and chinese food.  their chinese <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> was delicious but it was tiny and would not pay $9 for that. overall the dom dom mian was ok the sweet and sour soup was not good.", 
            "this place is great! i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> and the reposado flight of tequila and was very impressed.  the sandwich was an asian flair of a bbq sandwich and the tequila came with 2 great reposado's and an equally great mezcal and a palate cleansing drink to sip on.   this place is great!", 
            "this place is awesome! great mix between asian & mexican!\n\nwhen you first walk in it has a great cushion decor & feel. it's neat just to look around at the various decorations.\n\nwe tried a flight of tequilas & their margarita- both were delicious! super recommend their <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>!\n\nmy hubby had the rou jai <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> & it was delicious!\n\ni had the carnitas & cochinita tacos both were super delicious! we shared the chips & salsa & those were yummy too.\n\nservice was great also! our waitress was nice & prompt! we highly recommend this place. it's 100000 time better than the gross buffet!", 
            "i've been here a few times, it's an interesting mix of mexican and chinese.  some of the items are really hit or miss.  \n\nthe last time we went we sat at the bar and sarah schooled us on tequila, that girl is full of tequila knowledge, some really interesting stuff.  we had a few tequila flights, very interesting taste testing.  \n\nthe <mark>Caldo Tlalpeno</mark> wasn't that good had a odd flavor.  the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> ($19.88)was just ok, until i added <mark>Monk Chile Sauce</mark>($2.88), it added some flavor to it. the <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> was pretty good, the pork was very sweet tasting.  now the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>, looked bad, but was very good.  \n\nwould i suggest this place, boy that's a tough one, the menu is such a mine field, maybe i would and suggest sticking to the tacos and tequila.",

            "i came in with decent expectations. walking in, they were lowered a little bit. very gaudy, flashy decor. but once you look at the menu, it speaks for itself.  \n\nthe food isn't really fusion. they have a mexican side and an asian side. the cocktails are made with agave-based spirits and they have some agua frescas too.\n\ni started with a horchata. it was good.. a little chalky compared to others i've had, but not too sweet. my friend got the mango and it was delicious. \n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> many small things to share, starting with the lengua taco.\n\nbest lengua taco i've ever had. meat was seasoned, tender and simply garnished with radish, onion and cilantro. you can tell the corn tortillas are fresh and made in house (you can watch some ladies making them as you walk in).\n\nnext we had the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark>. similar to chinese pork buns but deep fried. the dough was slightly sweet and delicious. they're served with a side of house made condensed milk. yum! \n\nthe fries came next.. they were loaded with mole (perfectly balanced), crema and queso fresco. fries are hand cut. they were yummy. a carnitas taco came out too. again, best carnitas taco i've had. it was garnished with salsa verde and pork rinds.\n\nthe duck tongue taco and a chinese pork <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> were last. the duck tongue was glazed in some delicious sweet sauce, garnished with fresh lychee... a bit hard to get over the mental block, but i still gave it a shot. the pork sandwich was very full of flavor. chopped pork braised with 5 spice. \n\noverall, everything was very well executed. they mentioned almost everything was made in house. service was fantastic. definitely recommending this place to friends visiting vegas! it won't break the bank either."

            "2.5 stars\n\nunfortunately, i was ultimately disappointed.  the service was actually quite excellent, but the food ultimately fell short, considering the price.  \n\nit was interesting to see that in the front of house, there were two kitchens.  a mexican kitchen and a chinese kitchen on opposite ends.  i was hoping for more fusion entr\\u00e9es, but there were only a few.  the menu was predominantly mexican or chinese.  \n\nsetas tacos: mushroom tacos.  nothing special.  it felt it needed some kind of fresh vegetable in there to add some crunch.\n\n<mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>: actually pretty good with an amazing variety of vegetables in it.  good flavors, season well.  is it worth paying $16 for <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>...however good it may be?  questionable.\n\nthe unruly monk: hand-cut noodle soup.  when it came out, it smelled absolutely amazing and then it went downhill from there.  the hand-cut noodles were overcooked and mushy.  the broth lacked flavor.\n\n<mark>Beijing Glass</mark>: my friend had this one.  it actually had a nice crunch and was refreshing.  i'd call this dish a success.\n\nguacamole: this was really good guacamole with just a hint of heat.  but $12 for only one cup of guac????  c'mon...that's crazy talk. \n\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with <mark>XO Sauce</mark>: interesting concept, but wow...that <mark>XO Sauce</mark> is extremely overpowering and extremely greasy.  i had about 4 fries, but after that, it was too much.\n\nhappy buddha giggling taking a bath: it seemed like a pretty fun dessert.  how can you not like a jello mold of buddha sitting in lychee foam??  it was fun to squeeze his cheeks to make his mouth move, but it was pure novelty and not worth the $10. \n\nall-in-all, it was some hits, but more misses.  great service kinda made up for it.", 
            "we had a great christmas lunch here. \n\noverall the food was good, but nothing to rave about. it takes some time to get used to having chinese and mexican at the same time. i recommend the <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>, <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>, and lamb potstickers. papas frites (fries) were excellent as well, but i would order it with the toppings on the side. just don't get the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>...it was boring, the portion was tiny, and definitely not worth $16.88!\n\nthe main reason i'm giving it 5 stars is the desserts. they were amazing! we had mango sticky rice, happy buddha gello, and coconut tapioca balls. they were all delicious without being too sweet. \n\ni also loved the interior with funky mix of mexican and chinese decorations.", 
            "we were checking out cosmopolitan and accidentaly came across this restaurant. when i looked at the menu i thought it was way overpriced, but then i realized i was in the brand new 5 star las vegas strip hotel, so it was ok. all restaurants in lv strip hotel are overpriced anyway.\nexpect to order at least two dishes per person (around $30) because the portion is really small.\n \nwe had:\n- guacamole\nreally good but a bit salty. the tortillas are super good, the best i have   tasted so far.    \n- twenty veg <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>\nthe best <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> i have ever tasted, rice is cooked perfectly and the vegetables are super fresh. (i am chinese, so i know my <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>)\n- <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> (steamed pork buns, dimsum style)\nso so. they used the really fatty part of the pork, so i can't really taste the meat when i bite into it.\n- <mark>Chicken Ji Song</mark> \nit was ok, good, but not impressed.\n- unruly monk (vegetable noodle soup)\nreally good noodles, perfectly al dente. the soup is ok.\n\nso among the food i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> i was most impressed by the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>. the portion was super small for $16, but it was good.\n\nwill visit this place again on another trip to vegas.", 
            "i love oyamel and jaleo, so i was eager to see jose andres' latest creation, and i had really high expectations for china poblano.  i had this idea that mexican-chinese fusion would be the love child of two of my favorite restaurants, oyamel and myers+chang (a funky pan-asian restaurant in boston).  we decided to try the asian side of the menu at china poblano, after we realized that there weren't that many fusion dishes on the menu.\n\nthe good: the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> was great - the soy sauce did not make me think of sashimi at all! overall, it was a flavor combination that i wouldn't have thought of, and i liked the texture of the ceviche with the walnuts.  the monk's noodles had a nice texture, and i was pleasantly surprised by the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> - it really distinguished itself from your average <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>.  as far as drinks go, i had a margarita with sea salt \"foam\" (standard at oyamel, still tasty here).  the lemon drop with \"noodles\" was clever, and it tasted like your standard lemon drop.  yes, i bought into the cutesy presentation, and i enjoyed it.\n\nalso good: the service.  the host table seemed a bit confused but once we were seated, everyone was great.  our waitress had recommended the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> to us over the scallop ceviche, since she thought the scallop portion was too small, and i always like candor from the waitstaff.  there was also a mistake at the bar, and when she saw a drink about to go to waste she brought it over to me (yay!)  the entire staff was very attentive.\n\nthe bad: we had the \"<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>\" pork steam buns, and something about the texture of the bao was off.  even worse though, the meat was underseasoned.  the same thing goes for the <mark>Ten Treasure</mark> noodle soup and the monk's noodles - they looked great but the broth was underwhelming.  it's difficult to get the broth just right (tampopo, anyone?) but if you can't, maybe you shouldn't offer so many noodle soups <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> menu.\n\ni'm willing to give china poblano the benefit of the doubt, as the restaurant was only two weeks old when we visited.  i will probably eat here again... but there are so many restaurants to try on the strip, so i'm not sure when or if i'll be back.  the bottom line is, jose andres does a fantastic job with mexican cuisine and tapas, so if you're going to visit, maybe that's what you should stick with.  my visit to china poblano just left me craving a visit to myers+chang and oyamel.  i didn't take the ceviche and tacos at oyamel for granted before, but i will certainly appreciate them a lot more on my next visit.", 
            "my first time at the cosmopolitan hotel and was hungry so went upstairs to find this restaurant! \ngot seated right away and asked the server what their most popular dishes were from the china menu section and he told us couple options.\nbf or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> (kind of dry but was still delish) and i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> which was very delish!\ni did not feel guilty after eating my dish because it was full of different types of vegetables!", 
            "stayed at the cosmopolitan over the valentine holiday and i had the the chance to eat the china poblano...the chinese food was horrible tasted like dog food, the hot and sour soup tasted like soy sauce was the only ingredient in the damn thing, the 16.00 bowl of <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> tasted like shit it was salty as hell. stevie wonder could of done a better job. i'll\"ll never eat there again. their mexican food was some what decent. i actually liked the tendon burrito sorry i forgot the name . i cant believe they serve that overpriced crap!!!! china poblano should be only serving food to the clark county jail...never again shame on cosmopolitan hotel hope that place catches on fire...", 
            "4 eggrolls, thick as a chap stick and twice as long = $12\nplate of romaine lettuce w/ 4 oz of beef = $12\nthe food here is overpriced.  the food itself is pretty bland.  we tried 3 types of noodles, eggrolls, <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, \"mongolian beef\", tacos.  the \"best\" was the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, but <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> is hard to mess up.  the tacos i tried were oversauced and a little undercooked.  i would honestly eat at panda express or del taco before i eat at this place again.", 
            "china poblano is such an interesting place. i think that merging dim sum and taqueria is really cool. the place is really cool. has very interesting art everywhere and its nice to sit at eithr of the two bars to watch them make tacos or dimsum.\n\ni had or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a singapore sling for my drink. i had no idea that any place had it besides the famous raffles hotel in singapore where it originated. it was soo good! very grapefruity, not too sweet. my friend had their specialty margarity wc was also amazing. they top it with this salted foam as opposed to rimming the glass with salt. very cool.\n\nfor food we had the unruly monk wc is a noodle soup dish. nothing crazy. i thought it was alright. we had the  other noodle soup dish with the corn truffles. very interesting, had a good spice to it and loved he corn truffles. we had the twenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>. pretty good but pretty standard. we also had the nice but naughty bamboo shoot salad. very refreshing. love the heart of palm in it. a little mayonaise-ey at times.\n\non the mexican side we had the babrbacoa del res tacos. omg the beef was seasoned perfectly. so flavorful and cooked so well. the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> was fantastic. perfect spice and had a roasted quality. the like water for chocolate was really interesting too. the lotus flowers were tasty.the sauce was fruity and on the berry side.\n\nfor desert we had the flan. very good with slices of roasted pineapples drenched in vanilla bean. and the ginger ice cream was great. i also had tried their sticky mango rice dessert. it is not your typical sticky amngo rice. it is the modern version. it was the deconstructed version.\n\nall in all a great culinary experience with very interesting fusions. a greta menu, from lamb potsitckers to duck tongue! ambiance is great. casual and very fun. could get pricey once you start ordering you just cant stop! u wanna try everything! and it helps that its at cosmopolitan hotel, the best one on the strip right now.", 
            "first, let me tell you what this place is not.  it's not cheap, although not terribly pricey by vegas standards. if you want a cheap fast meal, i would recommend grabbing a couple slices at the pizzaria upstairs.  it's not really fusion, since most of the dishes are clearly either mexican or chinese, with only a couple that successfully fuse the two.  it's also not a fine dining experience you would expect at some of jose andres' other restaurants. \n\nhowever, we did enjoy excellent service and very tasty and often creative food. the server was very knowledgable about the menu and seemed enthusiastic about the food. service was very attentive and the manager even stopped by to make sure everything was good. \n\nthey have two nice open kitchens where you can see homemade dim sum made next to handmade tortillas. we mostly tried the chinese dishes, since we have plenty of good mexican in la. the lamb potstickers are juicy, delicious, and beautifully presented.  the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> is probably the best <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> i have ever had. we also tried the chilaquilles, which were delicious and filling. the tacos seemed pricey at $5 a piece, but we didn't try any. the mango sticky rice was very light and refreshing, but don't expect any actual sticky rice.  try the \"tea for two\" for an interesting cocktail. overall, it was a very good dining experience although not necessarily the best value.", 
            "mexican? chinese? chinexican??! w-h-a-t? \n\nok, now that i've figured that out i can say that this place was amazing. i've heard great things but honestly i never let comments affect my opinion before i eat somewhere.\n\nthere were a few meals that were definitely family sized including both the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>(a must have) and the noodle/soup dishes. the tacos themselves are very different and each has its own unique taste/texture. duck tongue taco? yes please!\n\nthere was a problem with one of the dishes and it literally came out about 10-15 minutes after we were done eating so we no longer wanted it. service was a bit poor and inattentive aside from the food mix-up but the food was so tasty that i barely wanted to take off a star.", 
            "great idea, awesome food, who would have thought to put together chinese and mexican. got the twenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> based on a story from the show \"best thing i ever ate\", then myself and friends shared tacos. great stuff, would love to have this back in dc.", 
            "review:  20 veg <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> / red braised pork <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>\n\nwe specifically went to this restaurant to try the 20 veg <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> ($17.88) that was featured on foodnetwork's \"best thing i ever ate.\"  loved it!  i wish i could duplicate the sauce.  big bowl, definitely feeds 2 as a main dish, 3-4 as a side.  my husband had the red braised pork <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> ($8) and he said it was very good.  pricey though for a very small sandwich.  still, the quality is outstanding and i'd rather eat less and pay more for great food.  bench style seating on community tables is hard on the back (no back rests); very sleek modern style - interesting ever changing graphics projected on the walls.  i'd go back for the veg <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> and would like to try their other food.  great quality!", 
            "went here close to a month ago and just getting around to posting a review. we've tried several other restaurants at the cosmo and have become fans of the resort and it's food offerings. <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark> started off not so great, with the hostess service a bit frenzied and disorganized. there was no one at the hostess area and a bunch of us milling by the entrance not sure what was going on. once seated, everything changed. the server was awesome...cheerful, knowledgeable and attentive. the service seemed a bit rushed at times. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> six different things and the time in between servings was sometimes not enough. i have no problem with the portions, which are on the small side and for the most part really aren't suitable for sharing unless you order a bunch of things.   i'm always about quality and not quantity, and the quality was excellent. these dishes, sauces, etc. aren't just slapped together. they are creative, complex and well executed. the prices for small plates is high, but again, cosmo on the strip, what do you expect.  now for the food: \n\n<mark>Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll</mark> - delicious, but nothing really set it apart from all the other good <mark>Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll</mark>. \n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - wheat noodles in a spicy pork sauce. omg. it's been a month and i still can't stop thinking about it. \n\n20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>. the price will blow you away, but have to say we really enjoyed it. the time and effort that goes into this dish is incredible and you can literally identify all 20 vegetables finely chopped in perfect proportions. \n\ncarnitas taco - awesome. the spicy verde cruda sauce...i asked for a side dish of it and almost drank it. \n\n<mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark>. had never tried pork belly, and the combination with pineapple was intriguing. good, but not my favorite. \n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> - outstanding, with a nice slightly burnt top to the cheese, perfect texture and great tortillas.\n\nthe beer was cold but could have been colder.\n\nwill definitely be back.", 
            "though mexican-chinese fusion food is not new (the same idea was done in the northern mexican city of monterrey, with its upscale \"chino latino\" restaurant), this restaurant can hold its own. the decor is modern, kitsch, and very inviting. seating is limited at night, so make sure to make a reservation. the food here is actually not \"fusion\", per se, as asian-inspired and mexican dishes are served on their own, and not \"mixed\". so, you can order pork dumplings and carnitas tacos separately. i believe this idea is lazy, but i would rather have well executed authentic food, rather than a failed attempt at some fusion. the cochinita pibil tacos are delicious, perfectly seasoned and very authentic. they taste very similar to what to would eat at the yucatan peninsula. of course, here they are way overpriced and served on a special taco gadget that keeps tacos standing up (to prevent spillage, i would assume). the barbacoa tacos are also very authentic tasting, as well as the pork belly tacos. we also tried the 20-vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, as we'd previously seen someone on the food network claim it was the \"best thing they ever ate\" in las vegas. i would not go as far as saying it was the best thing here, but it is delicious. the \"mexican mimosas\" are also very refreshing, though there is no such thing as a \"mexican mimosa\"... the margaritas, on the other hand, are modern and very tasty, as the salt element is done as a foam instead of only as a rim on the glass. inventive and great. do not order the cajeta flan, as it has nothing to do with a mexican flan. i understand the chef was trying to add his own spin to this traditional dish, but i believe he should stick to what he knows best. it was nice, but it should not be named \"flan\", as it was more of a \"crema catalana\" (a typical dessert of the catalunya region of spain). the tortillas are hand-made, and you can reall taste the difference! i have to go back to try the asian food. overall, portions are tiny, so be prepared to order 4-5 per person. it is not cheap for the same reason. but, i will definitely come back.", 
            "would be a 4 star, but way over priced.\n\notherwise, we've been here a few times, and they have good food and drinks. we really liked the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>, <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, barbacoa tacos, and definitely delicious guacamole and chips (ask for chips instead of tortillas).", 
            "such a disappointing place!  while i lived in dc several years ago, i visited many of his restaurants there and they were all amazing.  i was so hopeful for china poblano...but oh no, what happened?  the service was not good and the food was terrible and ridiculously overpriced.  the sprite i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> was $5 and the coke was $5.88...nowhere on the menu does it reveal these crazy prices!  but, back to the food...the vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> had no taste whatsoever and the <mark>Ocean's Nest</mark> barely had any seafood in it...just a lot of large vegetables!  there are so many other great choices in vegas and i am so disappointed we spent $80 here...ouch!",

            "this is truly an original concept.  i must say that i enjoy cuban-chinese food better, but this restaurant knows better than to go down the fusion route.  it is a truly fun place.  it is pricey but a good bargain by las vegas strip standards.  i enjoyed the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>.  it gives you an interesting combo of flavors.  the pork sandwich is a winner, as is the langosto taco and the pan fried noodles.  is it truly authentic: no.  if you are looking for dim sum or true chinese or mexican cuisine you will be disappointed.  however, it you enjoy creativity, and a restaurant willing to push the envelope with a fun atmosphere this is a great place.  i look forward to returning!",

            "really wonderful, adventurous casual dining on the strip.  \n\nwhile i am not a fan of the cosmopolitan's brand of chrome and disco decorating, i was immediately taken with the bright colors and fusion of elements in the china poblano restaurant.  immediately one becomes aware of two contrasting cuisines.  as you enter there are two bar areas where diners can watch various food preparations.  one side is devoted to mexican food and the other to chinese food.  \n\nthis dichotomy is reflected in the menu as well which is divided up largely by types of dishes and the two cuisines.  a closer look shows a comingling of cuisines within though.  \n\nthe 20 vegetable vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> was so yummy.  as full of vegetables as its name suggests.  the lamb pot stickers were served under a dome of incredibly thin and delicate pastry.  there was the hint of cumin lurking around the dish that was a beautiful almost haunting harmony with the delicious pot stickers.  one of my favorite dishes while i was in vegas!\n\nwe also enjoyed the guacamole and <mark>Golden Pigs</mark> (fried and steamed pork dumplings that were served with a sweet condensed milk sauce, a wonderful balance between sweet and salty flavors).\n\nfinally a jericalla which was described as an oaxacan chocolate custard with  passion fruit and chocolate sorbet.  this was an amazingly light and lovely dish.  beautifully layered as a parfait with solid chocolate in with the creamy elements and contrasting in texture.  just an amazing combination of tangy fruitiness and deep chocolate flavor.  really worthwhile.\n\nwhile this is slightly expensive for casual dining, the quality of ingredients, thoughtful food combinations, beautiful presentations and wonderful service made it a terrific choice for us.  i will brave the overstuffed glamor of the cosmopolitan for a repeat visit.",

            "***jose andres' china poblano in the cosmopolitan hotel scores a mediocre score of 3 stars on yelp, but i found all of the food (i had two of their savory courses and 1 dessert) to be good to very good***\n\nchina poblano features a mix of contemporary mexican and chinese dishes.  some dishes are gussied up with contemporary cooking techniques or high end ingredients while other dishes veer more on the fusion side.  \n\ni started with one of their tacos--a carnitas one topped with guacamole, fresh lime and chicarrones.  i thought the fillings were great.  the carnitas was moist and tender.  it was also nicely seasoned.  it had a good flavor and wasn't too salty (which happens a lot with carnitas).  the guacamole was cool and refreshing and it was a great contrast to the warm and savory carnitas.\n\nthe chicarrones were crispy and light.  the soft corn tortilla was fine, but it wasn't a good vessel for the meat juices.  the only problem with the taco was that it was too wet.\n\ni also has the twenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> and it was very good.  the rice had a nice soy flavor, but it was not too salty.  the vegetables provided great contrasts in textures, but with that many vegetables, which were cut up into small pieces as well as paired with a flavorful rice, the individual flavors of the vegetables were (as expected) kind of lost.\n\nstill, there were a lot of vegetables including fresh greens, crispy sweet potato, haricot verts, squash, turnips, carrots, asparagus, brussels sprouts, and watermelon radish.  there were also proteins like soft tofu and scambled egg.\n\nfor dessert, i opted for their flan and it was very good.  the flan was incredibly smooth, creamy and light like a panna cotta.  it was topped with a great cajeta gelee (rich caramel flavor).  there was also cajeta ice cream (incredibly dense and a great rich caramel flavor).  the plate was garnished with good pineapple, which was not too tart.\n\nservice by the bartender victor was excellent; he was incredibly personal and helpful with the menu.  you could tell he really wanted all of his customers to have the best experience possible.\n\nprices are not too bad considering that it was vegas.  the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> dish was under $20 and it was a very generous portion.  some portion sizes seem small in a few dishes when considering the prices (like the tacos), but it is still a better value than the many overpriced vegas restaurants serving just so-so food.\n\nin terms of the decor at china poblano, the bar gives you a view of the chefs making the dim sum.  there is a main dining room, but i wasn't a fan of the tables (they kind of looked like what you would find at a gourmet order-at-the-counter spot).  overall, the decor was forgettable and not that great.\n\ni thought the food at china poblano was good.  the food was pricey, but vegas food tends to be pricey and there are places in vegas serving much more expensive food that is not nearly as tasty or refined as what you can get at china poblano.  i think china poblano is a good spot for an upscale lunch.  and since the same menu (with the same prices) is featured at dinner, it is a good spot for a nice dinner with a more casual approach and more reasonable prices than the many overpriced high-end dinner places in las vegas.\n\ni believe the cosmopolitan offers both complimentary valet and self parking.",

            "as we were gathering our things after touching down at mccarren airport,\nour main concern was of course food.\ni suggested mexican (per usual) while my friend had been thinking chinese. well you can imagine our surprise when the concierge mentioned a mexican-chinese fusion restaurant within our very hotel.\n\nthis is not your standard mexican. so be prepared to shell out a lot of money for\neach very small taco. however, it is somewhat worth it. my friends or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> green tea sour cocktails (with an edible marigold) while i tried a new beer: moutai - it was light and exactly what i needed with my food. \n\ni tried the barbacoas and carnitas tacos. the carnitas was quite delicious but i am not quite used to the consistency of pork belly, so it was a bit of shock to bite into something so... jelly-like. \n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> because apparently it was on some\nwell-known foodie list and we weren't disappointed at all.\n\nlike all of our food, it was light, incredibly fresh and made with simple ingredients. \n\nfor dessert i had the mango sticky rice.\ncoconut milk is boiled to a cream and then added to shaved mango\nand sprinkled with crisped rice to create something incredible. loved.\n \n the decor inside china poblano was... interesting. there were steering wheels\nspanning most of the ceiling, an altar of buddhas near the entrance, \nlow ottoman seating and a red/orange color palette. \n \n\nwhat i loved? there is one \"bar\" for mexican  and one for the asian inspired dishes. each were incredibly clean and each dish is served as it is ready so if you order several things (as you will need to) you do not have to place the same emphasis on some of the more traditional dining rules.\n \n while i enjoyed my experience there (for the most part...) i do not think i would go again. it is definitely a great place to pop into if you are in a bit of a rush and not \nparticularly hungry, or else $6 per tiny taco just becomes a bit annoying.", 
            "dang. the vegas crowd is harsh - or at least very conservative with their stars.  came here over the weekend with a bachelorette party and i think everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food and drinks.\n\nbetween me and two other girls, we split: <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> (fries with rich mole sauce), <mark>Open Sesame</mark> (chilled noodle salad), <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> (cellophane noodles in soup), tuna cevhiche (veeeerrrrry interesting crunch), and dan dan mien (noodles with a spicy kick).\n\ni had a mexican mimosa and other people in the group had the <mark>Lychee Sour</mark> cocktail and <mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark>.\n\nseriously no complaints about the food except that the portions are tiny.  however, considering how many dishes we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> for three girls (we eventually cancelled our order for 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>), i think we did just fine.  sure, it was a little pricey, but you're in vegas and you're at the cosmopolitan.  the strip is littered with panda expresses if you want something cheap.\n\nnow that i've returned from vegas, and my coworker (who recommended china poblano to me) and i are discussing the different dishes that we've eaten here, i'm itching to go back.", 
            "love the decor. great service with friendly attentive staff. the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> are incredible. lobster tacos and the twenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> are perfect for a light lunch and leave plenty of room for the amazing mango sticky rice. wonderful fun restaurant.",

            "you need to come here with the right expectations.  china poblano is a mexican-chinese hybrid/fusionish restaurant by jose andres.  portions are on the smaller side while prices are on the larger side.  modern, more asian design/decor and it's in the cosmopolitan hotel near the upper level of the chandelier bar.  there...with that said, on to the food.\n\nwe had the heavenly pigs (roasted pork buns with condensed milk), a 20 (or 24) veggie <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, ha-gau (shrimp dumplings) and a vegan mexican spiced hand cut noodle dish.  honestly the food was pretty good.  everyone really liked the heavenly pigs though it was only 4 buns for 14 bucks.  the condensed milk really brought the little piggies to another level.  best plate by far.  the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> was done really well, but nothing exceptional.  shrimp dumplings were really fresh and also done well (again expensive, but that's a given here).  the hand cut noodle dish was interesting.  nice amount of heat and also nothing i've ever had before.  \n\noverall 4 stars.  the food is good and interesting.  pricey and the service wasn't great.  it's worth a stop if you're looking to try something different or to get a quick bite.", 
            "so, i agree with several of the 3 stars here and i am leaning on probably a 3.5 for here but, i can't quite put a 4 down. this has been on my list to  eat visit for awhile because of its odd asian/mexican fusion which does not seem to make sense. the place itself is like an acid trip with videos on the walls, stadium seating at bar, and bike wheels on ceiling. \nthe place is all small portion and sort of a tapas with large meal prices. \nmy meal\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> noodles $12- really good with great flavor, a great soba noodles and sauce.\nchilaquiles $13- which is basically tortilla chips, sour cream sauce, and a tomatillo type sauce. this is very close to a tradition version of this dish and it was good and rich.\n20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> $20- this was the best of them all, a great mix of veggies that i have eaten in such youthful form and great flavor.. however the size overall was probably 2 cups.\n\ndesert- mango rice $11- which was airy and very light with a cream rice flavor and cold mangos.\n\ndrinks-singapore sling- <mark>Traditional</mark> made and perfect! (where did these go america)\n\nsalt air margariita- crazy good with a salt flavored foam.\n\noverall a solid meal, however the bang for the buck is lacking. after tip this meal for 1 is over $90 and i can say i was not full in the end. so, the food is good but you are going to have to order 3 items per person to consider it a meal.",

            "i think china poblano is a very solid 3 stars, i gave it a fourth star because our second visit was on the busiest night in vegas...nye and we had no reservation. they accommodated us quickly, although it was at the outside tables but that's fine by me...more people to watch. \nour server was great, i have no complaints about the service. \nmy husband & i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> chips & salsa which were great, good seasoned chips, salsa was smokey and far from any pico de gallo. we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> 4 tacos...2 fish, 1 cochinita (bbq pork) and 1 carnitas. we've had the fish tacos before and they were delish...this time they were totally different. the fish wasn't very battered, and the salsa was way different. definitely not as good this time around but still very decent. the other tacos were full of flavor but very small! we both said we could eat 4 more! so after the chips & salsa & 2 tacos each we were still hungry so we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> dim sum. a 4 piece order of <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> and they were a knock out. very good. \nnow, a part of me wants to take a star off because of the high prices. this dinner was over $70 and i really couldn't justify paying more than $35-$40. you can't call this a full dinner. it was more like a lite bite before a concert type thing. \nthe kicker was the 2 cokes my husband or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> during dinner. they came in glass bottles and are imported from mexico. i've seen them at my local grocery store...they sell them 10 for $10. for all of you yelpers that are not math geniuses, that's $1 ea. china poblano charges $5.88 each!! holy coca cola! $12 on two cokes?! that's a little unreal. in a separate visit we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>--as featured on one of those television food shows--and it was good not amazing. this is not a place i need to return to. but it's also not a place i would stay away from. although, i might smuggle in my own mexican coca cola next time.", 
            "my work group of 5 had a reservation for a friday afternoon and there was no wait time. i love the color scheme and the fact that everyone spoke to us as we walked in. i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> chilaquiles, which had an authentic taste and just the right heat. two of my co-workers or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the infamous <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>. i was a little hesitant because i am not a big fan of <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, but it was amazing! very distinct flavors. \n\na major advantage to this restaurant is the vegetarian options. the only disadvantage, which has nothing to do with the food is the seating options. although most people are in vegas on vacation and wearing casual to club wear, it was a little difficult to get in and out of the bench style seating in a *work appropriate* length dress :(.\n\non a positive note, our waiter josue' was very attentive to our needs and made excellent recommendations.", 
            "china poblano is a bright, fun, casual restaurant. seriously, it is a carpeted wall away from being an ecstasy-lover's dream. chinese and mexican small plates is the name of the game here. they have a healthy list of tacos. being a self-appointed taco aficionado, this was a welcomed sight. unfortunately, the two i tried (<mark>Viva China</mark> & carnitas) missed a mark a bit, but were still solid. however, when you are dropping five bucks on a taco, you are looking for a bulls-eye. the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>, on the other hand, was dynamite. i am not a huge ceviche fan, but the server recommended it, so we gave it a whirl. marcus was dead-on with this suggestion. we also tried the 20 vegatable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, which was alright. overall, the dishes were interesting and varied in tastiness. the food was quality and intriguing enough to warrant another visit sometime in the future.", 
            "not crazy about the seating arrangements.  it is the unfortunate long wall bench seat with several small tables in front and small ottoman types seats on the opposite side of the table.  the decor is nice to look at the wall is covered kabuki masks and oaxaca animals.  we started with a taco each my friend had the pollo con mole poblano and i had the <mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>.  we both like them very much.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> to share.  it was smoking and very well executed. we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> which sounds either odd or no big deal.  it was my favorite dish i would go back just to order that.  my friend said he would go back just to have the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> again.  now for the drinks, we both or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Margarita Bandera Flight</mark> which had three minis consisting of the salt air, a pomegranate salt air, and the blood orange chili.  i like the blood orange chili the best since it has the balance with citrus  and heat.  the salt air is basically a salt foam on top.  which makes the drink too salty.  but the pomegranate version is very good.  i would recommend giving it try especially since the dishes are served family styled and meant to be shared.", 
            "avoid this restaurant at all costs - because that is all it will do cost.  we went with a group of eight and the bill was insane for insanely small portions.  i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> with chicken.  the vegetables must have been diced to a miniscule size, because i couldn't find all those vegetables  and at $34 with tax and tip - not worth it.  the tacos are also so small- 2 bites.  our friends or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> dessert and i laughed out loud when the waiter put it down.  it was a tablespoon sized portion.  the total bill came to about $400 and we were still hungry.  i've had amazing meals at commes ca and milos both at the cosmopolitan.  this restaurant was embarrassingly expensive and of inferior quality and can't even be discussed in the same breath.  oh by the way everyone at our table had no problem spending a lot on a good mean, which we did the following night at milos.  we just don't like being robbed for a shit meal.", 
            "i liked the atmosphere but there aren't many vegetarian options, other than the 20 ingredient <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>.  i was informed by our server that the bean and cheese taco isn't veg friendly as it is cooked in lard. bummer!  \n\ni know the airy margarita came highly recommended, however it tasted like <mark>Swallow a Cloud</mark> of salt and made me extremely thirsty.  seriously, after a few sips, i could not drink enough water to get rid of the \"thirsty\" feeling.  don't say i didn't warn you.", 
            "if you want to pay way to much for mediocre food and small portions then this place is your nirvana!\n\nthe $15 guacamole should have been a tip-off ... the waiter swore it was that good...so we gave it a try.  i'd say at best it might be slightly above average.  unless its amazingly hard to truck an avacado into las vegas though, at $15 for an avacado, some lime, and a tomato they are making a killing on this dish.\n\nnext up, salt and pepper tofu. this dish is best described as bland and unsatisfying. i love me some good tofu - but good this was not. basically it was 4 pieces of tofu doused in corn starch and fried. seasoned with some salt and pepper. there was a small chile garnish, but it was pretty bland and didn't give the tofu any flavor.  $12.88 for that gem of a dish. disapointing.\n\nthe waiter raved about the famous <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, featured on food network, yada yada. i was really looking forward to it... it was ok. i appreciated that the vegetables were nicely, uniformly diced up for texture, but man it was heavy. very greasy dish.  again for $20 i expected something a bit more sophisticated. \n\nmy wife had gan pung ji chicken, which to her was a big bunch of averageness for $23.00. \n\nanother annoying thing about this place is they bring your food out at random times. that meant my wife was done with her entree before i was even served mine. the waiter explained this was just how their restraurant worked. what?! why? it makes no sense. what kind of restraurant thinks that is normal?\n\ndefinitely would under no cirumstances eat here again. there are a lot of other choices in vegas that provide much better food and much better service at a much better price. \n\nto summarize, if you are in vegas and want to throw away some money. you can either hit the tables or hit china pablano. the tables are a lot more fun and at least there is a chance you may come out ahead. at china pablano however you are gauranteed to be a loser.", 
            "great food and service. they're clearly branding themselves as not being a fusion restaurant, but a restaurant that serves mexican and chinese dishes, of which the flavors compliment each other. it's not your typical sit down restaurant and that's fine with me. we had duck tongue tacos, carnitas tacos, <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, dan dan noodles, and some pork pot stickers. the pot stickers were very juicy inside and crispy outside, but the flavor was nothing special. everything else was exceptional. also ask for the hot sauce. it was a nice touch.", 
            "my beef isn't so much the  actual taste of the food it's more like the portion and cost.  i know, i know after all this is las vegas so everything is priced three times what it usually should cost. it is completely beyond me how people can charge this much for food. during this particular visit i arrived with seven other guests three of which were menly men (like these boys could eat). one of them even asked which is your largest meal and the waiter responded with twenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>. judging by it's miniture size i doubt it actually had twenty vegetables it was probably named that cause it cost close to twenty dollars! \n\nnext up is the <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> it is braised red pork in a chinese flat bread. it was tasty but a bit on the salty side and was almost half the size of my iphone! \n\nthen my hunny and i split the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> per the waiter's recommendation. it was packed full or flavor and mouthwatering good. it was $16 for eight pieces.\n\nagain my complaint isn't towards the taste or quality of the food mainly the portions. the service was good we were seated within 10 minutes for a party of eight while other places had hour long wait times. the restaurant decor and arrangement was very chic and trendy. but after loosing my butt in the casino i doubt i'd be able to pay for a substantial lunch here!", 
            "although they provide great service, i have always thought this place is overrated. i tried it a second time a couple of weeks ago to give it another chance. my first experience with their food left me questioning how they can get away with these outrageously high prices and the food being just average. \n\nthis time around we opted out of ordering tacos as i get way better tacos at tacos el gordo for half the price. i was craving soup so we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> posole as a starter as well as chips & salsa, chicken flautas, 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, and dan dan noodles. the posole was salty and the soup thick. i had to ask for more lime to offset the saltiness. the vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> is good but not at $19. \n\ni don't think i can see myself coming back unless there is nothing else available if i'm staying at the cosmopolitan.",

            "our waiter informed us that this restaurant was more collaboration than fusion. at first this was confusing but after many small, delicious plates emerged from the kitchen, i understood. i love chinese and mexican food and this place brought out some great flavors from both nations. pot stickers, dumplings, an awesome <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> dish and a very tender mongolian beef were complimented by tacos, guacamole..you get the idea. the hostesses graciously seated us right away on a packed night and the view from the casino/patio was outstanding. not outrageously expensive either like most casino restaurants so overall a great choice in the cosmo.",

            "odd. strange. weird. abnormal. disorientingly bonkers. that is how i would describe this jose andres' concocted \"fusion\" restaurant menu-melding both mexican and chinese fare.\n\nthere's actually two sides to the menu, mexican and chinese. this is not a fusion restaurant in the sense that the dishes are an amalgamation of both cultures and flavors, this is actually two cuisines co-existing on the same restaurant menu.\n\nwe came here for a dinner, pre-clubbing in vegas. the location at cosmopolitan is nice, easy to access (2nd floor pavilion near marquee night club). we had a big party of 10 and made a reservation, were seated within 15 minutes of our arrival. we had a few energetic waiters/servers and they explained the concept and threw out suggestions.  we all deiced to order and share...so people began ordering...mexican tacos, guacamole, <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>, empanadas...and chinese pot stickers, 20-veggie <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> (my choice), cold noodles, etc.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a lot of food. i think i tried everything, and you know what...nothing stood out...nothing was \"oh my god good\" and it was surprisingly bland, surprisingly meh, and surprisingly not all that filling. it just didn't do it for me.\n\nweird concept, bland food, confused and concerned taste buds and tummy, huge bill (like $600 huge), and we all didn't feel like we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> and ate $600 worth of food and drink.  it was suffice to say...a miss...and we should have gone to some other concept place like mesa grill, etc if we had really thought of it...only nice thing was proximity to our first club of the night...this was not what i have heard and experienced from jose andres' and we all left very disappointed.", 
            "interesting concept - mexican chinese fusion. some of the dishes come out better than others. love the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> with black garlic and the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>. the clams with buckwheat noodles were way too salty and heavy on the sauce. the dishes are a bit pricey - but not dull. a good selection of cocktails but no draft beer.",

            "i lived in dc for a while, so i am a frequent visitor to jose andres' restaurants and an avid fan.  i was really excited to try his new restaurant in vegas, and it did not disappoint!  i came here with a group of 4 people, and we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> 11 dishes i believe + 2 desserts.  they have a few chefs working at the front of the restaurant so people walking by can watch them make handmade tortillas and hand pulled noodles.  they also have two take out windows with a smaller menu that you can order from.  the decor is modern with chinese and mexican elements and made me think of something i would see in an urban outfitters catalog or on display at the moma.\n\nthe guacamole and hand made tortillas were to die for!  i could have just eaten guacamole for dinner.  and they have the best tortillas i've ever had.  my favorite presentation was the scallop ceviche, which they place on a carmelized key lime.  they lightly spray vodka on it, you eat the scallop, and then squeeze the lime into your mouth.  almost like taking a tequila shot.  i also thought the hand pulled noodles were amazing and cooked to perfection.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the unruly monk soup, and it was very light and refreshing, but at the same time, full of vegetables.  i would probably come here for lunch and order just that and maybe a small side dish.  we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> another soup, <mark>Caldo Tlalpeno</mark>, which i thought was more fusion, and i also enjoyed that soup as well.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the nice, but naughty dish with lotus root and pea shoots which doesn't taste very chinese because the pea shoots were somewhat raw but i enjoyed it nonetheless.  i also enjoyed the <mark>Chicken Ji Song</mark> and liked the presentation of it, especially with the fried sweet potato on top.  we tried a bunch of different tacos, and i think flavorwise, i liked the beef tendon and it was melt in your mouth tender, but also the greasiest taco out of all of them.  we didn't end up order any dim sum because i knew i could probably eat tastier (and cheaper) dim sum in chinatown.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the flan and the happy buddha giggling taking a bath.  the flan is deliciously creamy and easily one of the best flans i've ever had.  the happy buddha is really cute and he really is taking a bath!  it's one of the most entertaining desserts i've ever had.  it isn't your normal jello.  they make it from scratch with fresh strawberries and use seaweed extract instead of gelatin, and it has a very smooth flavor.  it's very refreshing at the end of a huge meal.\n\nthe dishes aren't that expensive but they do add up very quickly, and we ended up spending more than i wanted to, but it was definitely a fun and enjoyable experience, not to mention yummy!", 
            "i am not a big chinese food person, but i pretty much loved everything i tried here. for the life of me i could not tell you what half of the things were called, but i do remember that the best thing i had was\n<mark>Chicken Ji Song</mark> , which was chicken in a sweet sauce of some kind on a lettuce cup topped with shredded sweet potato. it was amazing. i would have never thought to try a place that entailed chinese and mexican foods, but i am glad i was invited to try it. \n\nthe service was great as well and the drinks were really good. one of the most creative ideas i have seen in awhile is the straws were wrapped in a green onion shoots.", 
            "another small plates casual restaurant by chef jose andres at the cosmopolitan of las vegas. we were so hungry, we only saw this restaurant open for lunch a bit earlier. it's chinese and mexican small plates. \n\na solid 2.5 star, one goes to the service, one goes to the tsingtao beer (chinese beer) they serve, and a very authentic chinese hot sauce they serve, half star goes to the decor. \n\ntotal lunch bill for 2 , 1 beer: $70, ( really a lot for the tiny portions)\n\na brunch menu and regular menu, we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> something from both menus.\n\nchinese noodle soup with eggs, pork and veggies., it's one of the bigger portion choices on the menu, it was meant for sharing, it tasted very very bad, we didn't know what kind of food was that.... definitely not chinese! \n\ntraditional shumai: 6 tiny pieces with some gold stuffs on top of each one. they looked fancy but tasted disgusting.....i think they dipped all of those in soy sauce and dried them up....extremely salty....\n\n<mark>Chicken Ji Song</mark>: 4 tiny chicken lettuce wraps with fried potatoes on the top, they were ok \n\nmexican grilled chicken taco: i don't think i have ever had a taco that tasted so bad, most disgusting flavor ever! they put some sort of salty chinese sauce or paste with green onions on top, those things just don't mix! think chef confused it with a traditional chinese wrap dish. \n\nif we weren't super hungry, i don't think we could have had even swallowed the food, they were soooo bad! honestly it's a shame to a celebrity chef, jose should've just sticked to spanish tapas, forget about chinese and mexican food! i think this 2 kinds of food are the more original the better, don't play with them.....\n\nworst food we'v ever had, but the service was great! our waitress was super attentive and friendly. the decor is so cute, very trendy, the pictures on the wall change every few minutes, it was fun to look at them. \n\ni am pretty sure we weren't the only ones who hated the food. saw some ppl sat down n looked at the menu for 5 minutes and left! smart.... just saying..... will never go back !!!",

            "we were running late on a concert night at the cosmo and it was a rare show where we actually cared about the opening act, so time was of the essence.   while doing a yelp search from the elevator we decided upon china poblano as:\n\n1) \"tacos sound kinda good right now\"\n2) \"it's jose andres!   that dude's been on bourdain and top chef so he's legit\"\nand\n3) \"it gets 3 stars on yelp!  that means it's gotta be....   wait, 3 stars?!?\"  \n\nso we went anyway even though a straight up 3 is typically below my snooty yelp threshold of place to visit.   i'm glad we did.    we started by looking at some signature cocktails presented to us that arent on the main menu.   i wanted the aviation which has been one of my go-to drinks lately, and my lady friend wanted something i don't remember the name of, but it was something that didnt sound very \"manly\" like \"the snow willow\"   or \"the kitten's purr\"   it had cucumber as a main fixture and didn't sound appealing at all to me.    naturally my friend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> my drink for me and forced me to order the other one.   i tried both and all i'll say is, the aviation was delicious! quick wait service update:  after we put in the drink order, our waiter disappeared for what i felt was a long time.   we sat without drinks and without placing our order for i'd say a good 12 minutes.   we were definitely looking left and right for a trace of him as if we were trying to jaywalk across a busy intersection.   \n\nso given that we had a bit of a break, i went to yelp to try to find some recommendations.   i went with 4 tacos (they're small and i'm big).   and my dining companion went with <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark>.    as long as we had to wait to get our drinks and orders in, the wait for the food was exceptionally as short.   it seemed like only 5 minutes had passed before a few of my tacos from my order arrived, and only a few minutes after that the <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark> showed up.   \n\nfor my 2nd list of the review, here are all 4 tacos i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> and ate\n\n1)  lengua (beef tongue) -  delicious as beef tongue usually is.   melt in your mouth, well seasoned.  \n2)  <mark>Viva China</mark> (beef tendon/oysters) - disappointed in this one as the reviews seemed highly favorable.   i must admit i'm not a huge oyster fan, but to me the flavors of the oysters and the tendon just didn't co-mingle well.   \n3) carnitas - my favorite.   the pork was tender and delicious and i loved the contrast the crunch and flavor of the pork rinds provided.\n4) i cant find the 4th one i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> on the menu.   either that or i had too much of that cucumber drink and lost my mind accordingly.   it was some sort of beef short rib with some sort of chile i thought.   it was tasty and the chile brought a lot of smoky flavor to it.   it didn't really offer up anything unique enough for me to want to order it again though\n\noverall i was very happy with my meal of tacos as a whole.   the tortillas are made to order and taste fantastic.   we actually or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> some on the side to go with the <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark>.  as for that dish i thought i was a bit underwhelming.   the beef was flavorful and it tastes exactly how its described in the menu with the ginger/soy/vinegar components, but there just wasn't any extra oomph to justify spending nearly $20 on it.   the tacos, albeit small, are well worth the $5.50 a piece they generally command.   i like the idea that you could just come in here, grab a drink and a few tacos and be in and out in a reasonable time (if your waiter doesnt take an extended break like ours seemed to) for about $20, or go all out and share a bunch of dishes for an extravagant (and expensive) meal.   not many places, especially at the cosmo, give you that option.",

            "after looking at other reviews i was skeptic of how this place would be, but gave it a try based on the menu. i'm glad i went despite others bad experiences because this was fantastic. we had the 18 noodle and the <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark>, both incredible. if you're looking to get full it's going to cost you a lot, but if you're looking to try a few things tapas style it's fantastic. i highly recommend it.",

            "i really enjoyed our dining experience here. if i could live on a diet of  just <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>, i would.  what a delightful concoction! we went for more of a mexican feast than chinese, so here is the breakdown.\n\nthe tacos: \n<mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark> (slow-cooked pork belly/ pineapple) - great play on flavors. the pork belly had good crispness to it and complemented the pineapple. \n\n<mark>Viva China</mark>* (soft beef tendon/ kumamoto oyster/scallions/ sichuan peppercorn sauce) - my husband's favorite. great fusion taco. the tendon was cooked just right. \n\nsilencio (duck tongue/ fresh lychee) - neither of us had tried duck tongue before, so we had to try it. fantastic! the sauce had a bit of spice to it that really made work. \n\n<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> (oaxacan-style barbeque beef/guajillo chile/ pickled cactus paddle) - the was a big taco filled with flavorful barbacoa and nopales. i'm not sure if it was worth the price, but it was tasty. \n\ncarnitas (braised baby pig/pork rinds/ spicy salsa verde cruda) - this was the favorite of the night. the carnitas were perfect, but the addition of the pork rinds really made this taco off the chain! we could have eaten 10 of these. \n\nthe rest:\nhuitlacoche noodles (wild mushrooms/ fresh mexican corn truffle/ knife-shaved noodles) - the huitlacoche actually worked well in this dish. i wasn't sure going in, but felt adventurous. the noodles were cooked perfectly. this is a dish that is big enough to share. this dish was surprisingly spicy, so beware. \n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> (melted chihuahua cheese/tequila blanco/fresh tortillas...with chorizo) - tasty! maybe a bit expensive. it reminded me of being with family in mexico and eating fresh tortillas off of the comal with cheese. \n\nmango sticky rice - the was actually a cream of sweet rice on top of mango shave ice topped with crispy rice (think rice krispies) and fresh mango. very refreshing! \n\nour server was attentive and the manager even came by the see if we were satisfied. overall, we had a pleasant dining experience.", 
            "went here close to a month ago and just getting around to posting a review. we've tried several other restaurants at the cosmo and have become fans of the resort and it's food offerings. <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark> started off not so great, with the hostess service a bit frenzied and disorganized. there was no one at the hostess area and a bunch of us milling by the entrance not sure what was going on. once seated, everything changed. the server was awesome...cheerful, knowledgeable and attentive. the service seemed a bit rushed at times. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> six different things and the time in between servings was sometimes not enough. i have no problem with the portions, which are on the small side and for the most part really aren't suitable for sharing unless you order a bunch of things.   i'm always about quality and not quantity, and the quality was excellent. these dishes, sauces, etc. aren't just slapped together. they are creative, complex and well executed. the prices for small plates is high, but again, cosmo on the strip, what do you expect.  now for the food: \n\n<mark>Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll</mark> - delicious, but nothing really set it apart from all the other good <mark>Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll</mark>. \n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - wheat noodles in a spicy pork sauce. omg. it's been a month and i still can't stop thinking about it. \n\n20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>. the price will blow you away, but have to say we really enjoyed it. the time and effort that goes into this dish is incredible and you can literally identify all 20 vegetables finely chopped in perfect proportions. \n\ncarnitas taco - awesome. the spicy verde cruda sauce...i asked for a side dish of it and almost drank it. \n\n<mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark>. had never tried pork belly, and the combination with pineapple was intriguing. good, but not my favorite. \n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> - outstanding, with a nice slightly burnt top to the cheese, perfect texture and great tortillas.\n\nthe beer was cold but could have been colder.\n\nwill definitely be back.",

            "while i'd never discourage someone from making their own discoveries our food experience was borderline horrible. \n\nthe cocktails (margaritas are topped with salted air which were refreshing and unique) and beers were spot on and the service polished and sharp. however the overpriced food was hit and miss. sui mai should be avoided (weird spongy texture and off tasting) as well as the weird tasting <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> and the ugly dancing eggplant. \n\nbright spots were the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> (awesome), unruly monk, guacamole, <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> and the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>. tacos are 2 bites and are $5.50 for one which i couldn't swallow the price tag so we skipped the tacos. bill was $240+ tip for 3 people. we left buzzed and full but we'd have a hard time going back except for drinks and maybe a few of the bright spots mentioned above.\n\nif you want killer dumplings and regional chinese food go to chinatown. for mexican food there are loads of more affordable and tastier options off strip.", 
            "a strange combination, but one that works. personally, i would say the chinese half of the menu outshines the mexican portion, but both are filled with many good choices that are more than enough to fill you up.\n\nfirst off, the specialty cocktails here are great, and should not be avoided it you can help it.  the highlights from each of the menus would have to be: '<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>' (char siu bao) from the chinese manu, and the carnitas tacos from the mexican menu.  the beef sui mai is also good, but i would avoid the traditional sui mai which is a bit bland.  the lamb potstickers, mongolian beef, and <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> are also great, along with <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> and <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> from the mexican side of the menu.\n\nlike it's neighbor holstein's, this place is definitely best for lunch, but you'll be perfectly happy having dinner here as well.\n\nchina poblano takes a very novel idea, and executes it well enough.  is it the best chinese or mexican food you'll find on the strip? no, but its very good, and when combined into one restaurant, you have a very unique place to eat that doesn't disappoint.", 
            "even i can't believe that i gave china poblano 4 stars but i did.  jose andres' perverse juxtaposition of mexican cuisine and chinese cuisine works.  who would have thought?\n\nlike many of jose andres' other restaurants, china poblano serves small plates.  thus it is possible to try many dishes in one sitting.  on my visit, i sampled, among other things, the steamed pork buns, the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>, the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>, cochinita taco, the barbacoa taco, and the lucky 8 sui mai beef.  \n\nthe <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>, and the cochinita taco were superb dishes that stood out above the rest.  the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> is wonderfully rich, as one would expect, and is accented well by the spicey chorizo.  the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> had a nice harmony of flavors between the garlic and the roasted poblano peppers.  and, the cochinita taco is everything you would hope a slow cooked pork taco would be.  \n\nwhile the three fore mentioned dishes deserve specific attention none of the dishes i tried were bad.  by mixing and matching between two very diverse cuisines, china poblano keeps things interesting and should have something that appeals to everyone's palate.", 
            "great concept, but it was poorly executed. i was really unimpressed, especially since the cosmopolitan houses so many amazing restaurants.\n\ni had dinner here with a party of 8. with the prices they had, i thought i'd be in for some amazing fusion cuisine...\n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> - $10 literally just melted, buttery cheese. i can't believe we paid 10 bucks for this!\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> w/ mole - $7 was interesting at first, but then no one wanted to finish it.\nsetas (wild mushroom guacamole tacos) - $4.50/taco i got two. i didn't even want to finish my 2nd one, so i gave it to my boyfriend.\ncochinita (yucatan-style bbq pork tacos) - $5.50/taco my friends said it was okay. nothing special.\n\nwe didn't feel satisfied after our meal.\nsmall portions. super overpriced. lousy flavors. avoid!", 
            "let's start with the good stuff about china poblano:\n\n- super cute and trendy decor, we had such a great time noticing the small details around us as we waited on food.  it almost feels like dining in an eclectic art gallery, fun.\n\n- the service was pretty solid, not rushed nor too pushy -- but very attentive with water glasses filled at all times, friendly rapport and helpful suggestions.\n\n- the drinks were interesting.  not strong or obsess about the cocktail menu until you return amazing, but definitely stood out above most of the rest of our vegas beverages.  in particular, the <mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark>  had a unique flavor (not as spicy as we'd like it, but that's not unusual as we're freaky about our spiciness) -- and the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> was an experience.\n\nbut now for the food....\n\nit was just 'meh'.  probably lower than meh... 'eh'?  \n\ni love fusion cuisine and small plate dining as much as the next food geek, but for the price and build up everything really fell short.  the chips and tortillas tasted store bought (or crappily made, if actually done in-house), the ceviche tasted borderline 'off', even the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> was barely mediocre (who knew you could mess that up).  \n\nfor the price and the buzz we heard, it was a total let down.  a great meal and a couple of nice dinner drinks are priceless in our household.  but this particular dinner for two set us back around $160 and was instantly regretted.  we stopped elsewhere to grab a (much tastier and filling) bite before heading back to the room for the night.  \n\nmy advice:  grab a drink and enjoy the vibe, then move on for dinner.", 
            "i like jose andres, chinese food and mexican food.  put them all together you'd get something spectacular, right?  well, at least that's i hoped for.\n\nthe service at china poblano was good.  i loved the interior.  images of mao, frida kahlo, the dalai lama, etc. projected on screen on the walls - nice touch.\n\ni had the <mark>Jasmine Downy Pearls</mark> tea and it was amazing.  it was fragrant and it tasted good.  it was a neat idea that they give you a timer so you get to enjoy the perfect tea whether you like it mild, medium or strong.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a bun of different things from the menu:\n\n<mark>Golden Pigs</mark>:\n4 fried bbq pork buns with a side of condensed milk.  dipping pork buns on condensed milk might seem pretty odd but it works.  sweet and savory just go well together.  5/5\n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>:\na braised pork sandwich.  the bread tastes just like biscuits but the filling's saaaalty. if you look at the menu, you'll see \"<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>\" in a box which will make you think that's their specialty.  honestly, i hated it. 1/5\n\ntacos (carnitas, langosta, <mark>Viva China</mark>, pescado frito):\nthe carnitas came with pork rinds on top but the pork in the taco was dripping in oil.  just let the oil drip off your taco and you're all set. great taco variety. 4/5\n\n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>:\n4 steamed bbq pork buns. yep, that's all i can say about that.  nothing special. 3/5\n\nlucky six siu mai:\n2 scallop siu mai, 2 beef siu mai and 2 traditional siu mai topped with itty bitty pieces of gold leaf. 3/5\n\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with mole:\ni wanted fries with my sandwich.  i had to pick between mole and <mark>XO Sauce</mark>.  fries + <mark>XO Sauce</mark> just doesn't seem appetizing so i went with mole.  the mole was overpowering.  there was a scant amount of mexican cream and queso fresco.  i can usually finish an order of fries but not this one. 2/5\n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> with chorizo:\nagain, nothing special. 3/5\n\nmango sticky rice:\nthis was the best thing on the menu.  instead of using sticky rice, they used puffed rice so you get that nice crunch with a nice creamy coconut sauce and semi-sweet mangoes. 5/5\n\nchocolate terra cotta warriors:\nthe name \"warriors\" is misleading because you only get one warrior made of chocolate filled with chocolate mousse on top of cookie crumbs and ginger ice cream.  it looks like something just died on my plate complete with dirt and flowers.  the presentation was just too funny but this chocoholic wasn't 100% pleased with the taste but the creativity was there. 4/5\n\ncajeta flan:\na flan made with goat's milk served with salted caramel ice cream and pineapple chunks.  the flan was mild and the salted caramel ice cream was just lovely. 4/5\n\nso why 3 stars?  for the amount and type of food you get vs. the price, not worth it.  it's like they grabbed the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> from viva zapatas, steamed bbq pork buns and siu mai from spring mountain, fish tacos from rubio's for like $3 each and decided to serve it to you for double or triple the price.  part of what makes chinese and mexican food great is that they're inexpensive.", 
            "i was a little unsure of this place and the chinese/mexican fusion combo made me ask why???.  when i visted their website and saw that it is a chef jose andreas establishment i figured it must be amazing so i said what the hell and made a reservation. i am a mexican food lover so i stuck with things on the miexican portion of the menu, a few different tacos(barbacoa and carnitas) both of which were amazing, the beef just melts in your mouth it is so tender. i also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> some <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> and some <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> to share with the table.  one of the people in my party went the chinese route and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, i tried a few bites and it was amazing, and could be a meal in itself. i will go back and next time i will order the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> for myself. \n\nprices were actually low in my opinion, not cheap but i would have paid more for the quality of food.  rreat value for the quality of food and location inside of the cosmopolitan. all in all i would recommend china poblano to anyone visiting vegas.", 
            "so i will never get a chance to eat at elbulli and i have to live with that. china poblano was awesome. yes, it is very pricey for the portions you get. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> (yum), dancing eggplant (beautiful presentation, so tangy and lively though they kind of went overboard on the bonito flakes), 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> (delicious) and <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> noodles (this was absolutely outstanding; spicy pork and peanut sauce, fresh delectable noodles). \n\nwe had water to drink and our bill for the two of us was $55, but we left full.\n\nthe service is okay. not overly friendly and two waiters stood by our table and talked about how hard they work and what money they made through almost the entire meal.", 
            "on our recent trip to vegas i researched different restaurants to try - turns out that dos caminos and isla have closed. we knew we'd be in the cosmo for the secret pizza (that's another review) and i wanted to try china poblano after reading the menu on the cosmo website. what i didn't do is check the yelp! reviews, and i'm glad i didn't. what we experienced was so far different from most reviews that i've just read!\nok look - when you're on vacation, you tend to spend money. $15 drinks are the going price at upscale hotels. and the \"<mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>\" (i just had to try one) was worth every cent!  i have no idea how they do it - the salt cloud that floats on the surface of the drink stays there as you drink, so with every sip you get a piece of salt heaven. \nthe wait staff were friendly and efficient. the manager, i\\u00f1igo, even stopped by to chat with k'ayum (age 8) and watched him do his latest magic trick.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> with chorizo. it came with fresh-made tortillas and was excellent. adriana got a carnitas taco and she was thrilled with the chicharr\\u00f3n topping. i had a fish taco which was fantastic, and k'ayum had some noodles which he devoured (and he's a picky eater!). \nthe drinks were what really got me excited. after the \"<mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>\" i had another specialty called a \"mexican gin and tonic.\" it's made with cilantro, elderflower liqueur, and i don't know what else, but it worked. for dessert i had a tequila flight that came with house-made sangrita that was sublime!  i wish i had a bottle of their sangrita for sipping tequila here at home!\nanyway, it's a week later and we're still talking about our experience. we loved the decor, the ambiance, the service, the food, and the drinks. we'll be back!", 
            "we were seated pretty quickly as a table for 7 at 7pm without having a reservation by two very hospitable staff. after 4 days in vegas, the first positive vibe i picked up on was that the front of house staff were very humble, gracious and genuine - a welcome change to the a few of the other restaurants we ate at. \n\ndespite the warm welcome, we were left sitting without a visit from a server for at least 10 minutes. and at most restaurants, this would be fine if not just slightly annoying. but here's why it was a much bigger problem at china poblano: the menu and how/what you should order isn't easily decipherable without a bit of guidance (or having been there before). \n\ni'd suggest to the managers of cp to have the staff who seats you stick around for an extra :15 and give a one or two line spiel on how the menu is divided, portion sizes, what's shareable/not shareable, and recommended quantity of order per person. we all started to confuse each other and actually started to discuss leaving to go to somewhere that was a bit easier on our we're-in-vacation-mode brains. \n\nour server came by just in time before we left and explained how it all worked, but then left and proceeded to give us another 10 minutes to ponder our life as well as our food order. he didn't take a drink order. so in the end, we sat for 20 minutes before we even get a drink order in. it's almost impossible to sit anywhere in vegas for that long without being offered a drink. \n\norders go in and the food starts rolling out pretty much immediately. highlights for me were:\n\n- <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>\n- lucky 6 siu mai\n- gan pung ji chicken (table fave)\n- carnitas taco\n- chipotle salsa\n\nlowlights:\n\n- <mark>Viva China</mark> taco\n- lamb pot stickers \n- guacamole (tasty enough, but poor value)\n\nthere were a few mix-ups with the service - some people didn't get their tacos till the rest of the table was pretty much done their food. i chalked that up to the shared-plates approach, but a bit more attention could have easily saved one upset and ignored diner. we were also missing a side of the \"monk chilli sauce\" which was or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> because we were - and still are - very curious as to wtf it would actually be. \n\nloved the decor of the restaurant and felt that the music was very well selected. not really sure about the choice to project a picture of frida kahlo up at the same time as chairman mao. when you take into account his political decisions were responsible for like 40-70 million unnecessary deaths,...  maybe it's art or irony, i dunno. it certainly sparked a conversation at the table where we concluded that the designer was probably more into the superficiality of the icon of mao, like che, rather than the politics and the fact that he's pretty much one of the greatest modern mass mur<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>. and we're looking at him while eating. in las vegas. ok, maybe it is irony. unintentional irony? moving along...\n\ntl;dr version: interesting spot, food was generally tasty, i found it priced pretty reasonably with a few exceptions. the menu could use a bit more explanation - ideally, immediately upon arrival - and the table service could be a bit tighter and attentive. \n\ni also think this menu would benefit from being slimmed down by a few items, and then perhaps divided by portion size.", 
            "we returned to this restaurant during our december 2013 visit.  we were not disappointed.  \n\nwe shared <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, <mark>Beijing Glass</mark>, <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>, happy family, mongolioan <mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark> and pato pasilla.  each dish was wonderful.\n\nthe waiter convinced the two birthday girls at the table to get the mango rice dessert.  it was amazing.  puffed rice, mango, whipped topping and other delights.  not a disappointed diner amongst us.", 
            "my friend talked up chef jose andres so much on a (sorta) recent trip to dc that the name stuck, and after seeing it tagged to china poblano at the cosmopolitan, i figured it was destiny calling and just had to try it. \n\ni'm not really of the belief that culinary experiences, however life-changing they may be, should break the bank and i'll just tell you now that for two people, drinks, four small plates and dessert, came in at about a couple dollars over 100--but make an exception for this place because it was pretty effing good. \n\njust know what to order. \n\nthe 18 <mark>18 Monk Noodle</mark> was so amazing. you don't even realize the noodles are whole wheat, because they're just so good with the sauce and the shitakes. our waiter suggested we opt for the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> as opposed to the ceviche pargo and i could've, no wait--should've hugged him for it. the tuna was so fresh. the soy it was bathed in and amaranth seeds that topped it really enhanced the fish in a way that is pretty indescribable. \n\nwe also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, and the xo scallops in <mark>XO Sauce</mark>. i wouldn't recommend either because you didn't really come here for melted cheese and i don't want you to pay $18.88 for two golf-sized scallops, respectively. that was our mistake--but don't make it yours! a side note, they were both good, but not great and your hard earned dollars deserve great, okay?\n\nafter dollar signs kept racing through my head as i tried to figure out the damage, i wasn't really up to pay another double-digit figure for dessert, but the lady next to us devoured her mango sticky rice in a matter of minutes, so we thought, we'd come this far. #yolo \n\nanyways, it was so incredibly good! it's not your traditional thai-place-msr by any means. it's so light and airy and everything in it just works so well that as i write this all i really want to do is drive down to the cosmopolitan in my jammies and order it. \n\nas far as the service, and given it was a tuesday night, we got seated right away. our waiter, miller, was awesome! he didn't shy away from putting his two-cents when he knew we were making potentially catastrophic mistakes trying to decide what to eat and god bless him for it.", 
            "my only regret about china poblano is that i didn't go sooner. i've lived in vegas for a few years and finally made it here on national margarita day. i had their signature salt \"air\" margarita. it's not really air, but salty foam that floats on top of your drink. not only is it super cool and inventive, but it gives you a hint of salt in every sip. delicious!\n\neven though jose andres, the spanish chef behind china poblano, is world renowned, i was curious to see how he'd do mexican food. i grew up eating mexican food and am very picky. all my cynicism was gone as soon as i read the menu. the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, a melted cheese appetizer served by nearly every mexican restaurant, is made with queso menonita. most of you have probably never heard about it, but that's what <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> is supposed to be made with (not monterey cheese most restaurant use.) to know chef andres has it imported from mexico is really special. \n\nall the food we tried was great, especially the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>. the one thing we had that was kind of blah were the tacos. that's why i'm not giving it five stars. you can find way better tacos in nearly every taco shop at a fraction of the price. even the $10 lobster taco ($10 for one, little taco) was just okay. nevertheless, i can't wait to go back again for margaritas and queso!", 
            "wow! i can't get enough of this place. i went two days in a row during my last vegas trip. \n\nwe were a group of 4 so we had a chance to try a lot of dishes- everyone was top notch. i recommend the chilaquiles, <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> and the wonton soup. \n\nnote: the prices are high relative to the portions but i can live with that since it's vegas baby.", 
            "china poblano was the first restaurant i ate at after arriving in las vegas, nv. we couldn't find secret pizza at the time, so we decided to eat here. the hostess kindly seated us immediately. the menu has a variety of items. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> <mark>Fried Wonton</mark>, <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, and <mark>Chicken Ji Song</mark> (lettuce wraps). the <mark>Chicken Ji Song</mark> was my favorite dish. china poblano lettuce wraps was fresh and the ingredients blended well together. the <mark>Fried Wonton</mark> and <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> was average at best in my opinion. i chose mango sticky rice for dessert. china poblano sticky rice was innovative compared to other restaurants i've visited. the unique spin on the mango sticky rice was cool literally (served cold). i enjoyed every bite of my mango sticky rice. the sticky rice is perfect for a hot las vegas day. our server wasn't very attentive (restaurant was not busy). we had to flag her down for refills constantly. the ambience at china poblano is awesome. it's a good place for drinks and enjoying the cosmopolitan eye candy. i personally expected more from some of the dishes but they didn't hit the spot for me. the presentation of meals deserves two thumbs up! i give china poblano a 2.5 rating.", 
            "this place is mexican/chinese....hence the name. it was my first time there and i really liked the atmosphere. it's very casual considering the location. it's an upscale place but at the same time you can go in with shorts/shirts. the services was great.  we had the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> and had the <mark>Fried Wonton</mark> and they were great!! their tortillas are hand-made!! i think the prices are reasonable. even though i can only judge on the appetizers, i think this place is worth it.",

            "i like jose andres, chinese food and mexican food.  put them all together you'd get something spectacular, right?  well, at least that's i hoped for.\n\nthe service at china poblano was good.  i loved the interior.  images of mao, frida kahlo, the dalai lama, etc. projected on screen on the walls - nice touch.\n\ni had the <mark>Jasmine Downy Pearls</mark> tea and it was amazing.  it was fragrant and it tasted good.  it was a neat idea that they give you a timer so you get to enjoy the perfect tea whether you like it mild, medium or strong.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a bun of different things from the menu:\n\n<mark>Golden Pigs</mark>:\n4 fried bbq pork buns with a side of condensed milk.  dipping pork buns on condensed milk might seem pretty odd but it works.  sweet and savory just go well together.  5/5\n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>:\na braised pork sandwich.  the bread tastes just like biscuits but the filling's saaaalty. if you look at the menu, you'll see \"<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>\" in a box which will make you think that's their specialty.  honestly, i hated it. 1/5\n\ntacos (carnitas, langosta, <mark>Viva China</mark>, pescado frito):\nthe carnitas came with pork rinds on top but the pork in the taco was dripping in oil.  just let the oil drip off your taco and you're all set. great taco variety. 4/5\n\n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>:\n4 steamed bbq pork buns. yep, that's all i can say about that.  nothing special. 3/5\n\nlucky six siu mai:\n2 scallop siu mai, 2 beef siu mai and 2 traditional siu mai topped with itty bitty pieces of gold leaf. 3/5\n\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with mole:\ni wanted fries with my sandwich.  i had to pick between mole and <mark>XO Sauce</mark>.  fries + <mark>XO Sauce</mark> just doesn't seem appetizing so i went with mole.  the mole was overpowering.  there was a scant amount of mexican cream and queso fresco.  i can usually finish an order of fries but not this one. 2/5\n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> with chorizo:\nagain, nothing special. 3/5\n\nmango sticky rice:\nthis was the best thing on the menu.  instead of using sticky rice, they used puffed rice so you get that nice crunch with a nice creamy coconut sauce and semi-sweet mangoes. 5/5\n\nchocolate terra cotta warriors:\nthe name \"warriors\" is misleading because you only get one warrior made of chocolate filled with chocolate mousse on top of cookie crumbs and ginger ice cream.  it looks like something just died on my plate complete with dirt and flowers.  the presentation was just too funny but this chocoholic wasn't 100% pleased with the taste but the creativity was there. 4/5\n\ncajeta flan:\na flan made with goat's milk served with salted caramel ice cream and pineapple chunks.  the flan was mild and the salted caramel ice cream was just lovely. 4/5\n\nso why 3 stars?  for the amount and type of food you get vs. the price, not worth it.  it's like they grabbed the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> from viva zapatas, steamed bbq pork buns and siu mai from spring mountain, fish tacos from rubio's for like $3 each and decided to serve it to you for double or triple the price.  part of what makes chinese and mexican food great is that they're inexpensive.", 
            "i was a little unsure of this place and the chinese/mexican fusion combo made me ask why???.  when i visted their website and saw that it is a chef jose andreas establishment i figured it must be amazing so i said what the hell and made a reservation. i am a mexican food lover so i stuck with things on the miexican portion of the menu, a few different tacos(barbacoa and carnitas) both of which were amazing, the beef just melts in your mouth it is so tender. i also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> some <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> and some <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> to share with the table.  one of the people in my party went the chinese route and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, i tried a few bites and it was amazing, and could be a meal in itself. i will go back and next time i will order the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> for myself. \n\nprices were actually low in my opinion, not cheap but i would have paid more for the quality of food.  rreat value for the quality of food and location inside of the cosmopolitan. all in all i would recommend china poblano to anyone visiting vegas.", 
            "i think this will most likely be a letdown for most people. given the breadth of variety and quality of dining options in vegas, i would skip it. if you are a jose andres faithful and you just absolutely must, get the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>. \n\nfirst of all, the outside seating is not fun. you're basically sitting on glorified wooden crates and when we got up to leave everyone's rear was a little sore. this makes me sound like such a pansy. not a dealbreaker on it's own, but just a note. also, as others have mentioned, this restaurant is not a fusion restaurant. not a big deal if you don't expect it, but just know that there's definitely no culinary cultural mash up to be had here. \n\nanyway, i went with two friends and we were pretty hungry and pretty comprehensive in our order. we got an item from each section of the menu except for soups and salads, because that's what the real pansies order. here's what we got and what i thought.   \n\ntacos: <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> - i mean it's decent, but it's not what we were expecting. not anything special at all. also, teeny tiny. very little chorizo. i know the chorizo is calling your name but don't do it. you end up with a $5 mouthful of regret. pass. \n\ndim sum: <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> - ugh. i didn't plan on this review being such a downer, but if i'm being honest, this is another pass. this tasted fine, but it was a steamed pork bun! for $14! we love steamed pork buns so we went for it, but expected some tender fall off the bone flavorful magic for this price. but like, it was totally standard and not special at all. pass.  \n\nnoodles: <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - this was pretty good. i'm a fan and if i came back i would get this again. it had a nice kick to it and the noodles had a nice al dente texture. i need to note that even though this is the one thing i will vouch for, it was a little on the salty side. but i'd do it again. play. \n\nfrom china: twenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> - i am a sucker for any sort of endorsement ever. the waiter says travel channel liked it? yes, ok, yes please. and then out comes this extra small portion of <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> that is so not worth $20 and then you feel like, maybe the waiter played you like a fiddle. pass.\n\nfrom mexico: <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> - i really didn't like this at all but to be fair i'm in the .001% of the nations's population that doesn't particularly care for fries. also i never really like mole sauce because it feels misleading. you can't bill yourself as a chocolate sauce and not taste anything like chocolate. and sometimes i forget it doesn't taste chocolatey at all and i try it again and it's like ugh fleeced again. but that's neither here nor there. pass.\n\nin hindsight, this really makes it sound like i hated it. which i totally didn't, i was just very underwhelmed. as i'm originally from the dc area, i've tried several of jose andres' restaurants and have always been absolutely obsessed with all his creations. so maybe i've set the bar high because i've had such good things from his places before, or maybe i'm just extra judgey because i grew up eating both these cuisines so i've had much better at cheaper prices before? dunno. either way, despite being very hungry, all of us were just kind of like, meh, this is so not on par with his other restaurants. again, nothing is terrible, it's just not very good. i think it just isn't worth the prices when there are so many more incredible options just a few steps away down the strip.", 
            "wow. why all the bad reviews? i eat here every time i go to vegas! china poblano is pricey, but i definitely think it's worth it. the service is pretty slow, but the restaurant is usually packed and the servers are nice. i always have the chips and guacamole, the lettuce wraps are my favorite, and the <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with mole sauce is pretty good too. everything is shareable, so we usually get a few other items. i love this place.", 
            "i was recommended by a local to try this place out. it was wonderful blend of chinese and mexican cuisines. we celebrated my dad's birthday. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> lamb potstickers from the dim sum menu, oh my this was incredible, the meat was cooked very well. another chinese dish we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> was 18 <mark>18 Monk Noodle</mark>, very delicious! for the mexican taste we had some poblano flautas, it had duck, this was a special on their menu. it was rich with flavor! then we added <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark>. of course i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> <mark>Mexican Coke</mark>. we ended the meal with tres leches! oh my this was decadent, and huge! haha didn't expect it to be so wholesome. the manager, jessica was incredible and so was our server! highly recommend this to anyone visiting and to the locals. i'm coming here again!"

            "great concept, but it was poorly executed. i was really unimpressed, especially since the cosmopolitan houses so many amazing restaurants.\n\ni had dinner here with a party of 8. with the prices they had, i thought i'd be in for some amazing fusion cuisine...\n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> - $10 literally just melted, buttery cheese. i can't believe we paid 10 bucks for this!\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> w/ mole - $7 was interesting at first, but then no one wanted to finish it.\nsetas (wild mushroom guacamole tacos) - $4.50/taco i got two. i didn't even want to finish my 2nd one, so i gave it to my boyfriend.\ncochinita (yucatan-style bbq pork tacos) - $5.50/taco my friends said it was okay. nothing special.\n\nwe didn't feel satisfied after our meal.\nsmall portions. super overpriced. lousy flavors. avoid!",

            "good food and fun ambiance, but very pricey for what you get. my friends and i wanted just some small bites before going out and this place seemed like it would fit the bill. i'd been to jose andres' bazaar in la so i knew this place would be pricey but probably worth a try. the dishes are actually pretty straightforward and tasty upscale versions of chinese and mexican street food. by upscale i mean gold leaf flakes on the dumplings, oyster in a taco, etc. and tiny portions.\n\nour group got to share:\n- sui mai (traditional 6pc  shrimp/pork/water chestnuts/mushrooms/peanuts)\n- <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> (hand-cut wheat noodles/spicy pork sauce/peanuts)\n- c\\u00f3ctel de camarones (fresh shrimp/jumbo lump crab meat/tomato/avocado)\n- <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> (fried potatoes with mole poblano/mexican cream/queso fresco)\n\nand i got for myself in addition:\n- <mark>Viva China</mark> (soft beef tendon/kumamoto oysters/scallions/sichuan peppercorn sauce)\n- china paloma (tequila reposado/house-made grapefruit lavender syrup/soda)\n\ni'd have to say my fave item was that <mark>Viva China</mark> taco! the beef tendon was perfectly crispy/chewy/fatty and the oyster added an extra dimension to the flavors--very good! all told with others ordering a drink of their own everyone's share came to about $35, which is pretty dang pricey for small bites. the service was also decent so i thought it was worth a try, but next time i'll probably save my $$ for other places.", 
            "i like jose andres, chinese food and mexican food.  put them all together you'd get something spectacular, right?  well, at least that's i hoped for.\n\nthe service at china poblano was good.  i loved the interior.  images of mao, frida kahlo, the dalai lama, etc. projected on screen on the walls - nice touch.\n\ni had the <mark>Jasmine Downy Pearls</mark> tea and it was amazing.  it was fragrant and it tasted good.  it was a neat idea that they give you a timer so you get to enjoy the perfect tea whether you like it mild, medium or strong.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a bun of different things from the menu:\n\n<mark>Golden Pigs</mark>:\n4 fried bbq pork buns with a side of condensed milk.  dipping pork buns on condensed milk might seem pretty odd but it works.  sweet and savory just go well together.  5/5\n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>:\na braised pork sandwich.  the bread tastes just like biscuits but the filling's saaaalty. if you look at the menu, you'll see \"<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>\" in a box which will make you think that's their specialty.  honestly, i hated it. 1/5\n\ntacos (carnitas, langosta, <mark>Viva China</mark>, pescado frito):\nthe carnitas came with pork rinds on top but the pork in the taco was dripping in oil.  just let the oil drip off your taco and you're all set. great taco variety. 4/5\n\n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>:\n4 steamed bbq pork buns. yep, that's all i can say about that.  nothing special. 3/5\n\nlucky six siu mai:\n2 scallop siu mai, 2 beef siu mai and 2 traditional siu mai topped with itty bitty pieces of gold leaf. 3/5\n\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with mole:\ni wanted fries with my sandwich.  i had to pick between mole and <mark>XO Sauce</mark>.  fries + <mark>XO Sauce</mark> just doesn't seem appetizing so i went with mole.  the mole was overpowering.  there was a scant amount of mexican cream and queso fresco.  i can usually finish an order of fries but not this one. 2/5\n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> with chorizo:\nagain, nothing special. 3/5\n\nmango sticky rice:\nthis was the best thing on the menu.  instead of using sticky rice, they used puffed rice so you get that nice crunch with a nice creamy coconut sauce and semi-sweet mangoes. 5/5\n\nchocolate terra cotta warriors:\nthe name \"warriors\" is misleading because you only get one warrior made of chocolate filled with chocolate mousse on top of cookie crumbs and ginger ice cream.  it looks like something just died on my plate complete with dirt and flowers.  the presentation was just too funny but this chocoholic wasn't 100% pleased with the taste but the creativity was there. 4/5\n\ncajeta flan:\na flan made with goat's milk served with salted caramel ice cream and pineapple chunks.  the flan was mild and the salted caramel ice cream was just lovely. 4/5\n\nso why 3 stars?  for the amount and type of food you get vs. the price, not worth it.  it's like they grabbed the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> from viva zapatas, steamed bbq pork buns and siu mai from spring mountain, fish tacos from rubio's for like $3 each and decided to serve it to you for double or triple the price.  part of what makes chinese and mexican food great is that they're inexpensive.", 
            "i was a little unsure of this place and the chinese/mexican fusion combo made me ask why???.  when i visted their website and saw that it is a chef jose andreas establishment i figured it must be amazing so i said what the hell and made a reservation. i am a mexican food lover so i stuck with things on the miexican portion of the menu, a few different tacos(barbacoa and carnitas) both of which were amazing, the beef just melts in your mouth it is so tender. i also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> some <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> and some <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> to share with the table.  one of the people in my party went the chinese route and or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, i tried a few bites and it was amazing, and could be a meal in itself. i will go back and next time i will order the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> for myself. \n\nprices were actually low in my opinion, not cheap but i would have paid more for the quality of food.  rreat value for the quality of food and location inside of the cosmopolitan. all in all i would recommend china poblano to anyone visiting vegas.", 
            "i think this will most likely be a letdown for most people. given the breadth of variety and quality of dining options in vegas, i would skip it. if you are a jose andres faithful and you just absolutely must, get the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>. \n\nfirst of all, the outside seating is not fun. you're basically sitting on glorified wooden crates and when we got up to leave everyone's rear was a little sore. this makes me sound like such a pansy. not a dealbreaker on it's own, but just a note. also, as others have mentioned, this restaurant is not a fusion restaurant. not a big deal if you don't expect it, but just know that there's definitely no culinary cultural mash up to be had here. \n\nanyway, i went with two friends and we were pretty hungry and pretty comprehensive in our order. we got an item from each section of the menu except for soups and salads, because that's what the real pansies order. here's what we got and what i thought.   \n\ntacos: <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> - i mean it's decent, but it's not what we were expecting. not anything special at all. also, teeny tiny. very little chorizo. i know the chorizo is calling your name but don't do it. you end up with a $5 mouthful of regret. pass. \n\ndim sum: <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> - ugh. i didn't plan on this review being such a downer, but if i'm being honest, this is another pass. this tasted fine, but it was a steamed pork bun! for $14! we love steamed pork buns so we went for it, but expected some tender fall off the bone flavorful magic for this price. but like, it was totally standard and not special at all. pass.  \n\nnoodles: <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - this was pretty good. i'm a fan and if i came back i would get this again. it had a nice kick to it and the noodles had a nice al dente texture. i need to note that even though this is the one thing i will vouch for, it was a little on the salty side. but i'd do it again. play. \n\nfrom china: twenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> - i am a sucker for any sort of endorsement ever. the waiter says travel channel liked it? yes, ok, yes please. and then out comes this extra small portion of <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> that is so not worth $20 and then you feel like, maybe the waiter played you like a fiddle. pass.\n\nfrom mexico: <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> - i really didn't like this at all but to be fair i'm in the .001% of the nations's population that doesn't particularly care for fries. also i never really like mole sauce because it feels misleading. you can't bill yourself as a chocolate sauce and not taste anything like chocolate. and sometimes i forget it doesn't taste chocolatey at all and i try it again and it's like ugh fleeced again. but that's neither here nor there. pass.\n\nin hindsight, this really makes it sound like i hated it. which i totally didn't, i was just very underwhelmed. as i'm originally from the dc area, i've tried several of jose andres' restaurants and have always been absolutely obsessed with all his creations. so maybe i've set the bar high because i've had such good things from his places before, or maybe i'm just extra judgey because i grew up eating both these cuisines so i've had much better at cheaper prices before? dunno. either way, despite being very hungry, all of us were just kind of like, meh, this is so not on par with his other restaurants. again, nothing is terrible, it's just not very good. i think it just isn't worth the prices when there are so many more incredible options just a few steps away down the strip.", 
            "wow. why all the bad reviews? i eat here every time i go to vegas! china poblano is pricey, but i definitely think it's worth it. the service is pretty slow, but the restaurant is usually packed and the servers are nice. i always have the chips and guacamole, the lettuce wraps are my favorite, and the <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with mole sauce is pretty good too. everything is shareable, so we usually get a few other items. i love this place.",

            "ate here this past sunday night. the best i can categorize it was strange.  the atmosphere is very casual - felt more like a <mark>Cafe</mark> than a fine dining experience. long tables with backless chairs, mexican pottery and artwork on the walls. no bar to wait for your table so we went to another restaurant's bar while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. the menu is not chinese-mexican fusion it's basically half chinese and half mexican and all small servings (like tapas). our group of 4 started with guacamole which was the most expensive item on the menu. it was truly delicious and was served with homemade tortillas which brought me back to mexico in one bite.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> as well which were very good. on the chinese side we went with traditional sui mai, lamb pot stickers, and 2 noodle dishes. everything was good but not outrageous. plus i'm accustomed to dipping sauces with sui mai and pot stickers that are usually seasoned with garlic, ginger and a touch spicy. the sauces here seemed just to be soy sauce. we finished off with a few more mexican choices - <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>, scallop ceviche and barbeque beef tacos. all were very good but again not amazing. also the offerings at the bar are very limited unless you're drinking tequila which i wasn't because i had to start drinking at the bar next door so i started with sky raspberry vodka which i couldn't get at china poblano. plain vodka only here. also only chinese or mexican beer. i probably wouldn't return unless i happened to be in the cosmopolitan and was really hungry.",

            "if not for the out-of-this-world carnitas tacos (yay for pork rinds!) i think i would have given this place only 2 stars.  it advertises itself as \"chinese/mexican fusion\", but the menu is really just split up into various mexican dishes and chinese dishes (mostly of the dim sum variety). as an overall note, i think that the mexican dishes were much tastier than the chinese items, so if you are wrestling b/w the two, i would go with mexican. here's what we tried:\n\ntacos\ncarnitas - yum yum yum.  definitely order this if you order nothing else.  and get two, so that you won't have to share. a+\n\n<mark>Viva China</mark> - this is a kumamoto oyster/beef tendon/sichuan peppercorn sauce taco.  the combo of the tendon and oyster was underwhelming, and if you really love that peppercorn taste, you're not going to find much of it here. c-\n\nbarbacoa - we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> this because it came with \"cactus paddle\".  still have no idea what cactus paddle is, but it's an awesome name!  the beef was alright, though a bit salty, and the cactus unfortunately didn't really taste like anything at all. c-\n\nfried fish taco - the fish was fried nicely, and i liked the pickled onions that came with it, but it was close to 7 bucks for two tiny tacos and pinky sized pieces of fish, so probably wouldn't order it again.  b-\n\nchinese\n\nfire phoenix - this was pretty much a variation of popcorn chicken, with pork rinds on the side.the sichuan peppercorn salt was really good, and fried chicken never tastes bad when it's fres, but there really wasn't anything that special about this dish.  c\n\nmexican\n\n<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> - comes on a bed of ice and looks delectable.  tastes pretty a-ok too. i think they put soy sauce in here, which gives it a nice depth of flavor.  a-\n\ncoctel de camarones - this was pretty much like a cold cocktail of shrimp, crab, and avocado, mixed with what is essentially a cocktail sauce.  i love lump crab meat and i love shrimp, but i didn't come here to eat those things with cocktail sauce.  i can get that for 3.99 anywhere else.  c\n\n<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> - this actually did taste like a fusion dish, though it was a bit heavily sauced.  the shrimp are nice and garlic-y, with a hint of spice from the poblano peppers.  good, but could have used a side of rice or something.  b-\n\nin a nutshell:  i'd recommend just stopping in and sitting at the counter and ordering some tacos (especially the carnitas ones), and then going somewhere else for dinner.  as a disclaimer, we didn't order the famous \"twenty ingredient <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>\" that was featured on food network, but i'm taiwanese, and i just don't feel right paying 20 bucks for <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>.", 
            "this was my second visit to china poblano, although my first visit was last year and it was limited to a couple dumplings and some drinks.  this time my wife and i came for lunch while the cosmopolitan was getting our room ready.  the restaurant has one of the cooler buildouts in town - stylish and chic yet still comfortable.  the design aesthetic borrows from chinese and mexican traditions, much like the menu.  what was interesting to us was that we didn't sense much \"fusion\" between the two traditions - they menu is segregated between chinese and mexican dishes.  we had a mix, but no single dish we had really fused the two cusines.\n\nlet's start off with a story.  just after we sat down, a party of 4 sat next to us.  after a quick look at the menu they asked the server why they didn't see quesadillas and burritos.  the server explained that china poblano's mexican fare comes from the cuisine of southern mexico, while they were thinking more about the food along the us border.  the server expertly encouraged them to give the place a try, and they wouldn't be disappointed.  no dice - they got up and left anyway.  the server told us that happens a lot.\n\nthat was their loss.  we started with the special chicken tinga tacos with chorizo, onions and potatoes, which my wife and i loved.  the potatoes in particular made the tacos, and they went great with the sauce, one of my favorites in the mexican lexicon.\n\nwe also really enjoyed the <mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> hot and sour soup.  this was not your traditional chinese hot and sour soup - the color was much darker, the sesame flavor really popped, as did the cilantro.  it had much more depth than we expected and was almost smoky.  \n\nof the lucky 6 sui mai, we liked the scallop sui mai the best, then the beef and then the traditional shrimp & pork.  all were delicious though, and sui mai is always a personal favorite, whatever anyone puts in it.  \n\nthe <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> was good too, but the shrimp was a little overwhelmed by the sweet black roasted garlic.  it was a good dish, but i'd have preferred a little bit more shrimp flavor. \n\nfun place with good food, but you have to like chinese and southern mexican flavors, which my wife and i absolutely do.", 
            "really really really wanted to love this. i came in with high expectations, especially because i am a fan of jose andres's style. he is creative and has a vision that is unique in the restaurant world. the kitchen needs to see his same vision. \n\nthe layout of the restaurant is stunning. two bars upon entry (left and right) and your in direct sight of the dimsum preparation and steamers. there are creative cocktails to choose from, & the bar has an embedded part of the design to hold a spoon...then dissapointment began. \nwithout being longwinded,  salty! over priced! really dissapointing! \n\nthis was the order: <mark>Viva China</mark>* soft beef tendon/ kumamoto oysters/scallions/ sichuan peppercorn sauce -- it was one tiny taco, this was my only tasty thing but the price was a serious turn off for the size. pescado frito fried fish/ ancho chile pickled onions taco-- again just okay, doesn't justify the cost. beef 6pc beef/lime/ daikon/ watermelon radish --dimsum, i've had better. and the clincher <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> 8 pc shrimp/sweet black garlic/roasted poblano peppers--salty\n\ni don't know if the kitchen was off that day but i rarely send things back and the salt content was so powerful we just had to say something. we got the dish made fresh again and sad to say, nothing changed.\n\nour bill was approximately $110 and it left us starved for a second meal that wasn't going to leave us with high blood pressure. i understand that good quality will justify higher priced cuisine but these portion sizes were abnoxious. they should even slightly up the price and give us two tacos instead! eating with your eyes is the first step to the dining experience and that left us hungry. \n\ni will definitely continue to visit jose andres's other projects but will stay away from china poblano in the cosmo when blue ribbon sushi satisfies me a lot more in the same price range!!", 
            "while i was skeptical of the whole fusion concept, some of the dishes were pretty inventive, i'll give them that!\n\nthe <mark>Viva China</mark> (oysters + soft beef tendon+ peppercorn sauce) taco was quite tasty as was the huitlacoche noodles with mushrooms and mexican corn truffles. the best cold dish has to be the palmitos (hearts of palm + grapefruit salad) which was ideal to combat the vegas heat. \n\nno matter what the server suggests, the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> (shrimp + fermented garlic sauce) is not worth it for the tiny bits of shrimp. it's something a chinese mama could make for a lot less. \n\ndrinks were amazing; mexican mojitos, mimosas and what have you. they do magic with mezcal here!\n\nfor what it is, this resto does solid lunch and dinners, and the drinks aren't too bad. drop in if you're stuck outside marquee or just for a quick bite before checking into your room.", 
            "in vegas from l.a. reviewing food.(service was great ).\nthe tacos are really well executed:you can taste the ingredients and the housemade tortillas are supple and melt in your mouth with the filling.not gonna list them all, but they were all excellent to our taste.\n the huitlacoche \"shaved pasta\", needed salt .the pasta were nice though, with a great texture but the spiciness overwhelmed the dish.we still managed to finish the bowl.\n<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> was tasty,the flavors well balanced, although we thought they would have been nice served with an accompaniment .\nthe must have to finish your meal: the sticky rice foam and mango.their take on the classic thai dessert (sticky rice and mango).when our waiter described it to us i was drewling! and it was beyond belief! i would go back just for that.", 
            "yes yes and yes. i have been craving this place since eating here with my bf. it is astonishing to me that there are only 3 stars on the company profile. jose andres can do no wrong in my book.\nstarted our meals out with a few yummy cocktails. i got the margarita with a \"salt air topping\" wow. i could have had 4 of these, but decided i actually wanted to remember my meal so i refrained. its your typical margarita with tequila and fresh lime juice and agave, but topped with a salt foam. great presentation i may add.\nwe had no clue what to order so we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a few items to share. we had a friend join us so between 3 people, this is what we had\nensalada gaspacho estilo de morelia; an amazing salad consisting of pineapple, dragonfruit, mango, jicama, queso fresco, and a  chile pequ\\u00edn \n<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> minus the pecans \ncctel de camarones; =shrimp, jumbo lump crab meat, tomato, and diced avocado \n<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> shrimp in a sweet black garlic sauce with roasted poblano peppers \n\n....and the best thing ive ever eaten\n\n20 vegetable with friend rice. omg. this is a vegan dream with so many different veggies all grilled served over rice that seriously melted in my mouth. i cant wait to go back to this restaurant and have 2 orders of this...\n\nthis restaurant has a very interesting concept. asian fusion meets mexican. i really enjoyed these two combined. the service was impeccable, i wish i could remember my servers name but he was so awesome. with so many restaurants in the cosmo to choose from, i highly recommend trying this place.", 
            "what a spectacular experience! from beginning to end, we had nothing but a yummy and hospitable welcome from china poblano and its staff. this restaurant is located on the second floor of my very favorite vegas hotel, the cosmopolitan. the seating is comfy and somewhat communal with long benches and tables. the decor is chic and earthy. the drinks are spectacular...any of the cocktails are great. we loved the small dishes, especially the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> and the coctel de damarones. both of these dishes are unbelievable and the tuna and lump crab were plentiful! i was partial to the mexican side of the menu but enjoyed everything we had. the noodles are a great selection for the asian flavor. the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> was simple but packed with flavor. the food is sultry and inviting, just like the atmosphere. you usually don't have to worry about reserving a table way in advance. i can't recommend china poblano enough. you have to experience it for yourself. enjoy!", 
            "not crazy about the seating arrangements.  it is the unfortunate long wall bench seat with several small tables in front and small ottoman types seats on the opposite side of the table.  the decor is nice to look at the wall is covered kabuki masks and oaxaca animals.  we started with a taco each my friend had the pollo con mole poblano and i had the <mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>.  we both like them very much.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> to share.  it was smoking and very well executed. we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> which sounds either odd or no big deal.  it was my favorite dish i would go back just to order that.  my friend said he would go back just to have the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> again.  now for the drinks, we both or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Margarita Bandera Flight</mark> which had three minis consisting of the salt air, a pomegranate salt air, and the blood orange chili.  i like the blood orange chili the best since it has the balance with citrus  and heat.  the salt air is basically a salt foam on top.  which makes the drink too salty.  but the pomegranate version is very good.  i would recommend giving it try especially since the dishes are served family styled and meant to be shared.", 
            "the food was great and the service was good. we tried a little of everything, but the highlights were the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> (recommended by our waiter, and definitely one of our favorite dishes of the night), dancing eggplant (we thought an eggplant dish would be boring, but it was out of this world), and the lucky 6 sui mai. other highlights were the guacamole and the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> (both pretty unoriginal in terms of concept, but when prepared as perfectly as they were, you take notice). this restaurant does get expensive, especially for alcohol -- that accounted for half of our bill. i would recommend eating here, but drinking elsewhere.", 
            "i had visited china poblano a few years ago on a visit to vegas and had such fond memories i had to go back. i love all of jose andres' dc restaurants so naturally i had to visit one of this vegas restaurants. \n\nthere was no wait for a party of one to get seated at the bar (30-45 minute wait for parties of 2-4). sitting at the bar is the way to go if you are dining alone! the bartender was very attentive, he quickly took my drink order and made suggestions for my food order. i personally love the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> (i opted for pomegranate, yum!). the foamy salt never mixes with your margarita so you just get a lovely taste of salt with every sip, less salty than big chunks of salt on the rim of the glass in my opinion.\n\nthe bartender said the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> was one of their most popular dishes and that the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> was a personal favorite so i went with those 2 items for dinner. i really enjoyed the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>, the noodles were the perfect texture and it wasn't too spicy for a spice wimp like me. the serving size is a little small so you may want an appetizer to go with it. the seasoning on the shrimp was really delicious, though a little on the salty side. \n\ni'll definitely be back, hopefully i won't be traveling alone next time because there are so many dishes that would be great for sharing!", 
            "my beef isn't so much the  actual taste of the food it's more like the portion and cost.  i know, i know after all this is las vegas so everything is priced three times what it usually should cost. it is completely beyond me how people can charge this much for food. during this particular visit i arrived with seven other guests three of which were menly men (like these boys could eat). one of them even asked which is your largest meal and the waiter responded with twenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>. judging by it's miniture size i doubt it actually had twenty vegetables it was probably named that cause it cost close to twenty dollars! \n\nnext up is the <mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> it is braised red pork in a chinese flat bread. it was tasty but a bit on the salty side and was almost half the size of my iphone! \n\nthen my hunny and i split the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> per the waiter's recommendation. it was packed full or flavor and mouthwatering good. it was $16 for eight pieces.\n\nagain my complaint isn't towards the taste or quality of the food mainly the portions. the service was good we were seated within 10 minutes for a party of eight while other places had hour long wait times. the restaurant decor and arrangement was very chic and trendy. but after loosing my butt in the casino i doubt i'd be able to pay for a substantial lunch here!", 
            "i was looking forward to seeing what this place had to offer as i've walked by it a lot but never had a chance to try it.  the place didn't really live up to the expectations.  i had the <mark>Ten Treasure</mark> noodle soup which was nice to have after a night of drinking in the vegas desert.  i also tasted the cheese fondido with chorizo but it was just an overly salty goop.  my friend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> and it was adequate but nothing to write home about. the pork steamed buns were overly sweet and really on the small side. \n\nprobably not worth a second visit given all the choices in town.", 
            "there's no mexican-asian fusion going on in this restaurant, except that the 2 menus and decor are intertwined. it's almost like someone could not decide if they wanted to open a mexican restaurant or chinese restaurant, so they decide to open both in the same space, with separate kitchens. i love both mexican food and chinese food, but this is neither here nor there. two cuisines that are normally best in a hole-in-the wall spot, and inexpensive - this is just the opposite: overpriced and mediocre.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> everything family style and tried to get a good mix of both mexican & chinese food:\n\n<mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark> ($15) - i liked this margarita a lot. i don't care for the taste of tequila, and the blood orange seemed to mask this well. it had a spicy kick to it, but not so spicy that it was undrinkable.\n\nguacamole & chips ($15) - handmade, and delicious, but the price is about double what i would expect to pay for fresh guacamole. chips were light, crispy and fresh.\n\ntacos (about $5 each) - i'm used to dollar tacos (maybe $2) at a taco truck. i got the <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> and it was good, but unless i'm expensing my meal to work, i would pass on this - much too expensive for tacos.\n\n<mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> ($12.88) - 6 pieces - this was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. the lamb inside was tasty and i liked the crispy lace (sweet onions) design on the dish. would recommend this.\n\nsui mai ($13.88) - 6 pieces - the only cool thing about this were the gold flakes on top. the rest was just okay, and tasted heavy on the ginger. at a normal dim sum restaurant, you can get 4 sui mai's for $4 that taste better.\n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> ($12) - wheat noodles and spicy pork sauce - this was definitely spicy, nothing that blew me away though. at least the price was reasonable for the portion-size.\n\ncol de bruselas ($12) - these are on the acidic side - tasted really limey. i wouldn't get this again.\n\n<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> ($18) - 8 pieces of shrimp = $2.25 per piece of shrimp. sauce was good, not too spicy, this was one of the better dishes we had.\n\nbistec con mole amarillo y hongos ($20) - grilled hanger steak with mole - there were about 6 sliced pieces of steak - again, with the small portions. it was one of the better tasting dishes we had, but expensive.\n\nall in all, it's an interesting concept and i was there for work so i was able to expense my meal. with tip and tax, it was $60 per person - quite honestly, i would rather eat at a mexican food truck or a hole-in-the-wall chinese place for 1/4 of the price and more authentic food. with so many other options in vegas, i'll be going elsewhere.", 
            "i was excited to try another of jose andres restaurants. of note, compared to many of his other restaurants, this one is a bit more casual. \n\nthe drink menu is excellent with many fresh and creative cocktails that are inspired by a fusion of chinese and mexican. they also have a large variety of different mescals. \n\nthis is definitely a small plate restaurant, so order at least 2-3 plates per person and share to experience as much as possible. the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> and tacos ( try the cochinita and lengua) were great!  the <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark> was more of a poke and less seafood ceviche, but still good. \n\na bit pricey compared to his other restaurants for the lesser experience but otherwise a fun place to have a casual bite.",

            "to be honest, i was really skeptical when my friends told me we were going to a chinese-mexican fusion restaurant. i like them mutually exclusively & never got on the fusion food bandwagon. i went in a party of 6, and we shared everything family style - that's the way to go! \n\nsitting on the \"patio\" is a great place for people watching, as it's across the way from marquee and the other restaurants in the cosmopolitan. \n\nsome highlights from our meal:\n- <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>: absolutely delicious and strongly scented of sesame.\n- chilaquiles: the menorita cheese was so melty, salty and perfect\n- <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>: light spice. i like the addition of the black garlic\n- <mark>Kao Lao Lao</mark>: little rolled noodle sheets served with a fermented vegetable sauce. very rich, umami flavor\n- i didn't personally get the duck tongue tacos, but those that did were blown away!\n\nmy only gripe was the price of alcohol. on a whim, we decided to order a pitcher of margarita & a few a la carte drinks - which pushed our $200 meal to well over $300. oopsies, should have looked at the price beforehand. they were mediocre, so pre-party elsewhere.\n\nyes, there will be haters that say the prices are too high, but this is vegas. it's food by jose andres, for heavens sake...",

            "the dishes were surprisingly small so we ended up ordering quite a few. pricey, but nothing unusual for vegas. i didn't find anything really memorable. the food was okay. none of us were sure what to order, so we went with the waiter's suggestions.\n\nthe meal started off great. the chips and house made guacamole were really good. i couldn't stop eating the chips. sodium was a absolute treat tonight. i could definitely taste all this good stuff.\n\neach of the dishes, served tapas style, was definitely small and probably meant to be shared. i had the six dishes below. most of them lacked flavor. maybe it was the chef's off night. the best dishes though were definitely the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> and the <mark>Gan Pung Ji Chicken Wings</mark>.\n\n*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*\n\nthe <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> - not the most appealing to look at, but each piece was delectable. we should of just or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> more of this.\n\n<mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> - at the very least, taste like something, please!\n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - what exactly am i eating? there's so little pork that i only taste wheaty noodles and peanut sauce.\n\n<mark>Chicken Ji Song</mark> - this looked like it was going to be good, if only we were able to find where the chef had hidden all the flavor.\n\nbistec con mole amarillo y hongos - the grilled hanger steak, another dish that looked great, but alas, it too suffered from blanditis.\n\nthe <mark>Gan Pung Ji Chicken Wings</mark> - the only other dish worth ordering. so tasty...and so spicy too.\n\n*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*\n\nservice was excellent. our waiter was attentive, did his best with the suggestions and came back often to ask if everything was okay.\n\nprobably a place to visit for something out of the ordinary. it's a fusion place after all, but i wouldn't come hungry. this place didn't really hit the spot. at least you'll have room for late night eats!",

            "allow me to preface, i seldom give 1 or 2 stars: a lot had to be missing for any dining establishment to fall in this category. \n\nit was a saturday night at the cosmopolitan hotel & casino.  h and i were in a hurry to grab a quick bite before heading to the marquee night club.  the cafe would surely prepare a hearty meal, but as the minutes ticked away, we knew that time was not on our side.  luckily (or unluckily in this case) china poblano jumped out of nowhere and had a sign that said \"to go or take out.\"  instantly, i'm thinking it's kinda like taco bell fast, but let's just say that we're lucky to get our food in less than 20 minutes.\n\nthe menu was a fusion of chinese and mexican food.  unique? not really.  anybody can make any type of meat and throw it in a tortilla shell and call it mexican food.  anybody creating this type of concept needs to think it through to create a unique dining experience for everyone who passes through the doors.  come'on, people travel from all over the world to come to vegas.  is this is best meal the cosmo can offer?  i believe not.\n\nthe pork siu mai were a disgrace to chinese people who invented this dish.   i have eaten this all my life in oc & la & even sf and have never seen anything so tiny.  it was literally the size of a quarter, all 6 of them, looking pretty sad and lonely in this takeout container that it was tossed into.  no shredded lettuce or cabbage for garnishment.  just 6 puny little siu mai's squished to the corner of the container.  i finished them in 2 minutes and naturally was not full at all.  the taste -- it was ok, not spectacular.\n\nthe tacos that h had were another dismal dish that appeared from the same menu.  i can't quite comment on the taste but the size was disappointing.\n\nthe prices.... were not cheap. both microscopic & macroscopic items came in slightly less than $30.  what?  does money grow on trees?  asians are taught to get the best bang for the buck and to bargain our way through life... this time i felt jipped & helpless.  left the establishment with a more than half empty stomach & feeling robbed.\n\n<mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark>:\nok, granted we order takeout, but there was no place to sit outside in the hallways of the hotel.  it's just not sexy or classy to eat in the hallways.  meanwhile inside, the bar was completely empty (as in zero, zip, zilch, nada patrons).  we asked the girl cleaning the bar if we could please sit there for a few minutes, and she said yes. then, like a bat out of hell, the hostess stormed over and said we cannot sit there.  what?  did you not realize we were not fighting for seats but actually making your establishment appear fuller than it is?  so, she escorted us to these benches behind the bar with pillows that we could sit in.  for all the commotion that she caused by moving us, we could've finished our food in the 2 minutes that it requires to consume our so-called meal.\n\nin conclusion:\nthis place is not suitable in such a gorgeous hotel as the cosmopolitan.  it does not compare to its elegance, its grandeur, and its sophistication.  the people who work there need to grace better manners and accommodate its patrons a little better.\n\ni would highly suggest you save your money and go to the cafe downstairs or win a couple of hands in blackjack and eat at blue ribbon sushi or stk instead.",

            "went here close to a month ago and just getting around to posting a review. we've tried several other restaurants at the cosmo and have become fans of the resort and it's food offerings. <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark> started off not so great, with the hostess service a bit frenzied and disorganized. there was no one at the hostess area and a bunch of us milling by the entrance not sure what was going on. once seated, everything changed. the server was awesome...cheerful, knowledgeable and attentive. the service seemed a bit rushed at times. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> six different things and the time in between servings was sometimes not enough. i have no problem with the portions, which are on the small side and for the most part really aren't suitable for sharing unless you order a bunch of things.   i'm always about quality and not quantity, and the quality was excellent. these dishes, sauces, etc. aren't just slapped together. they are creative, complex and well executed. the prices for small plates is high, but again, cosmo on the strip, what do you expect.  now for the food: \n\n<mark>Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll</mark> - delicious, but nothing really set it apart from all the other good <mark>Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll</mark>. \n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - wheat noodles in a spicy pork sauce. omg. it's been a month and i still can't stop thinking about it. \n\n20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>. the price will blow you away, but have to say we really enjoyed it. the time and effort that goes into this dish is incredible and you can literally identify all 20 vegetables finely chopped in perfect proportions. \n\ncarnitas taco - awesome. the spicy verde cruda sauce...i asked for a side dish of it and almost drank it. \n\n<mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark>. had never tried pork belly, and the combination with pineapple was intriguing. good, but not my favorite. \n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> - outstanding, with a nice slightly burnt top to the cheese, perfect texture and great tortillas.\n\nthe beer was cold but could have been colder.\n\nwill definitely be back.", 
            "i was super excited to try this place over the weekend and was not disappointed!\n\nfor those who say this place is overpriced, i say vegas, in general, is overpriced.  i didn't come here looking for a cheap taco since i can get that at any food truck on any corner at home; i came here to experience a jose andres creation and i'm glad i did!\n\nthe bf and i shared a few things:\n\n<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> taco - bbq beef with chili and cactus - yum!\n<mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark> taco - slow cooked pork belly with pineapple - my fave!!!\n<mark>Refried Bean Taco</mark> - black beans with chipotle salsa and queso fresco (probably the best refried beans i have ever had - totally unexpected!)\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> with chorizo - served with tortillas and really good.  it's not as greasy as some of the queso i've had before (tres agaves), so that's a huge plus!\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - wheat noodles with a spicy ground pork sauce - super good, a little sweet.\n\nit sounds like a lot, but the tacos are pretty small and we didn't eat all the queso, though it was so good, i feel like i could have.\n\na highlight to <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark> was chef andres, himself, in the restaurant.  i was tempted to ask for a picture with him, but refrained as he looked pretty busy with his staff.\n\nall in all a good experience - i will definitely be back!", 
            "i went to china poblano with my family at 10:00 pm on a saturday night. we were seated promptly. our waiter was terrible. he didn't explain the menu and was not helpful at all. most of the plates can be shared, but we didn't know how to go about ordering. we all agreed that <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark> could have been a lot better had we had a waiter who was helpful, happy to explain the menu, and had a personality. if i would have caught his name, i would have definitely called management.  the food was so so.  definitely not worth the prices.", 
            "delicious, funky, creative, slightly overpriced. nice ambiance, friendly service. worth <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark>. try a margarita. also enjoyed some yummy small bites.", 
            "are you looking for authentic chinese and/or mexican food? do you enjoy unique fusion combos? is it important for you to get good value in terms of quality/quantity vs price? if you answered yes to any of these questions, do not bother eating at this place.\n\nthe decor and service are top notch, i will give them that. but a restaurant is about food first and foremost, and those things should be there to complement <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark>, not make up for bad food. i had the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark>, the lamb pot stickers, the har gau, and the <mark>Swallow a Cloud</mark>. the portions were ridiculously tiny: i could've fit all six pieces of har gau in one bite. the noodle soup was really bland. \n\neverything about the restaurant looks unique, fancy, and pricy: all usually good indications. but not here. here, \"unique, fancy, and pricy\" are the indications of pretentiousness. don't be drawn in.", 
            "the guacamole was perfect, the spiciest had a good kick, and the sprinkling of queso fresco (or a similar cheese maybe?) was a nice touch. the tinga taco was tasty, and i really enjoyed the traditional shumai plate, a great sampler of the different varieties.  i had bites of my friends plates, and their food ranged from meh to pretty good.  however, i was expecting a unique and exciting experience from a jose andres restaurant, and was very underwhelmed by <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark> in general.  this was definitely a one-time visit for me.", 
            "i've always had great experiences at this place. great food, great service. i dont like sitting on the little stool thing but i can easily get over that. \n\nwe went there for my fiance's birthday, we has tacos, pozole, a couple orders of dim sum, noodles and a couple of deserts.\n\nhe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a manhattan, which sat in the window a bit to long so he was a little disappointing but it wasn't a huge deal.\n\nall in all we were very happy with <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark> and will be returning soon!", 
            "if it is authenticity you are looking for, obviously, you are setting yourself up for failure the second you step into this beautiful fusion restaurant. however, as a quintessential angeleno, i much much more prefer fusion rather than those so-called authentic food. and china poblano is the very reason why: it combines the distinctive taste of both worlds. plus, it's jos\\u00e9 andr\\u00e9s (see my reviews on \"saam\" or \"jaleo!!\") \n\nso, after bf and i sat down, without any hesitation, we immediately or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> \"<mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark>.\" on an average meal, we each can drink 2 to 4 cocktails easily, and $32 for 4 cocktails that's paired with the dishes we are about to order? who in their right mind would've missed that?\n\nas for food, we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>: langosta (seared lobster taco, i love how they served this dish out first and the grapefruit on the taco worked like an \"amouse bouche\" and ) <mark>Viva China</mark> (beef tendon/kumamoto oysters taco, the thinly sliced tendon was deep fried to the point like ultra thinned cristino! ) <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> (this is probably bf and my favorite of the entire meal; juicy minced lamb wrapped inside of dumplings that's topped with crispy fried pancake. an absolute culinary success,) traditional siu mai (with edible gold on top,) <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> (i love how surprisingly spicy this noodle dish was,) <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> (my favorite second dish, not to be confused with jaleo's garlic shrimp, the mojo sauce was actually blacken,) tres leches cake (by far the best tres leches i've ever tasted, and trust me i've tasted tons of them,) and churros (this dish was served fresh, so when i bit into the churro i can taste the exterior crunchiness as well as the soft and moist interior, not to mention they were served with a cup of hot chocolate as dipping sauce.)\n\nchina poblano embodies attentive and friendly staffs, delicious food, drinks, and dessert, plus, modern and \"fusionized\" d\\u00e9cor. it also was the first restaurant we went to after we arrived and checked into cosmopolitan. thus, the impeccable dining experience at china poblano set the bar up pretty high for the rest of this trip. if i do have to nitpick, i only wish they had more items on their menu. please be advised this place serves \"tapas style.\" i honestly do not think it's fair for people to give it such a low rating based on the size of the portion.\n\ni truly hope for those who haven't experienced china poblano's uniqueness would give it a try. as for bf and me, we cannot wait to go back to cosmopolitan again and pay this cute place another visit!!", 
            "located in the cosmopolitan next to the entrance of marquee. it's a cute restaurant with chinese/mexican decor. on the outside, you can order food at the \"take out\" windows (left is chinese, right is mexican). the type of food you get is made in that specific kitchen so everything comes out at different times. the interior decor was just as good as the outside. mad props to the decorator. \n\nalso, came with a group of 12 without a reservation, though the place was busy they managed to seat us in 5 minutes on a saturday. the service inside was just as good. our waiter was very knowledgeable.\n\npretty much everything here is made to share, with the exception of the tacos. they suggest that each person have 2-3 plates to themselves. if you eat a lot like me and are on a budget, this place isn't for you or maybe just get a taco.\n\nhighlights:\n*canitas taco $5.50 - pretty good but was oily\n*<mark>Mongolian Beef Lettuce</mark> $18.88 - type of meat they used was great, lettuce was good with the sauce. highly suggest this dish.\n*pozole rojo with a shot of reposado tequila $15 (w/out shot $12) - they tell you to add the shot to the pozole but i suggest you don't and just take the shot straight. some people liked it in the soup, and others didn't\n*<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> $12.88 - not bad/pretty average.\n*<mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> $19.88 - really good! you can add meat for an additional price but it's great the way it is\n\nif you don't want to make a decision on individual items, they do offer 3 tasting menus (<mark>Chef's Experience</mark> $55/person - combination of china/mexico dishes, <mark>Jose's Way</mark> $75/person - more unique dishes, & <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark> $35 - 4 of their unique cocktails)", 
            "poor guys, it looked like everyone were under a lot of pressure. the service times were horrible. \nthough we had 5 different people bring out food to us, it felt like they were understaffed or the manager just didnt have <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark> to get everything right though it looked like they were working their asses off. \n\nsome of the food didnt even taste that great, i didnt like my mushroom noodles and could eat only half of it. \n\nthey should stop making it look or feel like a classy restaurant and just deliver tasty food faster, just like they try to make it look. ( street style chinese and mexican food )", 
            "so i went back to china poblano to relive my 30th birthday last year (which was awesomely spent working the week in vegas and then spending the night at the cosmopolitan and eating here).  really i came back because the food was decent, i dug <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark> and the wait staff i had last time was memorable.  i felt bad for my dad because he is not as of an adventurous of an eater as i am, but he did find a noodle dish he enjoyed.  all in all, second time was a charm as well!", 
            "i have such fond experiences of eating here with my girlfriends when it first opened a few years ago, but my most recent visit wasn't nearly as delicious as i remembered. i don't know whether my taste has improved since my starving college student years or whether the restaurant has changed, but it was no longer the mind-blowing food i recalled. \n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Golden Pigs</mark>, the beef shumai, lobster tacos, and for dessert, mango sticky rice and churros (we like dessert). the pigs were basically donuts filled with bbq pork, and they were quite tasty when drenched with the accompanying condensed milk. the shumai weren't really anything to write home about, but the lobster tacos were the real disappointment! as my coworker put it, \"for $10 a taco, i expected them to taste good.\" the lobster was completely overwhelmed by an abundance of lime and grapefruit, making the tacos quite acidic and sour. the mango sticky rice was an interesting twist on the classic thai dessert, as the rice was puffed and sprinkled on top of mango and ice cream which was covered in quite a lot of whipped cream. it was light and interesting, and i enjoyed it. the churros were nice but not particularly special. \n\noverall i'm a bit disappointed in <mark>The China Poblano Cocktail Experience</mark>, and i hope they will start putting more effort into the food here."

            "picky eaters do not apply. to enjoy this place, you have to be an adventurous eater.  if you just get chips, <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, or a pork bun, you will not be happy.  \n\nfor foodies who won't turn their nose up at a beef tendon taco, this is the place for you!  super creative food and a great bargain for what you get.  \n\nwe started out with the pozole rojo ($9) which is a spicy shredded pork soup with chickpeas, cabbage, pork rinds, chopped onions, radish, and avocado.  this was a really good portion size for $9 and so tasty.  you can get it with a shot of tequila for an extra $3 but our server didn't recommend it unless we just wanted to do a tequila shot. apparently the tequila is offered for hangovers.  hair of the dog, you know.\n\nnext we tried the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco ($5.50 each) which has beef tendon, a kumamoto oyster, and sichuan sauce.  yes, beef tendon in a taco.  this was extremely tasty.  i could eat ten of these.\n\nwe also tried the cochinita taco ($4.50 each).  it's pretty much pork and pickled onions.  pretty good, but the carnitas taco topped with pork rinds is so much better.\n\nanother great dish was the papas with <mark>XO Sauce</mark> ($6).  french fries covered in a dried scallop sauce.  they serve it with lime, which you think would be awful.  but it's actually really, really good!\n\nthe big surprise of the night was the gaspacho morelia ($10).  this is a huge plate of very fresh, very tasty fruit covered in freshly squeezed orange juice.  some of the fruit had some spicy seasoning on it, which enhanced the flavor of the fruit.  pineapple, watermelon, mango, jicama, dragonfruit, strawberries, and queso fresca. very good and light.\n\nthe cocktails are also very inventive.  i don't think i can ever have a normal margarita again after having the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> ($12) served here.  the salt foam is a perfect compliment to the margarita and doesn't have the harsh taste of salt on the rim.  my husband had the <mark>Lychee Sour</mark> ($12) which was also very good.  \n\n$63 before tip and we were very, very full.  service was impeccable and very friendly.  just focus on the more creative dishes.  yeah, you can get a pork bun in chinatown for cheaper.  of course you can get a carne asada taco at a taco truck for cheaper.  come here for the creative dishes that you can't get anywhere else.", 
            "located in the cosmopolitan - i have to say what first caught my eye about this place was their viewing window where i could see them making pork buns, and also the fact it said there was take out. pork buns + take out = win! (not quite what happened but probably would have gotten more stars had that been the case.) \n\nchinese cuisine + mexican cuisine = china poblano. i'd say this is a fusion of the two but on the menu literally its two separate cuisines you can order from, no mingling at least not that my eyes could see. \n\norder consisted of: \n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> (4 pieces) - steamed pork buns $13.88\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - wheat noodles with spicy pork sauce $12.00\n<mark>Lychee Sour</mark> - yummy drink $12.00 \n\nso our waitress warned us that portions were small and that we should most likely order multiple things hence my pork buns and noodle dish. the pork buns to me were correctly portioned, i split the order with a friend thankfully because she had or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a single $10 lobster taco and $14 <mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>. the waitress really wasn't lying on small portions i give her credit for her honesty. \n\nthe food was overall pretty good. i loved the flavor of the meat in the pork buns but was a little turned off by the meat being lukewarm/cold. my noodle dish was the kind of spicy i enjoy but i had to \"pace\" myself with the small dish swimming in a large bowl (i didn't understand this presentation, the lets make our portions look even smaller with using larger serving bowls?). the <mark>Lychee Sour</mark>, was probably my favorite part of the whole meal. it was a different type of cocktail, tangy yet sweet, and oh how i love lychee.\n\noverall a bit pricey for my taste given it wasn't anything overly special or wow factor. perhaps i'd order the steamed pork buns again from the take out window given i could request the meat be a little more on the warm side.", 
            "chinese food and mexican food in one - what more could you ask for?\n\ni'm honestly pretty shocked about the lack of positive reviews for china poblano.  it's vegas - everything is expensive and probably not big enough (insert double entendre here).  stop your whining and realize it's tapas-style.  if you have 10 hungry bachelorette party girls like we were, order two of each type, eat family style, order a strong drink, and shut your trap.\n\nfor vegas shu mai, i thought it was pretty good.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> two servings of the lucky 8, which i recommend so you can get a taste of each type of shu mai they serve. all were tasty and topped with something interesting, like radish or goji berry. the har gau was ok; i have had better. the <mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> hot and sour soup had a wonderful kick of spices. drinks or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> included the singapore sling and the <mark>Lychee Sour</mark>, both of which were flavorful and interesting. i myself had vodka with fresh cantaloupe juice, which snuck up <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> and hit you like an unruly child. other dishes or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> at our table included a caesar salad (with way too much parmesan), <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>, shrimp, and numerous tacos. as far as pork buns go, the <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> was a little meh. i like the pork to be red and drier than this was.\n\nthe coup de grace of my palate was the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco. this is definitely the best non-traditional taco i've ever had. a taco with beef tendon and oyster - the crispiness of the tendon punctuated with the creamy oyster was mind-blowing. \n\nlots of good tastes, a few mediocre tastes. but definitely deserving of a higher rating than the uno estrellas some other folks are giving. i'd go back.  <mark>Viva China</mark> poblano!", 
            "dang. the vegas crowd is harsh - or at least very conservative with their stars.  came here over the weekend with a bachelorette party and i think everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food and drinks.\n\nbetween me and two other girls, we split: <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> (fries with rich mole sauce), <mark>Open Sesame</mark> (chilled noodle salad), <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> (cellophane noodles in soup), tuna cevhiche (veeeerrrrry interesting crunch), and dan dan mien (noodles with a spicy kick).\n\ni had a mexican mimosa and other people in the group had the <mark>Lychee Sour</mark> cocktail and <mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark>.\n\nseriously no complaints about the food except that the portions are tiny.  however, considering how many dishes we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> for three girls (we eventually cancelled our order for 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>), i think we did just fine.  sure, it was a little pricey, but you're in vegas and you're at the cosmopolitan.  the strip is littered with panda expresses if you want something cheap.\n\nnow that i've returned from vegas, and my coworker (who recommended china poblano to me) and i are discussing the different dishes that we've eaten here, i'm itching to go back.",

            "such an interesting concept in a gorgeous new casino on the strip! \n\nwhat initially caught my eye were the neon signs on either side of the entrance. one proclaiming \"mexican food\" and the other \"chinese food\". being a mexican food junkie, my friend and i saddled up the bar on the mexican side of the restaurant surrounded by cool lucha libre masks. we watched the mexican women make fresh corn tortillas by hand behind the bar. \n\ni started with my token order of chips, salsa and guac. oh..my..god!! the chips were to die for (what is that seasoning?), the salsa had a nice spicy kick and the $12 bowl of guacamole was huge & fresh!\n\nwe then split an order of chicken tacos which are small and come ala carte. the corn tortillas were as delicious as they looked! naturally, i washed it all down with their signature <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> which had an amazing lime tasting foam on top.\n\ni can't vouch for the chinese side of this joint but the whole restaurant was buzzing with energy and i am still dreaming about the food a week later....", 
            "we had a very enjoyable experience here. the service was outstanding and the food was delicious. admittedly, though, we did not venture into any dishes on the china side of the menu. we opted to sit at the taco bar, which was kinda nice. \n\nfor cocktails, we had the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> and mexican mimosa. with the mexican mimosa, we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the first one with papaya juice (good, but a little boring) and the second one with guava juice (amazing). the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> was particularly exceptional. such a great and innovative way to do a margarita - and it definitely tasted far better than your typical margarita.\n\nwe started off with the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>. the fresh tortillas were fantastic, but the queso itself was a bit of a let down. while it was good (and we certainly ate all of it), it didn't have a lot of flavor to it. basically, we were expecting more.\n\nwe then shared two sets of two tacos - the barbacoa and <mark>Viva China</mark>. the barbacoa were incredibly delicious! so many great flavors, and just the right amounts of juiciness and crunch. the <mark>Viva China</mark> were interesting, but were quite salty. and the two <mark>Viva China</mark> tacos actually tasted different - one meatier and saltier, and one crispier and less salty. a good and interesting flavor experience, but we probably wouldn't order them again.\n\nfor dessert we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the flan. it was unlike any flan we have experienced before. it was served with ice cream and these awesome seared-like pineapple squares. all the flavors together (flan, ice cream, and pineapple) were absolutely incredible! and it was all even better when paired with the guava mexican mimosa. one of the best desserts we've had in a long time.\n\nit was a little pricey (especially $6 for a bottle of coke), but everything we had was delicious (so it was worth it). and the service was exceptional. our server was very attentive and knew the menu well. one of the better service experiences we've had in awhile. and the space and decor is neat. overall, great casual dining experience.", 
            "like a 4.47 rounded all the way up because the lakers are on a 4-game winning streak. \n\ni came to china poblano during its opening week. a couple feet ahead of me, at the front of the restaurant, was big papi himself: jose andres. wearing baby blue, tweeting from his blackberry, eating what looked like every single dish on the menu, teaching his three daughters (who were sitting in descending order by height) how to use chopsticks - how cute.     \n\nanyway, the food. the bottom-line for me at any restaurant is the final product. the flavors, the textures, the temperature contrasts, all the good shit, working in unison to evoke memories or tell new stories. value, ambiance, service - that stuff's nice, too - but i'm not going to knock off stars from any restaurant if the waitress didn't fill my cup of coffee six times, or if i couldn't understand the gibberish coming out of the filipino waitress' mouth. notably, the ambiance and service at this restaurant were super-chill (like, 5/5 chill). \n\nhaving said that, the food here was generally very good, too. (we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the guacamole, fried potatoes with xo, chicken mole tacos, the lemon-tree shrimp, and some other stuff i can't remember right now. the ocean nest was fine, too.) the dessert menu didn't excite me, but the drinks made up for it (<mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> and the sal de gusano margarita). also, jose was gangster enough to get out of his seat (during his meal!) to make sure i had a good time. check it out.", 
            "ate at china poblano when i was in vegas last week and hadn't looked at any yelp reviews prior. i'm surprised to find it only has 3 stars on here. i thought it was amazing. most importanly, it was priced appropriately, unlike so many places in vegas.\n\nsome notes:\n\n-the atmosphere was fun (decor is amazing!)\n-service was great\n-food was creative and delicious\n-a few dishes were a miss (a noodle soup with the word \"ugly\" in the name), but most were spot on. \n-mexican food was slightly better than the chinese, but that makes sense given jose's backgound. \n-the salt-<mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> are genius.", 
            "picky eaters do not apply. to enjoy this place, you have to be an adventurous eater.  if you just get chips, <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, or a pork bun, you will not be happy.  \n\nfor foodies who won't turn their nose up at a beef tendon taco, this is the place for you!  super creative food and a great bargain for what you get.  \n\nwe started out with the pozole rojo ($9) which is a spicy shredded pork soup with chickpeas, cabbage, pork rinds, chopped onions, radish, and avocado.  this was a really good portion size for $9 and so tasty.  you can get it with a shot of tequila for an extra $3 but our server didn't recommend it unless we just wanted to do a tequila shot. apparently the tequila is offered for hangovers.  hair of the dog, you know.\n\nnext we tried the <mark>Viva China</mark> taco ($5.50 each) which has beef tendon, a kumamoto oyster, and sichuan sauce.  yes, beef tendon in a taco.  this was extremely tasty.  i could eat ten of these.\n\nwe also tried the cochinita taco ($4.50 each).  it's pretty much pork and pickled onions.  pretty good, but the carnitas taco topped with pork rinds is so much better.\n\nanother great dish was the papas with <mark>XO Sauce</mark> ($6).  french fries covered in a dried scallop sauce.  they serve it with lime, which you think would be awful.  but it's actually really, really good!\n\nthe big surprise of the night was the gaspacho morelia ($10).  this is a huge plate of very fresh, very tasty fruit covered in freshly squeezed orange juice.  some of the fruit had some spicy seasoning on it, which enhanced the flavor of the fruit.  pineapple, watermelon, mango, jicama, dragonfruit, strawberries, and queso fresca. very good and light.\n\nthe cocktails are also very inventive.  i don't think i can ever have a normal margarita again after having the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> ($12) served here.  the salt foam is a perfect compliment to the margarita and doesn't have the harsh taste of salt on the rim.  my husband had the <mark>Lychee Sour</mark> ($12) which was also very good.  \n\n$63 before tip and we were very, very full.  service was impeccable and very friendly.  just focus on the more creative dishes.  yeah, you can get a pork bun in chinatown for cheaper.  of course you can get a carne asada taco at a taco truck for cheaper.  come here for the creative dishes that you can't get anywhere else.", 
            "i really enjoyed our dining experience here. if i could live on a diet of  just <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>, i would.  what a delightful concoction! we went for more of a mexican feast than chinese, so here is the breakdown.\n\nthe tacos: \n<mark>Pancita al Pastor</mark> (slow-cooked pork belly/ pineapple) - great play on flavors. the pork belly had good crispness to it and complemented the pineapple. \n\n<mark>Viva China</mark>* (soft beef tendon/ kumamoto oyster/scallions/ sichuan peppercorn sauce) - my husband's favorite. great fusion taco. the tendon was cooked just right. \n\nsilencio (duck tongue/ fresh lychee) - neither of us had tried duck tongue before, so we had to try it. fantastic! the sauce had a bit of spice to it that really made work. \n\n<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> (oaxacan-style barbeque beef/guajillo chile/ pickled cactus paddle) - the was a big taco filled with flavorful barbacoa and nopales. i'm not sure if it was worth the price, but it was tasty. \n\ncarnitas (braised baby pig/pork rinds/ spicy salsa verde cruda) - this was the favorite of the night. the carnitas were perfect, but the addition of the pork rinds really made this taco off the chain! we could have eaten 10 of these. \n\nthe rest:\nhuitlacoche noodles (wild mushrooms/ fresh mexican corn truffle/ knife-shaved noodles) - the huitlacoche actually worked well in this dish. i wasn't sure going in, but felt adventurous. the noodles were cooked perfectly. this is a dish that is big enough to share. this dish was surprisingly spicy, so beware. \n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> (melted chihuahua cheese/tequila blanco/fresh tortillas...with chorizo) - tasty! maybe a bit expensive. it reminded me of being with family in mexico and eating fresh tortillas off of the comal with cheese. \n\nmango sticky rice - the was actually a cream of sweet rice on top of mango shave ice topped with crispy rice (think rice krispies) and fresh mango. very refreshing! \n\nour server was attentive and the manager even came by the see if we were satisfied. overall, we had a pleasant dining experience.", 
            "would be a 4 star, but way over priced.\n\notherwise, we've been here a few times, and they have good food and drinks. we really liked the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>, <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>, barbacoa tacos, and definitely delicious guacamole and chips (ask for chips instead of tortillas).",

            "no way jose! loved the teeny $12 <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> (really did) and was digging the camarones with black garlic but truth be told, i can get real street tacos and authentic chinese food which is much better and about 1/4 of the price.",

            "let's start with the good stuff about china poblano:\n\n- super cute and trendy decor, we had such a great time noticing the small details around us as we waited on food.  it almost feels like dining in an eclectic art gallery, fun.\n\n- the service was pretty solid, not rushed nor too pushy -- but very attentive with water glasses filled at all times, friendly rapport and helpful suggestions.\n\n- the drinks were interesting.  not strong or obsess about the cocktail menu until you return amazing, but definitely stood out above most of the rest of our vegas beverages.  in particular, the <mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark>  had a unique flavor (not as spicy as we'd like it, but that's not unusual as we're freaky about our spiciness) -- and the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> was an experience.\n\nbut now for the food....\n\nit was just 'meh'.  probably lower than meh... 'eh'?  \n\ni love fusion cuisine and small plate dining as much as the next food geek, but for the price and build up everything really fell short.  the chips and tortillas tasted store bought (or crappily made, if actually done in-house), the ceviche tasted borderline 'off', even the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> was barely mediocre (who knew you could mess that up).  \n\nfor the price and the buzz we heard, it was a total let down.  a great meal and a couple of nice dinner drinks are priceless in our household.  but this particular dinner for two set us back around $160 and was instantly regretted.  we stopped elsewhere to grab a (much tastier and filling) bite before heading back to the room for the night.  \n\nmy advice:  grab a drink and enjoy the vibe, then move on for dinner.", 
            "love the decor. great service with friendly attentive staff. the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> are incredible. lobster tacos and the twenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> are perfect for a light lunch and leave plenty of room for the amazing mango sticky rice. wonderful fun restaurant.",

(having gone to school in dc, i'm familiar with jose andres and his great food.)\n\nmy friends' flight landed a while after mine, so i dined solo at the bar. the service was excellent, especially considering it was 8:30 on a saturday night. \n\nthe food was outstanding and came quickly (but without any sort of rush). i had the arrachera con salsa molcajete - absolutely delicious - with a side of their freshly-made tortillas (to make my own fajitas, awesome suggestion by the server). also had a sea <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>, very foamy but tasty enough.\n\ni really enjoyed everything about this place...except the value for the money, which is why i'm leaving off a star. these are small plates meant to be shared, so your receipt can very easily tally up quickly.", 
            "i'm sad to see that this place isn't rated higher!  my husband and i eat here every time we go to vegas, sometimes more than once.  we love it!\n\nour favorites:\n\n<mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> (actually, they have lots of great cocktails!)\n<mark>Golden Pigs</mark> \n20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>\n\ngo!  you won't be disappointed!  \n\natmosphere is casual, service is friendly and prices are reasonable (for vegas).",

            "on our recent trip to vegas i researched different restaurants to try - turns out that dos caminos and isla have closed. we knew we'd be in the cosmo for the secret pizza (that's another review) and i wanted to try china poblano after reading the menu on the cosmo website. what i didn't do is check the yelp! reviews, and i'm glad i didn't. what we experienced was so far different from most reviews that i've just read!\nok look - when you're on vacation, you tend to spend money. $15 drinks are the going price at upscale hotels. and the \"<mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>\" (i just had to try one) was worth every cent!  i have no idea how they do it - the salt cloud that floats on the surface of the drink stays there as you drink, so with every sip you get a piece of salt heaven. \nthe wait staff were friendly and efficient. the manager, i\\u00f1igo, even stopped by to chat with k'ayum (age 8) and watched him do his latest magic trick.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> with chorizo. it came with fresh-made tortillas and was excellent. adriana got a carnitas taco and she was thrilled with the chicharr\\u00f3n topping. i had a fish taco which was fantastic, and k'ayum had some noodles which he devoured (and he's a picky eater!). \nthe drinks were what really got me excited. after the \"<mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>\" i had another specialty called a \"mexican gin and tonic.\" it's made with cilantro, elderflower liqueur, and i don't know what else, but it worked. for dessert i had a tequila flight that came with house-made sangrita that was sublime!  i wish i had a bottle of their sangrita for sipping tequila here at home!\nanyway, it's a week later and we're still talking about our experience. we loved the decor, the ambiance, the service, the food, and the drinks. we'll be back!", 
            "had an amazing lunch here.  first off the decor is really neat.  you can sit at tables or one of two bars.  we sat at one of the bars and were able to watch the ladies make the dim sum.  our waiter was really nice and helpful, he walked us through the menu, explaining that the food was not fusion, it was just both mexican and chinese.  i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>.  i am very picky about margaritas and i must say that this was the best one i have ever had.  the salt foam was fantastic.  ok, so yes, the food is expensive but it is delicious, and its from a celebrity chef at a las vegas restaurant so what do you expect.  i still think it is worth the high price.  my husband and i each or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a taco and shared two appetizers.  this was a perfect amount of food.  we each loved our tacos, i had the <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> which was awesome, kinda like a gourmet breakfast burrito.  my husband had the silencio, which was a duck tongue taco, he said it was great and the tongues had perfect texture.  we shared the <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> dim sum which was a good steamed pork bun.  we also had the chilaquiles, it was great and even better since we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a side of habanero salsa, it was super spicy and awesome.  i would eat here again for sure!", 
            "it was 10:30pm and we needed to eat asap.  we really wanted to eat at wicked spoon but sadly, we got there at 10:03 and they close at 10pm.  so we walked around for 20 minutes through the cosmopolitan trying to find anything that sounded good.  we found this place and it looked and sounded decent enough.  and who doesn't like a place where you can order both asian and mexican?\n\nafter a short wait, we were seated and it seemed to take awhile to see our waiter and then get our orders in.  in the meantime, i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>.  it was super tasty but for $14, it was kind of teeny.  especially when it seems the foam takes up 1/3 of the glass.  but it was a really superb margarita.\n\nmy friend or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the fried buns with the condensed milk glaze.  i wasn't sure about them but they were actually kind of amazing.  i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the chicken poblano taco and the lobster taco.  the poblano taco was really good.  i should've just or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> two or three of those and been done but the lobster taco sounded so enticing.  um, not so much.  it wasn't great and at $10, it was highway robbery.  all the other reviews are right.  these tacos are all crazy overpriced and they're tiny.\n\nwe ended with the sticky rice and mango dessert.  not at all what i imagined but we still ate every last bite.\n\nthis place isn't bad, it was just a let-down.  i had high hopes looking at the menu and was a bit underwhelmed by the food and overwhelmed by the prices.  i wouldn't say not to eat here, just know what to expect.", 
            "i absolutely love the concept at china poblano -- chinese and mexican food served side by side, with no fusion -- but i was also apprehensive about the middling reviews.\n\ni'm glad i swept my apprehension under the rug because my lunch here was wonderful!\n\nlocated on the second floor of the cosmopolitan hotel, china poblano is bright and inviting, with lots of color and neon and bold decorative touches.  (i dig the giant walk-through buddha in lieu of a door.)  it's one of chef jose andres' casual joints, in contrast to the fancier jaleo and \\u00e9 upstairs.  the place fills up fast at lunchtime, but i was lucky enough to score a seat at the bar without waiting at around 11:30am on a saturday.\n\nthe menu is divided into chinese and mexican small plates.  everything is served tapas-style.  nothing is particularly authentic, but what do you expect in a las vegas hotel-casino?\n\ni started with one of the specials of the day -- elote and squash blossoms.  loved the flavors and textures, especially the crunchy bits of elote sprinkled throughout.  everything was very fresh, light, and enjoyable.\n\nnext, i had the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> (wheat noodles with spicy pork sauce and peanuts).  this was a good complement to the elote, because its profile of flavors and textures was the diametric opposite.  the noodles were rich and heavy -- probably too heavy for most people.  the spicy pork sauce was almost like thick clay in consistency.  i didn't mind, but i'm also not sure if that was intentional or not.\n\ni washed my lunch down with china poblano's specialty beverage of the house -- the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> (spiked with pomegranate).  this was a unique take on a classic cocktail, with a salty foam on top in lieu of the traditional salt rim.  very refreshing.\n\nbar service is very upbeat and friendly -- and so are the other patrons!  everyone eating here seems to be coming or going in an alcohol-induced haze, so expect revelry.\n\nprices are definitely high.  i'm still smarting over that $14 margarita.  \n\nthat said, i'd go back.  the menu is just too tempting to resist!", 
            "i had visited china poblano a few years ago on a visit to vegas and had such fond memories i had to go back. i love all of jose andres' dc restaurants so naturally i had to visit one of this vegas restaurants. \n\nthere was no wait for a party of one to get seated at the bar (30-45 minute wait for parties of 2-4). sitting at the bar is the way to go if you are dining alone! the bartender was very attentive, he quickly took my drink order and made suggestions for my food order. i personally love the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> (i opted for pomegranate, yum!). the foamy salt never mixes with your margarita so you just get a lovely taste of salt with every sip, less salty than big chunks of salt on the rim of the glass in my opinion.\n\nthe bartender said the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> was one of their most popular dishes and that the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> was a personal favorite so i went with those 2 items for dinner. i really enjoyed the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark>, the noodles were the perfect texture and it wasn't too spicy for a spice wimp like me. the serving size is a little small so you may want an appetizer to go with it. the seasoning on the shrimp was really delicious, though a little on the salty side. \n\ni'll definitely be back, hopefully i won't be traveling alone next time because there are so many dishes that would be great for sharing!", 
            "i loved the more casual atmosphere at this location and the fact that it's tucked into the cosmo so you don't have a huge crowd coming in off the strip. the '<mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>' were strong and tasty. they may look small, but they're powerful. it was hard to choose from the menu because so much sounded wonderful. ended up with <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark>, the habonaro salsa (major heat), chicken flautas, and a lunch special that was pretty much equivalent to a ham quesadilla. all so tasty! i didn't think we'd have time for dessert, but the sticky rice sans rice was calling to me.. awesome way to end a meal- light, sweet, full of flavor. the fresh mango adds just enough sweetness to the dish. i could have eaten here everyday!", 
            "one of my favorite spots for lunch in vegas! i love the atmosphere. it's festive and fun without being loud and obnoxious. their <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> are absolutely to die for, and my friend has been re-creating them perfectly for at least a year. it takes some work to make the \"air,\" but it's totally worth it! one of my favorite drinks anywhere.\n\nthe concept of mexican-asian fusion seemed a little bizarre to me at first, but there is plenty of separation on the menu if you are not an adventurous eaters. it's fun to mix and match mexican and asian small plates and go between.\n\ni have been here 3 or 4 times, and have tried a variety of dishes. almost every dish is a small plate or appetizer, and my friends and i always get a variety of options to share. the guacamole is outstanding, and there are plenty of gluten free options (including the chips), which pleased my gluten free friends. <mark>When Pigs Fly</mark> is one of my favorite appetizers. the steamed buns are super filling, but delicious.\n\ni would recommend trying at least one of the sui mai options, and if you are indecisive, try the combination! the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> noodles are delicious, but definitely on the heavy side. the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> is also a go-to, especially if you are feeling the need to eat more vegetables during your time in vegas!\n\nthis is a perfect spot to try with friends and explore different menu items, including the must-have <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>.", 
            "i'm really surprised this place has only three stars. the boy and i came here on our last night in vegas and it was easily the best meal we'd had all weekend. since i imagine a lot of vacationers are frequenting this spot, i'll break down what we had:\n\nsalt and <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>: probably the best margarita i've ever had\n\ntaro chips: unbelievable. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> these for our ceviche, but i was gobbling them up on their own. insanely crisp and delicious.\n\n<mark>Tuna Ceviche</mark>: delicious. and quite a large portion for the price. the only complaint i might have is that by the bottom of the bowl, the tuna was completely overpowered by the dregs of citrus juice, but to be fair we ate this quite slowly interspersed with other dishes. might've had more time than normal for the tuna to get over marinated.\n\nsiu mai w/ <mark>Quail Egg</mark>: the best dish of the night, and easily the best siu mai i've ever had. and trust me, i live in queens in nyc, i know my asian food. the meat was soft, insanely flavorful, and the eggs just bursts with a creamy eggy-ness in your mouth.\n\npork buns (<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>): disappointing. i wouldn't be able to tell the difference between these and any old pork bun i come across. not necessarily bad, but not great.\n\nduck tongue taco (silencio): i am a fan of trying absolutely anything and everything, but this was just downright weird. i commend them for getting the tongue that soft, but the flavor wasn't appealing. \n\nbeef tendon taco (<mark>Viva China</mark>): outstanding. the beef tendon is crispy and packs an amazing amount of flavor. the sauce is delicious. \n\ncarnitas taco: my absolute favorite. i've never had such good meat in a carnitas taco. \n\ntwenty vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>: this one was interesting. first of all, i should mention that my boyfriend can't stand onions, so i sadly had to get this sans any kind of onions or scallions. i bet that would really add to the flavor. however, even without onions, this dish got a hold of me. at first i thought \"meh, it's <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>,\" but with each subsequent bite, i began to realize, \"wait, this is the best <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> i've ever had.\" every bite had a new vegetable. and the boy literally licked the bowl clean. \n\nchocolate teracotta warrior: really, we got this because we wanted our special dinner to end with some kind of dessert. the presentation is stunning, and the ginger ice cream mixed with the chocolate crumbles is delicious, but i could've done without this one. i have a feeling their other desserts are probably better.\n\nthe service throughout the meal was great, our waiter was very attentive and helpful in giving us tips on what we might want to order. and the vibe of the place was very nice. casual, but upscale. and not crowded. i would definitely come here again.",

            "i want to live off the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>. it's delicious and not to be missed. all chicagoans are extremely spoiled with great mexican food so the tacos here were not my favorite, however, the steamed buns and guac were delicious. our server terry was also worth a 5 star rating. las vegas houses some of the best service in the country and most are all-stars but he really made us love our time there. i would definitely recommend this place if you need somewhere quick to stop before grabbing a later dinner or show in or near the cosmo.", 
            "third time eating here as the tacos are all amazing and so is the crispy lace wontons! haven't tried much else - worth the price compared to the pricier restaurants at the cosmopolitan i have also been to. <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> are great but have some drinks before you get here- they're 14 bucks each and are small!",

            "this place deserves more than the 3 stars it currently has at the time of this writing. i had both the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> and the singapore sling. i don't normally like salted rims on my margaritas because i don't like the texture, but this salted foam was a nice, innovative way to infuse that flavor without the crunchiness. perfect balance of sweet and citrus with enough punch. the singapore sling was also really well done, i could drink those all day. the lengua taco was small, but very soft and juicy.",

            "we'd always been curious to try this place since we're regular cosmopolitan guests.  suffice it to say our first visit to china poblano will be our last.  unfortunately we didn't read the yelp reviews before going there. when the average is 3 stars, and people seem to say the guacamole is the best thing about the place, it should be avoided.  \n\nall we had were two <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>, which our server told us were 'amazing' house specialties.  they were different for sure, but not amazing. ours arrived in small glasses with nearly half of it covered in a salty foam.  some may view this as culinary genius, while others may view it as a way to get away from using alcohol.  it tasted like lime and salt and that was it.  they were gone in three small sips ... no joking.  all that was left was foam.i seriously wonder if there was any alcohol in it at all, and they came to over $30 with tax!  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the margaritas right off the bat (big mistake... i know), and the server said, \"i'll be back with your drinks and then i can explain our menu to you.\"  it was a little weird that a place has to explain the menu, but china poblano does, apparently.\n\nhe said the <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> was featured on a food network show, and then added some tidbits of info about certain dishes.  nothing seemed all that great, and we looked around and observed other guests who were either confused or unhappy.  it's not so much a fusion menu as a confusion menu.  and guacamole for $15?  seriously?  the waiter tried way too hard to sell the menu, and it was a complete turn-off.  \n\nthe cosmo has some nice restaurants.  this isn't one of them.", 
            "i have been here a couple times with work colleagues and have always had good meals.  i was there recently again and we shared a variety of dishes.  they had a special noodle dish the night we were there.  it was one long continuous noodle with pork belly and veggies.  it was very tasty.  we also had tuna tartar, mongolian beef, chicken lettuce wraps, <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, some tacos.  probably a few other things.  everything was very tasty - nothing too spicy but definitely flavorful.  the guys had the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> and loved those.  this is definitely a great place to go to share food and try lots of yummy things.  i definitely will be back.",

            "this is my 2nd time coming to this restaurant and we really enjoyed it. we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Chef's Experience</mark> tasting menu for a party of 5. they allowed one person in our party to order individually due to dietary restrictions. the tasting menu is $55 and well worth it. a well paced meal starting with the gold fleck dumplings. the 2nd course was a guacamole stuffed jicama cup. the hearts of palm salad was spicy and tasty. i honestly can't remember everything but we had duck in steamed bun taco wrapper, noodles, veggie rice, carnitas tacos,shrimp, pork stuffed wontons with sesame paste, buns with a codensed milk dipping sauce, and we ended with churros and a mango rice pudding. excellent value and delicious. i highly suggest the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark>. it was my favorite off the <mark>Margarita Bandera Flight</mark>. service was average and a noisy stimulating environment. i would suggest this place to anyone with a mildly adventurous food palette .", 
            "i truly have no idea how anyone could rate this place low. different strokes i guess. \n\nbut, let me tell you the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> is a world class dish. light, full of flavor, creative and perfectly cooked. the guac is perfect and balanced. chips were good and the lamb potstickers were so wild and crazy, you must try them to see.\n\nif nothing else you try from this mad wonderful scientist jose andres, give the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> a whirl. so new and fantastic. \n\nservice was intelligent and right on. she knew her menu and was on it to recommend all the good stuff.\n\nno cheap, but worth it to have my mouth happy for an hour! \n\ni'll be back to try all of his spots."

            "not crazy about the seating arrangements.  it is the unfortunate long wall bench seat with several small tables in front and small ottoman types seats on the opposite side of the table.  the decor is nice to look at the wall is covered kabuki masks and oaxaca animals.  we started with a taco each my friend had the pollo con mole poblano and i had the <mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark>.  we both like them very much.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> to share.  it was smoking and very well executed. we also or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> which sounds either odd or no big deal.  it was my favorite dish i would go back just to order that.  my friend said he would go back just to have the <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> again.  now for the drinks, we both or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the <mark>Margarita Bandera Flight</mark> which had three minis consisting of the salt air, a pomegranate salt air, and the blood orange chili.  i like the blood orange chili the best since it has the balance with citrus  and heat.  the salt air is basically a salt foam on top.  which makes the drink too salty.  but the pomegranate version is very good.  i would recommend giving it try especially since the dishes are served family styled and meant to be shared.", 
            "so when i heard chinese mexican fusion i expected something different than what it was. however, i wasn't disappointed when i saw the menu. it's broken up into mexican style dishes and chinese style dishes. our server said it was similar to a \"tapas\" place with small plates that were meant to be shared, or to order two plates per person for a full meal. i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the mexican asparagus and the chinese dancing eggplant. the asparagus was amazing and i devou<mark>Ichtegem's Flemish Red Ale</mark> of it. honestly would have been okay with just that because it was a pretty decent portion. the eggplant wasn't really what i expected. it's covered in a soy sauce glaze and these fish flakes (i forget the actual name, but they smell and taste really fishy). the eggplant was not the texture i expected. was hoping for something i would have to chew rather than something that just slid down my throat. the taste was okay but i couldn't do the slimy-ish texture. we had them bring <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> for the table and both were really good. i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the classic margarita and was not disappointed. if i ever make it back i really want to try the <mark>Margarita Bandera Flight</mark>, as a friend did and said it was amazing. our server was great, answe<mark>Ichtegem's Flemish Red Ale</mark> of our questions and ma<mark>Ceviche de Peje Sol</mark> great recommendations around the table that were raved about. he had no trouble dealing with the 14 rambunctious girls there for a bachelorette party and all of our food came out fairly quickly!\n\nmy gripe with this place is that even though it seems like there are a lot of choices, i had a tough time finding something to order other than my asparagus (which i was really excited about). i wish i would have or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> the tacos because they looked really good. a friend had the dan dan and said it was pretty spicy, but lost or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> off the mexican portion of the menu.",

            "dang. the vegas crowd is harsh - or at least very conservative with their stars.  came here over the weekend with a bachelorette party and i think everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food and drinks.\n\nbetween me and two other girls, we split: <mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> (fries with rich mole sauce), <mark>Open Sesame</mark> (chilled noodle salad), <mark>Beijing Glass</mark> (cellophane noodles in soup), tuna cevhiche (veeeerrrrry interesting crunch), and dan dan mien (noodles with a spicy kick).\n\ni had a mexican mimosa and other people in the group had the <mark>Lychee Sour</mark> cocktail and <mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark>.\n\nseriously no complaints about the food except that the portions are tiny.  however, considering how many dishes we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> for three girls (we eventually cancelled our order for 20 vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>), i think we did just fine.  sure, it was a little pricey, but you're in vegas and you're at the cosmopolitan.  the strip is littered with panda expresses if you want something cheap.\n\nnow that i've returned from vegas, and my coworker (who recommended china poblano to me) and i are discussing the different dishes that we've eaten here, i'm itching to go back.", 
            "let's start with the good stuff about china poblano:\n\n- super cute and trendy decor, we had such a great time noticing the small details around us as we waited on food.  it almost feels like dining in an eclectic art gallery, fun.\n\n- the service was pretty solid, not rushed nor too pushy -- but very attentive with water glasses filled at all times, friendly rapport and helpful suggestions.\n\n- the drinks were interesting.  not strong or obsess about the cocktail menu until you return amazing, but definitely stood out above most of the rest of our vegas beverages.  in particular, the <mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark>  had a unique flavor (not as spicy as we'd like it, but that's not unusual as we're freaky about our spiciness) -- and the <mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> was an experience.\n\nbut now for the food....\n\nit was just 'meh'.  probably lower than meh... 'eh'?  \n\ni love fusion cuisine and small plate dining as much as the next food geek, but for the price and build up everything really fell short.  the chips and tortillas tasted store bought (or crappily made, if actually done in-house), the ceviche tasted borderline 'off', even the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> was barely mediocre (who knew you could mess that up).  \n\nfor the price and the buzz we heard, it was a total let down.  a great meal and a couple of nice dinner drinks are priceless in our household.  but this particular dinner for two set us back around $160 and was instantly regretted.  we stopped elsewhere to grab a (much tastier and filling) bite before heading back to the room for the night.  \n\nmy advice:  grab a drink and enjoy the vibe, then move on for dinner.", 
            "i have been wanting to come here for two years... seriously, that long!  every time i head out to las vegas i try and make a point to dine but it just never worked out... that is until this week, when my boyfriend and i made it to lunch.  finally!\n\nstarted off with cocktails (<mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark>), and i was impressed.  it was really well-balanced and not too sweet.  we had the guacamole, which was very good.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> it \"medium\" but i think it could have used a little more kick.  the chips were fresh and completely addictive, and the salsa was really delicious- excellent smoky flavor.  we each or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a taco (carnitas and pescado frito).  serving size is small but we were going for a \"light lunch\" so it worked out.  my boyfriend liked the carnitas taco so much he or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> another.  it was really a decent amount of food when you consider the large, molcajete-like bowl of guacamole too.\n\nall in all, it was pretty good!  it's hard to \"wow\" in las vegas because there are so many great restaurant choices.  the ambiance and decor are really neat and lend to the overall feel of the place.  we had great service and enjoyed the food a lot, but i definitely think it's more of a lunch spot.", 
            "good if you want to try something with a unique taste, the <mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark> was yummy but overpriced. basically, the food was fine but definitely not worth the price. $20 for a small bowl of <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark>?!? it was good but not twenty dollars good. i wouldn't come back here simply because of the prices:", 
            "there's no mexican-asian fusion going on in this restaurant, except that the 2 menus and decor are intertwined. it's almost like someone could not decide if they wanted to open a mexican restaurant or chinese restaurant, so they decide to open both in the same space, with separate kitchens. i love both mexican food and chinese food, but this is neither here nor there. two cuisines that are normally best in a hole-in-the wall spot, and inexpensive - this is just the opposite: overpriced and mediocre.\n\nwe or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> everything family style and tried to get a good mix of both mexican & chinese food:\n\n<mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark> ($15) - i liked this margarita a lot. i don't care for the taste of tequila, and the blood orange seemed to mask this well. it had a spicy kick to it, but not so spicy that it was undrinkable.\n\nguacamole & chips ($15) - handmade, and delicious, but the price is about double what i would expect to pay for fresh guacamole. chips were light, crispy and fresh.\n\ntacos (about $5 each) - i'm used to dollar tacos (maybe $2) at a taco truck. i got the <mark>Tinga Poblana</mark> and it was good, but unless i'm expensing my meal to work, i would pass on this - much too expensive for tacos.\n\n<mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> ($12.88) - 6 pieces - this was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. the lamb inside was tasty and i liked the crispy lace (sweet onions) design on the dish. would recommend this.\n\nsui mai ($13.88) - 6 pieces - the only cool thing about this were the gold flakes on top. the rest was just okay, and tasted heavy on the ginger. at a normal dim sum restaurant, you can get 4 sui mai's for $4 that taste better.\n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> ($12) - wheat noodles and spicy pork sauce - this was definitely spicy, nothing that blew me away though. at least the price was reasonable for the portion-size.\n\ncol de bruselas ($12) - these are on the acidic side - tasted really limey. i wouldn't get this again.\n\n<mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark> ($18) - 8 pieces of shrimp = $2.25 per piece of shrimp. sauce was good, not too spicy, this was one of the better dishes we had.\n\nbistec con mole amarillo y hongos ($20) - grilled hanger steak with mole - there were about 6 sliced pieces of steak - again, with the small portions. it was one of the better tasting dishes we had, but expensive.\n\nall in all, it's an interesting concept and i was there for work so i was able to expense my meal. with tip and tax, it was $60 per person - quite honestly, i would rather eat at a mexican food truck or a hole-in-the-wall chinese place for 1/4 of the price and more authentic food. with so many other options in vegas, i'll be going elsewhere.", 
            "if you read my review of jaleo, you will find that i love, love, love jose andres and everthing he touches. china poblano is one of my go-to restaurants every time my mom comes into town and asks me where i want to eat (i mean, it is pricy, so i only get to go on my mom's dime ;) ) everything is so delicious, the service is always on point, and both are consistent. \n\nyes, it is expensive (their menu is online available through the cosmopolitan website with all prices clearly listed). yes, the portions are small. yes, it is really more chinese food + mexican food than it is fusion (the food comes from two separate kitchens, after all). \n\nwe always try to order the more rare / odd items .. can't seem to bring myself to pay $14 for a tiny order of siu mai that would probably be better at a dirty hole in the wall dim sum restaurant (sidenote: can anyone recommend a good dim sum restaurant nearby?)\n\n--\nfavorite items:\nguacamole with <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> - $15. handmade at the table, deliciously chunky. bypass if trying to save money, get it if you're splurging\n\n<mark>Viva China</mark> taco - $5.50. rich, chewy, juicy, salty, gooey. bypass if you do not like foods with \"weird\" textures. \n\n<mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> - $12.88. pretty, deliciously crispy on the outside and moist, tender lamb on the inside. must have\n\n<mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> - $12.88. love the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the sauce. could be spicier. have never had authentic dan dan noodles, so i could not tell you if these are authentic or not, but delicious nonetheless. must have. \n\n<mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> - $11.88. this is the biggest portion of hot and sour soup i've ever seen in my life. definitely meant for at least 4 people. not a traditional hot and sour soup. is pretty thick. very good. \n\ndiscontinued items?:\nthey had this chile-relleno type item once with pomegranate seeds on it. it did not look appetizing but was delicious. it looks like a frog with red warts on it. i no longer see it on the menu so it may have been a special, but if you see it, i recommend it!\n\nthey also used to have scallop ceviche - super untraditional and really expensive for what you are getting, but really fun. tiny little lime with a slice of raw scallop and some brown sugar in between. sprayed with tequila. you are meant to pop the scallop in your mouth and bite into the lime in one fell swoop. i no longer see it on the menu, though. \n--\ndrinks:\n<mark>Salt Air Margarita</mark> - $14. what fun! yummy, boozy fun. \n<mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark> - $15 / glass. yummy, but be careful, it's pretty spicy! \n--\n\nnot such a fan of:\nthey always push the 20-vegetable <mark>Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice</mark> because johnny iuzzini said it was his favorite dish on the show \"best thing i ever ate.\" i find it bland, boring, and wayyyyy overpriced.\n\ndancing eggplant - really pretty! i don't really like eggplant in general, though. \n--\n\ncons about the restaurant itself:\nthe restaurant is literally right outside of marquee. at lunch in the summer, it's overrun by trashy girls in swimsuits without coverups and douchey bros trying to get into the dayclub. at dinner time, it's overrun by girls in skimpy dresses wobbling in their heels and douchey bros with popped collars trying to get into the nightclub. luckily, if you have a reservation, you never have to wait for long, and sometimes they will have you wait inside on the steps rather than out in the throng. \n\nthe chairs in the middle of the restaurant have no backs. i'm a sloucher anyway, but sometimes after a big meal you want to lean back and pat your belly, but if you try to do that you will just topple over. there are no purse hooks under the table, and since the chairs don't have backs, you either have to hold your bag in your lap or, if you are lucky enough to be a group with an odd number of people, on the spare seat.", 
            "chinese food, mexican food, and jose andres. three of my favorite things in the entire world. combine them all together and it creates this harmonious bliss of magnificent food and dining.\n\ni am so sad that we only came here for lunch so i only was able to sample a few items. thankfully, vegas is only 5 hours away from san diego and i will be sure to  eat at china poblano the next time i visit!\n\nfirstly, i just love the ambiance of jose andres' restaurants. they are worldly, fun and adult at the same time. between courses i was entertained by watching the pictures on the wall change from chinese and south american peasants to mao zedung.\n\nthe margaritas we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> were spectacular. while i was tempted to order the margarita with the salt air (to brag about the pretentious \"salt air\" lol) i went with the <mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark>. it was balanced, but super strong. one was enough to start my vegas party blood pumping!\n\nmy friends and i or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a variety of tacos, which were all fantastic. i am a sucker for carnitas. while i have no shortage of those tacos in san diego, none of them are topped with chicarrones like the ones at china poblano! it added the perfect crunch to the perfectly cooked and tender pork. the carnitas weren't overly salty as they can be at other restaurants.\n\nwe split the dan dan noodles that came with black vinegar (oh black vinegar, how i love thee) and were so delicious. the guacamole was rich and flavorful. i love that it was served with tortillas and not just chips. \n\nmy favorite dish was the siu mai with <mark>Quail Egg</mark>. i have grown up eating siu mai - it is among my top favorite dim sum dishes...holy crap china poblano's siu mai was amazing! the <mark>Quail Egg</mark> on top was so perfect (see my picture). the yolk was runny and gave the already delectable siu mai flavors an extra kick. \n\nchina poblano, i will be back!", 
            "i must have amnesia because i really don't know why i keep coming back here. my first time was when it first opened a few years ago, and i believe i have a review for \"the worst thing i've ever eaten\" see: beef tendon taco w/ bad oyster. about a year and a half ago i went back, and was again taken aback by the incredibly mediocre food and astronomical prices. \n\na few weeks ago a friend and i were prowling the town, looking for a fun spot to grab a bite before we headed to drais for chromeo (woo!), and she'd never been, and again, i guess i blacked out momentarily from hunger, because i was like \"okay! let's go here!\". wrong. it was empty per usual... even though it was 9pm on a friday night. we each or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a <mark>Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita</mark> at $15 a pop, and they didn't even have the courtesy to fill them to top of the glass. we split the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, and there was nothing fun about it. it was a glop of starchy melted cheese. a 5 year old could make it by literally putting a block of monterey jack in the microwave. a very expensive block of $10 cheese. \n\ni had the special, a pork belly taco w/ pineapple at $4 which was nothing special at all, and the <mark>Dan Dan Mian</mark> noodles for $13 which were spicy, excessively sweet, and quite glue-y. she had a bowl of noodles as well, and somehow our bill came to almost $100 w/ tip. what. \n\njose andres- what are you doing. you are amazing, jaleo is amazing (the one in dc is 10x better), bazaar is amazing, this restaurant is a stain <mark>Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You</mark> reputation. the only pros are the service, which is always great, the manager did come over to see how things were, and we said great, because it's not her fault the food sucks. the servers are attentive as well. the first time i was there i saw mario batali eating in the back in his famous orange crocs, so i suppose that's cool. all this experience did was remind me why i avoid strip celebrity-name restaurants."

            "i've passed by this place quite a few times, but finally decided to dine in today. the service was very attentive, but i felt like they didn't go beyond what they teach you in table-waiting 101. our server asked if we were ready for drinks, entrees, then desserts and let us know her personal favorites for each course, but didn't actually describe any of them. i honestly didn't have any problems with the service though, it's the food/prices that leave me less than satisfied. \n\nguacamole ($15): although it was pretty pricey, it was probably my favorite dish of the night. there were a lot of large chunks of avocado, which is something i could never complain about and it was very fresh and flavorful. the only thing that i didn't like was that the waitress asked if we were done with it once the chips ran out, even though we still had about a third of it left. it was just kind of annoying that she was trying to take the plate away, rather than offering us more chips.\n\nlarge pot of <mark>Jasmine Downy Pearls</mark> ($8.88) - very aromatic and tasty. i would probably come here just for the tea.  \n\n<mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> ($4): i hardly touched the salsa, but i ate all the nice and crisp chips with the guacamole. definitely worth the four bucks.\n\npescado frito ($6.50): not very flavorful and not very \"fried.\" if i'm going to pay $6.50 for one taco, i expect it to be pretty damn good. \n\ndancing eggplant ($9.88) - the waitress seemed a little reluctant when we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> this. she made sure to warn us there were bonito flakes on it and the eggplant was boiled. i had the feeling she didn't like that at all. we thought it was just okay.\n\ntraditional sui mai ($13.88): i really loved the crisp water chestnuts they added in the sui mai. the edible gold flakes on each piece also gave it a unique presentation. \n\n<mark>Don't Be Jealous</mark> (hot and sour soup) $8.88: this was the most disgusting hot and sour soup i have every had. it seriously ruined my palette. the whole bowl of soup just reeked and tasted like hot red wine. i have never tasted hot and sour soup like that before. i couldn't take more than two bites of it without feeling sick because of the strong wine flavor it had. don doesn't even like hot and sour soup, but he could still taste how much worse it was than others. \n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark> ($8.88): way too salty and saucy. and for a whopping $8.88, this was definitely not worth it. \n\njericalla ($11) - have you ever had abuelita hot chocolate? it comes in a package like this: http://beautifulspitup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/abuelita-mexican-hot-chocolate1.jpg containing tablets of compressed cocoa, sugar, and cinnamon: http://beautifulspitup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cut-abuelita.jpg. well, the small amount of custard on the bottom of the cup was covered in what seemed to be ground up tablets of abuelita hot chocolate: http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v1zh1nc2vaskonusyjs5ja/l.jpg and no, that was not a good thing. i felt like ai was just munching on hot chocolate powder. i mean, the custard and sorbet alone were good, but i couldn't eat those without eating all the powder. plain and simple, it sucked. \n\noverall, i loved the presentation of all the dishes, however the flavors just didn't match. the hot and sour soup really killed it for me. the only thing i think was worth coming here for was probably the tea, but that's still not something i would drive over here for.\n\nwarning: if you look at your bank statement a day or two after coming here and the amount charged is a lot higher than what you actually paid, it's because they like to \"pre-authorize\" themselves for a 30% tip, but it goes down to whatever you actually paid them when the transaction clears. why anyone would give this place a 30% tip is beyond me...", 
            "i like jose andres, chinese food and mexican food.  put them all together you'd get something spectacular, right?  well, at least that's i hoped for.\n\nthe service at china poblano was good.  i loved the interior.  images of mao, frida kahlo, the dalai lama, etc. projected on screen on the walls - nice touch.\n\ni had the <mark>Jasmine Downy Pearls</mark> tea and it was amazing.  it was fragrant and it tasted good.  it was a neat idea that they give you a timer so you get to enjoy the perfect tea whether you like it mild, medium or strong.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> a bun of different things from the menu:\n\n<mark>Golden Pigs</mark>:\n4 fried bbq pork buns with a side of condensed milk.  dipping pork buns on condensed milk might seem pretty odd but it works.  sweet and savory just go well together.  5/5\n\n<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>:\na braised pork sandwich.  the bread tastes just like biscuits but the filling's saaaalty. if you look at the menu, you'll see \"<mark>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich</mark>\" in a box which will make you think that's their specialty.  honestly, i hated it. 1/5\n\ntacos (carnitas, langosta, <mark>Viva China</mark>, pescado frito):\nthe carnitas came with pork rinds on top but the pork in the taco was dripping in oil.  just let the oil drip off your taco and you're all set. great taco variety. 4/5\n\n<mark>When Pigs Fly</mark>:\n4 steamed bbq pork buns. yep, that's all i can say about that.  nothing special. 3/5\n\nlucky six siu mai:\n2 scallop siu mai, 2 beef siu mai and 2 traditional siu mai topped with itty bitty pieces of gold leaf. 3/5\n\n<mark><mark>Papas Fritas</mark></mark> with mole:\ni wanted fries with my sandwich.  i had to pick between mole and <mark>XO Sauce</mark>.  fries + <mark>XO Sauce</mark> just doesn't seem appetizing so i went with mole.  the mole was overpowering.  there was a scant amount of mexican cream and queso fresco.  i can usually finish an order of fries but not this one. 2/5\n\n<mark>Queso Fundido</mark> with chorizo:\nagain, nothing special. 3/5\n\nmango sticky rice:\nthis was the best thing on the menu.  instead of using sticky rice, they used puffed rice so you get that nice crunch with a nice creamy coconut sauce and semi-sweet mangoes. 5/5\n\nchocolate terra cotta warriors:\nthe name \"warriors\" is misleading because you only get one warrior made of chocolate filled with chocolate mousse on top of cookie crumbs and ginger ice cream.  it looks like something just died on my plate complete with dirt and flowers.  the presentation was just too funny but this chocoholic wasn't 100% pleased with the taste but the creativity was there. 4/5\n\ncajeta flan:\na flan made with goat's milk served with salted caramel ice cream and pineapple chunks.  the flan was mild and the salted caramel ice cream was just lovely. 4/5\n\nso why 3 stars?  for the amount and type of food you get vs. the price, not worth it.  it's like they grabbed the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> from viva zapatas, steamed bbq pork buns and siu mai from spring mountain, fish tacos from rubio's for like $3 each and decided to serve it to you for double or triple the price.  part of what makes chinese and mexican food great is that they're inexpensive."

            "ate here this past sunday night. the best i can categorize it was strange.  the atmosphere is very casual - felt more like a <mark>Cafe</mark> than a fine dining experience. long tables with backless chairs, mexican pottery and artwork on the walls. no bar to wait for your table so we went to another restaurant's bar while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. the menu is not chinese-mexican fusion it's basically half chinese and half mexican and all small servings (like tapas). our group of 4 started with guacamole which was the most expensive item on the menu. it was truly delicious and was served with homemade tortillas which brought me back to mexico in one bite.  we or<mark>Barbacoa de Res</mark> <mark>Chips and Salsa</mark> as well which were very good. on the chinese side we went with traditional sui mai, lamb pot stickers, and 2 noodle dishes. everything was good but not outrageous. plus i'm accustomed to dipping sauces with sui mai and pot stickers that are usually seasoned with garlic, ginger and a touch spicy. the sauces here seemed just to be soy sauce. we finished off with a few more mexican choices - <mark>Shrimp Mojo</mark>, scallop ceviche and barbeque beef tacos. all were very good but again not amazing. also the offerings at the bar are very limited unless you're drinking tequila which i wasn't because i had to start drinking at the bar next door so i started with sky raspberry vodka which i couldn't get at china poblano. plain vodka only here. also only chinese or mexican beer. i probably wouldn't return unless i happened to be in the cosmopolitan and was really hungry."
