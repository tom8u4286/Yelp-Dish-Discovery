            "wow i was pretty impressed with this place and i've done my share of dining in vegas. the decor was modern and in the middle had this treehouse area where there are more tables. that night, they happened to have the treehouse rented out so there was live music playing which got a bit annoying since it was loud. that was my main complaint. \n\non to the food. we started with the seafood tower and i wasn't even hungry going into this dinner but i gobbled everything up. it had jumbo <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, kunumoto oysters, <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark>, lobster, and <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>, the works. it was presented with dry ice. they served it with cocktail sauce, this mustard sauce and atomic horseradish, when you mix all 3 it was a pretty good sauce that way too. \n\ni was pretty full so i opted to get a salad and i chose the iceberg salad. now i have to say i always get dressings on the side but this dressing was a red wine vinaigrette but it was creamy looking. the waitress said it was emulsified but there was no cream in it. it was the best salad dressing i have ever had! i think i wanted to dip every lettuce in a spoonful of dressing, that's how much i liked it.  it just had this tangy taste (from the red wine) but a smooth creamy texture but it had no creme. yum!\n\ni tried my bf's steak and he had the rib eye and it was delicious, melt in your mouth meat. our favorite steak houses in vegas are michael's (southpoint) and cut (palazzo) but i think mastro's takes the cake on this. we had so many sides, potato's au gratin, snow peas, yam fries, mac and cheese but i heard the gnocci here was delicious from the rest of our party although i was too stuffed to try. \n\nbut the best part of dinner was the dessert! we had the warm butter cake, it tasted like a mix of pound cake and maybe cheesecake but it is served with vanilla ice cream and had a creamy inside, and sugar flakes line the cake to give it texture. oh and it comes with homemade whip cream! i think that was better than the ice cream, i wanted to eat gobs of it. \n\nthis is definitely a favorite now although the seafood tower is very pricey, it was probably half of the price of the meal, and we were with a party of 10. n", 
            "since i had a good experience at the mastro's steakhouse in oc, i decided to try this mastro's ocean club in las vegas and let me tell you, i had an even better experience.  it's probably due to the fact that i love seafood!!!\n\ni was tempted to get an appetizer tower but there were other things on the  menu that i wanted to try that were actually served hot so we opted out of the tower.  instead we ordered the following:\n\n*<mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> - (just as good as the first time i had it in oc)\n*<mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> - 3 pieces of jumbo scallops with three pieces of bread, in a rich creamy sauce.  amazing!!!  i just found out i'm moderately allergic to scallops but i love jumbo scallops so it doesn't stop me from trying them anyways. soo yummy.\n* chilled alaskan king <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> - came out served is a cool bowl with dry ice.  loved it.  way a lot more tasty than <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> or lobster option.  \n\nthis was definitely more than filling but it didn't stop me from ordering a <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> for my entree since my favorite fish are <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> or cod anything.  i'm use to ordering these type of fishes miso style but since it wasn't an option, i decided to order it pan seared.  it came out nice fluffy and buttery.  i ordered it cooked medium.  i really liked the consistency of the fish and how it was cooked but wouldn't have minded some type of sauce to give that extra umph.\n\nto be honest, i couldn't enjoy it as much because i was so stuffed!  i really wanted to try the infamous warm butter cake but i guess i'm just going to have to wait it out until the next time.  i will definitely come back :)", 
            "everything here was spectacular from beginning to end. i went here for dinner on a friday evening. the restaurant itself is located inside of crystals in an open area of the shopping center. despite the open area, the atmosphere was still very nice and the live music really added to it.\n\nmy experience:\nstarters\n-the bread was pretty good\n-the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> was delicious and the horseradish was spicy!\n\nmain course & sides\n-i ordered the filet, and having dined at another steakhouse earlier in the week, i must say, the filet here was incredible. this was probably one of the best <mark>Filet</mark> i have ever had!\n-the sides were just as amazing. we had the mac and cheese, <mark>Green Beans with Sliced Almonds</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>. i would recommend all of them as there wasn't one i did not like.\n\ndessert\n-i'm not a huge sweets guy, but i was told that i had to try the butter cake even though we were already stuffed. it definitely lived up to the hype as a must try dessert!\n\noverall, i had a great dining experience here. our waiter was awesome and we never felt rushed. i would highly recommend trying this place next time you are in vegas!", 
            "i gotta go 5 stars. the spicy horseradish that comes with the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> is the best i have ever had. simply incredible! everything here is very very good. it is probly the most expensive place on the strip though, make sure you save your pennies! lol. also try the crab cake, you won't regret it!", 
            "mastro's where to begin. located in the crystals mall just outside the main entrance to aria, sister restaurant to scottsdale & beverly hills' location. we embarked on night one in vegas.  so let's start with the drinks at the piano bar a very nice opening where a piano man and gorgeous singer belt out a few tunes prior to dinner where we were seated in the tree house so to speak.  bright open and airy we were treated service wise very nicely.  8 tonight and waiters and staff were brisk and efficient.  the standard push for bottled water well you get the drill. a high end steak house and fish place that needs no preamble.\n\ngreat start bread basket with pretzel breads and such excellent! \n\ni'll run it down.  <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> is a highlight with the dry ice making the fog come off the shrimp it's an eye catcher.  asked for horseradish on the side oh boy the hottest dam thing i've ever consumed. one drop in the sauce made my dry stuffed nose wince and my head was cleared like a nitrate ammonia pack from my football days. yea baby it was good! a <mark>Lobster Cocktail</mark> was also equally outstanding.  multiple salads were also ordered and shared from a chopped house salad, a cesar salad and beefsteak tomatoes & mozzerella.  skip the last one. \n\nentrees: 7 steaks one piece of fish.\nevery single steak was absolutely delicious from the bone in filet to the strip to the bone in <mark>Bone-In KC Strip</mark> there were outstanding. one was cooked or shall i say undercooked and the handled it not only by fixing the dish but removing it from the bill.  the hawaiian big eyed tuna was horrible only way to describe it. sorry but another get this out of here moments. \n\nsides: all very generous in size and easily splittable among the group 4 sides way too much for 8 people.\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> a die for moment outstanding\nsauteed mushrooms yummy\ngorgonzola mac & cheese another to die for moment\n\n<mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> excellent.\n\nall and all a fine dining experience with the drawback of a couple of 1 undercooked steak and one bad entree both removed from bill make this a nice experience.", 
            "i do not get the great reviews this place is getting. main course was awful. the restaurants in orange county & la are so much better then this.\n\ni was there friday may 4th with a group of 20 people. i thought it would be amazing since it is mastro's after all. it was the opposite. good service, but food was so so. my twin lobsters were so over cooked. it was tough & crunchy. i ate half of one & gave up. felt bad not to eat it, but it was awful. i eat lobster all of the time & it's supposed to melt in your mouth. that was not the case here. the rest of my group ordered filet mignon & they were all complaining as well. over cooked & chewy is what i was told. the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> was fine. the oysters were ok. the asparagus wasn't good. the cremed corn was good. the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> was excellent. the creme brulee was great. but, i would never go there again. unless you are in the wooden dome seating area it fells like you're just eating at the food court in the mall. not what i expected. save your money please & go to stk in the cosmo or joe's at caesars. the lobster is to die for.", 
            "definitely one of the best meals i have had in a long time.  everything at mastro's is great-- from the service to the ambiance to the food, the whole evening was really enjoyable.  \n\ni don't even usually like <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, but it is really exceptional at mastro's.  the jumbo shrimp is delicious and the over the top \"smoking\" presentation is pretty amazing.  \n\nthe steak is obviously great, but i could have eaten just sides all night.  the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> were all delicious.\n\nsince i was there with a big group we also sampled several desserts.  i know a steak meal can be filling, but try to save room.  highlights included the chocolate pudding cake and the key lime pie.\n\na great restaurant for a special occasion.", 
            "love mastros!\npricey but worth it!\nthe <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> is amazing", 
            "let me start from the beginning here. i was searching for a good date spot for me and my gf. i have dined at most of the finer restaurants in vegas. but i wanted to try something new and by far, this was the best reviewed spot. only thing that turned me off was that it was in the middle of a mall. not an issue. i requested the 'tree house' and that is where we were sat. once in there i completely forgot i was in a mall...it was romantic and beautiful. our server greeted us and asked if we've ever diner here before....we both responded \"no\". we were then treated to a 5 minute explanation of their entire menu. based on other reviews...we started with the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> and i suggest you do the same. very unique and brilliant presentation. my gf had the fillet of arctic char \"oreganata\"..we both loved it. i had the bone in rib-eye. cooked perfectly. delicious. for sides we chose the mac-n-cheese(not bad, but kinda bland to what i've had at comparable restaurants) and the brussel sprouts...fantastic. we had no room for dessert. cocktails were good....coming from a guy in that business. as we left, everyone thanked us for coming...from busser to manager. that was impressive. i even woke up the next morning to a voicemail from them thanking me for me business and hoping that me and my 'beautiful' gf had a great time; and that they hope to see us again. only complaint..and this is being picky: when our bread was dropped off(with multiple choices), it was just thrown down with no explanation as to what was what. but this is a must go!", 
            "came here for a friend's birthday celebration and the prices justified as much.  we gave our buddy a lot of crap for not being specific about tap water and we ended up with a fee of $20 for flat water.  oh well.  i'll take the story any day.\n\nthis is definitely a white table cloth establishment.  it's not super stuffy, but this isn't the place to roll in wearing shorts and a t-shirt.  the restaurant is beautifully designed and if you can, try to sit in the \"pod\" where you get a view of the mall interior and everyone walking around.\n\nfood was excellent.  we shared the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> and the <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark> for appetizers, and to this day, i still remember that <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark>.  probably one of the best appetizers i have had.  my main course was the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  the serving size was enormous and it brought off into perfect flakes during consumption.\n\nfor the side dishes we had the asparagus and <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>.  highly recommend either but their selection has a lot to offer.\n\nservice was attentive as expected and best of all got to use a little bit of polish.", 
            "whenever we dine here, my tummy and my brain thank me..after a disappointing dinner at the rm seafood last sunday../for my hubby s b-day/, we decided to visit our friend..mastro at crystals ...i called to make a reservation and was greeted by sarah which was super nice and helpful.my husband and i were wearing shorts and that was not a problem for the restaurant's attire.\nwe started with a bottle of pinot noir and of course the bread basket. \nfor appetizer we ordered the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> /all clean,deveined properly/ and the <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark>..let me tell ya..the shrimps are super jumbo..i took 4bites out of one shrimp..the mussels are delicious  with that tasty wine reduction ..actually just that by itself is an entree .\nfor entree we shared the seared scallops and a steak with a side of fries.. the portions are perfect ..but we got full after the <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark> so had to take the rest 'to go' ...\nalso, if u have a special occasion, make sure u tell them ahead as they will get u a super nice piece of cake for u.. on the house.\nall this deliciousness didn't cost more than $180 .. \nthank u for another pleasant experience mastro's ..see you soon!", 
            "we sat in the bar area   had a couple martinis and kumomoto oysters and (super huge) <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>.  everything was wonderful!  the service here is absolutely fantastic!", 
            "we recently dined here for my husband's birthday. having been at the mastro's in scottsdale, we knew what to expect: tasty appetizers, good drinks, and even better steak, so we were excited to check out this location.\n\nthe restaurant itself is in a unique setting: inside the high-end crystal mall in the aria in a wooden tree house sculpture - pretty unique! i will say that having dinner while being able to look out at the fendi & louis vuitton store did seem to downplay the high-end feel of this restaurant and it made me really annoyed (i know, hater) at all the women walking around with their chanel & prada shopping bags.\n\nwe were promptly seated outside of the tree house in the booths and as usual, service was second to none. they were aware of the gluten-free dining note on our open table reservation and brought me the gluten free menu which is pretty large and almost mirrors the regular menu with a few exceptions and some alterations.\n\nlarge signature cocktail, beer and wine menu - i liked that they denoted which cocktails were gluten free as this is usually a place in the gluten-free menus restaurants ignore. stunning and colorful bar - my husband liked the large selection of craft beers as well. the two tvs flanking the bar though did seem out of place.\n\nfor a starter, the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> is a great choice: presentation is really cool with the dry ice vapor, the shrimp are huge and the sauce is good. for an entr\\u00e9e, i went with the filet. instead of their regular rub which contains gluten, they will season it with salt & black pepper. it was a huge portion (had i known, i would have ordered the small filet) and it was cooked well and they even did a butterfly cut to ensure it cooked through. i also ordered a side of <mark>Green Beans with Sliced Almonds</mark> - tasty & fresh however, there were no almonds... \n\nour waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgeable and did a great job of checking up on us despite a busy saturday night.  he was even nice enough to bring out some chocolate covered strawberry with whipped cream on the house to celebrate my husband's birthday which was even more thoughtful because he made sure it was a dessert i could eat given my gluten-free diet.\n\nwe had an awesome time, with superb food and drinks and top of the line service. would highly recommend for a nice dinner, but be prepared to spend at least couple of hundred dollars on this indulgence!", 
            "had dinner here last nite w/ my wife.best swordfish i ever had.perfectly done.spectacular <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>. flourless chocolate dessert was incredible.\nmy wife had <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. to die for.\nservice was amazing! if u want a great dining experience come here!", 
            "i was back to vegas with my work team. first time at mastro's ocean club, a restaurant in the middle of crystal mall. we booked dinner reservation for 9:45 pm for 6 on sunday may/18/14 after the show. i arrived 7 mins early, but our table was not ready and we were seated 10:10 pm (empty table needs to set up for 6). our waiter was very tentative and recommend us the seafood platter.\nthe alaskan red king <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> & the jumbo <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> were awesome. \nmy <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> was cooked medium rare as i requested on a super hot plate. perfect!. the rest of the food and side dishes were great. the only less desirable thing was by the time we got our main course it was 11:40 pm at night. \nfor sure it was a bit pricey, our bill came to $1200 usd for 6 of us.\noverall, it was a good experience.\nmaybe we will try again an earlier dinner time when we have a chance again.", 
            "absolutely recommend mastro's ocean club.  we had a wonderful experience in the tree house.  we started with an apple martini and a berry martini.  the apple martini comes out smoking, we also saw a cosmo come out the same way.  a really cool touch!  we order an appetizer of <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, it come with three but since there were two of us lionel ( our server) suggested we get four, so we did.  they were huge and very tastie.  the cocktail sauce was delicious along with some very hot horseradish, perfect balance.  we also ordered <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> as an appetizer, this was amazing too.  ordered salmon prepared blackened style and my husband order tuna asian style with a side of asparagus.  we ordered way to much food as the portions are very generous.  we then had raspberries sorbet, which was to die for.   so, i mentioned large portions..we took home tuna, salmon and asparagus to our hotel room and ate a wonderful lunch in the room the next day.  they also boxed up the bread, which is a variety of sourdough, pretzel roll and something like a baguette.  our lunch was just as good as our dinner.  i mentioned lionel earlier in my post.  well, you must request him as your server, he is personable and very professional at the same time.  be sure to sit in the tree house.  it is expensive, but well worth the splurge!", 
            "our first time at this mastros.  we've been to others so expectations were high and they lived up to it!\n\nsat in the treehouse which is very cool.  others complained about feeling like you are in the middle of the mall, but it didn't bother us.  our server leonel was attentive and very personable.  outstanding service and he had a sense of humor!\n\nwe started with the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> which was fantastic. sometimes the really jumbo shrimp are chewy but these were tender and tasty.  \n\nhubby's filet was cooked perfectly and the mac n cheese is to die for.  i was craving some crab so i had 2 king <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> of the appetizer menu.  wow!\n\nof course you can't go to mastros without having butter cake.  omg!  it's like no other.\n\ngreat meal for a great date night!", 
            "one of the top 3 restaurants in vegas! third time coming here this year and i have never been disappointed. service from the waitress was on point and she was very thorough with explaining the specials on the menu. the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> is probably the best i've ever had along with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.  i had the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> as my main course which was amazing. <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> as a side is brilliant also. the one thing you cannot leave this restaurant without ordering is the legendary butter cake!!", 
            "food + service was awesome\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> 20$ i'd rate it 3\njapanese kobe beef steak 140$ rate 4\ngorgonzola mac & cheese 14$ rate a perfect 5\n<mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark> 70$ rate a perfect 5!\n\nservice was great!  thanks paul and craig.\n\nscenery was the best part", 
            "my fianc\\u00e9 and i tried this place out yesterday for our anniversary dinner. i feel like usually when i leave a review its because i'm unhappy with the place but that's not at all how we felt last night at mastro's.. down to every detail the experience and the night was amazing. our server paul gave us the best costumer service we had ever experienced. he was friendly.. made jokes and even custom tailored our menus to our liking.\n\ni started off with a cocktail that paul personally had made for me based off my preference for something sweet and tropical, yet strong. my fianc\\u00e9 had a beer found only at mastro's. for appetizer we both had shared the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>. the shrimps were jumbo sized and so fresh it's as if they had just got it from the ocean! \n\nfor our entrees my fianc\\u00e9 had the rib eye and i had the 3lbs <mark>Broiled Live Maine Lobster</mark>. our server brought out the food and de shelled the lobster in front of me. he even cut up my steak in front of me. talk about excellent service! the food was so flavorful.. fresh and the service was impeccable! i definitely would recommend this place.. and ask for paul to be your server!", 
            "mastro's beverly hills is in my top 3 steakhouses so i decided to give ocean club a try. it did not disappoint. the food is great and since you want everything the real problem becomes trying to not order too much. service is top notch and the staff is very friendly and knowledgable. <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> is served chilled with dry ice and the atomic horseradish that comes with it is sweet and will singe your sinuses in the best possible way. the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> are a must get, rich and filled with large pieces of lobster meat. we also got the wagyu tomahawk cut to share which was perfectly marbled. \n\nso why not 5 stars?  these items may seem nit picky but you can be the judge. we ordered the wagyu black and blue (seared rare) and while it did have the cool red center you really want a better crust on it. in addition i know we were sharing but they simply cut the steak down the middle with one person getting the bone piece. for something like this you would expect a presentation similar to a porterhouse. lastly although it shouldn't matter that it located inside a mall it does mean that the people next to you could be in shorts, flip flops and a backwards baseball cap. i know it's vegas but come on.", 
            "one of my all-time favorite restaurants! if you have never tried the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, you are missing out! other items i would recommend are the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, and the cosmopolitan which is served with dry ice giving it an appealing presentation. the service here is the best and the food is amazing! i wish we had one of these in the 405, but until then, i will hit them up whenever i'm in vegas or dc. if you visit the vegas location, it is located in the crystal mall in its very own treehouse, which is very unique. there's no other place like it!"

            "i've dined at many a mastro's, and i must admit: this location hooked me (and my rumbling stomach) + a pal for lunch because i found it architecturally intriguing. \n\nthe staff in the front of the house were still very wet behind the ears. i was asked, \"is there any special occasion that you're celebrating? anniversary, birthday...?\" \n\ni replied that i am a living kidney donor and i celebrate that every day. my response didn't even register with the hostess and there wasn't any acknowledgment at all. *shrug* people have birthdays every year; it's not that often you have the privilege of donating a kidney. just saying. \n\ni'm a sucker for waitstaff in white jackets; there's something very genteel about it that i absolutely adore, though the ambiance was a bit odd - the skylights above took away some of the mystery and glamour that one might otherwise enjoy over dinner. all the better to admire the lines and the strange view that our perch afforded us. \n\ncouldn't help but wonder: because the \"pod\" is not enclosed by walls, but mesmerizing woodwork that undulates and is breathtakingly organic... do shoppers at the nearby boutiques get distracted by the smells of the kitchen? \n\n\"yes, i'd like this limited edition dior - hold up a minute - i need me a steak! \" surf, turf and couture - pinch me, please, and pass the pretzel bread, i'm wearing a silk shift with an empire waist - carbonanza!!! \n\nthe pretzel bread is otherworldly. i ignored the other varieties in the very generous bread basket, and asked for more pretzel bread, which was delivered warm, fluffy and perfectly salted. a healthy slathering of room-temperature butter didn't hurt, either. even though i don't eat wheat, i was no match for the pb, and just surrendered to each bite of pillowy bliss. \n\nmy virgin strawberry martini was not as tasty as the high octane version (yes, i had a sippie and was glad i did) and was just too sweet for my palate - but i had to wash all that pretzel bread down with something, right? \n\nanother quirk: there was a phantom lounge singer, who was, to be honest, not good at all... it was almost comical. it took me a while to figure out that it wasn't tongue-in-cheek lounge-lizardy - the dude was actually that schmaltzy. he was playing and singing live... but from an indeterminate location - i think it was behind the blue curtain - but it was just so odd, we kept laughing about it. \n\nmy <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> was okay... it was fresh and bright, but the last 1/3rd was frozen, because of the ice bath in which it sat. to their credit, when i pointed that out, a fresh one was brought out. \n\nthe salads were nice. nothing that knocked my paul smith espadrilles off, but i was very pleased that the greens were not drowning in dressing. nice, simple, tasty. \n\ni plan to go again, but will make a reservation for dinner; lighting makes a difference, but then again... pretzel bread tastes good at any hour! \n\nbelieve.", 
            "if you're short on time and/or simply not a big fan of the written word, let me start this review with all you really need to know about mastro's: butter. cake.  that's it.  5 stars for the best cake i've ever had.\n\nok, now on to the merely trifling details.\ni made a reservation several weeks in advance as my boyfriend and i were headed to vegas on labor day weekend for his birthday.  i requested a table in the \"tree house\" (i called it the birdcage or something equally gauche) and noted the occasion.\n\nwe arrived and were told they were preparing \"one of the best tables\" in the birdcage--that we could sit at the bar for a few minutes or be seated promptly at another table.  obviously we hit the bar which, it bears noting, is visually interesting with a huge inventory of top shelf liquors stacked all the way to the ceiling.\ni had the mastro's martini--belvedere vodka with handstuffed blue cheese olives.  sweet jesus.  hands down, best martini i've ever had.  three days later, i'm still thinking about those olives.\n\ndidn't even finish my drink before the hostess, a sweet, bubbly thing, took us to our table.  situated on the perimeter of the birdcage, it was a great table.  yes, it's a mall, so our view included louis vuitton and a hoard of assholes who had just evidently exited the elvis show but, whatever.  it's vegas.  plus, i liked the change-up from the normal casino venue which meant i got non-smoky air for a full 3 hours.\n\nour meal, start to finish, was fabulous, perhaps only outdone by the impeccably rendered service.  a special shout out goes to our main server, matt, whose plesant demeanor, attentive service and knowledge of the menu (and wine list) were truly something special.\n\nwe started with a custom seafood tower.  wanting to save room for the steak, we went modest with 3 shrimp (huge), an order of <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> (the best cold crab i've ever had) and 1/2 dozen kumamoto oysters.  the dry ice effect and caper berry garnish were nice touches but the star of the tower was the hand grated horseradish.  when was the last time you noticed and raved about horseradish?  yeah, that's what i thought.  i will never buy the jarred stuff again.\n\nmoving on to the main attraction: i went with the 12 oz bone in-filet and boyfriend got the kansas city.  we both preferred mine as it offered a better combination of buttery tenderness and intense meaty flavor.  he would do the ribeye if he had to do it over again but he was by no means dissatisfied with his steak.\nfor sides we selected snap beas, glossed in simple butter, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> ,which mercifully left large kernels of corn intact, and an order of the matchstick fries (sans vinegar).\n\ntwo tiny complaints:\n(1) upon seating, we received the \"reserve wine list\" which the bf deemed very high priced--not a single bottle under $100.  a few things we could buy for $150 at the store were priced at $900 and up.  1000% = excessive mark-up.  nevertheless, he picked a nice bottle of red that he thought was reasonable.  when the menu came, about 10 minutes later, the left hand side had an enormous list of wines of the style and prices ($100-200) you'd expect at a standard steakhouse.  would have been nice to have seen that list when we were ordering.  might have been an isolated timing thing but worth pointing out.\n\n(2) our first order of fries came out and were basically salt sticks.  and i love me some salt.  i could barely eat these.  the manager came by and i made a casual comment about them.  he said he'd have the kitchen do a fresh batch but would leave us the salt bombs until the new batch was ready.  very nice touch, in my opinion.  because of course we kept eating them.  second batch was perfectly seasoned and the manager seemed to recognize that the kitchen can get a little heavy handed with them.\n\nthese two missteps in no way took away from how much we enjoyed our experience at mastro's.\n\nlast but not least (since it already got a plug at the outset of this review), mastro's blew us away with the complimentary butter cake--served on a personalized plate (\"happy birthday rob!\").  i've since seen some recipes for this cake and i'm really sorry i did.  i could hear my arteries clogging as i ate this, but man it was worth it.  one of those items where you take a bite, laugh at the insane delectability, take another bite, and chuckle some more.  for me, there is no better mark of good food than laughter. \n\ni found the prices high, but totally on par for what i expected in vegas.  and, in fact, to the dollar, the amount we spent on nobu the night before (with cocktails but no wine).\nwe'll definitely be coming back here.  and will hopefully be seated in matt's section.\noh, and the table next to us (3 couples) spent most of the evening talking about bra sizes and dirty sanchezes.  can't beat that for entertainment.", 
            "let's begin with, this location is in the middle of a mall.. which alot of other reviewers have brought up i know - but it's the main reason for 4 stars instead of 5. it does get a bit loud and the view is of a shopping mall.. a high-end shopping mall, but still. not my ideal view for a such an awesome spot. it is what it is though!\n\nthe room itself is very nice, lots of seating, lively atmosphere, great looking staff. i have been a couple of times now and the service is always great when i have gone and the food spectacular. \n\ni have ben to ocean club a couple of times, but this most recent visit was a dinner of 'dungeoness <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark>', 'ribeye' and '10 oz <mark>Ahi Tuna Sashimi</mark>' . we shared everything with a side of sauteed spinach .. and a few martinis. :) i loved was the personal style serving from the individual pans that the food items were seemingly prepared in. the service staff has always been very pleasant and makes the experience very comfortable. \n\nthe ahi was fantastic with a really beautiful presentation laid out on a long plate with a finish of a really tasty sauce. the ribeye was prepared expertly, perfect medium rare with still  a beautiful grill flavor. the spinach was .. spinach, sauteed.. but was excellent nonetheless! haha.. i was having such a great time and enjoying the vibe of the place overall. \n\nthere was a piano player in the corner of the room playing standards and old-school vegas tunes.. sinatra and the like. it gave a beautiful feel to an elegant style dinner. my friends and i aren't the most refined diners, but we know how to have a good time, and maestro's made us feel welcome within that setting.\n\nnow don't get me wrong... this ain't your downtown steakhouse with a $4.99 steak special.. you will drop a pretty penny to have some seriously tasty grub.. but i do believe it's worth it.  at over $150 a head when we dined there last, it was worth the money but definitely be ready for a big bill. it's nearly unavoidable. \n\nhave a great time, and happy eating!", 
            "my girlfriend and i took a whole week vacation off to visit the west coast. it was our first time trip to visit las vegas, and the entire experience was amazing and unforgettable. amid the many alluring performing shows, the endless eyes-dazing slot machines, and the gigantic resorts were some of the most fantastic restaurants that vegas could offer. \n\nwe first passed by oc while exploring the riches on the famed strip. it was located within the beautiful crystal. upon seeing it, both of us were intrigued by the outstanding artistry presented by the original designer. the structure's frames were made out of steel and covered with fine, deep red wood. between the frames were giant crystal clear glasses that allowed a perfect view from both within and out. however, the most salient and attracting feature was that the entire structure was slanted. my words would be lacking and limited for the description, but just imagine an hourglass tilted like a forward-slash sign. bemused by its charm, we booked a table on a monday night and dressed in proper attires, girlfriend in a beautiful orange-red dress.\n\nwe arrived around 10pm after seeing the fantastic le reve at wynn. being monday night, the restaurant had only a few tables occupied. we were given a table near the crystal glasses, which allowed an excellent view for the outside. our waitress of the night was very friendly and polite. as she went slowly on explaining the menu she also told us that the structure was called \"the tree\", its name inspired by the tiny leaves spurting out of the joints of the steel frames. from the menu, we picked \"<mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark>\" and \"vanilla batter shrimp\" for appetizers, a \"fillet of arctic char oreganate\" with \"<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>\" as entree and side dish. the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> came in a special tall glass container filled with mist giving dry ice. each large lumps of crab meat was tender and fresh with the saltiness and sweetness of the ocean. the vanilla fried shrimps were gigantic in size, each crispy on the outside and tender within, a must try for shrimp lovers. the arctic char was perfect, cooked to medium-rare the way i loved. it was a huge fillet more than enough for the two of us to share. the oreganate style was foreign to me, but the combination of butter, spices, and bread crumbs had made a wonderful sauce suited well with the fish. the gnocchi was huge in portion, baked in large hot skillet and filled with delicious cheese and crab meat. the mix of crab meat, cheese, and truffle gave the dish an unique and saliva dripping aroma. however, due to the large portion, over-stuffing this huge amount of cheese, crab meat and gnocchi is not recommended. you would need to trust me on this, as the first 5 bites would have you mouthwatering for more, but double that you would start having the too-much-cream-stuck-in-your-stomach feeling, and beyond that would be just too much to handle.  alas, at the end, gf and i had to pick out the delicious crab meat along with the truffle to eat and wasted a large amount of the gnocchi.\n\nregrettably, since we were on a tight schedule for a night club to visit, we skipped the desserts - what a shame! dinning at ocean club was such a wonderful experience. my gf and i enjoyed every minute from beginning to end. yes, it was a very expensive place, but so was everything else in vegas and every penny spend was well worth it. so by chance if you ever stop by vegas, be sure to checkout this amazing restaurant.", 
            "this place was recommended to me by a friend who lives in las vegas. we were celebrating a birthday. the ambiance and the service were just starters to a terrific meal. our waiter was helpful with suggestions and the other waitstaff was bomb!  when our appetizers arrived ( calamari, and dungeoness <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> was oh so good. dinner was delicious. we had the blackened halibut x3 and the other person had the lobster tail. our sides were   saut\\u00e9ed broccoli, lobster mash, saut\\u00e9ed asparagus , all were top notch. fabulous!!!  the service alone was 5 star. and the food was another 5 star.   we'll be back. yes it's pricey, but who cares!!",

            "great steaks, fantastic pretzel bread, the freshest fish (my wife swears by the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> appetizer) and of course the out of this world butter cake. what a fantastic meal up in the \"birds nest\" at city center.  still prefer the newport beach location but when in vegas . . .", 
            "i had made reservations here for my wife's birthday and when we got there the place was crowded.  the hostesses explained the wait, and offered for us to have a drink in the lounge until our table was ready.  they kept checking in on us until we were ready to be seated.  \n\nwe started with two cups of coffee and the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark>.  the crab came out on a cup of dry ice that was smoking and was a very good presentation, as well as being extremely tasty.\n\nfor dinner my wife had the 8oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark> and i had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  the waiter, piotr, explained that the sides are served family style and that we should share a couple.  we chose the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and the steamed broccoli.  my wife, when asked how she wanted her meat cooked, asked for it to be medium, piotr explained that medium would still have some pink in the center, and sensing the way that she likes hers cooked, recommended medium plus.  when it came out it was cooked perfectly, and was the most tender steak that she has ever had.  my <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was cooked so it had a nice, crispy shell of the outside, but was milky and soft on the inside.  the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> has spoiled me, now i find it hard to not expect that kind of perfection from all other potatoes.\n\nafter dinner they brought out a complimentary chocolate sin cake for us to share with a birthday message written in sauce on the plate.  \n\noverall, this was an amazing meal at an amazing restaurant, and i would highly recommend this to anyone.  the prices are high, but you will get what you pay for.  my only regret is not being able to try the warm butter cake everyone raves about, but i guess that means i have to go here again next time.", 
            "this is as good as it gets. three of us went to mastro's after deciding on seafood and reading the reviews on yelp. everything was top notch, including the attentive service, the gorgeous presentation of the food, and the portions. some of my favorites included the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> (with an abundance of crab meat), served over a bowl with dry ice, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (creamy and with actual meat), and the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. i had that night's special, which was a fantastic john dory with a chardonnay lemon sauce. \n\nsome of the other \"little touches\" to make the experience better? the server actually served side dishes on our plates for us, and we received a follow up phone call a couple of days later to ensure our satisfaction. very classy!\n\nexpect a hit to your wallet: three of us walked out of there at $600, though we did splurge on grey goose martinis (shaken table side), wine and lobster. i can assure you it's well worth it!",

            "i've had a number of people recommend mastro's in cities across the country, it wasn't until recently i realized there was a location right here at home. oddly enough i was familiar with the space, but never put two and two together. it's the bird's nest, the unmistakable structure in the crystals.\n\nwe were started with a huge bread basket. all of which was fresh and delicious. i also had the strawberry mule ($15), which was a refreshing twist on the moscow mule.\n\nif i'm being honest, it was the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> ($28) that swayed me to try mastro's. it's my favorite crab and this was scrumptious. all the flavor, but without the fuss. it is served over dry ice so the presentation is rather striking.\n\nwith \"ocean room\" in the name i had to try the fish. i was tempted by the halibut on special, but i chose the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> ($49). it was a huge filet, that was moist and flaky. surprisingly, their turf seems to be just as good as their surf, the husband had the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> ($49) and it was fantastic. i really like that the preparation is simple, just properly seasoned to allow the flavor of the meat to shine. we went for decadence when selecting our sides. i had to try the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> ($33) and the gorgonzola mac & cheese ($14) piqued his interest. both were rich, creamy and gooey. the crab in the gnocchi was too delicate for this dish it was overpowered by the creamy sauce and the bold truffle flavor. both were mighty tasty, however.\n\nwe ate until we could eat no more, and there was a bunch leftover. rarely do we have leftovers to box up, but it seemed like we hadn't even touched our sides. the portions are quite large and will satisfy the heartiest of appetites. we were much too full to attempt dessert. their famous butter cake will have to wait. service was attentive; overall, a really great experience. it's nice to have another option for seafood in the desert.", 
            "yelpers enticed us here--and we are glad we came. \nwe started with the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark>. it was great, too tantalizing to wait and take a photo; we only could do so once we took a break. delicious morsels of crab stacked in a bowl over dry-ice. the red cocktail sauce has some horseradish-but if you like it hot, ask for some on the side. \nwe planned to order one of the healthy vegetable side dishes but our waiter jonathan (\"johnny\") gave such a wonderful description of the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> that we couldn't resist. \nunless you're big eaters, the way to go is to split a steak. at the next table over it looked as though their steak was cut in half before cooking. but jonathan suggested that he cut our bone-in kansas city strip into slices after cooking, served on a plate \"in the middle.\"  this was perfect.  highly recommended. we couldn't even finish our halves of this delicious, well-cooked \"medium\" steak. \nthe <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were just as described. great. a big splurge, but this dish added to our memorable meal. \ntoo bad no \"desert pocket\" left for the longed for butter cake.  next time. \nif you're looking for a place for one of those meals you savor not only at the time but also in your memory for a long time, excellent food served by a pro, mastro's is your place and jonathan, who's been here since they opened, is the waiter you want.", 
            "this is top notch dining. located in crystals at aria on the 2nd level. five of us came to celebrate a birthday last night and we requested the \"tree house\". this is a wooden structure which almost floats in the air, very unique for sure. \n\nwe were seated in the center and were lucky enough to get paul as our waiter. paul is everything in a waiter you could ever ask for. knowledgeable, very attentive, funny and yet professional giving us excellent service during our meal. \n\nhe was helpful when selecting wines as well as explaining the menu. i ordered the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> and the 22 oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. i love seafood and was planning on the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> but couldnt resist the ribeye. our table split sides of gorgonzola mac & cheese, creamed spincach and gnocci with alaskan king crab. \n\nthe <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> was excellent. served in a dish with 2 sauces and dry ice it comes out smoking. it was about 10 large pieces of crab ($28). the ribeye was also very good ($58), although a tad to fatty for me. it had good marbling like a ribeye should but parts were a bit too fatty. 3 of us ordered our steaks medium rare and they all came out rare. beware they do tend to undercook  a bit, but we all finished them as the meat was so good. \n\nthe gorgonzola mac and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> ($14) were both really good. we were a little disappointed with the gnocci however ($33). i found very little king crab in the dish but the flavor was there. for dessert we ordered 3 of mastro's famous butter cakes which come with vanilla ice cream. \n\npaul was nice enough to personalize one of the plates with a \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate. the butter cakes were awesome (and quite large). they can easily be split  between two or three people. \n\nmastro's provided us an excellent meal with outstanding service. the steaks could have been cooked a little longer but with that being about the only flaw the 5 stars are well deserved."

            "i just experienced a wonderful meal at this establishment. i would say there was a mid-century modern flair to the establishment, with an extremely classy twist. our server was a gentleman by the name of eric baily, and i use the term gentleman loosely...kidding of course, as this man had a great sense of humor, and would truly appreciate a joke as such. he was amazingly attentive.  our table was also assisted by many other staff members throughout the meal, who were also very helpful and attentive. everyone was definitely friendly, and seemed excited about the restaurant and what they had to offer. we also spoke with a bar manager for a bit, luciana, i may have spelt that wrong :(. she had a radiant personality.  they offer a great cocktail and wine list. we tried a key lime martini...yum, and they had duckhorn decoy by the glass, for a respectable price...so i had to try it. the bar is beautiful, several stories in height, layered with a beautiful collage of bottles. there was a great open air feel to the restaurant, yet it still maintained a  wonderful level of intimacy. \n\nthen of course comes the food, solid, simple, and of high quality. judging from my one experience...that seems to be what they are going for. we had a chilled <mark>Lobster Cocktail</mark> and oysters on the <mark>Oysters On Half Shell</mark> for starters. seriously...amazing oysters...i am in the middle of the desert....eating amazing oysters. the lobster was also great. for our mains we had a steak that came out on a 400 degree plate, hot as can be....i know because i touched it, even after i was warned not to ;p perfect med rare...perfect med rare for sure. my lady had a crab cake dish... a little ballsy to order such a thing coming from living outside of maryland for some time. yet...it was much success...top notch fresh crab meat. i guess you gotta thank modern times and next day air, cause everything we tried was super fresh and very tasty. again, dishes were very simplistic...but with fresh flavors such as that, you'd only be doing an injustice by masking it with complex levels of flavors.", 
            "this place is phenomenal.\n\nbreathtaking when you walk in... just like then 1st time i walked in to xs the nightclub. absolutely breathtaking.\n\ni had the bone in filet mignon. it was cooked perfectly!!! but honestly it really needs sauce. not the type of steak you can eat by itself. maybe next time ill try ribeye. but with sauce its good.\n\nseafood tower was incredible!!!! <mark>Lobster Cocktail</mark> & oysters were great. they use blue point oysters.\n\nlobster mash was good.\n\nfor dessert, the chocolate pudding cake was the best!!!! very similar to a chocolate lava cake. outstanding.\n\ni love this place. its so beautiful and it really represents living the good life!!! \n\nservice is great. they have like 5 people waiting on your table, bread person, server, drink person. everything. great great service.\n\nseating was quick. probably because city center is new. i am enjoying it though & i am not looking forward to when this place gets packed. love it!!! gotta take advantage of the exclusivity while it lasts!!!!!!!!!!!!",

            "the food is spectacular and the butter cake is perhaps the greatest dessert i will ever have. the price is consistent with the food quality. i had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and mac and cheese w <mark>Lobster Cocktail</mark> as a n appetizer and the presentation alone was worth the price. also their drinks are spectacular feel free to try all the concoctions as they are all spectacular. however the service does falter a bit. they waiters and waitresses come off as a bit snobby and at times seem to be bothered by talking to the guests. again its not that the service is bad its just that for a restaurant of their caliber there is better. also because of the design of the restaurant it does get a bit loud."

            "wow i was pretty impressed with this place and i've done my share of dining in vegas. the decor was modern and in the middle had this treehouse area where there are more tables. that night, they happened to have the treehouse rented out so there was live music playing which got a bit annoying since it was loud. that was my main complaint. \n\non to the food. we started with the seafood tower and i wasn't even hungry going into this dinner but i gobbled everything up. it had jumbo <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, kunumoto oysters, <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark>, lobster, and <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>, the works. it was presented with dry ice. they served it with cocktail sauce, this mustard sauce and atomic horseradish, when you mix all 3 it was a pretty good sauce that way too. \n\ni was pretty full so i opted to get a salad and i chose the iceberg salad. now i have to say i always get dressings on the side but this dressing was a red wine vinaigrette but it was creamy looking. the waitress said it was emulsified but there was no cream in it. it was the best salad dressing i have ever had! i think i wanted to dip every lettuce in a spoonful of dressing, that's how much i liked it.  it just had this tangy taste (from the red wine) but a smooth creamy texture but it had no creme. yum!\n\ni tried my bf's steak and he had the rib eye and it was delicious, melt in your mouth meat. our favorite steak houses in vegas are michael's (southpoint) and cut (palazzo) but i think mastro's takes the cake on this. we had so many sides, potato's au gratin, snow peas, yam fries, mac and cheese but i heard the gnocci here was delicious from the rest of our party although i was too stuffed to try. \n\nbut the best part of dinner was the dessert! we had the warm butter cake, it tasted like a mix of pound cake and maybe cheesecake but it is served with vanilla ice cream and had a creamy inside, and sugar flakes line the cake to give it texture. oh and it comes with homemade whip cream! i think that was better than the ice cream, i wanted to eat gobs of it. \n\nthis is definitely a favorite now although the seafood tower is very pricey, it was probably half of the price of the meal, and we were with a party of 10. n", 
            "this is our 1st time at any of the mastro's restaurants.  we have family & friends in the vegas area who recommended & accompanied this as a truly upscale & 4-to-5 star dining experience.  they were correct!  \n\nupon being seated practically in the center of their 60 ft teak or mahogany simulated treehouse, we asked the very crisply uniformed captain to recommend the appetizers.  he had us create our own \"seafood tower\" and we chose <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark>, shrimp, oysters & calamari... delish!  the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> & <mark>Iceberg Wedge</mark> were next.  the five of us then shared a filet, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, atlantic salmon & scallops with garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  our captain went over and above as he assisted us in choose the appropriate wine to pair with our culinary choices.\n\nnow.. we would come back for all of this goodness, but the mastro's butter cake is one of a kind and is worth the whole meal or just to drop in for dessert after shopping.  \n\nneedless to say & in keeping with my \"positively outrageously\" great dining recommendations, you have to enjoy mastro's if you're in vegas!",

            "food and service is impeccable! my fianc\\u00e9 and i went and can't wait to go back! i had the filet and he had the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, both we great! their twice backed potato was too good to just consider it a potato and the king <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> on ice was delicious! we go to steak houses often everywhere we travel but this is definitely in the top for us.", 
            "our first time at this mastros.  we've been to others so expectations were high and they lived up to it!\n\nsat in the treehouse which is very cool.  others complained about feeling like you are in the middle of the mall, but it didn't bother us.  our server leonel was attentive and very personable.  outstanding service and he had a sense of humor!\n\nwe started with the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> which was fantastic. sometimes the really jumbo shrimp are chewy but these were tender and tasty.  \n\nhubby's filet was cooked perfectly and the mac n cheese is to die for.  i was craving some crab so i had 2 king <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> of the appetizer menu.  wow!\n\nof course you can't go to mastros without having butter cake.  omg!  it's like no other.\n\ngreat meal for a great date night!", 
            "called ahead to see if reservations were necessary, hostess said 9:15 pm is earliest res...but at 6:30 kids and wife were hungry!\nheard good things, so really wanted to try this place...glad we decided to walk over and take our chances...pleasantly sat down right away in high booth...\n\nordered 1 half dozen oysters and a few <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark>...wow, best claws ever, as fat as tabasco bottle! sweet n meaty too!\nserver (dalin) was excellent, made a mistake on our app order and punched in 6 half dozen oysters instead of the 1 half dozen...and when the tower came out, told us he made an order mistake and just said go eat as many as we can...36 oysters! 3 diff types, inc kumamotos, cushies from bc and the best misty points ever! first  time a server made mistake and left it on the table! we woulda totally understood if they pulled it off the table, but happily surprised to indulge...\n\nthen came the fish...swordfish pan seared to perfection and <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> that was breaded and baked...think of the biggest, tastiest  scallop you've had in your life...in a crispy, flaky, juicy...forget your name ono form!\nwinner! best, most memorable dining experience we've had!\n\nthis may have been the best meal experience so far", 
            "yes yes yes! took some friends and clients for a beautiful dinner here. what can i say? amazing food. highest quality i've had in a very long time. the steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked and all topped off with their truffle butter (highly recommended but an extra $15 add-on, i know. i can buy a lot of butter for $15, but worth it). yum! also ordered a fairly large seafood tower. it was stocked with lobster, large <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark>, oysters, <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>. can you say, unbelievable! with our steaks, we ordered the following sides. <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, mac and cheese, and the gnocci. all amazing. obviously the price here is fairly hefty but was well worth it. impeccable service with our waiter anticipating our every need. we ordered so much food that they ultimately comped us on a free desert. way to go maestros. will most definitely come again!", 
            "my hubby and i celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary here with my daughter and parents. we started off with mastro's seafood tower. you can create your own seafood tower to your liking and size. our seafood tower had shrimp, <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> and oysters. we all enjoyed especially my daughter; the cool dry ice effect and seafood tower presentation. the seafood was fresh and the oysters tasted amazing. my hubby had the <mark>Lemon Sole</mark>, my mom had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, my dad had the <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark>, i had <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> and my daughter got to sample a little bit of everything. we shared two sides family style of their signature <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (love this combo) and the other side dish of <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>. the seafood and chicken entrees and sides were served hot, fresh and perfectly seasoned. at the end, they complimentary served us their yummy signature warm butter cake dessert with vanilla ice cream and added happy anniversary wish which was a nice added personal touch. we had a wonderful time and food experience on our first visit here, and the service was friendly and excellent.", 
            "mastros over delivers every time! there are plenty of solid restaurants in vegas, but no one provides the level of service mastros does. the hamachi appetizer was amazing! colossal size stone <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> were lights out! steaks are always cooked spot on and seasoned perfectly! worth every penny you spend."

            "i just experienced a wonderful meal at this establishment. i would say there was a mid-century modern flair to the establishment, with an extremely classy twist. our server was a gentleman by the name of eric baily, and i use the term gentleman loosely...kidding of course, as this man had a great sense of humor, and would truly appreciate a joke as such. he was amazingly attentive.  our table was also assisted by many other staff members throughout the meal, who were also very helpful and attentive. everyone was definitely friendly, and seemed excited about the restaurant and what they had to offer. we also spoke with a bar manager for a bit, luciana, i may have spelt that wrong :(. she had a radiant personality.  they offer a great cocktail and wine list. we tried a key lime martini...yum, and they had duckhorn decoy by the glass, for a respectable price...so i had to try it. the bar is beautiful, several stories in height, layered with a beautiful collage of bottles. there was a great open air feel to the restaurant, yet it still maintained a  wonderful level of intimacy. \n\nthen of course comes the food, solid, simple, and of high quality. judging from my one experience...that seems to be what they are going for. we had a chilled <mark>Lobster Cocktail</mark> and oysters on the <mark>Oysters On Half Shell</mark> for starters. seriously...amazing oysters...i am in the middle of the desert....eating amazing oysters. the lobster was also great. for our mains we had a steak that came out on a 400 degree plate, hot as can be....i know because i touched it, even after i was warned not to ;p perfect med rare...perfect med rare for sure. my lady had a crab cake dish... a little ballsy to order such a thing coming from living outside of maryland for some time. yet...it was much success...top notch fresh crab meat. i guess you gotta thank modern times and next day air, cause everything we tried was super fresh and very tasty. again, dishes were very simplistic...but with fresh flavors such as that, you'd only be doing an injustice by masking it with complex levels of flavors.", 
            "went to mastro's before a show. scott was our server and was excellent. had a full dozen oyster's on the <mark>Oysters On Half Shell</mark> which were just out of the ocean fresh and delicious! i ordered <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> blackened and it was melt in your mouth perfect! the lobster mashed were delish as was the house dessert, warm butter cake, served with loads of fresh homemade whipped cream! servings are large and we all had leftovers. loved sitting in the treehouse. we do have a few suggestions: the entrance is so boring and the piano is shoved way back in a back corner that you would never notice it. how about putting the piano up front somewhere? such a wonderful restaurant needs a a better first impression. also, we had called and asked for a 7:30 reservation and were told it was not available but 8:30 was. that was too late for us to make our show, so reservationist suggested 7. we arrived and were seated at 7 and the restaurant was no more than half full until past 8 pm!! so why couldn't we have come at 7:30 as we first asked? i mentioned this to a manager who approached our table mid-meal  and he said, \"well, sometimes things change.\" huh??? terrible response. nevertheless, we loved our dinner and the service was fabulous. we can't wait to go back. we're already saving up!", 
            "love this restaurant! we had a wonderful experience there. top-notch service and great food. came here last week with my sister and my bf. we made reservation for 7:30 but we were about 15 mins late. the staff were really nice and didn't make us wait for our seats. we were seated almost immediately. right when we were seated, the server asked us if we cared for any drinks and offered us a warm towel to wipe our hands with. he also explained everything on the menu which i thought was awesome. \n\nmy sister and i ordered two cocktails ($18/each for the cocktails) and we shared the salmon as a main course. for appetizer we had the escargot and oysters on the <mark>Oysters On Half Shell</mark>. my bf ordered the filet mignon ($50+) but it was really tender and cooked to perfection. we also had the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> which i thought was great. the bill came out to be over $250 but i think it was well worth it for the great food, atmosphere and service.\n\ni would suggest requesting for a seat inside the birdnest because every table is separated with a glass so it's very unique.", 
            "i'm kind of surprised right now. so if you read my other reviews you pretty much know that it's hard to get 5 stars, but pretty easy to get 4 stars. if you get 3 stars then there must've been something wrong. \nfirst of all i was really into going to eat here. i thought it was really nice on the inside. i had a very positive attitude without super high expectations. that's the ideal right? \nwell, i was here for my wife's birthday, and my sister in laws belated birthday dinner. i ordered bone in rib eye. my wife ordered bone in filet w lobster tail on the side and my sister in law ordered lamb chops. i ordered mine medium rare. it came out just under well done. my wife ordered hers medium and it came out well done. my sister ordered hers medium and it came out rare. the manager happened to come by and ask how everything was. i really want to avoid complaining at a restaurant, but my wife said his is too done, and my sisters is not done enough. i said hey it's alright we can handle it, but the manager said oh no please let me take care of this. ok i said no problem thank you so much. so they started another steak for me and started to cook my sisters more. ok so they brought mine back. it looked right on the outside...nice looking. alright so it was practically raw. my sisters comes back and it looks like they threw it in the microwave. all the while it's my wife's birthday and her steak is brown. wtf. \nso i cook a little around the house. some say my steak is better than most restaurants. i usually say it's ok. well, in this case i can say i can get the temp on the money 90% of the time without timing it. i really was kind of shocked. i won't go into the meat anymore because it really was a train wreck. \nthe appetizers were good. <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark>, and oysters on a <mark>Oysters On Half Shell</mark>. drinks were great. we all enjoyed. but the dinner was really one of the worst i have ever had. i am really bummed about that. i can't really rate it a 1 star because the manager was good, appetizers were good, drinks were good, but the dinner...well, never again. i almost want to bump up the 2 stars that i have given on other reviews because this review is really 1 and a half.", 
            "we spontaneously decided to eat here tonight for dinner and they seated us right away which was great. the table we were assigned was not one we liked and they had no problem letting us sit beside the balcony instead... i ordered the oysters on the <mark>Oysters On Half Shell</mark> and even though the month of july has no r in it, they tasted extremely fresh. their horseradish is amazing! for an entree i ordered the scallops. i have not ordered scallops in years because it's such a difficult food for restaurants to really have fresh but this was a worthy choice. my partner is vegetarian and her sides were homemade <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> and asparagus. everything was so good that we forgot to leave space for dessert... even the complimentary bread was irresistible. thanks mario!"

            "had an absolutely fantastic dinner at mastro's the other day. our server, shauna, was more than helpful in helping us navigate the great menu. we started off with the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, which was super fresh and delicious, followed by a great <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. for the main course i had a fantastic filet cooked to perfection. but the best was the sides. our table shared the gorgonzola mac & cheese, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and sauteed broccoli. they were all fantastic, but the mac & cheese was to die for.\n\nshauna said the warm butter cake was not to be missed and she wasn't kidding. i'm surprised my arteries survived that cake after everything we'd already eaten, but it was worth risking it. :)", 
            "great ambiance and amazing service!  not to mention the food is just fabulous.  we started with <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> which was good but nothing spectacular.  but then for the main entree i got the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> with a side of mastro's <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  the meat was perfectly cooked to medium rare and the flavor was melt-in-your-mouth delicioso.  even the simple <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> was creamy and savory.  it sure is a splurge but i highly recommend it if you are in vegas and want to pamper your tastebuds.", 
            "so this is the 4th mastro's i have been to and i can't even count the number of times i have been to a mastro's. yet they never fail to prevail! i took my mother and 2 sisters here on a friday night when we were in vegas. i have never been to this one, but have been to the ocean club in scottsdale, city hall in scottsdale and the one in beverly hills. we got seated in the \"treehouse\" which is the big wooden circle that everyone takes pictures of when they are in crystal. we ordered a nice bottle of wine and my sister and i split the beefsteak tomato & mozz appetizer (i always get this when i am here) it is great because they split the order into two plates. my mother and older sister split the <mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark> and my mother could not stop talking about how great it was! i will admit we are all canadian so we are not used to the amazing portions of food they serve in america! it is great!!! i ordered my usual *massive* <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> with avocados and no meat/dressing on the side - it is my fav salad ever! younger sister ordered the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> 8oz which she loved and actually finished. older sister ordered something different - <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> sashimi 10oz, she was only able to finish half of it (i will add a picture soon b/c it is an unusual plate to order at mastro's) she said it was really tasty just a huge portion. my mother ordered the atlantic salmon filet 12oz, again very big but very good!!! of course we have to order sides! my fav <mark>Spinach <mark>Broccoli <mark>Asparagus - Steamed or Sauted</mark></mark></mark> mushrooms, steamed asparagus, and my sister's favourite gorgonzola mac'n'cheese. overall mastro's the my #1 fav restaurant and this new location in the city center is just as great as any other mastro's :)", 
            "actually 4.5, but not a choice here.\n\nso good! they know steak. the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> plate was delicious as well. mac and cheese was sinful. i also had the ceasar salad, mushrooms, garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and butter cake for dessert. everything was great, but the steak, ahi and mac and cheese were phenomenal. \n\nthe place is cool. we sat in the tree dome looking section. it's also nice to have tiffany's and louis v. right next door.\n\nour table was up against another seating booth which i didn't like. i don't like strangers so close to me, especially when i'm eating. don't want to listen to them and i'm sure they don't want to listen to me. service was decent, but they were busy.", 
            "truly a study of excess starting with the \"tree house\" in the middle of the crystals mall.  the excellent food is also a study of excess especially if you are not a huge eater!  starting with the escargot, served in the shell swimming in butter and garlic with a wonderful assortment of breads on the side.  best i have had in a long time.  the entree of <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> sashimi was huge (10 oz.) and perfectly cooked (virtually uncooked!) was a real treat.  the scallops were also more than generous, perfectly seared and served in a wonderful creamy sauce with toast points.  we decided to splurge and went for the $37 <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and were not disappointed, only bad part is this really would be too much for a table of four instead of 2 but we managed to eat all the lobster anyway.  service was flawless.  as you might imagine the bill was part of the excess, cocktails, wine, shared app, entrees with side and a shared desert came to about $260 but it was fun!", 
            "perfect first experience at mastro's! went there to celebrate our anniversary and they really did make it feel like a special occasion. we were seated in the treehouse - beautiful and romantic, great date spot. \nreally unique cocktail list -definitely not the usual boring drinks. i tried the blueberry martini, didn't really care for the taste since i prefer sweet drinks, but it was strong and something different. cocktails were a little pricey at about $18 each, but you pay for the ambiance. \nstarted w escargot, i've never had it served in the shell before. very pretty and delish - served w clarified butter and garlic. great selection of yummy breads too. \nwe shared the 18oz bone in kansas city strip w <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark> (1 butter poached, 1 vanilla tempura fried). sides - twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> and brussel sprouts w bacon. steak was cooked perfectly medium, tender, juicy and flavorful. they knew we were sharing so everything was split for us. poached lobster was good, cooked perfectly. the tempura lobster... mmm i'm not a huge fan. it was good, but a lot of batter and i didn't really get even a hint of vanilla. glad we decided to try it both ways. \ntwice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> was good, but i've had better. they didn't bring it out till about 10min after the rest of the food because the chef didn't like how the first one looked, so he made a new one. they took it off the bill w out us asking. nice that the chef has attn to detail vs just cranking out the orders. brussel sprouts used to be fried w pancetta but they recently changed the menu, so no more pancetta. they did accommodate by doing it w bacon instead, but not really the same - thin sliced bacon just can't compare to chunks of pancetta.\nwe got the butter cake comp since it was an anniversary. super cute of them to do a candle. the cake is enough for 3 or 4 to share, served w vanilla ice cream and a huge bowl of fresh whipped cream. so bad, but soooo good! \nservice was excellent, our server mike was friendly and knowledgeable. the rest of the wait staff were great too. i checked out our neighbors food, i'm looking forward to trying the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, or crab salad next time. \nin the end there's not a huge difference w steak joints - they generally serve the same cuts, appetizers and sides. but mastro's stands apart with its service and intimate classy ambiance.", 
            "wow is all i can say.  we have a mastros steakhouse in chicago and i have not been able to get in as it's always so hoppin. so since we were in vegas, we decided to give mastros ocean club a try.  we were not disappointed.  the restaurant is located in the city center shopping area and fits in well with the high end shopping and the swanky d\\u00e9cor of the city center and surrounding hotels.  the d\\u00e9cor is simple contemporary.  it would be too simple if it wasn't for their amazing bar set up but more their \"tree house\" structure.  if you visit mastros, request that you sit in the tree house section.  they also have a lounge singer and piano player.  the volume was fine (as i've read other review that it was extremely loud) - but we were sitting in the tree house area so i can imagine if you had one of the tables next to the singer or in the booths behind them, it would be pretty loud.  regardless, the singer was very good and sang songs from all genres.  now to the important part - the food.  everything we ordered was amazing.  as all higher end restaurants, all sides are ala cart but big enough to share.  our entrees were delishous - <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, and scallops.  i have no complaints, all were cooked perfectly and extremely flavorful.  the portions were quite large.  the sides were equally amazing and big enough to share between 3-4 people.  one of the sides - the mac and cheese was ah. maz. ing.  if we're ever back i'd be happy to dive into the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  the wedge salad was enourmous, enough to share between 2 people.  i had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which was very tasty.  i've had it before at other places and it sometimes has had a \"fishy\" taste but not this. and there were big chunks of lobster.  service, supurb as expected.  the menu is pricey, but worth it.  i'll definitely be checking out mastros in chicago.", 
            "since i had a good experience at the mastro's steakhouse in oc, i decided to try this mastro's ocean club in las vegas and let me tell you, i had an even better experience.  it's probably due to the fact that i love seafood!!!\n\ni was tempted to get an appetizer tower but there were other things on the  menu that i wanted to try that were actually served hot so we opted out of the tower.  instead we ordered the following:\n\n*<mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> - (just as good as the first time i had it in oc)\n*<mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> - 3 pieces of jumbo scallops with three pieces of bread, in a rich creamy sauce.  amazing!!!  i just found out i'm moderately allergic to scallops but i love jumbo scallops so it doesn't stop me from trying them anyways. soo yummy.\n* chilled alaskan king <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> - came out served is a cool bowl with dry ice.  loved it.  way a lot more tasty than <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> or lobster option.  \n\nthis was definitely more than filling but it didn't stop me from ordering a <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> for my entree since my favorite fish are <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> or cod anything.  i'm use to ordering these type of fishes miso style but since it wasn't an option, i decided to order it pan seared.  it came out nice fluffy and buttery.  i ordered it cooked medium.  i really liked the consistency of the fish and how it was cooked but wouldn't have minded some type of sauce to give that extra umph.\n\nto be honest, i couldn't enjoy it as much because i was so stuffed!  i really wanted to try the infamous warm butter cake but i guess i'm just going to have to wait it out until the next time.  i will definitely come back :)", 
            "mastro's ocean club located in crystals at citycenter is absolutely the best place restaurant with the best service on the latest vegas business trip. in fact, i was more impressed with the non-swanky mall location than its orange county siblings.\n\nthe mall is incredibly quiet and the piano acoustics are phenomenal, making dinner at the bar or at a quiet table a very nice experience. victor is a great bartender and the service is wonderful. as with all mastro's, the wine list is incredible and goes on and on. tonight was a darioush cabernet starter night as i pondered this wonderful menu, trying to stay light and healthy, amongst some decadent alternatives. \n\neventually, i decided on a starter of <mark>Jalapeno <mark>Ahi Tuna Sashimi</mark></mark> which is <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>\nsliced sashimi style, topped with fresh squeezed key lime juice, thinly sliced jalapenos, and ponzu chili sauce. this is light despite looking like a lot of chili sauce. \n\nnext, a salad of beefsteak tomato and onion with balsamic was a refreshing without being super oldtime steakhouse heavy! \n\nfor an entree, i ordered another small plate: the <mark>Lobster Cocktail</mark> which is 1.25 pounds (including shells). now after eating all of this, i have slowed down and am just enjoying my wine when a couple of friends show up and we decide to end the evening with the <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> which are excellent.\n\nwhat an incredible meal, great services, great music and very relaxing.",

            "we were celebrating my wife's birthday and decided that we would go out for a nice dinner.  after a couple of our first choices were not available, we did get a reservation at mastro's.  i can see why they had availability on a saturday night.\n\nthe night started out really well.  the live music in the lounge was very good, and our server in the bar recommended a fantastic riesling.\n\nonce we were seated, our server recommended a couple of salads.  i had a spinach/bacon salad.  nothing special, but ended up being the star of the meal. \n\nfor the main course, i decided to try the vanilla batter <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark>, because i read that it was a specialty of the chef.  i should have known something was up when the server also said i could get the tails baked or steamed, or a combination of those options.  i chose steamed and the vanilla batter.  the steamed tail was just fine, as expected.  the battered tail tasted like something from long john silvers.  it was so salty, and greasy, it ruined what should have been a great dinner.  \n\nwe also ordered a twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> to share.  this should be a very safe and tough to screw up dish.  they managed to do so.  my wife and i both commented that we get better twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> from the grocery store, and we certainly prepare them better.  these must have been sitting out for a while, and were probably over cooked to begin with.  they were so dry, we could not finish it.\n\nwe had two waiters for the evening, and we never saw them.  i'm sure they saw our meal and did not want to check in with us.  no refills on our water, much less filling our wine glasses.  i did see the manager at another table, but she did not stop by to see us about our meal.\n\nthe star of the meal if there was one, was the portion size of the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> sashimi.  it was reasonably priced, but loaded with seeds, so bad that it was a chore to wade through them.", 
            "seems like i've been on a steak kick recently, which makes me realize that my stomach and wallet are inversely proportional. after visiting gordon ramsay and old homestead recently my gut has increased exponentially while my wallet is shrinking dramatically. mastros, of course, had the same effect.\n\nour party of four dined family-style and sampled the following:\n\na dozen oysters (kusshi and bluepoint). all were delicious but, personally, i prefer the smaller kusshi.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> was beautifully presented in a cylindrical stack with, perhaps, too much avocado, but contained plenty of fresh tuna and a variety of textures and flavors.\n \nocean club crab cake. there was very little filler, nice big chunks of lump meat, and a perfectly balanced tartar sauce.\n\nthe scallops were too rich and buttery and was drowning in sauce. the accompanying toast was deliciously crisp and cheesy.\n\nthe 22 oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, cooked medium-rare, was tender and had a decent amount of fat, as was to be expected. a solid steak, but not as mind-blowing as the beef from the top steakhouses around town.\n\n<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. a little dense with a rich, cheesey truffle flavor. pieces of crab were scarce, but there were plenty of gnocchi for the four of us to share.\n\n<mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>. 5 large legs, slightly warm, with clarified butter and lemon. each yielded plenty of tender meat.\n\nthat was plenty of food for all of us, but we couldn't leave without trying their infamous warm butter cake. it was large enough for each of us to get a few bites. it came with a ridiculously large side of fresh whipped cream. i was expecting the cake to have a very moist texture, but instead it was a bit more firm with a slightly crispy exterior. the flavor was as sweet and buttery as you would expect. as delicious as it was, it's not something that my arteries and heart can take too frequently.\n\nmastors is pricey, but not as pricey as other steak or seafood houses along the strip. the atmosphere isn't the greatest either. it is located in the center of a shopping mall, afterall. there's no dim, mood lighting. just the bright florescent  lights of the mall. the tree house thing looked cool, so request that if you have the chance. we sat just outside of it and it had all the appeal of eating at a food court.\n\nthere was also live entertainment in the lounge area when we dined. i had to do a double-take because the girl performing looked like aubrey o'day. i didn't stick around long enough to see if she had the voice or attitude to match.\n\ni'm not sure how this mastros compares to the ones in california that people rave about, but relative to vegas steakhouses it's a solid option. it's a step below the top ones in town, but is great for seafood and, of course, the butter cake.", 
            "i had the <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, seared scallops, gnocci <mark>Seared Albacore with Black Truffles</mark>, spinach, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> (i like this fish for future reference), and creme brulee with homemade whipped cream (best whipped cream ever).  wow.  it sounds like so much food now - no wonder i was hurting!!!!  don't worry though - the pain is gone.", 
            "the food is great & the portions are generous.  i had the <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> & the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> & my boyfriend had the filet & <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  this place never disappoints!  i always look forward to eating here & the one back home in la.", 
            "3.5 stars- definitely better than 3 stars, but not quite 4.\n\nthis restaurant is location in the middle of crystals on the strip.  from the outside looking in, the restaurant is inside a neat sculptured \"treehouse\". it sort of made me feel like if would be cool to eat in there, but sitting on the inside of the treehouse looking out i feel a little disappointed, because i felt like i was eating in an \"upscale\" food court with views of retail stores, such as  lv, jimmy choo, and zegna.  not exactly, the scene i expected  from an expensive restaurant, however on the other side there was a piano bar.\n\nhowever, service was impeccable, except we were only told the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> was out when we ordering rather than beforehand.  in a rush we picked <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> as our appetizer, husband ordered mac & cheese, we shared the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>,  <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> and <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  \n\nwe ordered a bottle of schramberg blanc de blanc for $70. given it is about $27 in retail that markup isn't terrible, beside by the glass ranged from $15 to $30. the wine list is comprehensive.\n\ni am kind of bored with <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark>, but it was definitely above average and the portion size of the appetizer is the size of a meal.  it is presented like a tower with the base made of crushed fried wontons, then avocado almost like guacamole, then the seasoned tuna.  \n\nthe mac & cheese was a huge portion that could feed 4 people on its own or 6 side servings.  i just had to have a bite, it was creamy, cheesy and tangy all the same time; i like the addition of gorgonzola, which still remained subtle.   definitely an adult upscale mac & cheese. \n\n<mark>Chopped Salad</mark> was solid and i like how we were told the ingredients and asked if we wanted to omit anything.\n\nthe king crab comes warm when it is an entree and that was a bit unexpected, but tasted sweet and drowned in the drawn butter....ooooh, so good. i was surprised how meaty the 1 lb of legs were...easily filling up one person.  \n\ni love <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> prepared any way, but i it was pan-fried to perfection.  the outside crusty and the inside soft and buttery. the seasoning was just salt.  the serving size is probably 8 oz, which is ample and justifies the price.\n\nno room for dessert, but a slice of  chocolate layer cake with schlag (whipped cream) was on the house since it was my birthday.  very generous.\n\noverall, pretty good, but again i couldn't get past the view which cheapened the ambiance. we left with enough food for another dinner so that was good too.\n\ndon't know why it is called \"beach club\".  the environment doesn't in any way demonstrate a \"beach club\".  that may be a good thing, though.\n\nwill i go again? probably not, i think joe's seafood (not the crab shack) has a better ambiance and food, except the fish here is better.", 
            "i wanted to try mastro's for two reasons: (1) if possible, i would gorge myself to death on seafood; and (2) i wanted to eat in the weird looking treehouse in crystals.\n\ni got both (except for death...unless....).\n\nthe ambiance of this place is weird, to say the least.  a few tables are enclosed in a traditional restaurant space with, you know, walls.  the rest are inside the \"treehouse,\" a very cool, wood-slated structure dangling in the middle of crystals.\n\nalthough very cool looking, it's very loud.  in between the awwfffulll live music (really, they need to stop that) and the echo of everyone's conversations (no walls = no muffling of noise), it's almost difficult to have a conversation.  i would say this is not a romantic spot to eat.  \n\nthere were also lots of middle-aged dudes in jeans.  like, packs of them.  very weird.\n\nfood\n\nas we were in a \"small plate\" mood, we went crazy on the appetizers as follows:\n\n<mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> ($22)- three medium-sized scallops, three slices of parmesan toast, diced tomatoes and cream sauce.  unfortunately, the scallops were a tad overcooked and chewy. i'd probably pass on scallops next time.\n\nbeef bone marrow (around $18) - two huge bones and baguette toast.   delicious, decadent and full of flavor.  we gobbled it all up.\n\n<mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> encrusted in sesame seeds and served with julienned carrots ($22).  overall, it lacked flavor although perfectly cooked. \n\nwedge salad - ($12) big portion and very good.  i liked that they didn't cover the iceberg in dressing and instead left it on the bottom of the plate, surrounding the salad.  this allowed the diner to control how much dressing on each bite.  the dressing was a tad watery, the way i like it. well executed.  but, it's a salad, so......\n\nthen we got a half and half side of the following (they give you a half portion of each to let you try everything ($38):\n\nking crab black truffle gnocci - salty, rich and so delicious.  lots of king crab chunks. my favorite thing i tried.\n\nlobster cheese <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> -although rich, it wasn't that flavorful. mostly salty, not complex. i did love the enormous pieces of lobster, though. \n\ni have to add they were really generous with the wine pour ($12 for a glass of shiraz).\n\noverall, good service and big portions.  it's a bit pricey but they serve up some tasty food.  \n\ndefinitely come here if you're 40 and have a penchant for denim.  this is your mecca.", 
            "after living in vegas for about a year, this is easily the most disappointing high end meal i've had.  i'd give the food a 4/5 but the service was probably a 1/5.\n\nservice\nthe first disappointment was waiting.  we had a reservation and even so i can understand waiting by the bar for a few minutes.  however, we wanted far more than a few minutes.  our \"leader\" went up to the front to inquire and they said on someone will be by shortly to seat you.  that didn't happen so we had to check back again and someone gave us the apology of \"oh, i'm sorry i thought they came and got you.\"\n\nmaybe a miscommunication, but certainly something that could be excused.  however, things didn't get better from there.  it seems like about 10 minutes from when we seated until we even got drink menus, then another 10-15 before the drinks arrive.  easily 15 minutes before bread arrived at the table.  it just felt like everything was so slow.  after the first round of drinks came our waitress or waitresses seemingly disappeared.  i mean when you have a table of 10 people ordering rounds of $15 cocktails or better you'd figure service would be fast.  i think they easily missed out on  at least 1 extra round due to the slow service.\n\nif you look at the prices at mastro's and compare it to other places across town, you would expect to have a waiter or waitress that knows the menu back and forth and can describe all of the stars.  we got none of that.  i would say our service was at the level of an average chain restaurant.  you aren't adding any value when you ask about menu items and the waitress just lists 3 things that are \"good\".  we asked how the steaks come and the reply was something like \"what do you mean\"?  i mean are they seasoned, sauced, dry aged?  there is no explanation on the menu or listing of sauces or accompaniments for the steaks....\"oh yeah, they are seasoned and broiled\"....thanks.\n\nthis was followed up with no description or explanation of any sides.  during the meal we couldn't even locate the waitresses and people were still anxious to get more drinks.\n\ni will say that the food was good.  the steak was unique in the regard it was so warm when it came out.  usually food has somewhat cooled but their steak still had a sizzle and was warm for the first few bites, pretty good.  the asparagus was nothing special.  the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were good but at $40 can be steep for a side dish.  <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> was good, but i'm not crazy about gnocchi so i'm not an expert.  the problem in vegas is that you can find a place equal to mastro's food wise with probably lower prices so suffering through bad service can be a deal breaker.\n\nneedless to say, nobody ordered dessert or drinks after dinner.  with so many other options in town for steak i probably wouldn't come back for that.  i will say i tried the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> sashimi which seemed great for under $40.  i didn't try it but the swordfish looked the same.  i would come back if i was in the mood for seafood but would be nervous about the service, maybe with a smaller party and a better table things would be better.", 
            "what is there to say about mastro's ocean club that has not already been said? it's funny . . . we live in scottsdale, home of the original mastro's and mastro's ocean club, and yet, this is where we decided to dine in las vegas. having never been to mastro's ocean club in scottsdale, but knowing friends far and wide have been so delighted there, we thought on our vacation, we should give the sister restaurant a try! we are so glad we did!\n\nthe space itself is very unique in design. we were seated in the \"tree house\". it is quite a spectacle from inside as well as outside as the wood towers from the lower level of the crystals shopping center to the very top with a rounded platform area, that kind of resembles an open wooden spaceship, within which is the dining room seating. it is very light and airy. there is plenty of room between tables and despite some of other reviewers complaints that the music is loud, we had no problem with it, even on a friday night.\n\nour waiter (i think his name is robert) was one of the best servers we have ever had, in just about any restaurant in which we have dined. he was knowledgeable, friendly, didn't hover, and was not pushy at all. he gave us time to order, time in between courses, time to finish the humongous plates of food.  the rest of the waitstaff was also attentive. having sat outside at the pool all day, my husband was parched, and i think he drank at least eight glasses of water . . . he never had to wait for the glass to be refilled! when i couldn't finish a course, the attendant asked if he could wrap the remaining up to go. i didn't have to flag anyone down.\n\nthe food was top notch, bar none!  we started with the <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark>. it was a massive appetizer of tiny cubed ahi piled above avocado and what i believe were panko chips. fresh, flavorful and enough for a table of four (not two) to share! not knowing how large the portion was going to be, we also ordered an <mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark> to split - fabulous! and, huge! it had chopped egg, onion, shrimp, lobster, blue cheese . . . you could eat one as a meal. at that point, i issued a proclamation to my husband, aside from our main entrees, we could only order one side. hubby ordered the bone-in rib eye . . . a hunka hunka burnin' love of meat, perfectly seasoned, perfectly seared to medium rare. bliss for my hubby who gets no red meat at home!  i ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> oreganata . . . melted in my mouth . . . and, it too was a giant piece of fish! i couldn't even finish it. the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> was delish, even luke warm, as we couldn't even finish it during our meal, but instead had it as a midnight snack back in our hotel room!  \n\none other note . . . and this was pure genius. i couldn't finish my wine. if i put anything more into my stomach, i think i would have exploded! our waiter said on the way out, take my drink to the hostess and she will give it to me to go. apparently, the hostess can do this, but the waiter can't. thinking i am going to get my wine in a plastic cup . . . the hostess actually poured it into another wine glass and told me to keep it! \n\nwithout a doubt, this was the best meal we had in vegas over this three-day holiday. and despite what some would say is a hefty price tag, i beg to differ. the quality of the service and food were spot on. we had dinner at two other similarly priced restaurants and left feeling robbed. not so at mastro's ocean club. \n\ni think i have finally convinced my husband to make the scottsdale mastro's ocean club on our regular rotation for fine dining . . . i hope it lives up to the las vegas outlet!",

            "***short version of this review***\n\nmastro's is the cheesecake factory of fine dining.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n***long version of this review***\n\ni dropped by mastro's in the crystals mall for a quick dinner before a night on the town.  i'd heard of the mastro's chain before, especially their swanky steakhouses in orange county and la, but this was my first time hearing of their seafood restaurant.  it seemed like the perfect opportunity to lose my mastro's virginity without being subjected to massive slabs of red meat.\n\nfirst thing's first -- mastro's is enormous, and it's absolutely stunning.  in terms of architectural design, this place is a feast for the eyes.  the interior of the restaurant is bold and stunning.  much of the dining room is suspended over the rest of the mall in a giant wooden \"treehouse\".  i sat at the bar, which was a veritable mountain of mirrors and glass.  just being at mastro's feels glamorous.\n\nafter being seated, i ordered a glass of the \"grace lane\" riesling (which was fabulous) and was promptly offered a complementary breadbasket, filled with pretzel bread, toasted baguette, and various other goodies.  \n\ni noticed that most of the plates being carted around the restaurants were pretty large, so i decided to build a dinner out of two different appetizers.  i opted for the <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> and the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tostada.\n\nneedless to say, two appetizers were more than enough food, since these so-called \"appetizers\" were really entree portions.  the <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> included 3 giant scallops, soaking in a rich and buttery sauce and served alongside huge slabs of cheesy baguette.  the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tostada was actually 3 separate tostadas, each loaded to the hilt with big-<mark>Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna</mark>, avocado, and ponzu chili sauce.\n\nof the two dishes, i preferred the scallops, which were simply prepared and oh so silky and indulgent.  the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tostada was less enjoyable, since the tuna was served warm and had a slightly mealy consistency.  \n\nservice was efficient, formal, and bland -- fairly typical for a chain restaurant, but especially a vegas chain restaurant.  \n\nall in all, i'd really glad i had the chance to experience mastro's for the first time.  the behemoth portions, straightforward food, and stiff service felt like cheesecake factory -- not a bad place per se, but not somewhere that i'd visit on the reg, either.",

            "beautiful location in one of the high end malls in the new city center. little bit hard to find if you don't normally shop here. and i don't. civil servant salary :(. but we made it and we made reservations in advance so no problems with our table. \n\nonce placed at a table i think the floormanager thought it took too long before we got menu's and drinks because after some talking in a little microphone he brought the menu's himself. and bizarre: he really, really resembles sheldon cooper (big bang theory). and once you've seen it........\n\nour waiter showed up explaining the menu and taking the drink orders. to be honoust, we've missed most of the information. a high speed talk with way too much information about the specials.\n\nwe decided on half a portion of the salad of the day (spinach, bacon, egg, the promised blue cheese was hard to find), the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, a <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> and the ribeye with bone. for sides just the sauteed mushrooms.\n\nportions are huge, but had a few dissapointments considering the price. although we'resure the waitress spoke off different kinds of preparing the meat (grilled, blackend, etc.) she didn't asked we would like the meat prepared. looking at the meat of our neigbours we asked which cooking that was. turned out to be rare. just a little too pink for us so we asked the meat to be cooked medium. can tell you, what we got was definitely way beyond medium. almost welldone. and no,we didn't send it back. i know, we should have.\n\nthe mushrooms were perfectly cooked and huge. like the portion. more than enough to satisfy four. the bisque was oke but both appetizers, the spinach salad and <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> were flat. the salad being nothing special and the tuna was way to cold  discover any taste at all. i also don't understand the fried things (onions?) on the bottom.\n\nbest experiences were the setting, despite the location, the services and the bread. especially the latter was excellent. \n\ntogether with a glass of white and red we've paid $163 before tip.\n\nnote: excuse any grammar and spelling mistakes. i'm no native speaker and keep having troubles with my apple device that keeps trying to change the english words into proper dutch words. yes, you've guessed right. my first language.",

            "thanks to a coworker's recommendation and fellow yelpers, we had a wonderful christmas dinner here. we requested the tree house area and it's where you want to sit. we had a drink at the bar while waiting to be seated and randy served up an awesome lemon drop martini for me and a key lime pie martini for my wife. we had the grilled salmon and <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> sashimi, so good. and as many before me have said here, the signature butter cake dessert is phenomenal. finally, a comment about service. kudos to the entire staff and management are due. we walked up to the hostesses and we were welcomed by big smiles. then off to the table, from the bar, and the hostess carried the drinks for us. robert, our waiter, and a host of other men with bread and water and what ever we needed made this one special dinner experience. thank you and see you again soon.", 
            "mastro's was the capstone in a hedonistic tour-de-force of eating and drinking, and oh what an excellent climax it was! we set up dinner reservations for 6:30 prior to a 9:45 flight that would get us the hell out of vegas; while it wasn't the best idea in terms of timing, we were just super eager to eat at mastro's and couldn't cram it in earlier in the trip.\n\nwe were seated in the middle of the big floating wooden structure, which was excellent for the view and being in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of the restaurant (something i really like). our waiter was excellent; he made us feel at ease and happily answered all our questions about ordering.\n\nthe first order of business? a nice bottle of wine. fortunately, they had several wines in the $60 range that i like and pair nicely with both fish and meat (keeping our options open :-) ). we chose the 2009 grgich hills merlot, and sat around merrily sipping until our starters came.\n\nthe seared albacore with truffle (see the picture) was really damn good. i could have eaten two plates of that and been happy. the <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> was good, but not amazing. yep, i've dinged it for \"not being amazing\". we went in all different directions for main course: one bone-in steak, one cooked fish dish, one sashimi tuna dish. all were excellent. the sides were excellent. everything was excellent. see a pattern?\n\nsomewhere in the middle of the main course we ran out of wine and unconsciously ordered another! why not go out with a bang.\n\nthe hour was winding down, our stomachs at near capacity, and fears of the implications of missing our flight creeping in, yet we got dessert. the warm butter cake. dude. best part of the meal. might have been the best part of the weekend. don't go without it.\n\nthanks mastro's for an awesome dinner. i'll be back next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "mastro's literally is the best restaurant in las vegas. \n\nthe restaurant overlooks the main floor of crystal's and is absolutely gorgeous. very spacious with plenty of seating area.\n\ni've been here about 4 times and am never disappointed. in fact, i think i'm even more impressed each and every time i go and fall in love with the restaurant all over again. \n\nservice: impeccable, from the hosts to the servers. i've had a light skinned african american male with dreadlocks and glasses twice (embarrassing i should really remember his name) and he was quite delightful. i've had other servers as well who without a doubt, like the gentleman we had twice, ensured we were taken care of throughout our entire meal. \n\nfood: to die for. the best <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> i've ever had. i've tried quite a few steakhouses in las vegas (ribeyes because i am obsessed) and none compare to mastro's. their appetizers and sides are wonderful too! i've tried their scallops which are soft like butter, <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (a must try), gorgonzola mac and cheese, <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, and the <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> (gotta have some veggies).\n\nwine: they have one of my favorite cabernets here that pairs perfectly with the ribeye, chateau st. jean. highly recommend with your meal if you're enjoying steak, not seafood.\n\ndessert: do the butter cake. comes with a heaping pile of homemade whipped cream. sweet, warm, and delicious!\n\ni love this restaurant. writing this review makes me want to go there this week. a perfect 5!", 
            "here is how i would break down my review \n\nservice - 5 (great service and even removed the charge for my steak)\nappetizers - 5 (<mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, stone <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>, and shrimp all rocked)\nsteak - 3 (1st was medium well, 2nd was rare...medium rare is not that hard!)\nsides - 4 (mac and cheese, steamed spinach,  and brussel sprouts)\ndesert - 5 (butter cake is where it's at)\natmosphere - 3 (i like the funky \"tree house\", but sitting in the middle or a mall adds a little bit of a \"food court\" feel)",

            "i have never been to a fancy steakhouse before, and i have learned that they are incredibly awesome!\n\nwe booked a reservation ahead of time, so getting seats were very convenient and we were seated right away. our server for the evening was craig and he was a very personable man, who was very helpful throughout the entire evening. he had an answer for any question i threw his way and he explained things that they were offering off the menu very well as well. \n\nour appetizer came out first, which were their <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tostadas. they were very delicious. the tostada portion was very crunchy and had the perfect texture. the avocado and tuna that they served on the tostada were so soft and had a buttery texture, which was heaven in my mouth. our entrees then came out with our sides. i ordered the bone in ribeye with an 8oz prawn, while by brother ordered the kansas city strip. both of our steaks were cooked to perfection. i ordered mine medium and my brother ordered medium-well, and it came out exactly as expected. for our sides, we ordered the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> along with <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>. the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were supposedly their most popular side, and i can see why. they had a good amount of lobster in that dish and it added a nice change to plain <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was very creamy and rich. i personally could only handle so much, but they did prepare it very well. since we went there for my birthday, they provided a complimentary slice of cake for me to eat, and it was a 5 layered chocolate cake. their cake is some of the best cake i have ever had. i have no way to describe the taste besides \"clean.\" it stayed together very well, the flavor wasn't too strong, and the texture was perfect. \n\nto say the least, the service and food was some of the best i have ever had all in all. i definitely could not eat here on a regular basis, but for special occasions, this will definitely be on the list.", 
            "excellent meal. we made reservations at 7pm for a 9pm meal. arrived at 8:20 and sat at the bar. 2 delicious pomegranate martinis. we were sat at 9am. met an excellent server johnny from chicago. we was exceptional. superb recommendations on meal and wine selection. <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, spinach salad, bone in filet and ribeye, lobster mashed and brussel sprouts. then to top it off at the end of the night, butter cake. we have made reservations for our return trip in december. we are impressed and you will be too.", 
            "went with my brother for this birthday. it's rather odd to be eating in this kind of restaurant in a mall, but the faint mall music didn't affect the food. \n\nwe started with the <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> then moved on to (rare) bone in rib-eye and kansas city stip. my brother went surf and turf and added the prawn, which was basically the largest shrimp i've ever seen. we rounded out with sides of lobster mash potatoes and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>. \n\nmy only complaint was my moscow mule, which didn't appear to have any ginger beer and was essentially vodka and lemon juice. overall, the food was cooked perfectly and the service was attentive without being annoying (this is a fine line). it was a great experience and i'm sure it made my brother's day.", 
            "one of my all-time favorite restaurants! if you have never tried the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, you are missing out! other items i would recommend are the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, and the cosmopolitan which is served with dry ice giving it an appealing presentation. the service here is the best and the food is amazing! i wish we had one of these in the 405, but until then, i will hit them up whenever i'm in vegas or dc. if you visit the vegas location, it is located in the crystal mall in its very own treehouse, which is very unique. there's no other place like it!", 
            "had a 4.5 star meal, but not quite 5 star, at mastro's on a friday night.  it was very crowded, as in full, but we were seated promptly at our reservation time of 8:00.  we were seated in a high top kind of half-booth type table.  i'd not sat in something like this before, but it was comfortable.  the place was humming, but since it's open to the mall, it wasn't so loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation.  \n\nour server immediately approached us to take our water and drink orders.  she also provided a wine list, which was above average but pricey, which was expected given that mastro's is located in crystals on the strip.  i didn't think it was out of line with other lists at similar places on the strip.  \n\nto start, i went with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.  this was one of the best versions of this dish i've had.  it was velveety smooth with a lot of chunks of lobster.  the sherry came through, and it was seasoned very well.  just a creamy lobstery soup.  you may get some sticker shock given that it's soup, but i think it was worth it (i can't recall the exact price, i believe it was either $16 or $18).  additionally, a friend and i shared the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tostada.  these come 3 to an order, but i could have easily eaten another dozen.  the tuna serving is substantial, and all of the accompaniments (avocado, onion salsa, and chili sauce) are fantastic.  crispy, flavorful, but not too heavy.  loved it.\n\nwe split steaks among the table, opting for the traditional bone in ribeye and the wagyu bone in ribeye from australia.  it was $110, but well worth it.  it was noticeably better than the other steak.  not that the \"regular\" ribeye wasn't good.  it was.  but, the depth of flavor with the wagyu was significantly better.  absolutely re-order if they have it available.  plus, since we were sharing they offered to cut it for us in the back of the house, which we appreciated.\n\non the side, we had the peppercorn steak sauce.  it's good, but i don't know that it's worthy of its reputation.  i didn't think the steaks needed it, so i only had a couple of bites with it.  the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> are incredibly decadent, nearly swimming in lobster and butter.  the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> is good, but it's typical for this type of dish.\n\nfor dessert, we went with the famous butter cake.  it easily lives up to its reputation.  warm, a little crispy on the outside, but impossibly moist and buttery.  served with berries, ice cream, and plenty of whipped cream, it was an excellent end to a great meal.  \n\nservice was fantastic the entire time.  our server was there when we needed her but not overbearing.  our food came out quickly, but we never felt rushed, despite knowing how busy they were that evening.  all in all, a great experience.  i can see why mastro's has its reputation, i would absolutely return.", 
            "my boyfriend and i came here to have a celebratory dinner. there was a bit of a mix up with our reservations (i used open table) but they were still able to accomodate us.\n\nmastro's is located inside the shops at crystals on the second floor. my boyfriend loved his hennessy sidecar cocktail and always talks about going back just for drinks and to try their dessert.\n\nwe decided to skip appetizers and just go straight into the main course. we got the 22 ounce <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> sashimi, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and sauteed broccoli. since we were sharing, they offered to plate and serve everything for us. we ordered with the intention that the tuna would be for me, and the steak would be for him but by the end of the meal, i enjoyed the steak so much i ended up eating most of it. i'm a fan of ribeye steaks because i find them to be more flavorful than <mark>Filet</mark> - and the steak here had a nice sear on the outside and perfectly tendor on the inside. the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were yummy but a little bit salty to me (although my boyfriend said it was fine and he loved it). the amount that we ordered was more than enough for two people, we didn't get to dessert because we were so stuffed."

            "i admit i had my reservations dining in the middle of a mall, albeit a nice one, dining in the treehouse room felt intimate and classy.  in the grand scheme of steakhouses, i'd rate the food a solid 4, perhaps a 5, but the attention to detail by the staff, fantastic cocktails, wonderful ambiance, and late hours helped mastro's earn a 5th star in its belt.\n\ni was a bit peeved that we had to wait almost 30 minutes for our table at the bar, but the generous cocktail pours helped soothe the senses.  plus, we were late to our reservation by an hour and a half so i had to throw them a bone (haha!).  we arrived around 10:30pm and were surprised to find a happening bar scene and a 75% full dining room.  we left past 1am, but the staff was gracious and didn't try to rush us out even when we were the second to last table in the restaurant.\n\nthe food was delicious.  we may have over ordered on the appetizers, but we hadn't eaten in 12 hours so we figured we would indulge a bit.  very fresh oysters with all the fixings with lemon halves that were wrapped in cheesecloth and speared onto a fork.  great detail.  <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> plate was also good.  the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> was ok - good, but certainly have had better.  my bone-in rib-eye was great.  cooked a little past medium rare, but still tasted wonderful - a nice char on the outside, lightly salted crust.  the side dishes were also good, in particular the mac and cheese, but get it while it's still warm.  at the end of our meal, our coffee order came out a bit lukewarm, but it was close to closing time so i gave them a pass.  in honor of the groom, the staff also brought out a dessert with the words \"don't do it!\" written in chocolate on the borders of the plate.  again, great attention to detail.\n\ni really think this is where mastro's shines.  the details.  we were asked whether we wanted a black napkin versus a white one to minimize lint getting onto dark pants when we sat down.  i just received a phone call today asking whether we enjoyed our experience and to visit again.  i might have had a better steak elsewhere (not by much), but it's a real pleasure to dine somewhere that focuses on the little details that elevate a dining experience into a fine dining experience.  bravo mastro's - i will be back.", 
            "from start to finish, our experience with mastro's was wonderful. ruben and i brought his cousin, daisy here during one of her vegas trips. since there was a little bit of a wait for a table, we decided to hang out at the bar. the whole space feels large with the open-air setting in the crystals. the beautiful decor and low lighting creates an elegant atmosphere. the bar was pleasant and we enjoyed our beverages, including a couple crafted cocktails. \n\nwe didn't even have the opportunity to finish our drinks by the time our table was ready! we were seated near the edge of the restaurant (near the \"treehouse\"), so we had a view of the shops and open area with half our seating as a booth and the other half, chairs. it was really nice and very comfortable.\n\nwe started with <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, served with fresh lemon (in a mesh, love it) and aioli. the breading appeared thicker than i normally like, but the squid was fresh and it was tasty. ruben and i shared the filet mignon, medium rare, and mastro's crusted salmon. the three of us shared the side dishes: <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, potatoes au gratin, gorgonzola macaroni & cheese, and steamed broccoli. the steak was prepared perfectly and scrumptiously tender, the salmon was so flavorful, and the sides were all delicious.\n\neverything about our meal was enjoyable. the prices are similar to those of high end steakhouses, but the portions were generous. we were able to take home a lot of food! to round everything out, the service was impeccable. it is one of our favorite steakhouses and favorite recommendations.",

            "mastro's is amazing. i had the best steak here (even though this restaurant heavily features seafood). we had an early reservation because we had an 8:30 show to go to. we were seated immediately and i think they gave us white or black napkins, which they placed across our laps for us, based on what color we were wearing. and that was just a hint of the level of service to come. we had a very attentive server, but someone in a suit, his supervisor (?) was also constantly checking on us. my water glass was never empty, a standard i use to base a restaurant's level of service. i had gotten up once to use the restroom and accidentally dropped my napkin. as i was leaning over to pick it up, our server appeared out of nowhere and immediately insisted that he would do it. when i came back a fresh napkin was folded at my seat. when the sides came, someone immediately offered to serve them to us. i was surprised no one offered to cut my steak...lol. the restaurant quickly filled up, but from the time that we were seated until we left, never once did the superb service lapse.\n\nok onto the food: there were a few different types of bread and i think i like most of them. they refilled our bread basket, but i wish they didn't lol because i ate way too much bread. i ordered a berry flavored cocktail and it came in a martini glass, but they also set down a shaker cup by my glass, and to my delight, there was enough to fill my glass a second time! =d we ordered the <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark> appetizer and they were delicious, so fresh, not fishy at all. just delicious. i could have inhaled an entire order myself. everyone ordered the ribeye and it was perfect. so, so good. we were trying to be kinda healthy so we got sauteed mushrooms and spinach and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> as sides. but afterwards i wish we had gotten the mac & cheese and the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. everything was so delicious and the portions were pretty big. i ate about a third of my ribeye and we didn't even finish all of the sides. luckily our hotel room had a fridge so we could take the leftovers. \n\nit was definitely pricey, but for the amazing service and food, i think it was well worth it. i would definitely go back or at least go to one of the socal locations. mastro's is the standard by which i compare all steakhouses and other fine dining establishments to.", 
            "whenever we dine here, my tummy and my brain thank me..after a disappointing dinner at the rm seafood last sunday../for my hubby s b-day/, we decided to visit our friend..mastro at crystals ...i called to make a reservation and was greeted by sarah which was super nice and helpful.my husband and i were wearing shorts and that was not a problem for the restaurant's attire.\nwe started with a bottle of pinot noir and of course the bread basket. \nfor appetizer we ordered the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> /all clean,deveined properly/ and the <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark>..let me tell ya..the shrimps are super jumbo..i took 4bites out of one shrimp..the mussels are delicious  with that tasty wine reduction ..actually just that by itself is an entree .\nfor entree we shared the seared scallops and a steak with a side of fries.. the portions are perfect ..but we got full after the <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark> so had to take the rest 'to go' ...\nalso, if u have a special occasion, make sure u tell them ahead as they will get u a super nice piece of cake for u.. on the house.\nall this deliciousness didn't cost more than $180 .. \nthank u for another pleasant experience mastro's ..see you soon!", 
            "this place is a tree house.. no really, it is!  their main dining area is called the tree house; quite cute actually.  but regarding the experience:\n\nfood:4 stars\nservice: 1 star\nprice:2 start\naverage:2.5 star.. but i rounded up because my meal was courtesy of mgm... thanks casino host!\n\ni was seated by the hostess.. then i waited.. and waited... and waited.. for menus.  after making continuous eye contact with the wait staff, displaying my need for service, i was ignored.  then maybe after 10 mins, i received a menu, but still had to ask for water.  shocking, as this is supposed to be a nicer restaurant.. you would think with these prices, would come service.  also, during our dinner, i had numerous times where i was looking an empty champagne glass.. and no i'm not a fast drinker... if you are going to place the bottle in a ice bucket stand on the other side of the table, please be mindful of when to fill my glass... i know this may sound snobby, but i have no problem pouring my own glass.. however, i believe they should keep a close eye, especially since there was plenty of staff just standing around.\n\nthe mussels were probably one of the best i've had! this was a nice surprise, as most <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark> are quite standard with white wine, garlic and parsley.  but this had some sort of light and creamy sun-dried tomato sauce! it was thin enough to compliment these under the sea delights, but hearty enough to dip with bread!  the crab cake was also divine!  definitely no fillers here.. instead, a cake-shaped form of literally pure crab!  the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was prepared really great, especially for a white fish!\n\noverall, i would definitely check this place out, especially if you have a food/bev comp through mgm hotels.  however, i still prefer sage over this place.  the service really stood out to me, and it was horrible!\n\ndear waitstaff.- please be kind to your customers, especially in the city of where splurge-worthy tips are common!  and to the tall, 60 year old server with some salt and pepper action going on ontop of that head.. stop winking at ladies.. you're creeping people out!!", 
            "i've never ever thought in my life that i would find a perfect restaurant, but i guess i was proved wrong when i dined at mastro's. the service was absolutely amazing; the waiters practically catered to our every whim and made sure that our time at mastro's was warm and inviting. the appetizers were delicious. the escargot was average but the <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark> were very good. \n\ni ordered the petite fillet cooked to medium. my parents ordered their special of the night: the australian wagyu. let me just say the steaks were absolutely amazing. definitely 5 star status; both of the steaks were flavorful and tender. the juices from the meat blended incredibly well with the spices. these were probably some of the best steaks i've eaten and i've eaten at a ton of places. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> was just so delicious and filled with epic flavors, i give my kindest remarks to the chef. the meal was too amazing. \n\nwe were too stuffed for any dessert but the next time, i'll be sure to try something off of their dessert menu. this restaurant was way above expectation: service was extraordinary, food was delicious, amazing presentation and ambiance. absolutely perfect! i love mastro's and will be sure to visit again.", 
            "the food and service was on point here at mastro's. \n\ni always heard great things about it and i am so glad i finally tried it. \n\nto start, i had the <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark>. although the mussels were small the sauce and cheeses croutons were incredible. i took advantage of all the various breads they had in the basket just to dip in the sauce and\nindulge more. \n\nfor dinner i had the <mark>Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna</mark> served sashimi style. it was seared with asian inspired flavors and didn't make you feel so heavy. i will say that it is a quite a portion and initially seeing it can be overwhelming. \nthey warn about the size of the side portions so please think it through or else you will have way too much. i had a table of 4 and we battled to eat everything cause it was yummy but man i came out of there a fatty wack. i loved the cream corn and <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. done deal with those two! i had the lobster mash and yes it had big chunks of lobsters and it was good but not as great as it's hype was. we also had saut\\u00e9ed broccoli and honestly it looked steamed. they serve you the sides which i thought was a great service. \n\nthey gave us their signature butter cake. topped with ice cream and fresh fruit with a side of whipped cream. if you even last this long to have dessert then order it. warning-the portion is again good for 3-4 person so think it through before you order. \n\ni would highly recommended this place. it's ambiance is okay because it still does feel like you are still in the shopping area even though you can't see it too much. great service and great food. you really can't go wrong."

            "came here with a couple friends.  we were sat in the modern tree house which over looked the crystals mall, i would definitely ask to be sat there.  everyone was hungry so we got right down to business, <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark> and <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> to start followed by the 22oz bone in ribeye for myself with <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.   apps were flavorful,  steak was cooked perfectly midrare and the sides dishes were great .  service was impeccable as expected. overall great dinning experience, wasn't the best steak i've had but definitely worth trying even though technically this restaurants prime focus is seafood.", 
            "the ambiance was pretty rad. it's not you're usual dimly lit steakhouse. it's right in the middle of crystal and very bright. i liked the modern decor and the live music was a nice touch. the service was great. the bathroom attendant made me feel like i was a a club. \n\nmy <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> (12ox) was tasty, but i personally miss the crisp edges and extra butter on the ruth chris' steak. the mastro side dishes though, definitely beat ruth chris'. i loved the truffled gnocchi, lobster mash potatoes, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark>. \n\nmy highlight of the night was the butter cake! yummy!", 
            "<mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark>, escargot, <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tar tar... and <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> with <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> (oh, how i loved you!). this is a perfect menu. the place is beautiful, food is amazing, service is impeccable - this is mastro's. go.", 
            "i don't want to repeat what everyone else has said. it really is a fantastic meal. especially if you're out celebrating something special or romantic. the artistic treehouse canopy is lovely to sit under. the service is phenomenal and thoughtful (when i said i was already getting full after my appetizer, the waiter offered to make my scallops entree an appetizer portion). the gorgonzola mac n cheese is out of this world. the brussel sprouts are excellent. the scallops amazing. the <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark> were the best i've ever tasted. the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> also was the best i've ever tasted (my bf had that... i tasted it). then the warm butter cake... cuh-ray-zee!!! so unbelievably good. my eyes went all googly and i nearly floated away. and the portions are generous so unless you're like us and were just curious to try many different things, don't order too much. it will be enough.", 
            "amazing restaurant! we had <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark> and bone marrow for appetizer. both were superb! ribeye and <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> for main course were absolutely delicious. the atmosphere was very inviting. the only draw back was the location in the mall. will come back here every time  were in vegas.", 
            "we enjoyed this dining experience immensely!  renee was our waitress and brandon was the manager on site.  first of all cocktail pours are twice the size of normal (of course at $23 per martini you would expect that!).  we started with the <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark> ( nothing out of the ordinary).  <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was great - a pretty decent portion as well.  i'd have to say that the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> was sublime!  from the manger, to our waitress to the runners, we have nothing but praise.  wonderful evening!", 
            "this is our 2nd time dining at mastro's ocean club.  lanford was our waiter for the evening.  he was extremely personable and very knowledgeable about the menu.  we dined on <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark>,  <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, scallops, lobster/<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> and the brussel sprouts.  everything was wonderful.  we spoke to 3 of the on duty managers in passing: nicholas, brandon and dan(?).  we have nothing but praise for this restaurant and all who work there.  we will be back!"

            "a couple of weeks ago i went to dinner by myelf at mastro's ocean club, the wooden donut shaped eatery located in the middle of the new crystal's shopping mall at city center. \n\nit was tempting to fill up on the bread basket filled with pretzel and rye bread sticks, parmesan crackers, and teardrop sourdough boules, but i restrained myself and saved room for a half order of the <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark> ($7.99) and the <mark>Sauteed Shrimp</mark> appetizer ($18.95). everything at mastro's is fairly expensive, so these dishes were a great way to test their quality without spending a ton. the <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark> was essentially a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with horseradish in the dressing, and being a huge fan of horseradish, i very much enjoyed it. i always ask for light dressing (or dressing on the side) in less expensive restaurants because more expensive restaurants generally know how to dress a salad properly, and mastro's was no exception. if anything, the salad bordered on verge of being under-dressed, so if you are a fan of heavy salad dressing, i would ask for extra. the <mark>Sauteed Shrimp</mark> were nothing less than wonderful, and hit the spot for my seafood craving. the huge shrimp were cooked just right and served over a broth that tasted like a <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> reduction rich with butter. the cheesy garlic bread croutons absorbed this liquid on one end, but remained crunchy at the other, providing some textural contrast. it was fun to dip all the different kinds of bread from the basket in the sauce as well to see how they each paired differently. overall it was a really successful dish, and because the shrimp were so plump and the sauce so rich, it was certainly enough for my entree. one item that i might have tried as a side had i been with someone, however, was the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> - they looked fantastic. i wasn't too disheartened by not getting them, as i still had a terrific meal that was plenty filling.\n\ni wanted to order their signature butter cake dessert, but because it was $14 and i was full by that point, i decided to pass. i'm sure it's enough for two to three people so maybe next time i go and i'm not by myself i'll splurge and get it.", 
            "we went last night as a party of seven for a farewell dinner before i head to the middle east.  we requested the tree house and a round table and it was perfect.  the service all night was outstanding, water glasses never got less than half empty.  we all ordered apps, salad/soups, main course and dessert.  the escargot was great, very garlicky and the <mark>Sauteed Shrimp</mark> were excellent.  the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was good, but you could really taste the anchovy, if you don't like anchovies, stay away.\n  i had a bone in filet and it was the best, most melt in your mouth steak i have ever had.  all the steaks, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, scallops and lobster were great.  the only critique i have is that my father's <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> was quite under done.  we should have sent it back, but he refused.  overall, a great place for fine dining, bring your $$$$.", 
            "went here to the bar the other weekend.  order the <mark>Sauteed Shrimp</mark> and the <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> to munch on while we ordered some drinks.  both apps were great.  went with the classic long island and saw the bartender use top shelf booze so i was happy with that.  overall, we had a gift card to the place and came away happy and satisfied even though i wouldn't normally spend $20 per drink or app but everything was delicious none the less.\n\nnote: dress code says business casual but since it's located in a mall and it's vegas, they're pretty lenient on it."

            "in short, our meal was absolutely phenomenal-- perhaps one of the best we've ever had in vegas. with every element of the meal nearly flawless, i could not keep marveling over each little detail of our experience. yelp here has mastro's at a 4.5+ average on 250+ reviews..this is no fluke! \nwe came here for my mom's birthday dinner and my expectations were more than exceeded.\n\nwe were promptly seated for our 9:30 reservation within the \"tree house,\" as the hostess called it; it had a very loft feel to it yet was very quaint had a warm, welcoming atmosphere. i'll definitely ask to be sat in this area again. \nas we passed by the bar area, we were greeted by spectacular live music, consisting of a woman singing accompanied by a fantastic piano player (who also added in some vocals). big plus for this. \nafter immediately seating us, the hostess hurried to bring us black napkins to avoid the lint of white napkins attaching itself to our dark clothing. we didn't even ask. nice touch. \n\nrob, our waiter, and the rest of the waitstaff that took care of our table were nothing but spectacular. i was a bit worried at first as my water glass remained empty for a good 15 minutes, but this was the sole flaw of the entire evening (and a minor one at that). rob was extremely congenial, professional, yet very personable and extremely accommodating of our wishes. \n\nwe like to split things a lot when we go out to dinner so that we get our own little smorgasbord of items to try...and a smorgasbord we got! not only this, but the chefs made sure to split nearly everything that came to the table (even the bone-in steak we ordered!) now, where do i even begin...\n\n--<mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark>: caution: oxymoron... massive shrimp. the biggest shrimp i've seen in recent memory. the batter wasn't really too vanilla-tasting in my opinion, but this was a delicious starter regardless. three to an order! \n\n--burrata & heirloom tomato salad: mmm, burrata cheese is one of my favorites! yes, this was a typical salad, but the tomatoes were so fresh and the balsamic reduction was so tasty. we asked for a little bit more of this said reduction and they brought out an entire cup of it..whoops.\n\n--<mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark>: hands down the best i've ever had. not overly thick and creamy, yet perfect proportions of ingredients. piping hot when it arrived which i really appreciate with soups. \n\n--mac & cheese: ugh my mouth just waters at the thought of this. served in a skillet, the mac and cheese was perfect consistency: it wasn't drowning in sauce but it wasn't just a bowl of plain noodles with an ounce of cheese mixed in...perfect proportions (once again). on top was a layer of melted cheese that was just fantastic...i think that there were four cheeses or so just in this topper! \n\n--<mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> mignon: i really don't like throwing out the \"best i've ever had\" card very often. because, honestly, how many things can take that title? well, this definitely takes the \"best filet i've ever had\" title. join the club, <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark>. it had the taste of a ny strip, but was tender as a filet should be. and, to top it off, it is served on a 400 degree hot plate. i like my steak kept hot and this obviously got the job done. \n\n--warm butter cake: okay, now this piece of heaven really takes the cake (ha, horrible pun intended). my mom and sister are suckers for butter cake (who isn't..?) and we figured what better time to order it than for a birthday? out comes this large, circular cake and a behemoth side of whipped cream. really. view my picture to see how much there was. think of a frozen skillet just bombarded with thick, heavy whipped cream. fantastic dessert. and what's even better? rob comped this $16 dessert with the simple message of \"happy birthday, we're so happy you came in to dine with us tonight.\" winnnnnnn.\n\n\nfrom now on, every time i'm asked for a restaurant recommendation, mastro's will be the first word to escape my mouth. i cannot wait to go there again next time i've got a few bucks to blow.", 
            "came here for a friend's birthday celebration and the prices justified as much.  we gave our buddy a lot of crap for not being specific about tap water and we ended up with a fee of $20 for flat water.  oh well.  i'll take the story any day.\n\nthis is definitely a white table cloth establishment.  it's not super stuffy, but this isn't the place to roll in wearing shorts and a t-shirt.  the restaurant is beautifully designed and if you can, try to sit in the \"pod\" where you get a view of the mall interior and everyone walking around.\n\nfood was excellent.  we shared the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> and the <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark> for appetizers, and to this day, i still remember that <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark>.  probably one of the best appetizers i have had.  my main course was the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  the serving size was enormous and it brought off into perfect flakes during consumption.\n\nfor the side dishes we had the asparagus and <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>.  highly recommend either but their selection has a lot to offer.\n\nservice was attentive as expected and best of all got to use a little bit of polish.",

            "went here for christmas dinner, very disappointed. food was not good. <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark> were outrageously huge (3x the size of jumbo shrimp, might want to note that on the menu) and too thick and chewy for me. i ordered my 8oz filet medium well; the waiter confirmed it would be lightly pink in the center, and it came out charred, crunchy and bone dry. absolutely terrible.  a proper steakhouse always asks you if the steak was cooked to your liking; my waiter never asked me. \n\nmy girlfriend ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, also overcooked, and she pushed it aside after a few bites.  this place specializes in steak and seafood?  what a joke. any high class restaurant in vegas blows this place away, i've eaten at almost all of them. of all the restaurants in the $100 per person class, i'd rate mastro's dead last. \n\nservice was good, albeit a little slow. the bright spots of our meal were the pretzel bread and chocolate pudding cake, they were delicious. dining in the birdhouse was nice, but not worth the terrible food.", 
            "saturday 6pm reservation for 5 before a show. \nneat sculpture overhead and high end shops all around us in the crystals mall. \n\npeople don't know what to wear. mix of little black dresses, spandex, sport coats n jeans. \n\ncouple rounds of cocktails which are fast n strong. bread was great as described on yelp.  service was spot on. lots of people refilling water n clearing plates. \nstart with <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark>, calamari n tuna tartar.  nothing spectacular but not my choices. \nordered spinach salad n 8 oz filet medium. it's a little too rare for me but good. 3 other steaks, but wife orders some fish that flew in on our plane with us. i'm not sure why you come from the gulf to the desert n order fish.  i guess nothing is local in vegas but snake. \nsides were cream spinach (not as good as mine), brussel sprouts (excellent) and gnocchi which was amazing. add 4 wines by the glass. \n \nwe were tempted with butter cake but held off. \n$633 before tip.", 
            "it's become a family tradition to dine at mastro's ocean club every new year's eve. we're from los angeles but spend a lot of time at our home in las vegas and this location is by far the best location we've been to. the service is top notch and, of course, the food is absolutely delicious. every. single. time. highly recommend the <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark> and scallop appetizers. the bone in filet will ruin all other cuts of meat for you. the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> will change your life. the butter cake will clog your arteries and might send you into cardiac arrest, but hey, at least you will die happy. silver linings.", 
            "the fourth new discovery that was a five-star worthy dining experience was at mastro's ocean club.  i had heard good things about this place for at least two years, and before then espied its distinctive wooden bird's nest with admiration at its quite innovative and modern design just before the restaurant's opening inside the shops at crystals.\n\nit was the day of our 25th wedding anniversary, and our request for seating inside the nest was granted.  it actually felt like being two young birds sheltered inside a protective nest.  not only that, but we were surprised at meal's end with a complimentary warm butter cake ala mode, mastro's signature dessert.  this was a great mouth-watering end to a very memorable meal, as the soft cake seemed to melt in the mouth. \n\nbut the beginning of our meal was no less auspicious.  after enjoying a bread basket that included large homemade pretzel breadsticks, diane and i dove into succulent hot <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark>.  these big crustaceans bursting with flavor really deserve to be called \"prawns\" rather than \"shrimp,\" and did deliver a taste of vanilla in the light batter--but not overpoweringly so.\n\nfor our main we each ordered an 8-oz filet, which here is called a \"<mark>Petite Filet</mark>,\" along with 1-1/2 lbs. of <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>.  both tender steaks were cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, and with little char on top.  accompanying bearnaise sauce was drinkable, and a peppercorn sauce was not far behind.  the hot and long sections of <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> were pulled out of the pot at exactly the right moment  and presented as already opened legs, so no prying with tools was necessary.  they tasted great dunked in warm drawn butter.  and while diane praised her large and cheesy twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark>, i delighted in a huge mound of skinny sea salt & <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark>, which was reported to be a small rather than regular-sized version.  sauteed mushrooms were lovely, too, but i hardly needed them.  we were stuffed.  \n\nwith a ratio of about one waiter for every four guests, service was great.  our knowledgeable and conscientious server checked on us several times, and water refills were regularly poured without any need to request them.  even with the restaurant packed with guests, the ambiance inside the bird's nest section of the restaurant was romantic, intimate, and classy.\n\nmastro's is pricey to be sure.  but, executing well at delivering artfully prepared high-quality offerings from both land and sea, there is a reason why several local diners in the know call this one of the best restaurants in las vegas.  without question we will soon become repeat guests."

            "i admit i had my reservations dining in the middle of a mall, albeit a nice one, dining in the treehouse room felt intimate and classy.  in the grand scheme of steakhouses, i'd rate the food a solid 4, perhaps a 5, but the attention to detail by the staff, fantastic cocktails, wonderful ambiance, and late hours helped mastro's earn a 5th star in its belt.\n\ni was a bit peeved that we had to wait almost 30 minutes for our table at the bar, but the generous cocktail pours helped soothe the senses.  plus, we were late to our reservation by an hour and a half so i had to throw them a bone (haha!).  we arrived around 10:30pm and were surprised to find a happening bar scene and a 75% full dining room.  we left past 1am, but the staff was gracious and didn't try to rush us out even when we were the second to last table in the restaurant.\n\nthe food was delicious.  we may have over ordered on the appetizers, but we hadn't eaten in 12 hours so we figured we would indulge a bit.  very fresh oysters with all the fixings with lemon halves that were wrapped in cheesecloth and speared onto a fork.  great detail.  <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> plate was also good.  the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> was ok - good, but certainly have had better.  my bone-in rib-eye was great.  cooked a little past medium rare, but still tasted wonderful - a nice char on the outside, lightly salted crust.  the side dishes were also good, in particular the mac and cheese, but get it while it's still warm.  at the end of our meal, our coffee order came out a bit lukewarm, but it was close to closing time so i gave them a pass.  in honor of the groom, the staff also brought out a dessert with the words \"don't do it!\" written in chocolate on the borders of the plate.  again, great attention to detail.\n\ni really think this is where mastro's shines.  the details.  we were asked whether we wanted a black napkin versus a white one to minimize lint getting onto dark pants when we sat down.  i just received a phone call today asking whether we enjoyed our experience and to visit again.  i might have had a better steak elsewhere (not by much), but it's a real pleasure to dine somewhere that focuses on the little details that elevate a dining experience into a fine dining experience.  bravo mastro's - i will be back.", 
            "the meal may have taken 3+ hours (we had a large group and were in no rush, but still) but man, was it fantastic.\n\nthe group started with the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, and some shrimp dish (i'm allergic so i don't remember what it was exactly). the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> was delicious. not anything special necessarily, but it sure was delicious. the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> was cooked perfectly and came with such a delicious sauce, a superb aioli as opposed to the more traditional tomato sauce.\n\none thing the group really appreciated was that mastro's agreed to specially make a burger for one individual who didn't want to eat steak. of course, the individual got sick, but we were so appreciative of their willingness to accommodate us that we asked to have the burger brought out and we all shared it - cut it up into sliders. they were melt-in-your-mouth incredible. for a classy steakhouse, mastro's sure makes an incredible burger.\n\ni had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> for my entree, most everyone else had steaks. boy am i glad i went with the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> though, i was already feeling a bit full from the appetizers and then the sides on top sure was a lot of food. the fish was cooked perfectly, seasoned excellently. flaky and fairly light actually, it was a good sized helping as well. would definitely get again.\n\nfor sides the table all raved about the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, but i'm allergic, so i couldn't eat it. which was fine by me because the gorgonzola mac & cheese was heavenly. and the portion of the side was enormous. honestly, i could've had the mac and cheese side as my entire meal and gone home happy.\n\nfood was great, service was as good as expected, just a wonderful meal overall. would go back again in a heart beat.", 
            "what an amazing experience with mastro's!\\u00a0\nwe came in with a large party for a christmas dinner. this was most of my guests first time dining here. we had a view of the treehouse, love the architecture! there was no wait for a table.\\u00a0\nwe started with calamari, <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>. the bread basket was to die for! we enjoyed <mark>New York Strip</mark>, filet, chicken, artic char, and my favorite the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>! we had so many sides, they were all wonderful!\\u00a0\nour servers trista and daniel were wonderful. very friendly, always made sure we had a drink and were happy. and the manager luciana checked on us a few times making sure we were enjoying each course.\\u00a0\nbest dinner in vegas ever! can't wait to return!"

            "this was a 5 star anniversary dinner for us!  amazing!\n\nlocation:  you cannot beat dining in a \"tree house\" in the crystals mall.  very cool!  i loved the live music that i could hear from the lower levels of the mall.\n\nservice:  mike r was our server.  he was completely patient and totally helpful.  he gave us a taste of two different wines when we were trying to decide on a bottle.  he was great with any questions we had.  great guy and a huge asset to the restaurant.\n\nfood:  the bread basket was amazing and beautifully presented.  wish i could have tried everything without filling up before dinner!   <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark>, bone in filet, ribeye (bone in), au gratin potaotes, and compliementary butter cake (for our anniversary!).  i loved every bite of our meal.  the food was superb.\n\ndrink:  as mentioned, mike r let us sample the wines, and we selected the earthquake, which he stated was from a boutique winery.  huge thumbs up!!!!!  next visit will include one of the cool looking cocktails!\n\nthis was a great, great meal!  mastos hit everything on the mark, and have two satisfied customers who can't wait to return!", 
            "completely disappointed by maestro's restaurant in las vegas.  i read such wonderful reviews on yelp and was really looking forward to it. my husband and i went there for our 1 year wedding anniversary dinner. i made reservations a month before the big day and requested to have a bottle of champagne upon our arrival.  \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> to start.  it took about 20 minutes for them to take that initial order and another 20-30 minutes for them to bring it out.  the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> was so salty and came with a weird <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> combination on top as aside. the dressing of the salad ruined the flavor of the meat if the salt didn't already to it. \n\nas our main entrees we ordered a <mark>Petite Filet</mark> and lamp chops. dry, dry, dry! i'm sorry but if we are paying over +$50 a plate we expect mouth watering tender meat.  that wasn't the case at all. so disappointed. \n\nto end the evening we were so disappointed by the slow service, the bad appetizer and unsatisfactory entr\\u00e9e we didn't even want dessert. as the waiter brings the +$200 check he just says happy anniversary and walks away.  no complimentary dessert or glass of champagne as most places would have done. oh well...i will go back to sage inside aria which is the best steak house i have ever been too.", 
            "the bad - made reservations at 9, didn't get seated until 10, paying $15 for a drink, it better be a damn good drink. far from it. we are in vegas there are plenty of options at here, so for not being in a club, i didn't want to pay $15 for a bad drink\n\ni split the special - waygu steak bone in, it was a huge piece of meat, but for a $100 i truly didn't see why this was such an expensive piece of meat \n\nthe good - the manger did come over due to us waiting an hour before we got seated and she brought over some <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> which was some of the best i have ever had.\n\nthe ok - <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, sounded better then they tasted.\n\ni wouldn't recommend this place and i will not be coming back.", 
            "visited for lunch last year.  food quality is fantastic.  great cocktail menu.  would definitely try dinner when i have the chance.  service was great, but restaurant was not busy when i was there.  the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> as a starter is wicked!!  big wine list also!!", 
            "a good friend of ours suggested mastro's when we asked for a recommendation for a seafood on the strip. so i made a reservation online for that night at 7pm on the mastro's website. what i didn't know was that i had somehow clicked on the chicago location. luckily i was walking around the crystals shopping center that afternoon and went to check out the venue and was chatting with one of the hostesses who offered to check on our reservation to confirm it .. good thing she did and we fixed my error. they were pretty booked that night but were able to squeeze us in. :) \n\nthe service was pretty much top-notch from start to finish, hostesses, servers, and bussers,  all were very attentive and knowledgeable as well as being friendly and personable. loved that they dish out our sides for us .. that's a really nice touch. \n\nthe food, we had a variety of items which were all delicious but at the top of our favorites were the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> and the signature <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. both are must haves to accompany any steak or seafood dish. we had the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious as well as the pan seared <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which my dining companions said was spectacularly prepared and seasoned. \n\ndessert was over the top .. we had three .. mastro's signature warm butter cake, \nthe cherry crisp, and the profiteroles. the first two were topped with vanilla bean gelato. both were to die for. i had read lots about the warm butter cake and it was everything i had expected and more :) .. and surprisingly i also loved the cherry crisp .. i am not huge on cherry anything but the flavor had just the right amount of sweetness and was not overpowering and the crisp part is a crumbly granola like topping which is an nice balance with the gelato and fruitiness of the dish. it's something i would definitely order again! \n\nmy only complaint is that the server didn't warn us about the size of the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> appetizer. mom and i each ordered our own, and when they came out .. they were absolutely gigantic and even though we had a party of 5 we were unable to finish both. being in the service industry myself, i would have definitely warned my guests about the size of the carpaccio dish and suggested something else to order with it. \n\nall in all it was a fabulous dinner, the restaurant, even though it is in a busy mall .. has a nice ambiance, and we will absolutely be back.", 
            "3.5 stars- definitely better than 3 stars, but not quite 4.\n\nthis restaurant is location in the middle of crystals on the strip.  from the outside looking in, the restaurant is inside a neat sculptured \"treehouse\". it sort of made me feel like if would be cool to eat in there, but sitting on the inside of the treehouse looking out i feel a little disappointed, because i felt like i was eating in an \"upscale\" food court with views of retail stores, such as  lv, jimmy choo, and zegna.  not exactly, the scene i expected  from an expensive restaurant, however on the other side there was a piano bar.\n\nhowever, service was impeccable, except we were only told the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> was out when we ordering rather than beforehand.  in a rush we picked <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> as our appetizer, husband ordered mac & cheese, we shared the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>,  <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> and <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  \n\nwe ordered a bottle of schramberg blanc de blanc for $70. given it is about $27 in retail that markup isn't terrible, beside by the glass ranged from $15 to $30. the wine list is comprehensive.\n\ni am kind of bored with <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark>, but it was definitely above average and the portion size of the appetizer is the size of a meal.  it is presented like a tower with the base made of crushed fried wontons, then avocado almost like guacamole, then the seasoned tuna.  \n\nthe mac & cheese was a huge portion that could feed 4 people on its own or 6 side servings.  i just had to have a bite, it was creamy, cheesy and tangy all the same time; i like the addition of gorgonzola, which still remained subtle.   definitely an adult upscale mac & cheese. \n\n<mark>Chopped Salad</mark> was solid and i like how we were told the ingredients and asked if we wanted to omit anything.\n\nthe king crab comes warm when it is an entree and that was a bit unexpected, but tasted sweet and drowned in the drawn butter....ooooh, so good. i was surprised how meaty the 1 lb of legs were...easily filling up one person.  \n\ni love <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> prepared any way, but i it was pan-fried to perfection.  the outside crusty and the inside soft and buttery. the seasoning was just salt.  the serving size is probably 8 oz, which is ample and justifies the price.\n\nno room for dessert, but a slice of  chocolate layer cake with schlag (whipped cream) was on the house since it was my birthday.  very generous.\n\noverall, pretty good, but again i couldn't get past the view which cheapened the ambiance. we left with enough food for another dinner so that was good too.\n\ndon't know why it is called \"beach club\".  the environment doesn't in any way demonstrate a \"beach club\".  that may be a good thing, though.\n\nwill i go again? probably not, i think joe's seafood (not the crab shack) has a better ambiance and food, except the fish here is better.", 
            "beautiful restaurant that catches your eye. the staff was really nice and knowledgeable. the food is pricey but it's located inside of crystals so that's to be expected. the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> was delicious, the oysters were fresh and my mom ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which was perfectly cooked and tasty. i told them that it was my mother's birthday and they brought out a cake with a candle for her on the house. great surprise. great staff, great food and overall great experience! a must to check out."

            "let me preface by saying we're here for the architecture. as such, it's a 5 star \"treehouse\" experience in a magnificently creative space. i felt like we were dining in a modern interpretation of a jack and the beanstalk tree house above superman's fortress of solitude. enough imagery, onward to the food review.\n\nthe <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was amazing, the cod was very good; but the blackened halibuts were overdone (even the one we had specified medium rare). we also had <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, a <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, and a salad - all done very well. sides of <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and mushrooms were also on cue.\n\nas such,  we made no mention of the less than perfect preparation of the halibut. yet, a dessert arrived at the conclusion of our dinners, compliments of the house, as if the chef could read our minds. maybe this is the real superman's fortress of solitude!", 
            "i'm not sure if it was me expecting too much because all my other mastro's experiences in california were uh-ma-zing, but this experience at mastro's in las vegas was very much so a disappointment.  i'm with brad t, only 3 stars.... =(\n\n1.  kunomoto oysters were ordered off menu and pretty fresh and tasty, but i've had better.\n2.  by the time we finished our oysters, which was only a few minutes because we eat fast, we started our cold <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>.  i don't know about other people's experiences, but we've always had our <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> kind of toasty.  though it was crab-a-licious, i was put off by the temperature.\n3.  our 22 oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was cooked rare plus and it was delicious!  the extra sear with clarified butter is fantastic.  however, i was not pleased with the amount of connective tissue in my half of the steak.  i felt like i was prepping my own meal by having to cut through all that chewy stuff!\n4.  here's the moment of utmost disappointment.  i was thinking about my fluffy, warm and tasty butter cake all night long, and it was a butter cake fail.  it was not warm and fluffy as i remember.  it was actually almost grainy and almost cold on the outside, save the inside was warm but almost soggy.  the wonderful airy whipped cream was actually heavy and too sweet.\n\nconclusion:  for being open for 6 months, should i expect it to be where its other mastro counterparts are in amazing-ness, or should i expect it to be working out its kinks and be amazing 6 more months down the line?  regardless of kinks or not, i'm a sad puppy because other than the yummy steak mixed with connective tissue bits, everything else was just average compared to my other mastro's experiences.  mastro's did not rise to the occasion to it's reputation.  will i go back?  for the love of butter cake, i will after more time has passed for this particular establishment.\n\n[side note: if you do try this particular mastro's, do asked to be sit in the nice atrium with the mollusk looking wooden structure and not right outside of it.  i think you will get better service.  it seems as if the table we were sitting at is a \"blind spot\".  the servers liked to walk over an peer over the railing next to you and chat about the stores and patrons below as if you weren't there.]", 
            "came here with a couple friends.  we were sat in the modern tree house which over looked the crystals mall, i would definitely ask to be sat there.  everyone was hungry so we got right down to business, <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark> and <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> to start followed by the 22oz bone in ribeye for myself with <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.   apps were flavorful,  steak was cooked perfectly midrare and the sides dishes were great .  service was impeccable as expected. overall great dinning experience, wasn't the best steak i've had but definitely worth trying even though technically this restaurants prime focus is seafood.", 
            "my boyfriend and i came here with his parents and the first point i'll make to get your attention is that our bill came out $450. now that i've got your attention.\n\nservice: one word excellent. i'd like to start off by saying that i came here for my 21st birthday and you know how usually you'll mention it to restaurants in hopes of getting something free and they'll come out with some weak bite sized dessert. my boyfriend's parents were the one who mentioned it and i quickly got a happy birthday and i expected nothing of it after. but for dessert i actually got a full on, very generous portion of a piece of chocolate cake (with raspberries!). it had come while i was in the bathroom so i wasn't expecting the waiter to relight it again but he actually did! the waiters were very nice, they made jokes and conversation (not just about food but where we were from, etc) they really knew their stuff, like not just knew what the specials were but they were very knowledgeable about their menu.\n\nfood: for starters we ordered escargot, chilled seafood, and <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>. the escargot was probably the disappointment of the evening. i've had much better elsewhere. there was just no taste or not a great taste. it wasn't gross or anything but i've just basically tasted better marinated or sauced escargot. for the chilled seafood, you're allowed to pick however many pieces you want and what seafood you want on it. it came in this platter that had dry ice in it. the shrimp were so plump and juicy. the crab was the best part though. i don't even know how to describe it but my boyfriend and i were fighting for the last pieces, just popping them into our mouths one by one. \n-<mark>Rack of Lamb</mark>: so juicy! it was probably the best lamb i've ever had. the taste was there, it was perfectly cooked. \n\ndessert: we ordered their signature cake and it was very unique. i don't think i\"ve ever tasted anything like it but i wasn't raving about it as much as the rest of my table were. it tasted like butterscotch or toffee angel/sponge cake. i couldn't really put my foot on what it was, it was just so different. \n\nbathroom: this is actually the first bathroom i've been to where it had a bathroom attendant who handed you towels. they had tampons and other amenities on the counter. she opened and closed the door for me. it's too bad i didn't have my wallet to tip her but she was very nice. \n\nview: where we were seated, you could basically look out into the mall and people watch. \n\nmy boyfriend and i will definitely be back to this chain, maybe for an anniversary.", 
            "this is my favorite place to eat in las vegas. although it's basically a restaurant located in the middle of a shopping mall (albeit an upscale mall), it is a very pleasurable dining experience. the food here is incredible. the lemon drops are fantastic and entertaining as they are served smoking and bubbling. excellent wines on the wine list. the filet here is magnificent. the truffle lobster gnocchi is out of this world. the side dishes are excellent and feed about four or five people. the warm butter cake is spectacular and is served with a huge bowl of some of the best whipped cream we have tasted. unfortunately, one of the people in our party ordered the <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> and was disappointed with them as she thought they were over seasoned and almost tasted as though they were seasoned with poultry seasoning. the last time we ate at mastro's ocean the service was tad bit better, but compared to the poor service that we've been receiving lately, the service was outstanding. did i mention the live pianist? some of the people in our party thought they were listening to some recorded billy joel music and were surprised when they found out that it was actually a young man playing the piano.",

            "if you want classy, high end, and delicious food.. go to mastro's! my husband and i love mastro's. the <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> (appetizer) and butter cakes (dessert) are to die for! the atmosphere is very inviting and romantic, and the servings are very generous. i was full after eating just bread, my appetizer, and side salad! lol our most recent visit was on valentine's day evening. we were seated in the private dining area upstairs and were very pleased with the service. our waiter was extremely friendly and informative if we had any questions regarding anything on the menu. the hostesses were very welcoming and easy to talk to over the phone when making reservations. our most recent visit was fantastic! they even gave us a butter cake \"on the house\" as a thank you for visiting them on valentine's day (score!). we had a wonderful experience and overall, the food, atmosphere, service, experience, etc, was all top notch! highly recommended. \n\nthe only thing i had a problem with, was halfway through our meal, we noticed there were so many servers and waiters, some of them stood around and walked around aimlessly (within the private dining area, instead of out in the hall) because, well... i don't know.. maybe they just couldn't find anything to do because there were so many of them? it made me a bit uncomfortable as i felt i was being watched or stared at. i'm sure this was due to the fact that valentine's day was a busy one for them, so i'm sure it's not normal. but, still..", 
            "for starters i really wanted to give this place a great review because the food was good, but after receiving my bill i just can't do it.\n\nour total bill came up to $243.23. that's not my complaint. my complaint is that we left a cash tip and when we saw the charge on the card, it was for $291.88. i'm glad i kept my receipt.\n\nthis prompted a call from me to the restaurant today to find out why there was an additional $47.00 charged to my card without disclosing it to me. the manager told me that the company they use automatically adds a 20% gratuity to the bill. \n\nthis was not disclosed to us by the waitress. it was not disclosed on our receipt. in fact, when i called, he said they receive that complaint at least 5 times a day, as if that's the normal order of business. fix it if people are complaining. you have no right to charge them an additional 20% without disclosing this before  they eat.\n\ntips are voluntary, not mandatory unless disclosed. i leave my tips in cash and i always cross out the tip line on the receipt.  the money isn't the issue,its the principle that they have no right to take my money without my permission. that is basically theft. \n\nso now, i have to wait 2-3 business days for the additional $47 to be refunded to my card, which means i won't see my money until tuesday or wednesday, since we ate there friday night. other than this absurd experience with my bill, here is a review on the food.\n\n1) the customer service is great except for not disclosing that i'll be charged an additional 20% even if you leave a cash tip.\n\n2) the  <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> were good, but both my wife and i had a small piece of shell. nothing worth complaining about.\n\n3) my wife had the blackened ribeye. it was delicious.\n\n4) i had <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark>. it was delicious.\n\n5) twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> was good.\n\n6) gorgonzola mac & cheese was good.\n\n7) <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> was good.\n\n8) calamari was just ok.\n\n9) the complimentary bread was mostly hard except for the pretzels. i don't mind a mix of breads, but when the majority are hard, its just not for us. \n\noverall, the food was good, but we will not be going back until the change they policy of charging people an additional 20% without their knowledge.\n\nif you eat here pay cash.", 
            "i brought clients here on a thursday evening for dinner around 800 pm. i recommend reservations since  the place gets busy. my clients who arrived from denver around a year ago and never experienced mastro's previously so i knew they were in for a treat.\n\nwe started off with drinks at the table  once we were  seated and were brought the awesome bread basket -  i indulged in the pretzel bread yum! we ordered a few appetizers - scallops, <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> and ordered our starter salads. i opted for just the 1/2 salad of the <mark>Iceberg Wedge</mark> - it's plenty large and so yummy. for my main entree i went for he <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> and we shared several twice cooked potatoes and cream spinach. everything was spectacular and the service was stellar! my lamb was cooked to perfection and  my clients were impressed as i expected. the only con was nobody had room for buttercake!\n\ni received a telephone call from mastrro's the following day thanking me for my business which again is so out of the box. i'm happy to see even with the change of ownership that nothing has changed here!", 
            "not that this restaurant needs anymore reviews...\nso, i'll keep it short and sweet.\n\ni've been to this place twice now. it's awesome. hands down the best place for seafood i've been to in vegas. \n\nawesome service, love the ambiance and they have the yummiest breads.\n\ni would suggest:\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>\n<mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>\n<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>\n\nif you want a fancy dinner and you're dressed to impress, this would be a lovely place to hit up. just make reservations :)", 
            "we splurged (again) to enjoy mastro's great food and service.  this last visit was our second visit and we weren't disappointed at all.  tip: to guarantee your spot, always make a reservation.  las vegas ocean club has the beautiful tree house and i even asked to sit in there.  they brought us to the bar while we waited for our table.  \n\ni was pleasantly surprised that the drinks we ordered were actually strong; usually other restaurants are stingy with their alcohol.  maybe it was due to being in las vegas, but those drinks were tasty and strong.  a few minutes later we were seated inside the tree house.  the staff were very attentive to us.  we ordered <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> and a filet to share. a couple of side orders of veggies, salad, <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> and some bread completed our meal.  i really thought that we would not have enough food but i couldn't finish it all!\n\nwe promised ourselves that we would come back just for dessert- and we did return the next day! - just for the chocolate pudding cake and their cheesecake.  i love their pudding cake and i am not a chocolate person!  again, their service was outstanding. crazy busy on a friday or saturday night or slow like a sunday dinner, the staff never forgot about you.\n\nif you ever want to experience great service and food - consistently, mastro's ocean club in las vegas is a sure bet.", 
            "so as we walk into this place i was very skeptical to think that they would produce good food because on the outside all you see if the tree house and you kind of don't understand how to get in here but then we walked in and it finally made sense.we were celebrating our cousins birthday so there was four of us.\n\nso let's start with appetizers we had the <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> which here they were your typical <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> nothing special but still tasted petty good.\n\nbone marrow!! i'm telling you it's the business here! they were served with mini toasted bagettes buttered on the grill and the little salad they had on the side was an awesome pairing.i would definitely order it again yummy!\n\nso the waiter recommended that we try the 33oz wagyu tomahawk ribeye and i'm glad we ordered this steak. and for 88 bucks i expected another mediocre steak but boy was i wrong. i asked the waiter when the steak came out if i needed any sauces for this steak and i was thrown off on how he immediately said no trust me eat it as is.. the most awesome steak i've had in my life so far..i was so satisfied from first bite to finish and now look to have this steak on a regular.my wife also agreed and sister and cousin felt that was a phenomenal steak! thank you so much for the experience\n\nour cousin and sister had the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> and for me i'm not too much of a lamb guy but they insisted that i try it and i was amazed because normally when i eat lamb it's too gamy for me but this was an awesome prepared lamb chop so thank you for that because it totally changed my perspective on lamb.\n\nas for the sides that we enjoyed with our meal we had <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and asparagus and cream corn.they went with our meal and i will say my favorite thing was the cream corn and the recommended lobster mash felt like it was just your simple mash potatoes and gravy with lobster on top..still it was delicious\n\nsince we were celebrating a birthday or waiter gave us the also recommended butter cake on the house which was very nice and i think the dessert is not as good as they say. but we all enjoyed it overall the steak is what i will come back for it was such a great meal.", 
            "absolutely wonderful. probably the best meal i have eaten in vegas in years.\nit was my husband's birthday so i made reservations. i wasn't that impressed with the venue, almost like a food court in crystals, city center. but the service and attention from the moment we arrived more than made us feel special.\nwe had <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, mussels, filet and <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. super heated plates, everything cooked to perfection. we shared everything and had more than enough food for two. oh and a couple of bottles of wine. the prices were not silly! i had mentioned on the reservation that it was a birthday and an absolutely phenomenal dessert was brought to the table with no prompt from me. the manager personally visited the table and left a card.\nthe following morning i received a call asking how we enjoyed ourselves. who does that?? perfect attention to detail.", 
            "mastro's ocean club is a fine dining establishment located in the aria hotel and casino. the ambiance is set well, the architecture is particularly astounding, and the service is exquisite. our server, joe, was on his game. my water glass and wine glass never reached half empty (or half full). ordered the bone marrow, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, sauteed broccoli, gorgonzola mac and cheese, 22 oz. <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, and mastro's signature warm butter cake. \n\nbone marrow - holy donkey punching jesus this is astounding. i have never had bone marrow before but its alluring presence on the menu was enough for me to sample it. the bone marrow comes half charred on a split bone with a serving of toasted baguette to spread on. the flavor, the texture, the taste and everything about it was amazing. i will order this every time and you should as well.\n\n<mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> - hearty <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> with more crab than cake. in fact the cakes fall apart to the softest touch, the chunks of crab meat separating with ease as only a minimal amount of filler has been used. flavor and spice is more than enough to accent the cakes.\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> - oftentimes <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> comes heavily buttered, even in the most finest of dining establishment. butter is an easy thing to add to a dish to increase its flavor without actually improving on its originality and substance. however, mastro's <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> does not perpetuate this and, rather, has a full-bodied bisque with a generous portion of lobster inside. the thickness is akin to how a bisque should be.\n\nsauteed broccoli - opting to go a slightly healthier route with one of the dishes i was still impressed but of course, it's sauteed broccoli, and only so much can be done while keeping it true.\n\ngorgonzola mac and cheese - a perfect compliment to my <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and a hearty side at that. it's a shame our hotel fridge has a monitored scale with a restocking fee otherwise i would have had no issue taking the remainder of this with me.\n\n22 oz. <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> - one of the finer ribeyes i have had. a generous amount of fat and it was seared and salted well enough to make it exceedingly juicy. cooked to perfection (rare) with a cool red center while the black crust of searing on iron was still present. \n\nmastro's signature warm butter cake - fuck. that's amazing.\n\nthe servings sizes of sides are plentiful and the prices are what you'd expect at such an establishment. be wary of those giving mastro's a bad review due to price or service, such an establishment would be careful to hire only proven servers and i would wager that the reviewers themselves to be the standoffish party.", 
            "one of the best meals our group agrees we've had. even the simplest details, from the almost-double-portion martinis to the piping hot pretzel rolls are well-considered and designed to impress and welcome. steak was incredible, portions were generous. we couldn't decide if the \"blackened\" finish or the truffle butter won more accolades, but i doubt you can go wrong. \n\ni had the petit (6oz) filet mignon with a crab cake to create my own little \"surf & turf\". again, portions were above and beyond so it was almost more than i could finish. having lived in boston and maryland i'm extremely well-versed in seafood, especially lobster and <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, so i tend not to order these items freely elsewhere. the crab cake was pan-fried but still great. (i tend to prefer broiled.) the steak was better than top steak houses in dc/ny. honestly. find a way to get steak and seafood into your meal!\n\nfor \"family style\" sides we ordered <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> (unnecessary), <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> (food heaven), <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (must get), and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (i didn't even bother as i had too much more interesting food already). the server actually walks around to distribute the sides as you like, which again was a wonderful touch for our group of 9. \n\nother winners: shrimp sushi roll, all martinis, espresso drinks, tomato/burrata salad. \n\nour server was really fantastic. friendly, efficient, doting, and plenty loud which again, is very important when you have lists of specials to communicate enthusiastically and a long table of 9 semi-rowdy friends.\n\nwe used to actually go off the strip to find hidden top steakhouse gems but now maestro's in crystal center will be the go-to. \n\nif you have only one good/fancy/formal meal for your trip: go here.", 
            "i have been to this restaurant 3 times, and each time gets worse and worse. \n\n\n1: was seated, and unattended to for 5 minutes. no menus, water, nothing. this would be understandable if the restaurant was busy, but 7-8 servers were just standing around talking on the opposite side. \n\n2: i ordered a glass of wine and the proper way to serve it would be to have me try it first before pouring the glass. it was brought out like a coctail. \n\n3: i was given 2 choices for water- flat and sparkling. i said flat and was charged $17 for 3 glasses of water filled twice. \n\non to the food....\n\ni have long given up on the entrees at mastros. i have never received an entree that lived up to standards. \n\nwe ordered the following:\n\n<mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark>- pretty good \n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>- delicious\ncrab coctail- amazing\n<mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>- way too fishy\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>- amazing\ngorgonzola mac n cheese- too rich for my taste. could only have one bite \nbrussel sprouts- perfect\nbone marrow- burnt to a crisp and could not scrape any marrow out \nbutter cake- the one thing that saved the entire meal \n\nin the future , i will have dinner elsewhere and come to mastro's for coffee and dessert only."

            "mastro's ocean club is a gem that you cannot miss next time you're on the strip.  located in the newly designed city center, just look for the beautifully designed \"tree house\", which hangs high above the ultra chic boutiques in crystals that only the richest of the rich can actually shop in.  be sure to request a table inside the tree house...it's where all the cool kids sit. \n\nmastro's is not cheap, but then again, nothing in vegas is.  in any case, it's worth every penny because the food is outstanding.  i started off with a very rich and tasty new england <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark>.  for my entree, i went with the porcini mushroom crusted <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with fried spinach.  it was light but delicious!! perfect for lunch.  for the side dish, what else but the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>! i'm not talking about lobster flavored <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  no, no, not at mastro's.  i'm talking about over a pound of lobster mixed in the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  it was soooo good and was big enough that all four of us could enjoy it with plenty to spare.  although we were happily stuffed, our waiter brought out their signature butter cake with fresh whipped cream on the side for dessert; with his compliments (a very nice touch, which only further highlighted the tremendous service that we had during our entire meal). i highly recommend getting this dessert no matter how full you are. we all loved it.\n\ni should note that the cocktails were also great.  make sure you get one of their signature martinis, which comes with dry ice on the bottom of the glass that makes the drink bubble and emit smoke.  pretty cool. \n\nalthough i was able to get a table for four for lunch on a saturday with ease through opentable, that won't last long because the restaurant only opened up 2 weeks ago and the buzz is still building.  soon, mastro's will one of the hottest tables in vegas so get in while you can.", 
            "went there with the girlfriend before ka. got the <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> to share, she got the <mark>Broiled Live Maine Lobster</mark> (mkt price) and i got the round eye steak. we each got a martini. \n<mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> was ok, we had better at the fisherman's wharf in san francisco. \n<mark>Broiled Live Maine Lobster</mark> was a bit overpriced but very fresh. 5 waiters came to take out the shell! girlfriend was amazed\nround eye steak was very  generous. well cooked, and the outside was pretty crispy despite asking for medium rare. inside was soft and moist as expected.\ngot the cream spinach on the side.\nmartinis were very strong and plentiful. water melon martini was very good. we definitely started to speak more loudly and laughing for no reason after a few full glasses. \natmosphere overall feels very open, live music is excellent. waiters were attentive and professional without feeling overwhelmingly present. girlfriend had a great time so it deserves the 4 stars. overall, a great experience though a tad pricey, especially the lobster.", 
            "my friend treated me to dinner here for my birthday, and it was fabulous. \n\ni would've rated it as five stars, but i had a couple things that bothered me. first, we had a reservation, and came about 15 minutes early so we could grab a drink at the bar first. we checked in, but were not seated until about 20 minutes past our reservation. not a big fan of having to wait that long past the reservation time. second, i'm not a big fan of the dress code. it's supposed to be fine dining, and it is a beautiful restaurant. but, the fact that you see customers simply wearing t-shirts and jeans kind of ruins the whole thing. \n\nother than that - all was dandy. service was impeccable, but i would hope so considering the amount you pay to eat there. \n\nfood wise - we got oysters as appetizers. they were very fresh and tasted great. the <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> we ordered was decent, but nothing to rave about. i've had plenty of other <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> that easily beat the one at mastro's. the steaks we ordered were cooked to perfection, and were complimented well by the sauteed mushrooms. \n\nsince it was my birthday - they did give us free chocolate cake, which was nice. very light, fluffy, & moist. but, we did also order the warm butter cake, which i think most would agree is a must. man, the chocolate cake was nothing in comparison. \n\noverall, great place. would definitely go back again, when i have the money to spare. \n\nand on a completely random note - they do serve <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> at this establishment, which surprised me. this fish is known to be highly over fished and is on seafood watch's list of fish to avoid. just thought i'd let you know.", 
            "we were excited to dine at this acclaimed restaurant. my husband ordered the garlic mashed potatos, the filet and <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> soup.\nthe soup was superb, the finest he has ever tasted, the steak was tender and quite tasty, the mashed potaoes too were great. however the potatos were extremely salty. good but salty. so be aware. i ordered the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>, sauted spinach and <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark>.  salad was very good, <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark> were wonderful too. spinach was very good but had way too tuch garlic for my taste. our server and all of the staff were extreemly attentive and provided  excellent service which made the dinner even more enjoyable.  upon leaving we mentioned that the potatos were oversalted and only received a comment \"we know\" thanks for the feedback.  we would go back to dine here again but not order the potatos.", 
            "this is our 1st time at any of the mastro's restaurants.  we have family & friends in the vegas area who recommended & accompanied this as a truly upscale & 4-to-5 star dining experience.  they were correct!  \n\nupon being seated practically in the center of their 60 ft teak or mahogany simulated treehouse, we asked the very crisply uniformed captain to recommend the appetizers.  he had us create our own \"seafood tower\" and we chose <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark>, shrimp, oysters & calamari... delish!  the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> & <mark>Iceberg Wedge</mark> were next.  the five of us then shared a filet, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, atlantic salmon & scallops with garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  our captain went over and above as he assisted us in choose the appropriate wine to pair with our culinary choices.\n\nnow.. we would come back for all of this goodness, but the mastro's butter cake is one of a kind and is worth the whole meal or just to drop in for dessert after shopping.  \n\nneedless to say & in keeping with my \"positively outrageously\" great dining recommendations, you have to enjoy mastro's if you're in vegas!", 
            "i was more into the live entertainment than the food.  bone in ribeye was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  sides were just aiight - mac and cheese, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark>, salad, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, sauteed asparagus, sauteed mushrooms.  eating in a mall just doesn't feel as nice although we did see tyson chandler from the mavs.  i'd come back to try their seafood.", 
            "in short, our meal was absolutely phenomenal-- perhaps one of the best we've ever had in vegas. with every element of the meal nearly flawless, i could not keep marveling over each little detail of our experience. yelp here has mastro's at a 4.5+ average on 250+ reviews..this is no fluke! \nwe came here for my mom's birthday dinner and my expectations were more than exceeded.\n\nwe were promptly seated for our 9:30 reservation within the \"tree house,\" as the hostess called it; it had a very loft feel to it yet was very quaint had a warm, welcoming atmosphere. i'll definitely ask to be sat in this area again. \nas we passed by the bar area, we were greeted by spectacular live music, consisting of a woman singing accompanied by a fantastic piano player (who also added in some vocals). big plus for this. \nafter immediately seating us, the hostess hurried to bring us black napkins to avoid the lint of white napkins attaching itself to our dark clothing. we didn't even ask. nice touch. \n\nrob, our waiter, and the rest of the waitstaff that took care of our table were nothing but spectacular. i was a bit worried at first as my water glass remained empty for a good 15 minutes, but this was the sole flaw of the entire evening (and a minor one at that). rob was extremely congenial, professional, yet very personable and extremely accommodating of our wishes. \n\nwe like to split things a lot when we go out to dinner so that we get our own little smorgasbord of items to try...and a smorgasbord we got! not only this, but the chefs made sure to split nearly everything that came to the table (even the bone-in steak we ordered!) now, where do i even begin...\n\n--<mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark>: caution: oxymoron... massive shrimp. the biggest shrimp i've seen in recent memory. the batter wasn't really too vanilla-tasting in my opinion, but this was a delicious starter regardless. three to an order! \n\n--burrata & heirloom tomato salad: mmm, burrata cheese is one of my favorites! yes, this was a typical salad, but the tomatoes were so fresh and the balsamic reduction was so tasty. we asked for a little bit more of this said reduction and they brought out an entire cup of it..whoops.\n\n--<mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark>: hands down the best i've ever had. not overly thick and creamy, yet perfect proportions of ingredients. piping hot when it arrived which i really appreciate with soups. \n\n--mac & cheese: ugh my mouth just waters at the thought of this. served in a skillet, the mac and cheese was perfect consistency: it wasn't drowning in sauce but it wasn't just a bowl of plain noodles with an ounce of cheese mixed in...perfect proportions (once again). on top was a layer of melted cheese that was just fantastic...i think that there were four cheeses or so just in this topper! \n\n--<mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> mignon: i really don't like throwing out the \"best i've ever had\" card very often. because, honestly, how many things can take that title? well, this definitely takes the \"best filet i've ever had\" title. join the club, <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark>. it had the taste of a ny strip, but was tender as a filet should be. and, to top it off, it is served on a 400 degree hot plate. i like my steak kept hot and this obviously got the job done. \n\n--warm butter cake: okay, now this piece of heaven really takes the cake (ha, horrible pun intended). my mom and sister are suckers for butter cake (who isn't..?) and we figured what better time to order it than for a birthday? out comes this large, circular cake and a behemoth side of whipped cream. really. view my picture to see how much there was. think of a frozen skillet just bombarded with thick, heavy whipped cream. fantastic dessert. and what's even better? rob comped this $16 dessert with the simple message of \"happy birthday, we're so happy you came in to dine with us tonight.\" winnnnnnn.\n\n\nfrom now on, every time i'm asked for a restaurant recommendation, mastro's will be the first word to escape my mouth. i cannot wait to go there again next time i've got a few bucks to blow.", 
            "manager dan was kind enough to ensure my second experience here was memorable. everything was great. from the service (our server was tim) , to the food, there is not one thing i can say that was not excellent. we ordered the scallops again, which were as good, if not better than the first time. the <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> and chop salad were tasty. the biggest difference was how the steaks were prepared. my bone in ribeye was perfect. each bite was tender and juicy, make sure to order the mac n cheese side dish.\n\ni would definitely recommend this place. thanks, dan!", 
            "i just can't say that i am a fan of this famous steakhouse, but hubby is definitely a fan of their steak, so still 4 stars, the service was over the top, the restaurant is classy and beautiful. \n\ndecided to have anniversary dinner there, we asked to be seated at one of those window tables in the tree house, our host managed to get us one, very nice of her. started off with bottle of french champagne, loved it, the bread basket was so delicious, just too much for 2 people, it could easily feed up to 5 people seriously! \n\nthe hard part was to order, the entire meat section is out, that's pretty much all of the items on the menu. saw seafood and sushi choices, a bit relieved really, glad i am usually a pesce at nice restaurants, otherwise i would have nothing to order except salads or some sides, that would be miserable at a nice restaurant, wouldn't it ? \n\nour server introduced lots of things, we decided to do chilled seafood platter first, a little bit of everything on the platter: the presentation of the platter was amazing, smokes came out of the prawns container, so beautiful and appetizing. the kumamoto oysters were so good, the lobster claw meat was fairly tender. but the other things in there were bad, the crab & lobster meats were so hard and chewy, the prawns were even harder. they were hard to cut, even harder to swallow, we didn't finish them, so wasteful... the horseradish and cocktail sauces were so good, added nice flavors to chilled seafood. \n\n<mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> soup with garlic bread: our server was so nice to split the soup for us, even though we didn't ask so, the soup was still huge after splitting, too bad i didn't want any soup, so i just gave it to hubby, kinda felt bad for our server's thoughtful gesture. \n\n<mark>Clear Lobster Roll</mark>: had it as my entree, it was bad, really? the rice was thick, the stuffing was not that flavorful, i didn't like the cream sauce came with it, i had one and half pieces, and stopped eating. \n\n12 oz bone in filet in medium rare: the plate was 400 degrees hot! perfectly cooked to medium rare, the steak melted in hubby's mouth right away, he said it tasted amazing! absolutely loved every single bite of it! \n\nmushroom side: i love mushrooms so much, but those mushrooms were flavorless, they were just not that good. i had one bite, that's it. \n\nso, either my taste buds were numbed from too much drinking? or mastro's is really just for steak lovers? my food was just bad... i didn't even eat that much, just sat there , sip on my champagne, and tried very hard not to fall asleep in the middle of a dinner date.... \n\nthey gave us anniversary chocolate cake with a lit candle, so beautiful, and a huge plate of whipped cream too. the cake was so good, both of us loved it, so yummy! i had a 20 -yr -old tawny ($27) to go with it, it was amazing. \n\nit's a famous steakhouse, of course it's pricey. reserved wine list starts at $100 a bottle, up to 10 thousand. tab was $350 for two. \n\nto be honest, i didn't like my food, dinner experience was good, i was just too sleepy to really enjoy it. their restroom located upstairs next to private dining room, the elevator to upstairs was claustrophobic. \n\nand i don't think this place is good for dinner date, food is too much for two people, impossible to finish everything. the restaurant is too bright, not intimate at all. but it's great for family, group dining, or steak lovers!", 
            "for starters i really wanted to give this place a great review because the food was good, but after receiving my bill i just can't do it.\n\nour total bill came up to $243.23. that's not my complaint. my complaint is that we left a cash tip and when we saw the charge on the card, it was for $291.88. i'm glad i kept my receipt.\n\nthis prompted a call from me to the restaurant today to find out why there was an additional $47.00 charged to my card without disclosing it to me. the manager told me that the company they use automatically adds a 20% gratuity to the bill. \n\nthis was not disclosed to us by the waitress. it was not disclosed on our receipt. in fact, when i called, he said they receive that complaint at least 5 times a day, as if that's the normal order of business. fix it if people are complaining. you have no right to charge them an additional 20% without disclosing this before  they eat.\n\ntips are voluntary, not mandatory unless disclosed. i leave my tips in cash and i always cross out the tip line on the receipt.  the money isn't the issue,its the principle that they have no right to take my money without my permission. that is basically theft. \n\nso now, i have to wait 2-3 business days for the additional $47 to be refunded to my card, which means i won't see my money until tuesday or wednesday, since we ate there friday night. other than this absurd experience with my bill, here is a review on the food.\n\n1) the customer service is great except for not disclosing that i'll be charged an additional 20% even if you leave a cash tip.\n\n2) the  <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> were good, but both my wife and i had a small piece of shell. nothing worth complaining about.\n\n3) my wife had the blackened ribeye. it was delicious.\n\n4) i had <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark>. it was delicious.\n\n5) twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> was good.\n\n6) gorgonzola mac & cheese was good.\n\n7) <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> was good.\n\n8) calamari was just ok.\n\n9) the complimentary bread was mostly hard except for the pretzels. i don't mind a mix of breads, but when the majority are hard, its just not for us. \n\noverall, the food was good, but we will not be going back until the change they policy of charging people an additional 20% without their knowledge.\n\nif you eat here pay cash.", 
            "my girlfriend had told me about this place and although it had great reviews for a steakhouse. i thought it was just okay. the service was great which was a plus, but i thought the food was just okay. maybe we're just used to the more traditional and old-fashioned steakhouses. there didn't seem to be much of a dress code and the steak (ribeye) was too fatty for our taste. we didn't want anything lean, but this was too fatty. the best side to me was the <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> and the <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> soup was the highlight of my dinner. i will say it was my first time having <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark>. the ambiance was not exciting at all. (not for an *upscale* steakhouse. i don't think i'll come back unless i'm going to try the seafood or the butter cake.", 
            "this was the most over rated restaurant i have ever dined at.  the food was just ok. actually the pretzel rolls were the best part of the meal.  my husband's <mark>Lemon Sole</mark> was over cooked and his <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> was just ok.  i had the tomatoes and buratta cheese.  the cheese was very good.  my <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark>:  one baked and one in a vanilla batter were both over cooked.  we shared the butter cake which was good but not spectacular.  along with this our service was horrible.  we had to ask for bread which eventually came had no butter with it.  we had a different person for each course and were totally ignored in between.  in the meantime a woman manager in a business suit and the waiter were busy fawning over the people at the next table.  eat at sinatra's if you want a first class meal and exceptional service.\nrenee p.", 
            "what's that expression that a lot of us foolhardy guys toss about as soon as we get to vegas? \"go big, or go home\"? it basically gives us a free pass to indulge in things that are extravagant, luxurious and potentially dangerous. and mastro's fits well within this criteria: the place holds meals fit for royalty, the decor is immaculate, and it can be hazardous to your wallet's health if you are not prepared. but for those of us still reading, and certainly for those of us who have had the honor, mastro's is a must-dine destination if you're in town.\n\nlocated pretty centrally in the city center shopping district, it's almost impossible to miss mastro's: the opulent, wood-like \"fishbowl\" perched precariously at an elevation is definitely eye-catching, and i'm pretty sure i inadvertently photobombed countless tourists as they stopped to take pictures of this structure, which is actually a dining room. before you can get to your table, you stop by a tiny hostess desk flanked by two gals who wasted no time getting us seated once we checked in with our reservation. you'll more than likely walk past an offshoot to another, more private dining room, a pretty spectacular bar and then make your way into the main dining room that is expertly laid out: whoever did the layout here did so in such a way that seating is maximized but not once does it feel crowded. and this is even more impressive when you consider the polished staff is zipping about without hesitation or collision.\n\nand let's talk about the staff, right quick: simply put, these are professionals who know their craft inside and out. our waiter, lionel, was the epitome of providing an exceptional customer service experience. we were -that- table that upfront told him we had a show to catch later that evening, and without missing a beat, he assured us he would keep us on schedule and would not let the meal be compromised. his service, along with the refills and bussing provided by other staff members, made for the best, most efficient dining experience i have seen yet in years of visiting vegas. add in a visit from a manager who just stopped by to chat and make sure everything was cool, and you have a place with a team that cannot be topped.\n\nbut all the friendliness and attention to detail means nothing if the food is bogus, and mastro's has this base covered, too. oh, do they ever. my folks started with a bowl of <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, while i went with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. all three were perfect pre-show snacks for the main courses, and just typing this sentence out is making me drool with fond remembrance. ahem. \n\nmom went with a <mark>Gulf Red Snapper</mark> that was cooked to perfection and my surf-and-turf combo of a filet and lobster tail (which lionel was gracious enough to de-shell table side like a boss) ranks among the best i've had at any place around the world. but the most surprising part was when dad sheepishly admitted he had somehow never had <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> before... and now that bar is set unfathomably high as his <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> here was his favorite meal of this trip. a side of <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> and <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark> rounded out dinner, and wiped out my stomach. somehow, my folks found room for mastro's signature dessert, a butter cake that made me question how a chef can bake happiness, joy and euphoria into one pastry. it's that good (even though i had two bites and almost went into a coma with the straight gin i was drinking).\n\ni cannot say enough positive things about mastro's. from the staff to the overall \"look\" of the place, and most assuredly the culinary satisfaction each plate offers, it's a place that rewards all those who stop by for a drink or a bite to eat. take those winnings from the casino and invest them here: i promise it's a much better deal than your favorite variation of blackjack.", 
            "my lovely girlfriend took me here for my birthday. being a non-practicing hindu, i hold a special love for a medium-rare steak. our reservation was for 7:30pm and once we got there we were escorted to our table and seated promptly. it's a very busy place; so do reserve a table ahead of time.\n\nour server was very nice and professional. we ordered soups for starters, my girlfriend ordered <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> and i ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, both soups were delicious, especially the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was cream and not too sweet and as an added bonus there were big piece of delicious lobster meat. \n\nafter we were done with both soups we both ordered filet mignon. i went with 12 oz. medium rare cut while my girlfriend went with 8 oz. well done cut (sacrilege!!!). we also ordered <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> with cheese and saut\\u00e9ed asparagus. after a 20-25 minute wait we were served our delicious meal. the steak was exquisite, the seasoning was perfect and the meat was like butter. it melted in our mouth. the sides were also delicious, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> in particular complimented the steak well.  the only complaint of mine was that the <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> had too much cheese on it, but everything else was amazing. \n\ni think this is best steak house i've been to in las vegas and if you are on the strip, then this is the place to go.",

            "a couple of weeks ago i went to dinner by myelf at mastro's ocean club, the wooden donut shaped eatery located in the middle of the new crystal's shopping mall at city center. \n\nit was tempting to fill up on the bread basket filled with pretzel and rye bread sticks, parmesan crackers, and teardrop sourdough boules, but i restrained myself and saved room for a half order of the <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark> ($7.99) and the <mark>Sauteed Shrimp</mark> appetizer ($18.95). everything at mastro's is fairly expensive, so these dishes were a great way to test their quality without spending a ton. the <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark> was essentially a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with horseradish in the dressing, and being a huge fan of horseradish, i very much enjoyed it. i always ask for light dressing (or dressing on the side) in less expensive restaurants because more expensive restaurants generally know how to dress a salad properly, and mastro's was no exception. if anything, the salad bordered on verge of being under-dressed, so if you are a fan of heavy salad dressing, i would ask for extra. the <mark>Sauteed Shrimp</mark> were nothing less than wonderful, and hit the spot for my seafood craving. the huge shrimp were cooked just right and served over a broth that tasted like a <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> reduction rich with butter. the cheesy garlic bread croutons absorbed this liquid on one end, but remained crunchy at the other, providing some textural contrast. it was fun to dip all the different kinds of bread from the basket in the sauce as well to see how they each paired differently. overall it was a really successful dish, and because the shrimp were so plump and the sauce so rich, it was certainly enough for my entree. one item that i might have tried as a side had i been with someone, however, was the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> - they looked fantastic. i wasn't too disheartened by not getting them, as i still had a terrific meal that was plenty filling.\n\ni wanted to order their signature butter cake dessert, but because it was $14 and i was full by that point, i decided to pass. i'm sure it's enough for two to three people so maybe next time i go and i'm not by myself i'll splurge and get it.", 
            "love, love, love this restaurant!  what a treat and a perfect way to end an already awesome vegas trip.  this restaurant is located within the new city center mall and was ultra convenient to get to from the aria hotel.  we started the night by sitting at the live piano bar in the lounge and ordering pomegranate martini's on dry ice.  the martini's bubbled from the dry ice.  it was very cool and they were oh so good.\n\nas far as the food goes... the meat is so tender and cooked to perfection.  my husband and i split an 18 oz. bone-in steak and it was more than we could possibly eat.  the steak was gigantic.  it was also really nice that they cut it for us and brought it out on two plates.  with 4 people we ordered 3 separate side dishes and it was way too much food.  one side will feed 3 - 4 people easily, but they are all so good you have to try more than one. \n\nby the time the chocolate birthday cake was served we were all so full that we had one bite and that was all but it was really good too.\n\nthe servers were really good and the atmosphere was perfect.  the tree house was really neat.\n\nthis is a definite must try.  oh and i almost forgot... we shared the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> to start and it was the best ever.  we also really enjoyed the different breads in the basket.  i think the waitress said that the pretzels come from germany.  if you want an amazing dinner you have to try this place.", 
            "the name mastro's is known to a lot of people for their steaks already.  we happened to be in vegas for our anniversary, so we decided to have dinner there as our celebration.\n\nbecause this place is located at the city center right in the middle of the mall, so it doesn't carry the same kind of \"exclusiveness\" as the one in costa mesa or b hill.  dress code is also easier, only required hotel casual, so shorts and tees are welcome.\n\njust as mentioned by most, the staff are extremely polite and friendly, that was a great start already.  we got seated fairly quickly and our waiter brought us the wine / cocktail list quickly.  i asked for the mastro's mojito cocktail, which is rum with lime and mint.  it's not very strong and i like it a lot.\n\nwe were aware of the portion at mastro's, and since my wife is pregnant she can't eat too much.  so i asked the waiter if it's ok for us to split the steak and allow us to try more other dishes.  they were very understanding and said absolutely no problem at all.\n\nfor appetizer, we went ahead and ordered the <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark>.  we were both very very impressed with the dish.  three gigantic scallops, all prepared and seared to perfection, and the sauce was awesome together with the bread.  it was very rich and good.\n\nwe also ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, and they went ahead and split the soup between two bowls for us, that was very nice.  the waiter also came and helped us split the scallop appetizer on our dish, that's great service.  we also tried the pretzel bread together with the soup, they all paired together very well!!!!!!\n\nmy wife particularly loved the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.  she commented that a lot of times the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> she has is way too salty, but the one we had was just right.  very smooth and rich in lobster flavor, but it doesn't get overpowered by the saltiness.\n\nfor steak, we ordered the bone-in 18oz filet and we asked them to split a small portion for my wife (medium well).  mine was cooked medium rare.  it was simply fabulous.  meat was very tender and juicy, and even my wife's portion, though cooked medium well, was still very tender.  \n\nand i have to say one of the most important thing they did right was resting the steak well before serving.  most of the time when i eat steak, by the end it was juice all over the dish.  but not this time, all the juice was retained inside, that was awesome.\n\nwe also got the lobster mashed potato as side dish.  it's good, a lot of lobster as stated by others, though i agree with my wife, while it's good, for $36 bucks, it's basically lobster mixed with mashed potato.  it doesn't have that \"specialness\" in some sense.\n\nsince it was our anniversary, they gave us a big chocolate cake.  it was big, and it tasted really good too!\n\nat the end of the day, we were impressed with the dinner.  it's not cheap by any means, but for special occasions, the quality and quantity of food?  i think it's worth it.  although part of me still wonder how the experience would differ if we were to go to the one at costa mesa.", 
            "this is our 1st time at any of the mastro's restaurants.  we have family & friends in the vegas area who recommended & accompanied this as a truly upscale & 4-to-5 star dining experience.  they were correct!  \n\nupon being seated practically in the center of their 60 ft teak or mahogany simulated treehouse, we asked the very crisply uniformed captain to recommend the appetizers.  he had us create our own \"seafood tower\" and we chose <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark>, shrimp, oysters & calamari... delish!  the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> & <mark>Iceberg Wedge</mark> were next.  the five of us then shared a filet, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, atlantic salmon & scallops with garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  our captain went over and above as he assisted us in choose the appropriate wine to pair with our culinary choices.\n\nnow.. we would come back for all of this goodness, but the mastro's butter cake is one of a kind and is worth the whole meal or just to drop in for dessert after shopping.  \n\nneedless to say & in keeping with my \"positively outrageously\" great dining recommendations, you have to enjoy mastro's if you're in vegas!", 
            "wow is all i can say.  we have a mastros steakhouse in chicago and i have not been able to get in as it's always so hoppin. so since we were in vegas, we decided to give mastros ocean club a try.  we were not disappointed.  the restaurant is located in the city center shopping area and fits in well with the high end shopping and the swanky d\\u00e9cor of the city center and surrounding hotels.  the d\\u00e9cor is simple contemporary.  it would be too simple if it wasn't for their amazing bar set up but more their \"tree house\" structure.  if you visit mastros, request that you sit in the tree house section.  they also have a lounge singer and piano player.  the volume was fine (as i've read other review that it was extremely loud) - but we were sitting in the tree house area so i can imagine if you had one of the tables next to the singer or in the booths behind them, it would be pretty loud.  regardless, the singer was very good and sang songs from all genres.  now to the important part - the food.  everything we ordered was amazing.  as all higher end restaurants, all sides are ala cart but big enough to share.  our entrees were delishous - <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, and scallops.  i have no complaints, all were cooked perfectly and extremely flavorful.  the portions were quite large.  the sides were equally amazing and big enough to share between 3-4 people.  one of the sides - the mac and cheese was ah. maz. ing.  if we're ever back i'd be happy to dive into the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  the wedge salad was enourmous, enough to share between 2 people.  i had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which was very tasty.  i've had it before at other places and it sometimes has had a \"fishy\" taste but not this. and there were big chunks of lobster.  service, supurb as expected.  the menu is pricey, but worth it.  i'll definitely be checking out mastros in chicago.", 
            "as a 'local' in this town, it is one of our favorites, with the reason being that the portion sizes are so large that you will have left overs for at least one meal!  the prices do support this, but once you divide it by 2 or 3 i feel it is worth it.\n\nthe wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  they are excellent at giving you the actual methods of preparation, ingredients, etc. on any item vs. places where they basically repeat what is written on the menu (yes, i can read).\n\nthe <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> is sublime.  the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> is wonderful.  the fish and seafood i have had each time was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  and above all else...be sure to save room for the warm butter cake!\n\ni feel bad for the tourists that usually leave so much on the table.  me....i'm walking out with my doggy bag!", 
            "our reservations were for 10:30 pm (valentine's day), but we arrived a little after 10:00 and were quickly seated in the \"tree house\", which is more like a bird cage!  our waitress (tanya) was phenomenal the entire evening.  she catered to every need and offered excellent suggestions during ordering.  \n\nwe began with a few cocktails, which were very tasty.  my wife and i decided to split a bowl of <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, since i had read reviews that it was very good (i had <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> the previous evening at a venitian restaurant, and was very disappointed).  this bisque was the best i have ever had!  it was a quite large serving with many sizeable pieces of lobster.  it could easily satisfy as a meal by itself!\n\nas a main course, we split the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> ($50, i think).  when asked for suggestions, tanya recommended the blackened seasoning.  for sides, we chose the king crab truffled gnocci ($29), and roasted brussle sprouts ($11).  the fish came a la carte on a large plate.  for being a split order, the portions were surprisingly generous.  the gnocci and brussle sprouts came as large sides to be shared.  the waitress dished the sides on the main plate.\n\nnow, plated and ready to go, and accompanied by a basket of various breads, my wife and i embarked on the best meal we have ever had!  initially, we agreed it had to be in the top three, but then we couldn't come up with where we had had a more impeccable meal (and service).\n\nthe <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was tender, flakey, moist, and so perfectly seasoned.  the gnocci had large pieces of crab mixed with the creamy gnocci.  for the brussle sprouts, we like them almost burnt on the outside to bring out the flavor.  they, too, were perfectly roasted dark and tender!  \n\nwe ate the all the fish, even though we were quite full.  we took home the leftover gnocci and brussle sprouts, which was enough to make another whole meal for two.  my wife made the comment that she wanted to take home a piece of the bread that was still in the bread basket.  the waitress said she would get us fresh ones.  with our leftovers, she packed four extra pieces of the fresh \"pretzle\" bread.\n\nwe travel a lot, we love to cook, and we love to eat at quality restaurants.  if you go to vegas, you have to eat here!  we hope your experience is as enjoyable as ours was!", 
            "i found mastro's on yelp and didn't realize that it was the cool restaurant that looked like it was encased in a cocoon (now known as the treehouse) when i shopped at the city center a couple of trips back.  i made reservations that day via yelp and although we waited for about 15 minutes for our 9pm reservations, we were lucky enough to be seated in the treehouse.  very cool!  \n\ni had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> for a starter and the bowl was huge!  it filled me up quite a bit and from the mid point on, i wished i had it to share but managed to drink it all.  it was a bit rich so i was kind of done with it before i finished it off but didn't want to waste any of it so i was a trooper and drank it to the last drop.  <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> seemed to be the popular recommendation so that's what i ordered for my entree and that was definitely delicious.  it's a good thing i didn't order any sides because those two dishes totally filled me up!\n\ngreat place to try and would recommend at least going there once.  it is a bit pricey but i think worth the experience. next time i go back, i'd like to go back with a whole bunch of people to get their seafood tower.  the table next to us ordered that and it looked really cool.  if not for the food, just to take a picture to post online.  haha!", 
            "i did not get to enjoy my meal as much as i wish... =( but i know for a fact that the food was really good..\n\nme & my girl friend (amy l) made reservations for 6pm on a saturday. after dragging ourselves over here from vdara, we finally made it on time. it was an absolute drag because we were awake for 30+ hours & we felt really crappy from all the \"beverages\" we consumed... basically we felt like utter sh** and couldn't enjoy our meals =(\n\nlocated in the city center, the restaurant is pretty much in the very center of the building. service was good but a bit slow. i love the assortment of bread, my favorite is the crunchy cheesey-garlicky one =)\n\nhere's what we ordered:\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> - comes in a huge bowl, tastes very very veryy rich, not too many pieces of lobster but still pretty delicious\n\nseared <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> - i've had this before at mastro's in beverly hills, same thing, still delicious, comes with 3 scallops & yummy cheese/garlic bread. scallops from mastro's comes in 2nd place after providence's :p\n\n <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> - cooked medium. comes on a sizzling plate, very good rich flavors and good texture. i was only able to eat 2-3 bites. i did eat the leftovers the next morning & it was still pretty tasty. \n\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> - blacken cajun flavored, i think.. it was pretty damn good, texture is very similar to scallops.\n\n<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> - big enough to be an entree on it's own, holy sh*t, i don't know how this thing can just be a side dish lol it's meant to be shared amongst 4+ people.. i thought it was pretty yummy, i love cheese and king crab meat... but this is super duper heavy, i probably would not order this again...\n\ngarlic spinach - tasty but a bit too garlicky for me, it was so infused with garlic that it tasted a bit bitter to me..\n\n\ni am so sad that we were so full that i didn't get to try to butter cake, again! =( we didn't have much of an appetite at all, plus i think we ordered a little too much lol... we were stuffed after having a few bites of our appetizers.  service was good, our waiter was a bit slow though. our water glasses were never empty (thank goodness, we must have drank a total of 13 glasses each..)\n\nrestrooms are located on the second floor, kind of a hassle to look for. bad idea to go when you're intoxicated..\n\n\n\nlesson learned: do not attempt fine dining after a night of debauchery....excellent restaurant & food! must try the butter cake one day.... =(", 
            "the las vegas-mastro's ranks among our top dining experiences anywhere in the world.  on this labor day weekend visit, our initial disappointment, of not being seated in the unique & always fascinating \"tree-house\", was quickly extinguished by shauna, our culinary captain extraordinaire, menu \"tour guide\" and libation/wine aficionado.  turns out... our \"terrace\" seating near the piano bar was as enjoyable as it was entertaining, resulting in yet another \"positively outrageous\" fine dining adventure.\n\nshauna introduced us to mastro's participation in \"las vegas restaurant week\", a worthy nationwide charity drive to raise money for & donate meals to 3-square food bank in southern nevada.  she offered a special 4-course dinner deliciously flanked by beefsteak tomato & onion salad, an 8 oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> & garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and key lime pie all for a reasonable price, part of which was ultimately donated for a worthy cause.  \n\nas there were 5 of us on this visit, the aforementioned special meal was joined by collection of our menu favs and shauna's recommendations. she perfectly paired our appetizers & meals with wonderful riesling, cabernet, and sauvignon blanc.\n\nsooo, included in the culinary delight were: the legendary seafood tower (ohhh yes!!), <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (best in class!), <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark> (delightful), <mark>New York Strip</mark> (absolute perfection), <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> (sweet & outa this world), saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> (oh yeah!), <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (buttered and seasoned to perfection), saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms ( a fav of favs), <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> (these aren't yo mama's sprouts, believe it!), 1 lb. <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> (huge), triple chocolate layer cake (nothing but delish), and...(drum roll)... the mastro's signature warm butter cake!!...once again to die for!!!\n\nwithout fail, and to paraphrase the writings of t. scott gross,... mastro's was again a \"positively outrageous\" dining experience where the culinary expectations were always far exceeded.  shauna's unsurpassed service & superior guidance was unexpected, delivered-at-random, fun, entertaining, and so very memorable!  it doesn't get any better!", 
            "this is as good as it gets. three of us went to mastro's after deciding on seafood and reading the reviews on yelp. everything was top notch, including the attentive service, the gorgeous presentation of the food, and the portions. some of my favorites included the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> (with an abundance of crab meat), served over a bowl with dry ice, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (creamy and with actual meat), and the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. i had that night's special, which was a fantastic john dory with a chardonnay lemon sauce. \n\nsome of the other \"little touches\" to make the experience better? the server actually served side dishes on our plates for us, and we received a follow up phone call a couple of days later to ensure our satisfaction. very classy!\n\nexpect a hit to your wallet: three of us walked out of there at $600, though we did splurge on grey goose martinis (shaken table side), wine and lobster. i can assure you it's well worth it!", 
            "my girlfriend and i fell in love with this place for several reasons.  the staff, the atmosphere, and the food combined to bring us back the next night as well  we were able to make reservations through yelp and opentable but we arrived early each night and sat in the first come, first serve bar area.  the piano entertainment was first class. our server, racqel, was always timely, willing to meet our every request, and helpful in navigating the menu to ensure we got the most of the food choices we desired with the least amount of waste.  her name escapes me now but there was a corporate employee there the second night who recognized us from the night before.  she not only bought our first round of drinks but when we were leaving insisted we try their \"butter cake\" so much so that she ended up giving it to us.  very good stuff. i can't imagine anyone not feeling good upon receipt of this restaurant \"regular\" type of treatment on a 3 day, 2 night trip.  sheri and i can't wait to return to town and visit the place again!  i highly recommend any of the <mark>Filet</mark>, shriimp cocktail, king crab, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, gorgonzola mac and cheese, and the <mark>Gulf Red Snapper</mark>.  they will split any plate they have, upon request.",

            "don't believe the hype. started off with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> soup of which the lobster was chewy. my friend had the heirloom and barrata salad and it was fairly decent. we shared the ribeye which was a bit dry but bloody if that can even happen. as a side we had the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> that had pieces of the lobster shell mixed in which brutalized my gums. we also had the saut\\u00e9ed asparagus that never made it to our table but we can only imagine what that would have tasted like. \n\nas far as service our waiter was good and the team that assisted him was good as well. i was disappointed that i had to box my own food for the price i paid but hey it is what it is.",

            "nice ambiance but the rib eye was overly seasoned. the brussel sprouts where not oven roasted but burnt. the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was excellent but the mac n cheese was dry and not saucy. the only good thing was the two bottles of wine we drank.",

            "i completely regret resisting going to this place. after 3 hard vegas days, expensive food seemed like a waste, but this meal was one of the best memories of the trip. <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was definitely one of or the best i've ever had, my friends' macaroni and cheese was huge and delicious and the butter cake, our main reason for going here was so good, i was contemplating pulling the trigger right there just to force in a few more bites. sitting in the treehouse in the middle of the mall made the whole experience that much more unique. there was a 2:1 diner/waiter ratio, our main guy was one of the most attentive pros i've ever had.", 
            "beautiful location in one of the high end malls in the new city center. little bit hard to find if you don't normally shop here. and i don't. civil servant salary :(. but we made it and we made reservations in advance so no problems with our table. \n\nonce placed at a table i think the floormanager thought it took too long before we got menu's and drinks because after some talking in a little microphone he brought the menu's himself. and bizarre: he really, really resembles sheldon cooper (big bang theory). and once you've seen it........\n\nour waiter showed up explaining the menu and taking the drink orders. to be honoust, we've missed most of the information. a high speed talk with way too much information about the specials.\n\nwe decided on half a portion of the salad of the day (spinach, bacon, egg, the promised blue cheese was hard to find), the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, a <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> and the ribeye with bone. for sides just the sauteed mushrooms.\n\nportions are huge, but had a few dissapointments considering the price. although we'resure the waitress spoke off different kinds of preparing the meat (grilled, blackend, etc.) she didn't asked we would like the meat prepared. looking at the meat of our neigbours we asked which cooking that was. turned out to be rare. just a little too pink for us so we asked the meat to be cooked medium. can tell you, what we got was definitely way beyond medium. almost welldone. and no,we didn't send it back. i know, we should have.\n\nthe mushrooms were perfectly cooked and huge. like the portion. more than enough to satisfy four. the bisque was oke but both appetizers, the spinach salad and <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> were flat. the salad being nothing special and the tuna was way to cold  discover any taste at all. i also don't understand the fried things (onions?) on the bottom.\n\nbest experiences were the setting, despite the location, the services and the bread. especially the latter was excellent. \n\ntogether with a glass of white and red we've paid $163 before tip.\n\nnote: excuse any grammar and spelling mistakes. i'm no native speaker and keep having troubles with my apple device that keeps trying to change the english words into proper dutch words. yes, you've guessed right. my first language.", 
            "wonderful! ultimate 5 star experience in vegas! we thoroughly enjoyed our experience here. we loved the appetizer tower that can be mixed and matched. oysters were fantastic. the cocktail shrimp vanilla  we sat inside the 'space ship' or 'ufo'... be sure to request this seating during your reservation.\n\nto begin... cocktails: paloma was fantastic for the tart drink lovers. elderflower martini was better for the sweet tooth! \n\nappetizer: cocktail jumbo shrimp, <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark> & oysters... delish! \n\n\nsalad: we split the <mark>Iceberg Wedge</mark>, please note that in photo... it's only half. the bacon used was a sweet hickory smoked wisconsin bacon. amazing. \n\nsoup: <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. phenomenal. rich & creamy. \n\n\nentree: filet. ordered med well but the cut was too thick and it ended up well done on outside and almost rare in the middle, but it was still fantastic.\n\nside: king crab & <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>- to die for. an absolute must. yes, i actually chose this over my standard potatoes au gratin with steak and was do glad i did.\n\n<mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was fantastic. \n\nwe ended our meal with cappuccinos.\n\nthank you for well educated wait staff and quality service.", 
            "one of the top 3 restaurants in vegas! third time coming here this year and i have never been disappointed. service from the waitress was on point and she was very thorough with explaining the specials on the menu. the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> is probably the best i've ever had along with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.  i had the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> as my main course which was amazing. <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> as a side is brilliant also. the one thing you cannot leave this restaurant without ordering is the legendary butter cake!!", 
            "what's that expression that a lot of us foolhardy guys toss about as soon as we get to vegas? \"go big, or go home\"? it basically gives us a free pass to indulge in things that are extravagant, luxurious and potentially dangerous. and mastro's fits well within this criteria: the place holds meals fit for royalty, the decor is immaculate, and it can be hazardous to your wallet's health if you are not prepared. but for those of us still reading, and certainly for those of us who have had the honor, mastro's is a must-dine destination if you're in town.\n\nlocated pretty centrally in the city center shopping district, it's almost impossible to miss mastro's: the opulent, wood-like \"fishbowl\" perched precariously at an elevation is definitely eye-catching, and i'm pretty sure i inadvertently photobombed countless tourists as they stopped to take pictures of this structure, which is actually a dining room. before you can get to your table, you stop by a tiny hostess desk flanked by two gals who wasted no time getting us seated once we checked in with our reservation. you'll more than likely walk past an offshoot to another, more private dining room, a pretty spectacular bar and then make your way into the main dining room that is expertly laid out: whoever did the layout here did so in such a way that seating is maximized but not once does it feel crowded. and this is even more impressive when you consider the polished staff is zipping about without hesitation or collision.\n\nand let's talk about the staff, right quick: simply put, these are professionals who know their craft inside and out. our waiter, lionel, was the epitome of providing an exceptional customer service experience. we were -that- table that upfront told him we had a show to catch later that evening, and without missing a beat, he assured us he would keep us on schedule and would not let the meal be compromised. his service, along with the refills and bussing provided by other staff members, made for the best, most efficient dining experience i have seen yet in years of visiting vegas. add in a visit from a manager who just stopped by to chat and make sure everything was cool, and you have a place with a team that cannot be topped.\n\nbut all the friendliness and attention to detail means nothing if the food is bogus, and mastro's has this base covered, too. oh, do they ever. my folks started with a bowl of <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, while i went with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. all three were perfect pre-show snacks for the main courses, and just typing this sentence out is making me drool with fond remembrance. ahem. \n\nmom went with a <mark>Gulf Red Snapper</mark> that was cooked to perfection and my surf-and-turf combo of a filet and lobster tail (which lionel was gracious enough to de-shell table side like a boss) ranks among the best i've had at any place around the world. but the most surprising part was when dad sheepishly admitted he had somehow never had <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> before... and now that bar is set unfathomably high as his <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> here was his favorite meal of this trip. a side of <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> and <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark> rounded out dinner, and wiped out my stomach. somehow, my folks found room for mastro's signature dessert, a butter cake that made me question how a chef can bake happiness, joy and euphoria into one pastry. it's that good (even though i had two bites and almost went into a coma with the straight gin i was drinking).\n\ni cannot say enough positive things about mastro's. from the staff to the overall \"look\" of the place, and most assuredly the culinary satisfaction each plate offers, it's a place that rewards all those who stop by for a drink or a bite to eat. take those winnings from the casino and invest them here: i promise it's a much better deal than your favorite variation of blackjack.", 
            "my lovely girlfriend took me here for my birthday. being a non-practicing hindu, i hold a special love for a medium-rare steak. our reservation was for 7:30pm and once we got there we were escorted to our table and seated promptly. it's a very busy place; so do reserve a table ahead of time.\n\nour server was very nice and professional. we ordered soups for starters, my girlfriend ordered <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> and i ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, both soups were delicious, especially the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was cream and not too sweet and as an added bonus there were big piece of delicious lobster meat. \n\nafter we were done with both soups we both ordered filet mignon. i went with 12 oz. medium rare cut while my girlfriend went with 8 oz. well done cut (sacrilege!!!). we also ordered <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> with cheese and saut\\u00e9ed asparagus. after a 20-25 minute wait we were served our delicious meal. the steak was exquisite, the seasoning was perfect and the meat was like butter. it melted in our mouth. the sides were also delicious, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> in particular complimented the steak well.  the only complaint of mine was that the <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> had too much cheese on it, but everything else was amazing. \n\ni think this is best steak house i've been to in las vegas and if you are on the strip, then this is the place to go.",

            "mastro's ocean club is a fine dining establishment located in the aria hotel and casino. the ambiance is set well, the architecture is particularly astounding, and the service is exquisite. our server, joe, was on his game. my water glass and wine glass never reached half empty (or half full). ordered the bone marrow, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, sauteed broccoli, gorgonzola mac and cheese, 22 oz. <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, and mastro's signature warm butter cake. \n\nbone marrow - holy donkey punching jesus this is astounding. i have never had bone marrow before but its alluring presence on the menu was enough for me to sample it. the bone marrow comes half charred on a split bone with a serving of toasted baguette to spread on. the flavor, the texture, the taste and everything about it was amazing. i will order this every time and you should as well.\n\n<mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> - hearty <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> with more crab than cake. in fact the cakes fall apart to the softest touch, the chunks of crab meat separating with ease as only a minimal amount of filler has been used. flavor and spice is more than enough to accent the cakes.\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> - oftentimes <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> comes heavily buttered, even in the most finest of dining establishment. butter is an easy thing to add to a dish to increase its flavor without actually improving on its originality and substance. however, mastro's <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> does not perpetuate this and, rather, has a full-bodied bisque with a generous portion of lobster inside. the thickness is akin to how a bisque should be.\n\nsauteed broccoli - opting to go a slightly healthier route with one of the dishes i was still impressed but of course, it's sauteed broccoli, and only so much can be done while keeping it true.\n\ngorgonzola mac and cheese - a perfect compliment to my <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and a hearty side at that. it's a shame our hotel fridge has a monitored scale with a restocking fee otherwise i would have had no issue taking the remainder of this with me.\n\n22 oz. <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> - one of the finer ribeyes i have had. a generous amount of fat and it was seared and salted well enough to make it exceedingly juicy. cooked to perfection (rare) with a cool red center while the black crust of searing on iron was still present. \n\nmastro's signature warm butter cake - fuck. that's amazing.\n\nthe servings sizes of sides are plentiful and the prices are what you'd expect at such an establishment. be wary of those giving mastro's a bad review due to price or service, such an establishment would be careful to hire only proven servers and i would wager that the reviewers themselves to be the standoffish party.",

            "had a 4.5 star meal, but not quite 5 star, at mastro's on a friday night.  it was very crowded, as in full, but we were seated promptly at our reservation time of 8:00.  we were seated in a high top kind of half-booth type table.  i'd not sat in something like this before, but it was comfortable.  the place was humming, but since it's open to the mall, it wasn't so loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation.  \n\nour server immediately approached us to take our water and drink orders.  she also provided a wine list, which was above average but pricey, which was expected given that mastro's is located in crystals on the strip.  i didn't think it was out of line with other lists at similar places on the strip.  \n\nto start, i went with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.  this was one of the best versions of this dish i've had.  it was velveety smooth with a lot of chunks of lobster.  the sherry came through, and it was seasoned very well.  just a creamy lobstery soup.  you may get some sticker shock given that it's soup, but i think it was worth it (i can't recall the exact price, i believe it was either $16 or $18).  additionally, a friend and i shared the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tostada.  these come 3 to an order, but i could have easily eaten another dozen.  the tuna serving is substantial, and all of the accompaniments (avocado, onion salsa, and chili sauce) are fantastic.  crispy, flavorful, but not too heavy.  loved it.\n\nwe split steaks among the table, opting for the traditional bone in ribeye and the wagyu bone in ribeye from australia.  it was $110, but well worth it.  it was noticeably better than the other steak.  not that the \"regular\" ribeye wasn't good.  it was.  but, the depth of flavor with the wagyu was significantly better.  absolutely re-order if they have it available.  plus, since we were sharing they offered to cut it for us in the back of the house, which we appreciated.\n\non the side, we had the peppercorn steak sauce.  it's good, but i don't know that it's worthy of its reputation.  i didn't think the steaks needed it, so i only had a couple of bites with it.  the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> are incredibly decadent, nearly swimming in lobster and butter.  the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> is good, but it's typical for this type of dish.\n\nfor dessert, we went with the famous butter cake.  it easily lives up to its reputation.  warm, a little crispy on the outside, but impossibly moist and buttery.  served with berries, ice cream, and plenty of whipped cream, it was an excellent end to a great meal.  \n\nservice was fantastic the entire time.  our server was there when we needed her but not overbearing.  our food came out quickly, but we never felt rushed, despite knowing how busy they were that evening.  all in all, a great experience.  i can see why mastro's has its reputation, i would absolutely return.",

            "a couple of weeks ago i went to dinner by myelf at mastro's ocean club, the wooden donut shaped eatery located in the middle of the new crystal's shopping mall at city center. \n\nit was tempting to fill up on the bread basket filled with pretzel and rye bread sticks, parmesan crackers, and teardrop sourdough boules, but i restrained myself and saved room for a half order of the <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark> ($7.99) and the <mark>Sauteed Shrimp</mark> appetizer ($18.95). everything at mastro's is fairly expensive, so these dishes were a great way to test their quality without spending a ton. the <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark> was essentially a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with horseradish in the dressing, and being a huge fan of horseradish, i very much enjoyed it. i always ask for light dressing (or dressing on the side) in less expensive restaurants because more expensive restaurants generally know how to dress a salad properly, and mastro's was no exception. if anything, the salad bordered on verge of being under-dressed, so if you are a fan of heavy salad dressing, i would ask for extra. the <mark>Sauteed Shrimp</mark> were nothing less than wonderful, and hit the spot for my seafood craving. the huge shrimp were cooked just right and served over a broth that tasted like a <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> reduction rich with butter. the cheesy garlic bread croutons absorbed this liquid on one end, but remained crunchy at the other, providing some textural contrast. it was fun to dip all the different kinds of bread from the basket in the sauce as well to see how they each paired differently. overall it was a really successful dish, and because the shrimp were so plump and the sauce so rich, it was certainly enough for my entree. one item that i might have tried as a side had i been with someone, however, was the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> - they looked fantastic. i wasn't too disheartened by not getting them, as i still had a terrific meal that was plenty filling.\n\ni wanted to order their signature butter cake dessert, but because it was $14 and i was full by that point, i decided to pass. i'm sure it's enough for two to three people so maybe next time i go and i'm not by myself i'll splurge and get it.",

            "completely disappointed by maestro's restaurant in las vegas.  i read such wonderful reviews on yelp and was really looking forward to it. my husband and i went there for our 1 year wedding anniversary dinner. i made reservations a month before the big day and requested to have a bottle of champagne upon our arrival.  \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> to start.  it took about 20 minutes for them to take that initial order and another 20-30 minutes for them to bring it out.  the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> was so salty and came with a weird <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> combination on top as aside. the dressing of the salad ruined the flavor of the meat if the salt didn't already to it. \n\nas our main entrees we ordered a <mark>Petite Filet</mark> and lamp chops. dry, dry, dry! i'm sorry but if we are paying over +$50 a plate we expect mouth watering tender meat.  that wasn't the case at all. so disappointed. \n\nto end the evening we were so disappointed by the slow service, the bad appetizer and unsatisfactory entr\\u00e9e we didn't even want dessert. as the waiter brings the +$200 check he just says happy anniversary and walks away.  no complimentary dessert or glass of champagne as most places would have done. oh well...i will go back to sage inside aria which is the best steak house i have ever been too.", 
            "i was introduced to mastro's by a friend of mine.  he had nothing but good things to say about it, so last year, we gave it a shot. mastro's is the perfect hybrid of really good seafood and classic steakhouse.  when you walk in the first thing you smell is the juicy steaks coming out of the kitchen. this was our second time here and i'm not going to lie, i was a little worried that it wouldn't be as good as i remembered. lucky for us, it was just as good. i remembered that they had a nice wine list and they still do. gramercy guy was able to get darioush (one of our favorite napa wineries) by the glass, which is really hard to find. \n\nwhile our waiter was walking us through the menu, some specials, and suggestions, i zeroed in on a salad called, the spicy mambo, which is a take on a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, without croutons but has horseradish and blue cheese crumbles. it was really tasty and i'm looking forward to going home and adjusting my caesar dressing recipe with some fresh horseradish. \n\na secret menu item is the mastro's mash. it used to be on the menu but has recently come off, if you ask, they will make it for you. it's like a loaded <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> but mashed. we also got sauteed spinach, don't forget your greens.\n\nthe design of mastro's is really amazing, they have what they call a 'tree house', a wooden structure that has two levels. the bottom is the crystal's information desk and the top level is the mastro's tree house. when we booked our reservation, we requested a table in the tree house. once you step inside, the atmosphere totally changes, the band (which is really good) gets muffled and it's very relaxing and feels almost private (there are about a dozen tables).\n\nmy advice for anyone going to mastro's...share...the portions are huge and unless you have a place to store your left overs, it will all go to waste. also, the pretzel rolls in the bread basket are amazing. \n\nto see pictures and read more, go to http://gramercygirl.blogspot.com/2012/03/mastros-ocean-club-las-vegas.html", 
            "i wanted this to knock my socks off, but it fell short.  mostly due to the service, partly due to the strange atmosphere and the fact that they were 40 minutes late seating us when we had reservations and arrived early for them.\n\nfirst, the bar.  there is a beautiful bar, great drink list, nice bartenders, piano and lounge singer... all setting up for a relaxing setting, right?  nope, the lounge singer, with piano accompaniment, sang songs by katy perry and rhianna, and songs like \"call me maybe\".  wtf?  it was just so weird! \n\nwe had 8:30 reservations, arrived around 8:20, and didn't get a table around 9:10.  that's just bad planning on their part, i believe.\n\nnow, the service was the worst part of our meal. the menu is very simple, with no explanations of any of the items.  you would rely on your server to elaborate on preparations, etc, when the menu contains none.  this was where the meal went off the tracks.  there was just a list of all the available entrees (lots of different fish, etc), and our server showed up and said, \"are you guys ready?\".  i said something like, \"we're unsure of the preparations available for each fish\"... and he said something like, \"oh, we can do blackened... you know... whatever......\".  seriously?  that's it?  so guess what i ordered... blackened halibut!  i didn't know how else to order!  even the salads, the one we ordered was the <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark>, had no explanation.  what the hell is a <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark>?  i don't know, so thank god we liked it.  it was like a spicy <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and was very good.  my halibut was delicious, my husband's tuna was great.  portions are ridiculously huge.  i wouldn't suggest 2 side dishes for 2 people, just choose one and share it.  we had so much food left over, it was depressing to leave it all to be thrown away, but it's vegas!  we're not gonna pack leftovers around all night!  after we ordered, the server at the table next to us went through the available preparations with his table, and after hearing them, i would have definitely liked to try several of them.  i was very disappointed by our server.\n\nall in all, the food is delicious, but good food is not hard to find in vegas.  the service is a big part of making a great meal, and this was lackluster.  not sure i would return or recommend this restaurant, with all the great options in this town.", 
            "everything done to perfection. on one visit, my swordfish was grilled deliciously and was a perfect compliment to the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>.\n\non a subsequent visit, i had the <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> appetizer for an entree and was not disappointed. the portion size was generous. i also tried to small <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which i liked very much.\n\nof course, the pretzel bread and buttercake are amazing! service was very friendly and warm. i will be back again!", 
            "my husband and i have been to mastro's twice, once for work and most recently for my birthday. \n\n1. service is good.  \n\n2. <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was over dressed and had too much cheese.  gavin degraw was also eating at the restaurant that night and shared the same feedback on the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.  \n\n3. steak is the reason that this rating is 4 stars instead of 5.  we have had far better steak at craftsteak. but the side of mushrooms that you can order with the steak is sooo good!\n\n4. butter cake was a great dessert but there chocolate cake was very dry.  both you could share with someone else.\n\n5. the lemon drop is one of the best i have ever had.  i will order it every time i am in vegas. the wine list is also reasonable and has a lot of good choices.", 
            "mastro's ocean club is one of my favorite restaurants inside of city center!  although the designer of this restaurant claims that it is set in a treehouse, it feels more like the dining room of a luxury cruise ship.  \n\ntheir <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> cannot be beat.  i'm a huge fan of the pretzel bread too and apparently my server noticed.  he won my heart by giving me an entire basket of it!\n\ni wish they were still open for lunch.", 
            "mastro's to me is just another steak house. just like fleming's or morton's and ruth's chris, morton's offers a very classic steak restaurant. visiting vegas, i made a decision i shouldn't have made. not to say that going to matro's ocean club inside the shops at crystals was a mistake or a bad experience. i just have a dining out rule when i'm in vegas. \"if there's one in la or oc, don't go there.\" well, i broke my rule, but it was all for a birthday celebration. i figured, i probably won't be going to mastro's anytime soon, so might as well. and the bird's nest really attracted me. i was really happy with my decision for the most part.\n\nwe started things of with bread service. they offered pretzel, crouton, baguette, dinner roll, and wheat bread. the breadbasket had variety all were quite good. my favorite was the pretzel -- it was soft and airy.\n\ni had some of the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> to start. i needed some kind of greens to soak up all that meat juice. their <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was near perfect. the dressing was nice and creamy. the addition of parmesan cheese and cracked pepper made everything better.\n\ni was ready for the main event, the 22oz bone in rib eye. the rib eye is one of my favorite cuts because of the even fat marbling and soft texture. mine was cooked perfectly medium rare, though a bit more on the rare side. this actually caused the meat to be a bit tough. this cut did have some nice fat running through the steak. this helped with the tenderness and mouth feel of the meat. even though this wasn't the best steak i have had, the help of the amazing sides made it all better.\n\nthe real reason i came here wasn't the steak. well it is, and it isn't. the real reason i came here was for the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. i mean. it is mastro's ocean club -- ocean, meaning seafood is in order. this side dish was rich as can be -- full of butter. i believe the potato to butter ratio is near 1 to 1. with a whole lobster tail carefully chopped up and placed in a pool of butter, the potatoes were creamy and flavorful. the pure essence of the sea was encased in butter, and mixed with potatoes. eating this with steak was pure bliss. the kid in me wanted to order the mac and cheese. made with gorgonzola, the flavor was very rich. another cream heavy and dairy heavy dish, the mac and cheese was delicious. my favorite was the layer of melted cheese on top.\n\nmy favorite was dessert. we were celebrating a birthday, so they gave us a chocolate birthday cake. the cake was rich in chocolate and eating just a few bites was enough for me. the best thing about this dessert was their home made whipped cream. served on the side in a bowl, the homemade whipped cream was so dense and fluffy. the cold cream and the chocolate cake was a perfect mixture. honestly though, the whipped cream was the best thing ever. i wanted to take it all home.\n\neating at mastro's ocean club was a great experience. the location is a bit awkward. as you are enjoying your expensive meal inside an amazingly architectured \"bird's nest,\" you look out and you see people shopping. that is cool and all, but you can't help but think you are inside of a mall -- well, you are inside of a mall, and this mastro's makes sure you know that. i couldn't help but think i was at a very glorified food court at a mall. when i eat at a nice establishment, i want to feel secluded from the world. i just didn't get the at from here. the food is great, though as far as steakhouses go in las vegas, you can do a lot better. i guess i can only break my rule once. never eat at las vegas where you can at home.", 
            "we went last night as a party of seven for a farewell dinner before i head to the middle east.  we requested the tree house and a round table and it was perfect.  the service all night was outstanding, water glasses never got less than half empty.  we all ordered apps, salad/soups, main course and dessert.  the escargot was great, very garlicky and the <mark>Sauteed Shrimp</mark> were excellent.  the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was good, but you could really taste the anchovy, if you don't like anchovies, stay away.\n  i had a bone in filet and it was the best, most melt in your mouth steak i have ever had.  all the steaks, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, scallops and lobster were great.  the only critique i have is that my father's <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> was quite under done.  we should have sent it back, but he refused.  overall, a great place for fine dining, bring your $$$$.", 
            "what's that expression that a lot of us foolhardy guys toss about as soon as we get to vegas? \"go big, or go home\"? it basically gives us a free pass to indulge in things that are extravagant, luxurious and potentially dangerous. and mastro's fits well within this criteria: the place holds meals fit for royalty, the decor is immaculate, and it can be hazardous to your wallet's health if you are not prepared. but for those of us still reading, and certainly for those of us who have had the honor, mastro's is a must-dine destination if you're in town.\n\nlocated pretty centrally in the city center shopping district, it's almost impossible to miss mastro's: the opulent, wood-like \"fishbowl\" perched precariously at an elevation is definitely eye-catching, and i'm pretty sure i inadvertently photobombed countless tourists as they stopped to take pictures of this structure, which is actually a dining room. before you can get to your table, you stop by a tiny hostess desk flanked by two gals who wasted no time getting us seated once we checked in with our reservation. you'll more than likely walk past an offshoot to another, more private dining room, a pretty spectacular bar and then make your way into the main dining room that is expertly laid out: whoever did the layout here did so in such a way that seating is maximized but not once does it feel crowded. and this is even more impressive when you consider the polished staff is zipping about without hesitation or collision.\n\nand let's talk about the staff, right quick: simply put, these are professionals who know their craft inside and out. our waiter, lionel, was the epitome of providing an exceptional customer service experience. we were -that- table that upfront told him we had a show to catch later that evening, and without missing a beat, he assured us he would keep us on schedule and would not let the meal be compromised. his service, along with the refills and bussing provided by other staff members, made for the best, most efficient dining experience i have seen yet in years of visiting vegas. add in a visit from a manager who just stopped by to chat and make sure everything was cool, and you have a place with a team that cannot be topped.\n\nbut all the friendliness and attention to detail means nothing if the food is bogus, and mastro's has this base covered, too. oh, do they ever. my folks started with a bowl of <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, while i went with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. all three were perfect pre-show snacks for the main courses, and just typing this sentence out is making me drool with fond remembrance. ahem. \n\nmom went with a <mark>Gulf Red Snapper</mark> that was cooked to perfection and my surf-and-turf combo of a filet and lobster tail (which lionel was gracious enough to de-shell table side like a boss) ranks among the best i've had at any place around the world. but the most surprising part was when dad sheepishly admitted he had somehow never had <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> before... and now that bar is set unfathomably high as his <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> here was his favorite meal of this trip. a side of <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> and <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark> rounded out dinner, and wiped out my stomach. somehow, my folks found room for mastro's signature dessert, a butter cake that made me question how a chef can bake happiness, joy and euphoria into one pastry. it's that good (even though i had two bites and almost went into a coma with the straight gin i was drinking).\n\ni cannot say enough positive things about mastro's. from the staff to the overall \"look\" of the place, and most assuredly the culinary satisfaction each plate offers, it's a place that rewards all those who stop by for a drink or a bite to eat. take those winnings from the casino and invest them here: i promise it's a much better deal than your favorite variation of blackjack.", 
            "what an amazing experience with mastro's!\\u00a0\nwe came in with a large party for a christmas dinner. this was most of my guests first time dining here. we had a view of the treehouse, love the architecture! there was no wait for a table.\\u00a0\nwe started with calamari, <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>. the bread basket was to die for! we enjoyed <mark>New York Strip</mark>, filet, chicken, artic char, and my favorite the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>! we had so many sides, they were all wonderful!\\u00a0\nour servers trista and daniel were wonderful. very friendly, always made sure we had a drink and were happy. and the manager luciana checked on us a few times making sure we were enjoying each course.\\u00a0\nbest dinner in vegas ever! can't wait to return!",

            "a couple of weeks ago i went to dinner by myelf at mastro's ocean club, the wooden donut shaped eatery located in the middle of the new crystal's shopping mall at city center. \n\nit was tempting to fill up on the bread basket filled with pretzel and rye bread sticks, parmesan crackers, and teardrop sourdough boules, but i restrained myself and saved room for a half order of the <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark> ($7.99) and the <mark>Sauteed Shrimp</mark> appetizer ($18.95). everything at mastro's is fairly expensive, so these dishes were a great way to test their quality without spending a ton. the <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark> was essentially a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with horseradish in the dressing, and being a huge fan of horseradish, i very much enjoyed it. i always ask for light dressing (or dressing on the side) in less expensive restaurants because more expensive restaurants generally know how to dress a salad properly, and mastro's was no exception. if anything, the salad bordered on verge of being under-dressed, so if you are a fan of heavy salad dressing, i would ask for extra. the <mark>Sauteed Shrimp</mark> were nothing less than wonderful, and hit the spot for my seafood craving. the huge shrimp were cooked just right and served over a broth that tasted like a <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> reduction rich with butter. the cheesy garlic bread croutons absorbed this liquid on one end, but remained crunchy at the other, providing some textural contrast. it was fun to dip all the different kinds of bread from the basket in the sauce as well to see how they each paired differently. overall it was a really successful dish, and because the shrimp were so plump and the sauce so rich, it was certainly enough for my entree. one item that i might have tried as a side had i been with someone, however, was the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> - they looked fantastic. i wasn't too disheartened by not getting them, as i still had a terrific meal that was plenty filling.\n\ni wanted to order their signature butter cake dessert, but because it was $14 and i was full by that point, i decided to pass. i'm sure it's enough for two to three people so maybe next time i go and i'm not by myself i'll splurge and get it.",

            "so this is the 4th mastro's i have been to and i can't even count the number of times i have been to a mastro's. yet they never fail to prevail! i took my mother and 2 sisters here on a friday night when we were in vegas. i have never been to this one, but have been to the ocean club in scottsdale, city hall in scottsdale and the one in beverly hills. we got seated in the \"treehouse\" which is the big wooden circle that everyone takes pictures of when they are in crystal. we ordered a nice bottle of wine and my sister and i split the beefsteak tomato & mozz appetizer (i always get this when i am here) it is great because they split the order into two plates. my mother and older sister split the <mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark> and my mother could not stop talking about how great it was! i will admit we are all canadian so we are not used to the amazing portions of food they serve in america! it is great!!! i ordered my usual *massive* <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> with avocados and no meat/dressing on the side - it is my fav salad ever! younger sister ordered the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> 8oz which she loved and actually finished. older sister ordered something different - <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> sashimi 10oz, she was only able to finish half of it (i will add a picture soon b/c it is an unusual plate to order at mastro's) she said it was really tasty just a huge portion. my mother ordered the atlantic salmon filet 12oz, again very big but very good!!! of course we have to order sides! my fav <mark>Spinach <mark>Broccoli <mark>Asparagus - Steamed or Sauted</mark></mark></mark> mushrooms, steamed asparagus, and my sister's favourite gorgonzola mac'n'cheese. overall mastro's the my #1 fav restaurant and this new location in the city center is just as great as any other mastro's :)", 
            "my first thought when seated was, \"it's a good thing all of these world class stores aren't doing any business because it sure takes the edge off a high-dining experience along the mall food court railing\". our table felt like a satellite location for a sparkling contemporary version of daddy's classic steak house. and we weren't even seated in the satellite (you'll get it if you visit). it just seemed surreal for a \"room\" with such distinguishing attributes. i won't hold that against them, much.\n\nit was just my son and i that visited to celebrate his 21st. matt was our dining guide and he was fun. not like, \"let's have a vegas night!\", fun. just that he carried his demeanor well and kept his smile on. he was very, very consistent in that his presentation to each of the three tables nearby was identical, and specific. he was meticulous to ensure accuracy and satisfaction.\n\nwe were completely impressed by the young lady and gentleman entertaining the room. we later learned that it was their first night at mastro's. their acoustics in that challenging environment are absolute perfection and their talents are superior.  \n\nwe went light on the openers which were supplemented by an abundant variety of stellar bread choices. my son is all-american in his need for a calamari appetizer. it was the best we'd ever had, and maybe will. i had the <mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark> and, again, maybe the best complete salad i've ever enjoyed. my son ordered the <mark>Bone-In KC Strip</mark> a little less than medium and he dubbed it the crown jewel of his steak experiences. he couldn't finish it and he finishes everything. i asked for the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. matt helped me herd descriptives into a perfectly cooked finish. i'm still thinking it's the fact that i live in colorado, where even onions and garlic sometimes have difficulty offering flavor, but if it's possible to have too much natural flavor in a steak, it happened. i'm taking accountability on that one, because it's not mastro's fault i live at high altitude. this was a huge steak and i hardly dented it. we sided up a strong contender for best garlic mashed, which we carried out more of than we ate. so we get this this lovely shopping bag, consistent with the elevated neighborhood, to carry our midnight snack down the strip with. \n\ni have so many reasons to go 5 star all over this place and fractions of thoughts about why i wouldn't. those fractions, the bulk of which are carried by the food court railing ambiance, add up to one. and i won't insult matt because i liked him.\n\nwhen i return in may, i might just take the other half of the family because i can't go wrong on this one.", 
            "what is there to say about mastro's ocean club that has not already been said? it's funny . . . we live in scottsdale, home of the original mastro's and mastro's ocean club, and yet, this is where we decided to dine in las vegas. having never been to mastro's ocean club in scottsdale, but knowing friends far and wide have been so delighted there, we thought on our vacation, we should give the sister restaurant a try! we are so glad we did!\n\nthe space itself is very unique in design. we were seated in the \"tree house\". it is quite a spectacle from inside as well as outside as the wood towers from the lower level of the crystals shopping center to the very top with a rounded platform area, that kind of resembles an open wooden spaceship, within which is the dining room seating. it is very light and airy. there is plenty of room between tables and despite some of other reviewers complaints that the music is loud, we had no problem with it, even on a friday night.\n\nour waiter (i think his name is robert) was one of the best servers we have ever had, in just about any restaurant in which we have dined. he was knowledgeable, friendly, didn't hover, and was not pushy at all. he gave us time to order, time in between courses, time to finish the humongous plates of food.  the rest of the waitstaff was also attentive. having sat outside at the pool all day, my husband was parched, and i think he drank at least eight glasses of water . . . he never had to wait for the glass to be refilled! when i couldn't finish a course, the attendant asked if he could wrap the remaining up to go. i didn't have to flag anyone down.\n\nthe food was top notch, bar none!  we started with the <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark>. it was a massive appetizer of tiny cubed ahi piled above avocado and what i believe were panko chips. fresh, flavorful and enough for a table of four (not two) to share! not knowing how large the portion was going to be, we also ordered an <mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark> to split - fabulous! and, huge! it had chopped egg, onion, shrimp, lobster, blue cheese . . . you could eat one as a meal. at that point, i issued a proclamation to my husband, aside from our main entrees, we could only order one side. hubby ordered the bone-in rib eye . . . a hunka hunka burnin' love of meat, perfectly seasoned, perfectly seared to medium rare. bliss for my hubby who gets no red meat at home!  i ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> oreganata . . . melted in my mouth . . . and, it too was a giant piece of fish! i couldn't even finish it. the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> was delish, even luke warm, as we couldn't even finish it during our meal, but instead had it as a midnight snack back in our hotel room!  \n\none other note . . . and this was pure genius. i couldn't finish my wine. if i put anything more into my stomach, i think i would have exploded! our waiter said on the way out, take my drink to the hostess and she will give it to me to go. apparently, the hostess can do this, but the waiter can't. thinking i am going to get my wine in a plastic cup . . . the hostess actually poured it into another wine glass and told me to keep it! \n\nwithout a doubt, this was the best meal we had in vegas over this three-day holiday. and despite what some would say is a hefty price tag, i beg to differ. the quality of the service and food were spot on. we had dinner at two other similarly priced restaurants and left feeling robbed. not so at mastro's ocean club. \n\ni think i have finally convinced my husband to make the scottsdale mastro's ocean club on our regular rotation for fine dining . . . i hope it lives up to the las vegas outlet!", 
            "i've been to this place maybe about 3 times, and one of its sister locations in costa mesa about 3 times as well. both restaurants exude that high end feeling and you will leave feeling... well feeling awesome that you spent 50 bucks on a slab of meat. but that's not all.\n\nif you make an open table reservation they will always call you the day of to confirm and remind you that you are going to attend. one of the times i've been to this mastro's ocean club and they were fully committed, and suggested to look for a seat at the bar area, and then one of the waitress or hostesses asked if i would mind eating on the piano (they had live music that time) which i found it hilarious, a $1k+ grand piano with me eating on it. regardless i told her i would wait for a party at the bar to be seated but that was another time. \n\nyou're going to pay at least $70+ per person but the food along with the service makes it all worth it. every time i go to mastro's, the waiters/waitresses are always so nice, helpful, professional, and willing to answer any and all questions you may have about the menu. if you haven't been there before they will let you know the vastness of the menu and how they operate as a steakhouse/ocean club.\n\nmy reccemondations as far as mastro's ocean club in las vegas?\n\nbone-in fillet\n<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> (although the filet wins my money by a mile)\n<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>\ngarlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>\n<mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark>\nand their raw oysters - wherever it is from because it is super fresh\n\nif you go in on a special occasion like a birthday or a graduation, most of the time they'll give you a slice of chocolate cake as dessert and the most kick ass whipped cream you would have ever had the chance to have. yes it is just that good.\n\nhope you guys enjoy it as much as i do. after writing this review, i'm just vying to go back.", 
            "*** word of warning: this steakhouse is located inside a mall and you will most likely have a view of a high-end store while you eat. *** \n\ntypically, i'm a huge fan of mastro's and every time we are celebrating a special occasion, we will pay a visit to mastro's. unfortunately i was a little disappointed in the vegas location. \n\ni will start with the pros. the food was sublime. it was exactly the quality of food mastro's provides at their locations in phoenix. i started with the <mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark> which came with fresh shrimp with blue cheese dressing, avocado and tomatoes. the salad was refreshing and delicious and filled me up! however, i wasn't done just yet. following the salad, i ordered the crab cake and shared the lobster mac and cheese with my husband. the crab cake was made of fresh crab and was more crab than filling which was perfect. the lobster mac and cheese is always a must and you can't visit mastro's without ordering it! i also stole a bite of my husband's filet which was cooked to perfection. yes, i did roll out of the restaurant but rolled out fat and happy from the amazing food! they cook everything to perfection and it's always a gluttonous good time. \n\nso why the three stars? sadly, that goes to ambiance and service. the restaurant in located inside a mall. granted, it's a very high-end mall but it's still a mall just the same. that wouldn't make a huge difference except that the restaurant has an open floor plan with an open balcony which means you are looking out into the mall while you eat. it's very light and bright and just doesn't provide for a very romantic experience. they do have a tree-like structure that you can eat in which hides the mall a little bit, but it's hard to forget that you're in a mall during your meal. considering that it's vegas and there are so many venues with wonderful ambiance, i would choose another restaurant next time. \n\nthe customer service was also a bit disappointing. i felt like we were always trying to get our server's attention. he wasn't very attentive to us and anytime we wanted to order another drink or food, we had to hunt him down. we were going to order dessert but it took him so long to check on us that by the time he came to our table, we were just ready to go at that point. i would have liked it if the server was a bit more attentive so that we didn't have to track him down the whole meal. \n\nwhile the food was amazing, the ambiance and service left something to be desired and since vegas has so many restaurants to choose from, we will choose a different restaurant during our next visit to the strip."

            "we were excited to dine at this acclaimed restaurant. my husband ordered the garlic mashed potatos, the filet and <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> soup.\nthe soup was superb, the finest he has ever tasted, the steak was tender and quite tasty, the mashed potaoes too were great. however the potatos were extremely salty. good but salty. so be aware. i ordered the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>, sauted spinach and <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark>.  salad was very good, <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark> were wonderful too. spinach was very good but had way too tuch garlic for my taste. our server and all of the staff were extreemly attentive and provided  excellent service which made the dinner even more enjoyable.  upon leaving we mentioned that the potatos were oversalted and only received a comment \"we know\" thanks for the feedback.  we would go back to dine here again but not order the potatos.",

            "obviously mastro's is really expensive but it's very much worth it. this is in vegas so my friends and i didn't have time for dinner so we decided to go to the bar and have some appetizers.\n\n<mark>Chopped Salad</mark>\ncalamari\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>\n\nthe chocolate covered strawberries are ridiculously good.\n\nwe ended up back at the bar the following night to do it all again. i wish i could remember both bartender's names but i can't. they were both great.\n\nif you don't mind paying for great food the this is the place to go.", 
            "to me just the architecture of the place alone is magnificent. first time i visited the city center i was blown away by this very spectacular  structure. when i found out there is a restaurant inside i knew i have to try it.\n\non one of my visits to sin city i was lucky enough to experience the remarkable dinning from above. \nwe shared the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>. yeah, you are thinking \"out of the colorful selection, really?\" but it was marvelous. so flavorful and fresh. \n\nand then <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> medium rare followed. ahhhh,,,,, it came on super hot plate the whole rack in one piece. we cut through the meat which was on rare side and finish cooking it on the hot plate. the result  flavor of the dish was beyond extraordinary. best <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> ever.\n\natmosphere great, music decent, waiters nice and well knowledge  of menu and wine.", 
            "we had dinner one night at mastro's, and what a great choice!  i can honestly say everyone on staff made our dining experience a complete delight.\n\nfor dinner i got the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>, <mark>Gulf Red Snapper</mark>, and the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark>.  in addition, our server also brought some warm, fresh bread out to the table.  everything was so good.  truly, the fish was so fresh i would not be surprised if it had been caught that very same day.  the seasoning on all the food was perfect, and i didn't have to add salt, pepper or anything.  truly tantalizing.  the portions were also large.  the potato was definitely big enough to split with at least one other person.\n\nto top off my experience, someone from the restaurant actually called me the next day to ask how our experience was!  that was a first for me, and i was majorly impressed.  the next time i go back to vegas, we will definitely be stopping in at mastro's again.", 
            "great service, amazing food, and awesome live jazz band. it's a great restaurant. love the architecture of this place. i had the burrata salad, <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, and filet steak. my favorites were tomato & mozzarella and the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. very good quality.", 
            "3.5 stars- definitely better than 3 stars, but not quite 4.\n\nthis restaurant is location in the middle of crystals on the strip.  from the outside looking in, the restaurant is inside a neat sculptured \"treehouse\". it sort of made me feel like if would be cool to eat in there, but sitting on the inside of the treehouse looking out i feel a little disappointed, because i felt like i was eating in an \"upscale\" food court with views of retail stores, such as  lv, jimmy choo, and zegna.  not exactly, the scene i expected  from an expensive restaurant, however on the other side there was a piano bar.\n\nhowever, service was impeccable, except we were only told the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> was out when we ordering rather than beforehand.  in a rush we picked <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> as our appetizer, husband ordered mac & cheese, we shared the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>,  <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> and <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  \n\nwe ordered a bottle of schramberg blanc de blanc for $70. given it is about $27 in retail that markup isn't terrible, beside by the glass ranged from $15 to $30. the wine list is comprehensive.\n\ni am kind of bored with <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark>, but it was definitely above average and the portion size of the appetizer is the size of a meal.  it is presented like a tower with the base made of crushed fried wontons, then avocado almost like guacamole, then the seasoned tuna.  \n\nthe mac & cheese was a huge portion that could feed 4 people on its own or 6 side servings.  i just had to have a bite, it was creamy, cheesy and tangy all the same time; i like the addition of gorgonzola, which still remained subtle.   definitely an adult upscale mac & cheese. \n\n<mark>Chopped Salad</mark> was solid and i like how we were told the ingredients and asked if we wanted to omit anything.\n\nthe king crab comes warm when it is an entree and that was a bit unexpected, but tasted sweet and drowned in the drawn butter....ooooh, so good. i was surprised how meaty the 1 lb of legs were...easily filling up one person.  \n\ni love <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> prepared any way, but i it was pan-fried to perfection.  the outside crusty and the inside soft and buttery. the seasoning was just salt.  the serving size is probably 8 oz, which is ample and justifies the price.\n\nno room for dessert, but a slice of  chocolate layer cake with schlag (whipped cream) was on the house since it was my birthday.  very generous.\n\noverall, pretty good, but again i couldn't get past the view which cheapened the ambiance. we left with enough food for another dinner so that was good too.\n\ndon't know why it is called \"beach club\".  the environment doesn't in any way demonstrate a \"beach club\".  that may be a good thing, though.\n\nwill i go again? probably not, i think joe's seafood (not the crab shack) has a better ambiance and food, except the fish here is better.", 
            "i think it is actually called the \"tree house\", but i kept calling it the birds nest. whatever it was, it was cool!! now, keep in mind, this was a business dinner that i was at, so anything goes when it comes to ordering!! \n\nas far as what i had, i started with the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>. delish! for dinner i got the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> special. this was different than the regular <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, because it came with the most delicious king crab leg meat as well in a yummy butter sauce. i honestly could only eat half of the steak, this was just too much food all around. \n\nfor sides, we got the mushrooms, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>. holy bananas these were all so good.\n\nthen we finished with the butter cake!! which is gigantic, way to big for two people. we all got some of it (there were six of us), but keep in mind we were stuffed at this point! the noise level was reasonable in this restaurant, so it was perfect for a dinner with colleagues.", 
            "what an amazing experience with mastro's!\\u00a0\nwe came in with a large party for a christmas dinner. this was most of my guests first time dining here. we had a view of the treehouse, love the architecture! there was no wait for a table.\\u00a0\nwe started with calamari, <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>. the bread basket was to die for! we enjoyed <mark>New York Strip</mark>, filet, chicken, artic char, and my favorite the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>! we had so many sides, they were all wonderful!\\u00a0\nour servers trista and daniel were wonderful. very friendly, always made sure we had a drink and were happy. and the manager luciana checked on us a few times making sure we were enjoying each course.\\u00a0\nbest dinner in vegas ever! can't wait to return!"

            "this is our 1st time at any of the mastro's restaurants.  we have family & friends in the vegas area who recommended & accompanied this as a truly upscale & 4-to-5 star dining experience.  they were correct!  \n\nupon being seated practically in the center of their 60 ft teak or mahogany simulated treehouse, we asked the very crisply uniformed captain to recommend the appetizers.  he had us create our own \"seafood tower\" and we chose <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark>, shrimp, oysters & calamari... delish!  the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> & <mark>Iceberg Wedge</mark> were next.  the five of us then shared a filet, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, atlantic salmon & scallops with garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  our captain went over and above as he assisted us in choose the appropriate wine to pair with our culinary choices.\n\nnow.. we would come back for all of this goodness, but the mastro's butter cake is one of a kind and is worth the whole meal or just to drop in for dessert after shopping.  \n\nneedless to say & in keeping with my \"positively outrageously\" great dining recommendations, you have to enjoy mastro's if you're in vegas!", 
            "i made reservations for dinner on a thursday evening and my hotel was nearby so i was able to walk here. i heart the decor of the tree house dinning which we were seated at. see it: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-las-vegas?select=veyizprriievg0x5eyxb7q#veyizprriievg0x5eyxb7q this mastro's has three levels dinning areas and tree house is on the second floor with views of the crystal mall.  \n\nordered a a bottle of napa cabernet sauvignon after the yummy bread basket arrived. followed with the <mark>Iceberg Wedge</mark> salad which contained smoked maple bacon and chunks of blue cheese - refreshing and so yummy. for the main entree i opted for the 22 oz bone in rib eye - cooked medium rare and a side of the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. as with every mastro's i've dined at, the food and service were impeccable. if you're a fish eater check out the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> here, it was incredibly fresh and delicious. we ended the meal with the chocolate sin cake which was moist and a perfect ending to conclude the meal. \n\neven though mastro's was bought out last year, the quality and service in my opinion are at the top tier of the industry. btw, have a beverage in the bar before or after dinner for some interesting people watching.\n\nthank you to the entire staff at the las vegas mastro's for an awesome dinning experience!",

            "i brought clients here on a thursday evening for dinner around 800 pm. i recommend reservations since  the place gets busy. my clients who arrived from denver around a year ago and never experienced mastro's previously so i knew they were in for a treat.\n\nwe started off with drinks at the table  once we were  seated and were brought the awesome bread basket -  i indulged in the pretzel bread yum! we ordered a few appetizers - scallops, <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> and ordered our starter salads. i opted for just the 1/2 salad of the <mark>Iceberg Wedge</mark> - it's plenty large and so yummy. for my main entree i went for he <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> and we shared several twice cooked potatoes and cream spinach. everything was spectacular and the service was stellar! my lamb was cooked to perfection and  my clients were impressed as i expected. the only con was nobody had room for buttercake!\n\ni received a telephone call from mastrro's the following day thanking me for my business which again is so out of the box. i'm happy to see even with the change of ownership that nothing has changed here!",

            "my wife and i celebrated her recent birthday here on monday evening 10/25/10 and enjoyed and amazing dinner that far exceeded our highest expectations. this new outpost of mastros is romantic and elegant with all of the true hallmarks of five star dining. \nwe have previously been to mastros in beverly hills and i much preferred this location as food and service were flawless as we've come to expect with the added touch of refinement and class that mastro beverly hills seems to lack with the nightclub atmosphere and hollywood infused scene. \n\nthe food:\n\nappetizer:\n\nseared <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> -  perfectly seared and prepared in a garlic cream sauce. accompanied by 2 garlic toasted bread crisps. delicous.\n\nentrees:\n\n<mark>Petite Filet</mark> (medium) - hers - simple but perfect. mastro's signature entree and they do it to perfection\n\n<mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> (medium rare) - mine -  i love lamb above all other meats and this is one of the best i can ever remember having. bold but not gamey it flavor.\n(jiraffe in santa monica is a close 2nd.)\n\nsides:\n\nsauteed mushrooms w/ onions  - sweet & earthy. the perfect compliment to tender filet & lamb when combined with mastro's fries. \n\nsea salt shoestring fries (no vinegar) - crisp and salty which just the right amount of texture.\n\ndessert - \n\nchocolate birthday cake - brought out complimetary. nothing special but a nice birthday gesture. \n\nwarm butter cake ala mode - you simply have to get this! \nno meal at mastro's would be complete without it. my wife talked about this for days before our meal and reminisced about it for days after. it's simply the best enormous warm, buttery sugar cookie you've ever had paired with the smoothest vanilla bean ice cream you can imagine.\n\n i have to say we left very impressed with our mastro's las vegas experience. it definitely raises mastro's to our favorite special occasion restaurant from now on (just not the beverly hills location.)with food, service and atmosphere this wonderful you just can't go wrong. \n\nnext up for us is mastros in thousand oaks.", 
            "so this is the 4th mastro's i have been to and i can't even count the number of times i have been to a mastro's. yet they never fail to prevail! i took my mother and 2 sisters here on a friday night when we were in vegas. i have never been to this one, but have been to the ocean club in scottsdale, city hall in scottsdale and the one in beverly hills. we got seated in the \"treehouse\" which is the big wooden circle that everyone takes pictures of when they are in crystal. we ordered a nice bottle of wine and my sister and i split the beefsteak tomato & mozz appetizer (i always get this when i am here) it is great because they split the order into two plates. my mother and older sister split the <mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark> and my mother could not stop talking about how great it was! i will admit we are all canadian so we are not used to the amazing portions of food they serve in america! it is great!!! i ordered my usual *massive* <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> with avocados and no meat/dressing on the side - it is my fav salad ever! younger sister ordered the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> 8oz which she loved and actually finished. older sister ordered something different - <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> sashimi 10oz, she was only able to finish half of it (i will add a picture soon b/c it is an unusual plate to order at mastro's) she said it was really tasty just a huge portion. my mother ordered the atlantic salmon filet 12oz, again very big but very good!!! of course we have to order sides! my fav <mark>Spinach <mark>Broccoli <mark>Asparagus - Steamed or Sauted</mark></mark></mark> mushrooms, steamed asparagus, and my sister's favourite gorgonzola mac'n'cheese. overall mastro's the my #1 fav restaurant and this new location in the city center is just as great as any other mastro's :)", 
            "overall, i really enjoyed my meal but be prepared for a different ambiance! the restaurant is literally in the middle of the mall, with the tables pretty much out in the open. not a huge deal, but definitely not ideal. \n\ni had the <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark> (spicy <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with no croutons), 8 oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark> and cheese cake for dessert. the filet was perfectly prepared, served on a burning hot plate that sizzled and continued to cook the sides of <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, spinach and garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. our table also shared the <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark> appetizer, which was excellent! highly recommended!", 
            "completely disappointed by maestro's restaurant in las vegas.  i read such wonderful reviews on yelp and was really looking forward to it. my husband and i went there for our 1 year wedding anniversary dinner. i made reservations a month before the big day and requested to have a bottle of champagne upon our arrival.  \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> to start.  it took about 20 minutes for them to take that initial order and another 20-30 minutes for them to bring it out.  the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> was so salty and came with a weird <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> combination on top as aside. the dressing of the salad ruined the flavor of the meat if the salt didn't already to it. \n\nas our main entrees we ordered a <mark>Petite Filet</mark> and lamp chops. dry, dry, dry! i'm sorry but if we are paying over +$50 a plate we expect mouth watering tender meat.  that wasn't the case at all. so disappointed. \n\nto end the evening we were so disappointed by the slow service, the bad appetizer and unsatisfactory entr\\u00e9e we didn't even want dessert. as the waiter brings the +$200 check he just says happy anniversary and walks away.  no complimentary dessert or glass of champagne as most places would have done. oh well...i will go back to sage inside aria which is the best steak house i have ever been too.", 
            "i came here for a nice dinner with a special person, and i absolutely loved it. \n\nfirst of all, the xmas decorations in the mall were amazing. set the mood very well for our dinner. we checked in with the hostess, and the hostess who walked us to our seats was very friendly. \n\nwe sat next to the live band, a lady singer and a guy pianist/singer. they played really good music ranging from older american pop songs to older r&b songs with their own twist. i couldn't help but to quietly sing along during dinner. \n\nwe ordered the following:\n\n1. <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> - this was the best <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> i've had in my life. they really don't skimp on the lobster meat either you would find huge chunks, and it was like digging for treasure! the meat was also cooked just right, and it was really fresh. if you go to this restaurant, this side dish is a must get if you like lobster. \n\n2. sauteed asparagus - pretty standard just got this dish to get some veggies. \n\n3. <mark>Petite Filet</mark> mignon - usually i like more flavorful cuts like ribeyes, and i don't really like filet mignons because they are lean. however this steak was so tender and cooked just right. i enjoyed it a lot. it was just the right portion, 8 oz, since i wasn't too hungry.\n\n3. <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> - i had a small bite, the scallop was cooked just right, medium rare, and the meat was so sweet!!\n\ndefinitely recommend to come here on a special occasion, or if you won from gambling!", 
            "i liked this place, but i think it's more for the atmosphere than the food.  don't get me wrong, the food was good - it just didn't quite live up to what i was expecting.  we ordered the seafood tower and everything was delicious.  for my entree, i ordered the <mark>Petite Filet</mark>.  while good, it definitely could have been seasoned more and was a bit overcooked.  honestly, i think kevin rathbun steak has ruined  every other steak restaurant for me - nothing will ever to compare to the steak i had there.  as a side, we ordered the gorgonzola mac and cheese, which had far more mac than cheese unfortunately.  i could barely taste the gorgonzola at all, and given it's strong flavor, there had to be practically none in there.\n\ndrinks were top notch and the service was excellent.  we sat in the treehouse, which was very cool, but the food just didn't do it for me.  unfortunately, it just didn't live up to my lofty expectations.", 
            "how can anyone not love this place?  \n\namidst yelp's spring break festivities and other dining excursions we had in vegas, the dining experience at moc was one of the most memorable.  \nfrom the amazing \"eighth wonder of the world\" tree house we were sitting in, to a generous martini offering, to excellent overall service....it was beyond a five star experience. and i haven't even scratched the surface yet.   \n\nwith all the eating going on in vegas, i could have been very content with just their fresh pretzel rolls and a fantastic campagna burrata salad.  \nbut i couldn't resist and...\n\n...order more pretzel rolls.  they were just too addicting.\n...try their brussel sprouts.  lightly salted to perfection.\n...taste the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  one order can feed an army.  \n...sample their <mark>Petite Filet</mark>.  medium rare truly melted in my mouth.\n...and savor the seared <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark>.  cooked just right with an orgasmic garlic butter sauce. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gi-caiz_gg3h21pwranb4q?select=krtnnxciarthzdx-fq1_ra#mwxtyvukccbgmgfizysluq)\n\njust when i thought it was over, i was reminded of their infamous warm butter cake for dessert.  so i had to be a teamplayer and try a little.  it was heavenly.  no matter how full we were, dinner was not complete without indulging in this popular dessert...and the accompanying gigantic bowl of whip cream. i discovered that 10 spoonfuls is \"just a little taste\" when it comes to this cake topped with vanilla ice cream and sliced strawberries. ay! \n\ntheir mysterious live piano artist kept us entertained and added a nice touch to the ambiance of not only the restaurant, but around all of crystals mall. \nthis will not be the last time i dine here, that's for sure. even though we were running late to a yelp event, it was well worth it!", 
            "the las vegas-mastro's ranks among our top dining experiences anywhere in the world.  on this labor day weekend visit, our initial disappointment, of not being seated in the unique & always fascinating \"tree-house\", was quickly extinguished by shauna, our culinary captain extraordinaire, menu \"tour guide\" and libation/wine aficionado.  turns out... our \"terrace\" seating near the piano bar was as enjoyable as it was entertaining, resulting in yet another \"positively outrageous\" fine dining adventure.\n\nshauna introduced us to mastro's participation in \"las vegas restaurant week\", a worthy nationwide charity drive to raise money for & donate meals to 3-square food bank in southern nevada.  she offered a special 4-course dinner deliciously flanked by beefsteak tomato & onion salad, an 8 oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> & garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and key lime pie all for a reasonable price, part of which was ultimately donated for a worthy cause.  \n\nas there were 5 of us on this visit, the aforementioned special meal was joined by collection of our menu favs and shauna's recommendations. she perfectly paired our appetizers & meals with wonderful riesling, cabernet, and sauvignon blanc.\n\nsooo, included in the culinary delight were: the legendary seafood tower (ohhh yes!!), <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (best in class!), <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark> (delightful), <mark>New York Strip</mark> (absolute perfection), <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> (sweet & outa this world), saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> (oh yeah!), <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (buttered and seasoned to perfection), saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms ( a fav of favs), <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> (these aren't yo mama's sprouts, believe it!), 1 lb. <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> (huge), triple chocolate layer cake (nothing but delish), and...(drum roll)... the mastro's signature warm butter cake!!...once again to die for!!!\n\nwithout fail, and to paraphrase the writings of t. scott gross,... mastro's was again a \"positively outrageous\" dining experience where the culinary expectations were always far exceeded.  shauna's unsurpassed service & superior guidance was unexpected, delivered-at-random, fun, entertaining, and so very memorable!  it doesn't get any better!", 
            "i had made reservations here for my wife's birthday and when we got there the place was crowded.  the hostesses explained the wait, and offered for us to have a drink in the lounge until our table was ready.  they kept checking in on us until we were ready to be seated.  \n\nwe started with two cups of coffee and the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark>.  the crab came out on a cup of dry ice that was smoking and was a very good presentation, as well as being extremely tasty.\n\nfor dinner my wife had the 8oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark> and i had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  the waiter, piotr, explained that the sides are served family style and that we should share a couple.  we chose the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and the steamed broccoli.  my wife, when asked how she wanted her meat cooked, asked for it to be medium, piotr explained that medium would still have some pink in the center, and sensing the way that she likes hers cooked, recommended medium plus.  when it came out it was cooked perfectly, and was the most tender steak that she has ever had.  my <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was cooked so it had a nice, crispy shell of the outside, but was milky and soft on the inside.  the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> has spoiled me, now i find it hard to not expect that kind of perfection from all other potatoes.\n\nafter dinner they brought out a complimentary chocolate sin cake for us to share with a birthday message written in sauce on the plate.  \n\noverall, this was an amazing meal at an amazing restaurant, and i would highly recommend this to anyone.  the prices are high, but you will get what you pay for.  my only regret is not being able to try the warm butter cake everyone raves about, but i guess that means i have to go here again next time.", 
            "stopped by for an anniversary dinner before watching le reve. since it was monday after easter, it was easy to make a same day reservation for 5:30 pm. the place was pretty quiet then and around 6:30, more people started to come by so we definitely beat the dinner rush. got a nice seat in the treehouse, with a view overlooking the dior store downstairs.\n\nsince we didn't want to be food comatose for our show later, we ordered just the <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, the regular filet, and a side of <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>. i also ordered coke, but beware that it's by the aluminum bottle and not with unlimited refills. the <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark> were rich and delicious, but the cheese was too much halfway through the side order. the meat was very tender and cooked to perfection. the medium was medium and the medium rare was just as it should be. since it was our anniversary, they also brought by a complimentary slice of rich chocolate cake topped with raspberries and whipped cream. overall a fantastic meal!", 
            "i've been here twice and my second experience was even better than the first.  my hubby and i came here to celebrate our anniversary and we were so glad we did.  \n\nwe were greeted by the sweetest hostess as soon as we arrived, and she asked if we were here for a special occasion.  i let her know that it was our anniversary, and word traveled fast since our waiter greeted us with a congratulations.  \n\ni ordered the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> (8oz) and a side of <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>, and my husband ordered the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> (12oz) and the gorgonzola mac & cheese.  my steak was so tender that i could cut it with a butter knife and it practically melted in my mouth.  my husband is a steak connoisseur and he said that it was the best steak that he's ever had.  the <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> were buttery and pan seared to perfection, and the mac & cheese was rich and heavy.  i'm not a fan of blue cheese at all but the gorgonzola was really mild (i guess they use 4 kinds of cheeses).  \n\nalthough we didn't even have room for dessert, our waiter brought us a nice piece of chocolate cake with \"happy anniversary\" on the plate.  along with this came a giant serving of their homemade  whip cream.  i somehow found room in my belly and managed to scarf down 1/2 of it.  a really nice gesture that went a long way.  \n\nthe service was fantastic.  even if we looked in the waiter/servers' direction they would come over to see if we needed anything.  \n\nthe only thing odd about this location is that it is in the crystal cove mall, so the ambiance isn't what i'm used to with this kind of food.  at least we were surrounded by high end shops like jimmy choo.  the bathrooms are also upstairs which are kind of a bummer.  we didn't mind at all though, we were on cloud 9 with everything else about the place.", 
            "came in here for dinner and all i can say is wow. first, the service is outstanding. second the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> was so well prepared you did not even need a knife. the flavor was amazing, as were the sides we order. you definitely get what you pay for here..worth every penny", 
            "i think it is actually called the \"tree house\", but i kept calling it the birds nest. whatever it was, it was cool!! now, keep in mind, this was a business dinner that i was at, so anything goes when it comes to ordering!! \n\nas far as what i had, i started with the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>. delish! for dinner i got the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> special. this was different than the regular <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, because it came with the most delicious king crab leg meat as well in a yummy butter sauce. i honestly could only eat half of the steak, this was just too much food all around. \n\nfor sides, we got the mushrooms, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>. holy bananas these were all so good.\n\nthen we finished with the butter cake!! which is gigantic, way to big for two people. we all got some of it (there were six of us), but keep in mind we were stuffed at this point! the noise level was reasonable in this restaurant, so it was perfect for a dinner with colleagues.", 
            "i don't say this much.  omg, this place is amazing.  i was in vegas with friends, and my buddy said i should try this place out  and i would love it.  i was skeptic at best..\n\nwe had a group of 8 and we decided to do family style and order apps.  we ordered the bone marrow, escargot, scallops, and calamari  \n\nthe bone marrow was okay in my opinion, but everyone loved it on my table.  i would have like some more accompaniment to enhance the flavors.  there was plenty of marrow, bread and  micro greens, and fine sea salt flakes.  it was very rich and flavor, but i had better.  it is still worth it.\n\nthe scallops were perfectly pan seared, and it came with a pleasant herb-y butter sauce.  each bite was amazing and when you are done with the scallops.  the sauce was great for  bread  dipping.\n\nthe escargot was good.  it came with the standard butter, garlic and shallots.  t\nhere is probably a few other herbs in there, but we ate them too fast to really look.\n.  \nthe friend calamari was good and came with two sauce, tartar, and i think a remoulade.  after having the other items, i wasn't too impressed.  this would be a great dish, if it was somewhere else. but we are talking about mastro's.\n\nthe omg moment was a  bone in <mark>Petite Filet</mark> we ordered.  when i first saw it, i was very disappointed when i saw the waiter cut it,  it look raw.  i was thinking how can a place like this, don't know the difference between medium rare and raw.  boy was i wrong.  the table decide we should try it and not waste it, because we all thought the same thing.  but when i bit into it, it was the most wonderful steak i had in recent memory.  it has a full of flavor, it was season to perfection.  every bite, i wanted another one.   in the end, i would have fought off the table for the bone.  lucky for me, no one wanted it.  i love the acidic marinade they used for the steak.  i guess it is a balsamic vinegar marinade.  man, i want to go back so badly.\n\nanyway, i don't think i can top anything else in this review.  i have to say the signature pound cake was good, but you must really have a sweet tooth.  \n\nwaiters and bus people were amazing and entertaining.  they are here to give you the best experience they can.    so please tip well.\n\nthe decor is amazing, just go look at the pictures online.  \n\nnow i just want to go to any mastro's and have that steak again.", 
            "there's really nothing negative to say about this place. the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> was amazing, it was cooked to perfection. the sides were delicious. we had the cream of corn, sauteed spinach, mac & cheese and mushrooms. service was great and the atmosphere was lovely. \n\ni'm just disappointed i wasn't able to try everything on the menu but the next time i'm in vegas, i will definitely return.", 
            "my husband and i had a wonderful time at mastro's. the food was excellent, nice ambiance, drinks were great, and the warm butter cake is ridiculous. we came back the next day to have the warm butter cake one more time before our flight home. the medium well <mark>Petite Filet</mark> was moist because our waiter offered to butterfly it, the bake potato was delicious, as well as the asparagus. the blufeld riesling was so smooth. it was a nice compliment to our meal. \n\ni saw people complaining about this mastro's being in a mall. it is located in a mall but it is a high end shopping mall connected to aria where other nice restaurants are located. i found the shape of the restaurant to be cool and it has a nice ambiance.", 
            "this restaurant has become one of my all-time favorites! i've eaten here multiple times over the past 3 years, and that's says a great deal because the strip has so many fine dining options. i've actually had the same waiter, mike, a couple of times. his knowledge of the menu, and service to our table couldn't have been better. \n\nmy favorite entree is the fillet of arctic char oreganata style. this is a flavorful fish like sockeye salmon or snapper, not bland or mild like grouper or cod. the portions are large at mastro's, both the entrees and the sides, and this dish is no exception. they serve 2 fillets of fish. there must be 12 to 14oz of fish on the plate. i've ordered steak here once as well, an 8oz <mark>Petite Filet</mark>. is was excellent, cooked perfectly, as one would expect at a high-end restaurant. \n\nfor desert, i recommend sharing the mastro's signature warm butter cake. it has an amazing smooth and warm buttery taste that intensifies as you near the cake's center. \n\nlastly, with regard to the dining experience, the restaurant is located in the crystals mall, however, there is no \"mall-feel\" to the experience whatsoever. the wooden \"tree house\" dining area is an impressive sight to see, and a truly unique and beautiful open-air room to dine in.", 
            "being a vegas local, living on the strip, i get to try amazing vegas eats weekly. i must say by far mastros is a step above the rest & my personal favorite restaurant on the strips.\n\nservice is top notch, as good as it gets! some of my fav dishes are the scallops, <mark>Bone-In KC Strip</mark>, hamachi, <mark>Petite Filet</mark> mignon, & of course the amazing buttercake dessert. must try.", 
            "this was our first time visiting mastro's. we've visited other steakhouses like flemings, mortons, ruth chris, etc,  and this place ranks at the top. the servers are on point the entire meal, making sure that every detail of your meal is correct.\n\ni ordered the 19 oz bone in filet and my wife ordered the <mark>Petite Filet</mark>. both steaks were cooked exactly to our liking and did not need any seasoning at the table. they were flavorful as they were served. we ordered mac and cheese, mushrooms, and asparagus as our side dishes. the side dishes are large enough to share with your entire table so be aware.\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> as a starter and it was delicious. every bit of it was finished.\n\nwe ordered a few drinks with dinner and the drinks were excellent. the lemon drop i ordered was served on dry ice so the drink was smoking, entertaining presentation.\n\nthe location of this restaurant is a little odd, smack dab in the middle of a shopping mall in what appears to be a large wooden bong (not sure how else to explain it).\n\nwe also received a call the next morning thanking us for dining with them. it was expensive, but excellent and we didn't mind since we were celebrating our marriage.", 
            "we went here last night for my girlfriend's birthday.  mixed feelings about our experience.  to start off with, the service was impeccable.  daniel and tim made sure to constantly check in and my water glass was never empty.  we started out with the strawberry mules which tasted good and strong.  we skipped an appetizer and just munched on the bread basket which was also tasty.  for dinner, we ordered the lobster mash and steamed broccoli to share as our family style sides.  our server came back to apologize that they were out of broccoli so we switched to spinach.  both were good.  we loved the lobster mash.\nfor our entrees, we ordered the 8oz <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, saut\\u00e9ed scallops and another fish dish that i cannot recall at this time.  my scallops were great.  my friend said the other fish i can't recall was great as well.  birthday girl had the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> and stated after her first bite that the quality of meat was definitely lacking.  after us all trying a bite, we agreed it did not taste like a very high quality meat.  the server confirmed it was corn fed beef sourced from various midwestern farms.  surprising for such a high quality restaurant to source corn fed beef.  the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> our other friend ordered was a bit over cooked making it dried out as well.  we mentioned our dislike of the steak to our server and he did apologize and offer to get us started on something else.  we were all sharing our meals and noted it was fine and we didn't need a replacement dish.  for dessert, we were treated to a happy birthday slice of chocolate cake (a bit dry) as well as the butter cake (which was phenomenal).  in the end, the steak was taken off our bill and both desserts were comped.  the service made our experience enjoyable despite some of our dishes being off.  5 stars for service, 3 stars for taste of food, 3 stars for price in comparison to quality of food.  unfortunately, not sure the price is worth the quality of food you receive at this one.", 
            "he always said we should have a nice proper steak dinner.  but every single time i'm in town, we end up skipping the whole steak thing.  but this time, his boyfriend had a client to impress, so we off we went on a steak dinner.  yay me!\n\nanyhow, since it is rare back home in honolulu to find a filet with bone in, that's what they got.  myself, because my eating habits have changed (boo!!) i opted for the <mark>Petite Filet</mark>.  i know, sad, right?  i got 8 ounces of meat!  not the 12 ounces they ordered.  i got my meat rare, cold center, hot plate.  mmmm i just love a good piece of meat especially when you can control how you're gonna receive it.  i got it just the way i want it, which is actually hard to come by.  i'll take it the way i want it.  he says out loud, \"you think you know a person,\" when i ordered my meat rare.  oh, honey, you've known me for how many years now, and you still don't know how i like my meat?  as rare as can be is how i like it and i got a true piece of meat perfection.  you know that i ate all of it!  i love me some meat!\n\nthe rest of the dishes were typical.  salads, soups, sides were just regular, nothing extraordinarily spectacular to really write about.  the portions for those items are generous, i must say.  we did order a bottle of wine to go with dinner.  i think it was a shiraz.  i didn't pick it out, but it did go well with dinner.  and since it was their birthday, there was dessert.  not 1, but 2, since two of them were celebrating.  one was a butter cake and the other a chocolate cake.  how nice, right?  we couldn't finish the desserts, but i must say they were very rich and of course yummy.\n\nwould i return again?  most definitely!  it's good that this place was a nice walk from our hotel.  i sure am glad that they are open late, since my eating habits were out of wack.  i love me some meat!!", 
            "located in the crystals shopping center next to aria. park at crystals valet if you aren't staying at the hotel. they have electric car charging. consistently delicious food every time we come. 5 stars for service, food, everything. try to get a table inside the treehouse. few of the items we ordered:\n\n<mark>Petite Filet</mark>: absolutely melt in your mouth delicious. \nheirloom tomato and burrata cheese: very good but pricey at $20.\nsea salt and <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark>: addicting!\nalaskan halibut: hubby says was very good.\n<mark>Creamed Corn</mark> side: delish.\nsignature butter cake: so yummy!\n<mark>Sauted Sugar Snap Peas</mark> side: cooked perfect...super crunchy.\ntable bread and butter: even that was awesome!\n\nwould highly recommend and def be back, mastros!", 
            "the fourth new discovery that was a five-star worthy dining experience was at mastro's ocean club.  i had heard good things about this place for at least two years, and before then espied its distinctive wooden bird's nest with admiration at its quite innovative and modern design just before the restaurant's opening inside the shops at crystals.\n\nit was the day of our 25th wedding anniversary, and our request for seating inside the nest was granted.  it actually felt like being two young birds sheltered inside a protective nest.  not only that, but we were surprised at meal's end with a complimentary warm butter cake ala mode, mastro's signature dessert.  this was a great mouth-watering end to a very memorable meal, as the soft cake seemed to melt in the mouth. \n\nbut the beginning of our meal was no less auspicious.  after enjoying a bread basket that included large homemade pretzel breadsticks, diane and i dove into succulent hot <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark>.  these big crustaceans bursting with flavor really deserve to be called \"prawns\" rather than \"shrimp,\" and did deliver a taste of vanilla in the light batter--but not overpoweringly so.\n\nfor our main we each ordered an 8-oz filet, which here is called a \"<mark>Petite Filet</mark>,\" along with 1-1/2 lbs. of <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>.  both tender steaks were cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, and with little char on top.  accompanying bearnaise sauce was drinkable, and a peppercorn sauce was not far behind.  the hot and long sections of <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> were pulled out of the pot at exactly the right moment  and presented as already opened legs, so no prying with tools was necessary.  they tasted great dunked in warm drawn butter.  and while diane praised her large and cheesy twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark>, i delighted in a huge mound of skinny sea salt & <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark>, which was reported to be a small rather than regular-sized version.  sauteed mushrooms were lovely, too, but i hardly needed them.  we were stuffed.  \n\nwith a ratio of about one waiter for every four guests, service was great.  our knowledgeable and conscientious server checked on us several times, and water refills were regularly poured without any need to request them.  even with the restaurant packed with guests, the ambiance inside the bird's nest section of the restaurant was romantic, intimate, and classy.\n\nmastro's is pricey to be sure.  but, executing well at delivering artfully prepared high-quality offerings from both land and sea, there is a reason why several local diners in the know call this one of the best restaurants in las vegas.  without question we will soon become repeat guests."

            "my wife and i celebrated her recent birthday here on monday evening 10/25/10 and enjoyed and amazing dinner that far exceeded our highest expectations. this new outpost of mastros is romantic and elegant with all of the true hallmarks of five star dining. \nwe have previously been to mastros in beverly hills and i much preferred this location as food and service were flawless as we've come to expect with the added touch of refinement and class that mastro beverly hills seems to lack with the nightclub atmosphere and hollywood infused scene. \n\nthe food:\n\nappetizer:\n\nseared <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> -  perfectly seared and prepared in a garlic cream sauce. accompanied by 2 garlic toasted bread crisps. delicous.\n\nentrees:\n\n<mark>Petite Filet</mark> (medium) - hers - simple but perfect. mastro's signature entree and they do it to perfection\n\n<mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> (medium rare) - mine -  i love lamb above all other meats and this is one of the best i can ever remember having. bold but not gamey it flavor.\n(jiraffe in santa monica is a close 2nd.)\n\nsides:\n\nsauteed mushrooms w/ onions  - sweet & earthy. the perfect compliment to tender filet & lamb when combined with mastro's fries. \n\nsea salt shoestring fries (no vinegar) - crisp and salty which just the right amount of texture.\n\ndessert - \n\nchocolate birthday cake - brought out complimetary. nothing special but a nice birthday gesture. \n\nwarm butter cake ala mode - you simply have to get this! \nno meal at mastro's would be complete without it. my wife talked about this for days before our meal and reminisced about it for days after. it's simply the best enormous warm, buttery sugar cookie you've ever had paired with the smoothest vanilla bean ice cream you can imagine.\n\n i have to say we left very impressed with our mastro's las vegas experience. it definitely raises mastro's to our favorite special occasion restaurant from now on (just not the beverly hills location.)with food, service and atmosphere this wonderful you just can't go wrong. \n\nnext up for us is mastros in thousand oaks.", 
            "had a reservation for 3 for a business dinner (friends really).  arrived on time but still waited in the bar for 30 minutes for a table.  ok though, had a cocktail and caught up.  the double lobster tail, and bone in <mark>Filet</mark> were what we ordered, along with starter salads.  the quality of the ingredients was very good, the service was great, and the location is nothing to sneeze at.  great bread too.  we were in the restaurant right by the entry to something called the birds nest i think.  very open restaurant right by aria in the citycenter.  great place with a big bill but that is expected.  the wine list is a bit out of hand.  i never mind spending good money on a great wine list, which it was, but the median price point was over the top.  i go to many nice business dinners so i have an idea what wines should go for and these were ridiculous in some cases.\n\ni will tell you that for the first time ever a restaurant manager called me the day after and left a message to make sure we enjoyed our dinner and that we would be back.  nice touch since nobody every does that.  mastros's is good everywhere and this location is no different.", 
            "the ambiance was pretty rad. it's not you're usual dimly lit steakhouse. it's right in the middle of crystal and very bright. i liked the modern decor and the live music was a nice touch. the service was great. the bathroom attendant made me feel like i was a a club. \n\nmy <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> (12ox) was tasty, but i personally miss the crisp edges and extra butter on the ruth chris' steak. the mastro side dishes though, definitely beat ruth chris'. i loved the truffled gnocchi, lobster mash potatoes, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark>. \n\nmy highlight of the night was the butter cake! yummy!", 
            "great ambiance and amazing service!  not to mention the food is just fabulous.  we started with <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> which was good but nothing spectacular.  but then for the main entree i got the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> with a side of mastro's <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  the meat was perfectly cooked to medium rare and the flavor was melt-in-your-mouth delicioso.  even the simple <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> was creamy and savory.  it sure is a splurge but i highly recommend it if you are in vegas and want to pamper your tastebuds.", 
            "my my my...what a treat it was to eat here. from start to finish, the food tasted superb, and service was impeccable. \n\nfood highlights\n* bread basket: served steamy and warm with mastro's fresh salted butter. pretzel bread and cheesy, cracker-like breadsticks were my favorites.\n* truffle-lobster gnocchi appetizer special: the chewiest, richest gnocchi i've tried, with tender lobster meat and drizzled with truffle oil.\n* <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> steak, medium rare: soft, tender beef, topped with clarified butter and a pinch of herbs. served on a 400 degree plate, so it stays nice and toasty throughout your meal!\n* butter cake: devastatingly moist, melty, slightly salty, and of course, buttery, with a crisp crust, a scoop of french vanilla ice cream, and whole plate of freshly whipped cream. not overrated in any sense of the word.\n\ni'm going to stop writing now because i'll drool all over my work laptop keyboard otherwise...", 
            "so this is the 4th mastro's i have been to and i can't even count the number of times i have been to a mastro's. yet they never fail to prevail! i took my mother and 2 sisters here on a friday night when we were in vegas. i have never been to this one, but have been to the ocean club in scottsdale, city hall in scottsdale and the one in beverly hills. we got seated in the \"treehouse\" which is the big wooden circle that everyone takes pictures of when they are in crystal. we ordered a nice bottle of wine and my sister and i split the beefsteak tomato & mozz appetizer (i always get this when i am here) it is great because they split the order into two plates. my mother and older sister split the <mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark> and my mother could not stop talking about how great it was! i will admit we are all canadian so we are not used to the amazing portions of food they serve in america! it is great!!! i ordered my usual *massive* <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> with avocados and no meat/dressing on the side - it is my fav salad ever! younger sister ordered the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> 8oz which she loved and actually finished. older sister ordered something different - <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> sashimi 10oz, she was only able to finish half of it (i will add a picture soon b/c it is an unusual plate to order at mastro's) she said it was really tasty just a huge portion. my mother ordered the atlantic salmon filet 12oz, again very big but very good!!! of course we have to order sides! my fav <mark>Spinach <mark>Broccoli <mark>Asparagus - Steamed or Sauted</mark></mark></mark> mushrooms, steamed asparagus, and my sister's favourite gorgonzola mac'n'cheese. overall mastro's the my #1 fav restaurant and this new location in the city center is just as great as any other mastro's :)", 
            "the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> is absolutely delish!  we came here on a wednesday night and there was live music which was pretty cool.  we ordered kumomoto oysters and the scallops for appetizers and share the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  everything was delish and our server was super attentive.  will definitely go back.", 
            "quite simply the best fish i have ever had, as for my wife also the best fish she has ever had.  i had the swordfish blackened, my wife had a fresh seasonal filet of wild caught salmon seasoned with their special house blend.  both were outstanding and some of the largest fish <mark>Filet</mark> we have ever seen, but yet still cooked and seasoned to perfection.  also had amazing sides of asparagus and <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>.  service was great and i would recommend that anyone should try it at least once.  prices are high, but side dishes are served family style, so at least you will get full unlike some of those trendy-trash places that give you a fish nugget with a red sauce on it and call it gourmet.  go there and eat fish.", 
            "i love this place !! this was practically the highlight of my trip to vegas . they give you a variety of bread but their bread didn't really impress me . the oysters were alright but didn't really impress me either . i had the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> mignon which was absolutely heavenly !! it was so yummy and literally melted in my mouth !! their filet mignon is perfect ... the best i ever had !! the cream of corn made the perfect side . it was very delicious . they also carry white muscat wine which was good . it came out to be about $100 per person with the muscat wine including tip but it was totally worth it . i will definitely be back here again the next time i am in vegas !", 
            "mastro's was recommended by a co-worker who went to one of the locations in ca and absolutely loved it. i made reservations for a group of friends and i, and despite some initial resistance from my fellow yelper lauren m., we all had a fabulous time and were more than happy with our decision to come here!\n\nour server, lionel, was amazing the whole evening. he was friendly, helpful, and attentive. he recommended we get a customized seafood tower, and everyone in the group was very impressed.\n\nwe were also impressed with our meals. i got the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>, and two of my friends split the tomahawk special. my other friends got fish. my filet melted in my mouth and was cooked perfectly. i don't typically get filet when i go to a steakhouse, but i was so happy with my meal! \n\nwe also got the very popular <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> for a side, and it was delicious. lionel brought us out some of the warm butter cake for dessert, and it was amazing! you could definitely smell the butter as soon as he put it down on the table. you must try it if you come to mastro's!\n\nthe setting is a little weird, as you are essentially in the middle of a mall. honestly, the food was so good that i could have been sitting literally anywhere and enjoyed this meal!", 
            "thanks to the mad hattrix's mouth-watering review of the pretzel bread, mastro's became my top choice of the perfect vegas steakhouse to celebrate my steak-loving boyfriend's birthday.\n\nknowing that the restaurant is located in crystals--a shopping arcade (mall is far too down-market to describe this place) featuring tiffany, cartier, and lv--i had a feeling this would be an expensive celebration, and it was, but well worth it.\n\nour table in the treehouse wasn't ready when we arrived, so we sat at the bar and ordered a drink. i thought i was prepared for vegas prices, but i was wrong. martinis that cost $18?! but when in rome ...\n\nas our bartender raised the shaker to pour the martini into the oversize martini glass, i noticed that the cocktail shaker itself was about one and half times the size of your regular shaker. that's right, we got about three generous martinis out of that one shaker. unfortunately, we'd each ordered a martini, which is why the rest of my review will be a bit vague.\n\nthis mastro's features a variety of seafood, and you can create your own seafood tower appetizer, even if it's only for one. we passed on a seafood appetizer and ordered a very good <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, followed by a bone-in rib eye for him and a <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> mignon for me. our waitress also sold us on the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>--1 1/4 pounds of lobster chunks folded into buttery mashies--so we enjoyed some seafood too.\n\nbetween the monster martini and the addictive pretzel bread (soft with a slightly chewy exterior, sprinkled with salt), i had a hard time saving room for the entree and ended up taking half of it home. but it was one of the best <mark>Filet</mark> i've ever had. although i love the tenderness of filet mignon, i typically prefer the flavor of a rib eye. both were excellent, even as leftovers.\n\nthe restaurant provided a complimentary slice of chocolate cake to mark the occasion. and although it would have been nice if they'd given us their famous butter cake, which they'd talked up, it didn't really matter because i was too full to have even one bite.\n\ni guess i'll just have to go back for more pretzel bread and that butter cake. but next time, i'll definitely share a martini--and maybe remember a few more details.", 
            "this mastro's is better than the one in la. all 3 of us couldn't believe how good it was. the sauteed mushrooms are out of this world. \n\ni had the 12oz filet (not the on the bone filet) and it was amazing. i don't like bone-on <mark>Filet</mark> personally. i know i'm the only one. it was great. \n\nits in the mall at the aria/crystals/whatever the fuck its called place, but its a pretty upscale mall with lots of swanky shit goin on - so don't stress, its not mall food-ish at all.", 
            "overall, i really enjoyed my meal but be prepared for a different ambiance! the restaurant is literally in the middle of the mall, with the tables pretty much out in the open. not a huge deal, but definitely not ideal. \n\ni had the <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark> (spicy <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with no croutons), 8 oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark> and cheese cake for dessert. the filet was perfectly prepared, served on a burning hot plate that sizzled and continued to cook the sides of <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, spinach and garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. our table also shared the <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark> appetizer, which was excellent! highly recommended!", 
            "completely disappointed by maestro's restaurant in las vegas.  i read such wonderful reviews on yelp and was really looking forward to it. my husband and i went there for our 1 year wedding anniversary dinner. i made reservations a month before the big day and requested to have a bottle of champagne upon our arrival.  \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> to start.  it took about 20 minutes for them to take that initial order and another 20-30 minutes for them to bring it out.  the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> was so salty and came with a weird <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> combination on top as aside. the dressing of the salad ruined the flavor of the meat if the salt didn't already to it. \n\nas our main entrees we ordered a <mark>Petite Filet</mark> and lamp chops. dry, dry, dry! i'm sorry but if we are paying over +$50 a plate we expect mouth watering tender meat.  that wasn't the case at all. so disappointed. \n\nto end the evening we were so disappointed by the slow service, the bad appetizer and unsatisfactory entr\\u00e9e we didn't even want dessert. as the waiter brings the +$200 check he just says happy anniversary and walks away.  no complimentary dessert or glass of champagne as most places would have done. oh well...i will go back to sage inside aria which is the best steak house i have ever been too.", 
            "everything here was spectacular from beginning to end. i went here for dinner on a friday evening. the restaurant itself is located inside of crystals in an open area of the shopping center. despite the open area, the atmosphere was still very nice and the live music really added to it.\n\nmy experience:\nstarters\n-the bread was pretty good\n-the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> was delicious and the horseradish was spicy!\n\nmain course & sides\n-i ordered the filet, and having dined at another steakhouse earlier in the week, i must say, the filet here was incredible. this was probably one of the best <mark>Filet</mark> i have ever had!\n-the sides were just as amazing. we had the mac and cheese, <mark>Green Beans with Sliced Almonds</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>. i would recommend all of them as there wasn't one i did not like.\n\ndessert\n-i'm not a huge sweets guy, but i was told that i had to try the butter cake even though we were already stuffed. it definitely lived up to the hype as a must try dessert!\n\noverall, i had a great dining experience here. our waiter was awesome and we never felt rushed. i would highly recommend trying this place next time you are in vegas!", 
            "i will preface this review with the fact that family was in town and this dinner was free!\n\nwe had reservations for saturday night  at 8:30 pm for a group of 7. i am always leery of a restaurant that is in the middle of a mall. i don't care how fancy the mall is, i think mall food every time i dine at one. mastro's my friends is no mall food place.\n\nthe service was top notch, we had a waiter and 2 bussers, while i'm sure they had different tables, they were always there when we needed them. it was like they were our dedicated staff.\n\nthe meal was top notch, starting with the amazing bread basket, continuing through the entrees, the family style sides, and ending up with an amazing dessert (which they comped to the table).\n\nthe bread basket was a good start, it had pretzel bread, olive bread, a parmesan crisp, and few other breads. the sides were amazing, they are served family style in surprisingly large portions. we had <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (some of the best i've ever had), <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, and mushrooms. we also had a few salads to pass around the table, 2 caesars (one regular and one spicy), tomato and onion, and tomato and mozzarella. a seafood tower and <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> were also ordered, i'm not much of a seafood guy but everyone else loved it. \n\nthey entrees were pretty stellar as well, i was splitting the 33oz wagyu tomahawk cut with my uncle, but since he was too full from the salads and sides, i had to man up and eat the whole thing myself (the things i have to do). this was one of the best pieces of cow i've had in my life (and i've had a lot of cow). it was cooked just a touch under medium rare (perfect imo), the marbling in the meat was insane, and it came out on a scorching hot plate. i don't know how they cooked it but it was perfect. \n\ntable mates also got the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, a filet, and a few other meats, i was very impressed with the size of their portions, most places would serve about 4oz of fish, but their <mark>Filet</mark> were about 12oz servings.\n\nafter dinner, they brought out a warm butter cake with vanilla ice cream for the table, it was a great end to the meal, and comping it was a nice touch!\n\ni have no clue what the meal ran, but it was amazing. my only complaint is that their bar area isn't the best, if they're going to make you wait 10-20 mins for your table they need more room in the bar. they did however have a great piano player and singer who played a variety from christmas carols to current hits which only added to the amazing meal.\n\nwill i be back, hopefully, especially if someone else is picking up the tab!", 
            "i came here for a nice dinner with a special person, and i absolutely loved it. \n\nfirst of all, the xmas decorations in the mall were amazing. set the mood very well for our dinner. we checked in with the hostess, and the hostess who walked us to our seats was very friendly. \n\nwe sat next to the live band, a lady singer and a guy pianist/singer. they played really good music ranging from older american pop songs to older r&b songs with their own twist. i couldn't help but to quietly sing along during dinner. \n\nwe ordered the following:\n\n1. <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> - this was the best <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> i've had in my life. they really don't skimp on the lobster meat either you would find huge chunks, and it was like digging for treasure! the meat was also cooked just right, and it was really fresh. if you go to this restaurant, this side dish is a must get if you like lobster. \n\n2. sauteed asparagus - pretty standard just got this dish to get some veggies. \n\n3. <mark>Petite Filet</mark> mignon - usually i like more flavorful cuts like ribeyes, and i don't really like filet mignons because they are lean. however this steak was so tender and cooked just right. i enjoyed it a lot. it was just the right portion, 8 oz, since i wasn't too hungry.\n\n3. <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> - i had a small bite, the scallop was cooked just right, medium rare, and the meat was so sweet!!\n\ndefinitely recommend to come here on a special occasion, or if you won from gambling!", 
            "18 oz <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> was the best and priciest piece of steak i had so far.  \n\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were good.  the portion was huge.  it can probably feed 3 to 4 people.", 
            "i regret not going back to jean george's prime restaurant. \n\ni wouldn't  go back to mastro's if you paid me. to be fair it wasn't because the service was bad because it was very good. props to our waiter troy.\n\nif you're a steak-snob you're going to weep for the cow who gave his life to the second rate chef who doesn't know how to season a cut of meat. i ordered the 18oz <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> which is a glorious piece of meat. it was the first time in my life i didn't finish a steak.\n\nif you're like most people you'll have one, maybe two, nights to eat out in vegas. if you're  considering going to masto's, that means you're likely considering other high-end restaurants like prime, cut, craftsteak etc. regardless where you go, you're going to spend $90-$150 a person so wouldn't you be disappointed if you weren't blown away?!\n\ngo to prime.", 
            "i liked this place, but i think it's more for the atmosphere than the food.  don't get me wrong, the food was good - it just didn't quite live up to what i was expecting.  we ordered the seafood tower and everything was delicious.  for my entree, i ordered the <mark>Petite Filet</mark>.  while good, it definitely could have been seasoned more and was a bit overcooked.  honestly, i think kevin rathbun steak has ruined  every other steak restaurant for me - nothing will ever to compare to the steak i had there.  as a side, we ordered the gorgonzola mac and cheese, which had far more mac than cheese unfortunately.  i could barely taste the gorgonzola at all, and given it's strong flavor, there had to be practically none in there.\n\ndrinks were top notch and the service was excellent.  we sat in the treehouse, which was very cool, but the food just didn't do it for me.  unfortunately, it just didn't live up to my lofty expectations.", 
            "how can anyone not love this place?  \n\namidst yelp's spring break festivities and other dining excursions we had in vegas, the dining experience at moc was one of the most memorable.  \nfrom the amazing \"eighth wonder of the world\" tree house we were sitting in, to a generous martini offering, to excellent overall service....it was beyond a five star experience. and i haven't even scratched the surface yet.   \n\nwith all the eating going on in vegas, i could have been very content with just their fresh pretzel rolls and a fantastic campagna burrata salad.  \nbut i couldn't resist and...\n\n...order more pretzel rolls.  they were just too addicting.\n...try their brussel sprouts.  lightly salted to perfection.\n...taste the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  one order can feed an army.  \n...sample their <mark>Petite Filet</mark>.  medium rare truly melted in my mouth.\n...and savor the seared <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark>.  cooked just right with an orgasmic garlic butter sauce.

            "i did not get to enjoy my meal as much as i wish... =( but i know for a fact that the food was really good..\n\nme & my girl friend (amy l) made reservations for 6pm on a saturday. after dragging ourselves over here from vdara, we finally made it on time. it was an absolute drag because we were awake for 30+ hours & we felt really crappy from all the \"beverages\" we consumed... basically we felt like utter sh** and couldn't enjoy our meals =(\n\nlocated in the city center, the restaurant is pretty much in the very center of the building. service was good but a bit slow. i love the assortment of bread, my favorite is the crunchy cheesey-garlicky one =)\n\nhere's what we ordered:\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> - comes in a huge bowl, tastes very very veryy rich, not too many pieces of lobster but still pretty delicious\n\nseared <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> - i've had this before at mastro's in beverly hills, same thing, still delicious, comes with 3 scallops & yummy cheese/garlic bread. scallops from mastro's comes in 2nd place after providence's :p\n\n <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> - cooked medium. comes on a sizzling plate, very good rich flavors and good texture. i was only able to eat 2-3 bites. i did eat the leftovers the next morning & it was still pretty tasty. \n\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> - blacken cajun flavored, i think.. it was pretty damn good, texture is very similar to scallops.\n\n<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> - big enough to be an entree on it's own, holy sh*t, i don't know how this thing can just be a side dish lol it's meant to be shared amongst 4+ people.. i thought it was pretty yummy, i love cheese and king crab meat... but this is super duper heavy, i probably would not order this again...\n\ngarlic spinach - tasty but a bit too garlicky for me, it was so infused with garlic that it tasted a bit bitter to me..\n\n\ni am so sad that we were so full that i didn't get to try to butter cake, again! =( we didn't have much of an appetite at all, plus i think we ordered a little too much lol... we were stuffed after having a few bites of our appetizers.  service was good, our waiter was a bit slow though. our water glasses were never empty (thank goodness, we must have drank a total of 13 glasses each..)\n\nrestrooms are located on the second floor, kind of a hassle to look for. bad idea to go when you're intoxicated..\n\n\n\nlesson learned: do not attempt fine dining after a night of debauchery....excellent restaurant & food! must try the butter cake one day.... =(", 
            "in short, our meal was absolutely phenomenal-- perhaps one of the best we've ever had in vegas. with every element of the meal nearly flawless, i could not keep marveling over each little detail of our experience. yelp here has mastro's at a 4.5+ average on 250+ reviews..this is no fluke! \nwe came here for my mom's birthday dinner and my expectations were more than exceeded.\n\nwe were promptly seated for our 9:30 reservation within the \"tree house,\" as the hostess called it; it had a very loft feel to it yet was very quaint had a warm, welcoming atmosphere. i'll definitely ask to be sat in this area again. \nas we passed by the bar area, we were greeted by spectacular live music, consisting of a woman singing accompanied by a fantastic piano player (who also added in some vocals). big plus for this. \nafter immediately seating us, the hostess hurried to bring us black napkins to avoid the lint of white napkins attaching itself to our dark clothing. we didn't even ask. nice touch. \n\nrob, our waiter, and the rest of the waitstaff that took care of our table were nothing but spectacular. i was a bit worried at first as my water glass remained empty for a good 15 minutes, but this was the sole flaw of the entire evening (and a minor one at that). rob was extremely congenial, professional, yet very personable and extremely accommodating of our wishes. \n\nwe like to split things a lot when we go out to dinner so that we get our own little smorgasbord of items to try...and a smorgasbord we got! not only this, but the chefs made sure to split nearly everything that came to the table (even the bone-in steak we ordered!) now, where do i even begin...\n\n--<mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark>: caution: oxymoron... massive shrimp. the biggest shrimp i've seen in recent memory. the batter wasn't really too vanilla-tasting in my opinion, but this was a delicious starter regardless. three to an order! \n\n--burrata & heirloom tomato salad: mmm, burrata cheese is one of my favorites! yes, this was a typical salad, but the tomatoes were so fresh and the balsamic reduction was so tasty. we asked for a little bit more of this said reduction and they brought out an entire cup of it..whoops.\n\n--<mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark>: hands down the best i've ever had. not overly thick and creamy, yet perfect proportions of ingredients. piping hot when it arrived which i really appreciate with soups. \n\n--mac & cheese: ugh my mouth just waters at the thought of this. served in a skillet, the mac and cheese was perfect consistency: it wasn't drowning in sauce but it wasn't just a bowl of plain noodles with an ounce of cheese mixed in...perfect proportions (once again). on top was a layer of melted cheese that was just fantastic...i think that there were four cheeses or so just in this topper! \n\n--<mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> mignon: i really don't like throwing out the \"best i've ever had\" card very often. because, honestly, how many things can take that title? well, this definitely takes the \"best filet i've ever had\" title. join the club, <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark>. it had the taste of a ny strip, but was tender as a filet should be. and, to top it off, it is served on a 400 degree hot plate. i like my steak kept hot and this obviously got the job done. \n\n--warm butter cake: okay, now this piece of heaven really takes the cake (ha, horrible pun intended). my mom and sister are suckers for butter cake (who isn't..?) and we figured what better time to order it than for a birthday? out comes this large, circular cake and a behemoth side of whipped cream. really. view my picture to see how much there was. think of a frozen skillet just bombarded with thick, heavy whipped cream. fantastic dessert. and what's even better? rob comped this $16 dessert with the simple message of \"happy birthday, we're so happy you came in to dine with us tonight.\" winnnnnnn.\n\n\nfrom now on, every time i'm asked for a restaurant recommendation, mastro's will be the first word to escape my mouth. i cannot wait to go there again next time i've got a few bucks to blow.", 
            "the las vegas-mastro's ranks among our top dining experiences anywhere in the world.  on this labor day weekend visit, our initial disappointment, of not being seated in the unique & always fascinating \"tree-house\", was quickly extinguished by shauna, our culinary captain extraordinaire, menu \"tour guide\" and libation/wine aficionado.  turns out... our \"terrace\" seating near the piano bar was as enjoyable as it was entertaining, resulting in yet another \"positively outrageous\" fine dining adventure.\n\nshauna introduced us to mastro's participation in \"las vegas restaurant week\", a worthy nationwide charity drive to raise money for & donate meals to 3-square food bank in southern nevada.  she offered a special 4-course dinner deliciously flanked by beefsteak tomato & onion salad, an 8 oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> & garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and key lime pie all for a reasonable price, part of which was ultimately donated for a worthy cause.  \n\nas there were 5 of us on this visit, the aforementioned special meal was joined by collection of our menu favs and shauna's recommendations. she perfectly paired our appetizers & meals with wonderful riesling, cabernet, and sauvignon blanc.\n\nsooo, included in the culinary delight were: the legendary seafood tower (ohhh yes!!), <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (best in class!), <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark> (delightful), <mark>New York Strip</mark> (absolute perfection), <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> (sweet & outa this world), saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> (oh yeah!), <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (buttered and seasoned to perfection), saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms ( a fav of favs), <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> (these aren't yo mama's sprouts, believe it!), 1 lb. <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> (huge), triple chocolate layer cake (nothing but delish), and...(drum roll)... the mastro's signature warm butter cake!!...once again to die for!!!\n\nwithout fail, and to paraphrase the writings of t. scott gross,... mastro's was again a \"positively outrageous\" dining experience where the culinary expectations were always far exceeded.  shauna's unsurpassed service & superior guidance was unexpected, delivered-at-random, fun, entertaining, and so very memorable!  it doesn't get any better!", 
            "<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, seafood tower, <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>, 5 star service, presentation, be sure to get a spot in the \"treehouse\" section. take a good look at menu prices beforehand though;)", 
            "it's not that we had a bad experience at mastro's. but for what we paid i was expecting a bit more. the bread basket was good, but not dazzling. the tomato and mozzarella salad we shared wasn't memorable. in fact, for burratta mozzarella it wasn't good at all. i thoroughly enjoyed my <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> which made up for the salad. the side of <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> was decent but not outstanding, same goes for the side of peas we shared. mostly we went because the location was conveniently close to the aria, where we stayed, and because after seeing the tree house on a previous visit to vegas i desperately wanted to eat there. being in the tree house wasn't the best experience. it's loud, since you are in the middle of the crystal's mall. all in all, it was decent but overpriced in my opinion. i probably won't be returning to this mastro's location.", 
            "it's the little things....\n\n1. providing dark napkins for those with dark clothing and white napkins for those with light clothing so customers can stay oh-so visibly lint-free.\n\n2. the hostess pulling out your chair to seat you because your date clearly forgot that it was his job.\n\n3. the server's extensive knowledge of the menu! she made it sound better than the menu itself. it's always nice when people convincingly show that they know what they're selling. makes me have more faith in the restaurant.\n\n4. although it was inside a shopping center, you could easily overlook it due to the dimly lit dining space and romantic ambiance.\n\n5. calling you within days to make sure you had a great experience.\n\n6. servers scooping serving size portions onto your plate, so you won't have to, because eating is so damn labor intensive.\n\n7. oh and the food:\n- <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> was cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. order it rare or medium rare.\n- order the gnocchi. do it. your tastebuds will thank you.\n\ntwo bone-in <mark>Filet</mark>, a side of roasted brussel sprouts, and the gnocchi ran about $180 with tax and tip.", 
            "i had made reservations here for my wife's birthday and when we got there the place was crowded.  the hostesses explained the wait, and offered for us to have a drink in the lounge until our table was ready.  they kept checking in on us until we were ready to be seated.  \n\nwe started with two cups of coffee and the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark>.  the crab came out on a cup of dry ice that was smoking and was a very good presentation, as well as being extremely tasty.\n\nfor dinner my wife had the 8oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark> and i had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  the waiter, piotr, explained that the sides are served family style and that we should share a couple.  we chose the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and the steamed broccoli.  my wife, when asked how she wanted her meat cooked, asked for it to be medium, piotr explained that medium would still have some pink in the center, and sensing the way that she likes hers cooked, recommended medium plus.  when it came out it was cooked perfectly, and was the most tender steak that she has ever had.  my <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was cooked so it had a nice, crispy shell of the outside, but was milky and soft on the inside.  the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> has spoiled me, now i find it hard to not expect that kind of perfection from all other potatoes.\n\nafter dinner they brought out a complimentary chocolate sin cake for us to share with a birthday message written in sauce on the plate.  \n\noverall, this was an amazing meal at an amazing restaurant, and i would highly recommend this to anyone.  the prices are high, but you will get what you pay for.  my only regret is not being able to try the warm butter cake everyone raves about, but i guess that means i have to go here again next time.", 
            "a good friend of ours suggested mastro's when we asked for a recommendation for a seafood on the strip. so i made a reservation online for that night at 7pm on the mastro's website. what i didn't know was that i had somehow clicked on the chicago location. luckily i was walking around the crystals shopping center that afternoon and went to check out the venue and was chatting with one of the hostesses who offered to check on our reservation to confirm it .. good thing she did and we fixed my error. they were pretty booked that night but were able to squeeze us in. :) \n\nthe service was pretty much top-notch from start to finish, hostesses, servers, and bussers,  all were very attentive and knowledgeable as well as being friendly and personable. loved that they dish out our sides for us .. that's a really nice touch. \n\nthe food, we had a variety of items which were all delicious but at the top of our favorites were the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> and the signature <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. both are must haves to accompany any steak or seafood dish. we had the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious as well as the pan seared <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which my dining companions said was spectacularly prepared and seasoned. \n\ndessert was over the top .. we had three .. mastro's signature warm butter cake, \nthe cherry crisp, and the profiteroles. the first two were topped with vanilla bean gelato. both were to die for. i had read lots about the warm butter cake and it was everything i had expected and more :) .. and surprisingly i also loved the cherry crisp .. i am not huge on cherry anything but the flavor had just the right amount of sweetness and was not overpowering and the crisp part is a crumbly granola like topping which is an nice balance with the gelato and fruitiness of the dish. it's something i would definitely order again! \n\nmy only complaint is that the server didn't warn us about the size of the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> appetizer. mom and i each ordered our own, and when they came out .. they were absolutely gigantic and even though we had a party of 5 we were unable to finish both. being in the service industry myself, i would have definitely warned my guests about the size of the carpaccio dish and suggested something else to order with it. \n\nall in all it was a fabulous dinner, the restaurant, even though it is in a busy mall .. has a nice ambiance, and we will absolutely be back.", 
            "stopped by for an anniversary dinner before watching le reve. since it was monday after easter, it was easy to make a same day reservation for 5:30 pm. the place was pretty quiet then and around 6:30, more people started to come by so we definitely beat the dinner rush. got a nice seat in the treehouse, with a view overlooking the dior store downstairs.\n\nsince we didn't want to be food comatose for our show later, we ordered just the <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, the regular filet, and a side of <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>. i also ordered coke, but beware that it's by the aluminum bottle and not with unlimited refills. the <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark> were rich and delicious, but the cheese was too much halfway through the side order. the meat was very tender and cooked to perfection. the medium was medium and the medium rare was just as it should be. since it was our anniversary, they also brought by a complimentary slice of rich chocolate cake topped with raspberries and whipped cream. overall a fantastic meal!", 
            "my girlfriend and i fell in love with this place for several reasons.  the staff, the atmosphere, and the food combined to bring us back the next night as well  we were able to make reservations through yelp and opentable but we arrived early each night and sat in the first come, first serve bar area.  the piano entertainment was first class. our server, racqel, was always timely, willing to meet our every request, and helpful in navigating the menu to ensure we got the most of the food choices we desired with the least amount of waste.  her name escapes me now but there was a corporate employee there the second night who recognized us from the night before.  she not only bought our first round of drinks but when we were leaving insisted we try their \"butter cake\" so much so that she ended up giving it to us.  very good stuff. i can't imagine anyone not feeling good upon receipt of this restaurant \"regular\" type of treatment on a 3 day, 2 night trip.  sheri and i can't wait to return to town and visit the place again!  i highly recommend any of the <mark>Filet</mark>, shriimp cocktail, king crab, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, gorgonzola mac and cheese, and the <mark>Gulf Red Snapper</mark>.  they will split any plate they have, upon request.", 
            "went to mastro's with friends for a belated birthday celebration. well worth the wait. opened with salad and calamari and our waiter, craig, recommended a nice wine. \n\nthe main event made my night: <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>, cooked to melt-in-your-mouth perfection. i suggest this as a place to visit with friends. you can find more intimate spots for a date, but it's perfect for enjoying an upscale dinner with a group.", 
            "i've been here twice and my second experience was even better than the first.  my hubby and i came here to celebrate our anniversary and we were so glad we did.  \n\nwe were greeted by the sweetest hostess as soon as we arrived, and she asked if we were here for a special occasion.  i let her know that it was our anniversary, and word traveled fast since our waiter greeted us with a congratulations.  \n\ni ordered the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> (8oz) and a side of <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>, and my husband ordered the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> (12oz) and the gorgonzola mac & cheese.  my steak was so tender that i could cut it with a butter knife and it practically melted in my mouth.  my husband is a steak connoisseur and he said that it was the best steak that he's ever had.  the <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> were buttery and pan seared to perfection, and the mac & cheese was rich and heavy.  i'm not a fan of blue cheese at all but the gorgonzola was really mild (i guess they use 4 kinds of cheeses).  \n\nalthough we didn't even have room for dessert, our waiter brought us a nice piece of chocolate cake with \"happy anniversary\" on the plate.  along with this came a giant serving of their homemade  whip cream.  i somehow found room in my belly and managed to scarf down 1/2 of it.  a really nice gesture that went a long way.  \n\nthe service was fantastic.  even if we looked in the waiter/servers' direction they would come over to see if we needed anything.  \n\nthe only thing odd about this location is that it is in the crystal cove mall, so the ambiance isn't what i'm used to with this kind of food.  at least we were surrounded by high end shops like jimmy choo.  the bathrooms are also upstairs which are kind of a bummer.  we didn't mind at all though, we were on cloud 9 with everything else about the place.", 
            "best <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> in my life.  the portion was much bigger than i was expecting, and because i ordered it medium rare, the fish was cooked just right!  everyone at our 8-person table had either the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, rib-eye, or <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>, and everyone's dish was delicious.  would definitely come back here!!!", 
            "party of 8 on a tuesday night.\ninteresting set up - there is a part of the restaurant that looks like a large wooden hornet's nest.  not sure what that's all about.  \n\nservice was impeccable from the hostess to the main server to his assistants.  everything was prompt, polite and timed well.  we were not rushed out even though we were one of the last parties to leave. \n\nfood:\ni ordered the gorgonzola mac and cheese $12 and the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> $48.  the mac and cheese was a little disappointing - very little flavor and it was dry,  very dry.  i had read that this was a great side dish so i was sad when it wasn't very palatable.  the portion is huge - consider sharing it if you do.  it easily fed our entire table.  i asked for the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> medium rare and it came out closer to medium.  regardless, the flavor was very smooth, not gamey.  the outside was a little too charred, but the rest of it was quite good.  it came with mint jelly, which was very tasty.  we also had a heirloom tomato and burrata salad $12 which was a very generous portion - the tomatoes were sweet and juicy.  the table got the seafood tower (have no idea how much that was but it was worth it).  this was friggin amazing.  honestly.  there were kumamoto oysters, fresh dungeness crab, snow <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>, humongous shrimp, great big lobster claws.  all fresh and tender meat.  it didn't require sauce.  none of it was briny or sandy.  so delicious and whatever we paid, i don't care.  it was unbelievable. other people in our party got the arctic char \"oreganato\" style, <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>, seared scallops and halibut.  every dish was served with mushrooms, asparagus, green beans and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (this had to have crack in it b/c <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> never tasted so good.)  no one had a single complaint and everyone finished what they ordered.  by this time, we're all about to pass out from food coma, but we insisted on the butter cake.  if you come here, no matter what you order, you must save room for this signature dessert.  i can't even describe it but it is amazing.  it comes out warm, w/ freshly made whipped cream and vanilla ice cream.   must.  must.  must have.  \n\noverall, great experience.  cost us a total of $1400 for 7 people.  you do the math.", 
            "came in here for dinner and all i can say is wow. first, the service is outstanding. second the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> was so well prepared you did not even need a knife. the flavor was amazing, as were the sides we order. you definitely get what you pay for here..worth every penny", 
            "i think it is actually called the \"tree house\", but i kept calling it the birds nest. whatever it was, it was cool!! now, keep in mind, this was a business dinner that i was at, so anything goes when it comes to ordering!! \n\nas far as what i had, i started with the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>. delish! for dinner i got the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> special. this was different than the regular <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, because it came with the most delicious king crab leg meat as well in a yummy butter sauce. i honestly could only eat half of the steak, this was just too much food all around. \n\nfor sides, we got the mushrooms, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>. holy bananas these were all so good.\n\nthen we finished with the butter cake!! which is gigantic, way to big for two people. we all got some of it (there were six of us), but keep in mind we were stuffed at this point! the noise level was reasonable in this restaurant, so it was perfect for a dinner with colleagues.", 
            "i don't say this much.  omg, this place is amazing.  i was in vegas with friends, and my buddy said i should try this place out  and i would love it.  i was skeptic at best..\n\nwe had a group of 8 and we decided to do family style and order apps.  we ordered the bone marrow, escargot, scallops, and calamari  \n\nthe bone marrow was okay in my opinion, but everyone loved it on my table.  i would have like some more accompaniment to enhance the flavors.  there was plenty of marrow, bread and  micro greens, and fine sea salt flakes.  it was very rich and flavor, but i had better.  it is still worth it.\n\nthe scallops were perfectly pan seared, and it came with a pleasant herb-y butter sauce.  each bite was amazing and when you are done with the scallops.  the sauce was great for  bread  dipping.\n\nthe escargot was good.  it came with the standard butter, garlic and shallots.  t\nhere is probably a few other herbs in there, but we ate them too fast to really look.\n.  \nthe friend calamari was good and came with two sauce, tartar, and i think a remoulade.  after having the other items, i wasn't too impressed.  this would be a great dish, if it was somewhere else. but we are talking about mastro's.\n\nthe omg moment was a  bone in <mark>Petite Filet</mark> we ordered.  when i first saw it, i was very disappointed when i saw the waiter cut it,  it look raw.  i was thinking how can a place like this, don't know the difference between medium rare and raw.  boy was i wrong.  the table decide we should try it and not waste it, because we all thought the same thing.  but when i bit into it, it was the most wonderful steak i had in recent memory.  it has a full of flavor, it was season to perfection.  every bite, i wanted another one.   in the end, i would have fought off the table for the bone.  lucky for me, no one wanted it.  i love the acidic marinade they used for the steak.  i guess it is a balsamic vinegar marinade.  man, i want to go back so badly.\n\nanyway, i don't think i can top anything else in this review.  i have to say the signature pound cake was good, but you must really have a sweet tooth.  \n\nwaiters and bus people were amazing and entertaining.  they are here to give you the best experience they can.    so please tip well.\n\nthe decor is amazing, just go look at the pictures online.  \n\nnow i just want to go to any mastro's and have that steak again.", 
            "the service of course is great. we had the 12 oz <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> (in the $50's range) and the 10oz filet ($48). if you like your steak tasting soft like butter it's best to order it medium rare. it comes in a 200 degree plate so it'll continue to cook the steak. \n\nfor sides, we had the lobster mashed potato ($39)-it was delicious, it was a bit salty for me  but my party liked it. \n\ncream spinach-bland- i think i had better at lawry's \n\ngorgonzola mac and cheese-best eat it while it's hot, once it's cold it's really bland.\n \nthe sides are generous, we order one of each  and it was more than enough for my party of 6.  we did have some appetizers prior. \n  the basket of bread of abundant- prezel bread, garlic parmesan bread, olive bread and some other stuff.",

            "my husband and i had a wonderful time at mastro's. the food was excellent, nice ambiance, drinks were great, and the warm butter cake is ridiculous. we came back the next day to have the warm butter cake one more time before our flight home. the medium well <mark>Petite Filet</mark> was moist because our waiter offered to butterfly it, the bake potato was delicious, as well as the asparagus. the blufeld riesling was so smooth. it was a nice compliment to our meal. \n\ni saw people complaining about this mastro's being in a mall. it is located in a mall but it is a high end shopping mall connected to aria where other nice restaurants are located. i found the shape of the restaurant to be cool and it has a nice ambiance.", 
            "best steakhouse hands down! <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> are a few to name the best ever! <mark>Filet</mark> to die for! always a treat! love you mastros!", 
            "in the mall at aria lies a bird house made of wood that serves great steak. we came here with a reservation made on open table for a pre-show dinner for a birthday. it's pricey but the steaks are worth it. i read the sides are massive, they were decent. enough for 2 people in my opinion. i had the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> and it was delicious. my partner had a grilled fish and it was fresh and tasty. the sauteed spinach was full of garlicky goodness and the asparagus was cooked to perfection. the big bread basket had lots of choices and the chocolate cake was great. the service was impeccable and our waiter was very knowledgable. the only downfall is the location. it's so odd to be at a high-end restaurant in a mall, even if it is a very high-end mall.", 
            "ate here recently when we were in vegas.  i was so excited because reviews were great.  service was very good, food was very good.  <mark>Filet</mark> were good, but i guess i expected outstanding.  and of course, it's in a mall.  i would recommend someone try this place, but i'll try something else next time.", 
            "this place is always pretty good! this location in particular is a bit odd, though. you're literally eating in the mall much like a food court (with a large bill). but hey, at least you're surrounded by designer names..ha!) \n\nthe seafood tower is the way to go. the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> is not the best thing on the menu despite what the masses say. it's a bit chewy. my girlfriend had a regular filet and it was much better and cooked perfectly.\n\nthe butter cake is terribly overrated. i always find that it's a bit dry and for lack-of-a-better thought....not worth the calories.", 
            "this restaurant has become one of my all-time favorites! i've eaten here multiple times over the past 3 years, and that's says a great deal because the strip has so many fine dining options. i've actually had the same waiter, mike, a couple of times. his knowledge of the menu, and service to our table couldn't have been better. \n\nmy favorite entree is the fillet of arctic char oreganata style. this is a flavorful fish like sockeye salmon or snapper, not bland or mild like grouper or cod. the portions are large at mastro's, both the entrees and the sides, and this dish is no exception. they serve 2 fillets of fish. there must be 12 to 14oz of fish on the plate. i've ordered steak here once as well, an 8oz <mark>Petite Filet</mark>. is was excellent, cooked perfectly, as one would expect at a high-end restaurant. \n\nfor desert, i recommend sharing the mastro's signature warm butter cake. it has an amazing smooth and warm buttery taste that intensifies as you near the cake's center. \n\nlastly, with regard to the dining experience, the restaurant is located in the crystals mall, however, there is no \"mall-feel\" to the experience whatsoever. the wooden \"tree house\" dining area is an impressive sight to see, and a truly unique and beautiful open-air room to dine in.", 
            "this restaurant is superb! i've been wanting to check this place out for a while now and it just so happened one of my long time friends was planning on having her birthday dinner here. the ambiance of the restaurant is high class and lavish. making a reservation is highly recommened, especially if you want to sit at a table in the tree house. in case you were wondering, the tree house is that giant structure across from louis vuitton. we had a 7pm reservation, but the birthday girl was running 10 min late. the hostesses and staff were more than accommodating and held our table. once everyone was there we were seated right away. the waiter went over the menu and highlighted his favorites as well as what they are known for. i was torn between surf or turf, but luckily my date wanted the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which i had my eye on, so i opted for the 18oz <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>. i ordered mine rare of course because i feel anything above medium rare ruins the true flavor of the meat. the cool thing about how they serve their steak is they actually under cook it and serve it on a 400 degree plate which allows the steak to cook more to exactly how you ordered so it's absolutely perfect when you take your first bite. they age all their steaks for 3 weeks, and omg they are perfect. juicy, full of flavor, and melt in you mouth like butter. now for the fish, the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was buttery, flakey, not too dry, not too wet, and just the right amount of oiliness. for sides, you order them seperately and they feed up to 5 which was perfect since there was so many of us. we all ordered different sides and got to share. we had brussel sprouts, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>, saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms, and truffle fries. oh my oh my, we were all beyond stuffed. every element of the meal was perfect, but dessert was what sealed the deal. two words, butter cake. if you don't think it is one of the most amazing desserts to ever exist, you need to reevaluate your life choices. they also make their own whipped cream which is euphoric. if you're looking to have a memorable dinner you need to check out mastro's, it's totally worth the money.", 
            "being a vegas local, living on the strip, i get to try amazing vegas eats weekly. i must say by far mastros is a step above the rest & my personal favorite restaurant on the strips.\n\nservice is top notch, as good as it gets! some of my fav dishes are the scallops, <mark>Bone-In KC Strip</mark>, hamachi, <mark>Petite Filet</mark> mignon, & of course the amazing buttercake dessert. must try.", 
            "this was our first time visiting mastro's. we've visited other steakhouses like flemings, mortons, ruth chris, etc,  and this place ranks at the top. the servers are on point the entire meal, making sure that every detail of your meal is correct.\n\ni ordered the 19 oz bone in filet and my wife ordered the <mark>Petite Filet</mark>. both steaks were cooked exactly to our liking and did not need any seasoning at the table. they were flavorful as they were served. we ordered mac and cheese, mushrooms, and asparagus as our side dishes. the side dishes are large enough to share with your entire table so be aware.\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> as a starter and it was delicious. every bit of it was finished.\n\nwe ordered a few drinks with dinner and the drinks were excellent. the lemon drop i ordered was served on dry ice so the drink was smoking, entertaining presentation.\n\nthe location of this restaurant is a little odd, smack dab in the middle of a shopping mall in what appears to be a large wooden bong (not sure how else to explain it).\n\nwe also received a call the next morning thanking us for dining with them. it was expensive, but excellent and we didn't mind since we were celebrating our marriage.", 
            "we went here last night for my girlfriend's birthday.  mixed feelings about our experience.  to start off with, the service was impeccable.  daniel and tim made sure to constantly check in and my water glass was never empty.  we started out with the strawberry mules which tasted good and strong.  we skipped an appetizer and just munched on the bread basket which was also tasty.  for dinner, we ordered the lobster mash and steamed broccoli to share as our family style sides.  our server came back to apologize that they were out of broccoli so we switched to spinach.  both were good.  we loved the lobster mash.\nfor our entrees, we ordered the 8oz <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, saut\\u00e9ed scallops and another fish dish that i cannot recall at this time.  my scallops were great.  my friend said the other fish i can't recall was great as well.  birthday girl had the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> and stated after her first bite that the quality of meat was definitely lacking.  after us all trying a bite, we agreed it did not taste like a very high quality meat.  the server confirmed it was corn fed beef sourced from various midwestern farms.  surprising for such a high quality restaurant to source corn fed beef.  the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> our other friend ordered was a bit over cooked making it dried out as well.  we mentioned our dislike of the steak to our server and he did apologize and offer to get us started on something else.  we were all sharing our meals and noted it was fine and we didn't need a replacement dish.  for dessert, we were treated to a happy birthday slice of chocolate cake (a bit dry) as well as the butter cake (which was phenomenal).  in the end, the steak was taken off our bill and both desserts were comped.  the service made our experience enjoyable despite some of our dishes being off.  5 stars for service, 3 stars for taste of food, 3 stars for price in comparison to quality of food.  unfortunately, not sure the price is worth the quality of food you receive at this one.", 
            "he always said we should have a nice proper steak dinner.  but every single time i'm in town, we end up skipping the whole steak thing.  but this time, his boyfriend had a client to impress, so we off we went on a steak dinner.  yay me!\n\nanyhow, since it is rare back home in honolulu to find a filet with bone in, that's what they got.  myself, because my eating habits have changed (boo!!) i opted for the <mark>Petite Filet</mark>.  i know, sad, right?  i got 8 ounces of meat!  not the 12 ounces they ordered.  i got my meat rare, cold center, hot plate.  mmmm i just love a good piece of meat especially when you can control how you're gonna receive it.  i got it just the way i want it, which is actually hard to come by.  i'll take it the way i want it.  he says out loud, \"you think you know a person,\" when i ordered my meat rare.  oh, honey, you've known me for how many years now, and you still don't know how i like my meat?  as rare as can be is how i like it and i got a true piece of meat perfection.  you know that i ate all of it!  i love me some meat!\n\nthe rest of the dishes were typical.  salads, soups, sides were just regular, nothing extraordinarily spectacular to really write about.  the portions for those items are generous, i must say.  we did order a bottle of wine to go with dinner.  i think it was a shiraz.  i didn't pick it out, but it did go well with dinner.  and since it was their birthday, there was dessert.  not 1, but 2, since two of them were celebrating.  one was a butter cake and the other a chocolate cake.  how nice, right?  we couldn't finish the desserts, but i must say they were very rich and of course yummy.\n\nwould i return again?  most definitely!  it's good that this place was a nice walk from our hotel.  i sure am glad that they are open late, since my eating habits were out of wack.  i love me some meat!!", 
            "went here with my wife and two adult kids on recommendation from our concierge at the green valley resort. the ceasar salad and warm spinach salad were perfect and they let you split portions. we had the salmon and three boneless <mark>Filet</mark> with garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. again they let us split the potatoes 4 ways. steak and salmon was some of the best that i ever had. service was impeccable. prices are very fair especially because they let you split the salads and sides.",

            "the fourth new discovery that was a five-star worthy dining experience was at mastro's ocean club.  i had heard good things about this place for at least two years, and before then espied its distinctive wooden bird's nest with admiration at its quite innovative and modern design just before the restaurant's opening inside the shops at crystals.\n\nit was the day of our 25th wedding anniversary, and our request for seating inside the nest was granted.  it actually felt like being two young birds sheltered inside a protective nest.  not only that, but we were surprised at meal's end with a complimentary warm butter cake ala mode, mastro's signature dessert.  this was a great mouth-watering end to a very memorable meal, as the soft cake seemed to melt in the mouth. \n\nbut the beginning of our meal was no less auspicious.  after enjoying a bread basket that included large homemade pretzel breadsticks, diane and i dove into succulent hot <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark>.  these big crustaceans bursting with flavor really deserve to be called \"prawns\" rather than \"shrimp,\" and did deliver a taste of vanilla in the light batter--but not overpoweringly so.\n\nfor our main we each ordered an 8-oz filet, which here is called a \"<mark>Petite Filet</mark>,\" along with 1-1/2 lbs. of <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>.  both tender steaks were cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, and with little char on top.  accompanying bearnaise sauce was drinkable, and a peppercorn sauce was not far behind.  the hot and long sections of <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> were pulled out of the pot at exactly the right moment  and presented as already opened legs, so no prying with tools was necessary.  they tasted great dunked in warm drawn butter.  and while diane praised her large and cheesy twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark>, i delighted in a huge mound of skinny sea salt & <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark>, which was reported to be a small rather than regular-sized version.  sauteed mushrooms were lovely, too, but i hardly needed them.  we were stuffed.  \n\nwith a ratio of about one waiter for every four guests, service was great.  our knowledgeable and conscientious server checked on us several times, and water refills were regularly poured without any need to request them.  even with the restaurant packed with guests, the ambiance inside the bird's nest section of the restaurant was romantic, intimate, and classy.\n\nmastro's is pricey to be sure.  but, executing well at delivering artfully prepared high-quality offerings from both land and sea, there is a reason why several local diners in the know call this one of the best restaurants in las vegas.  without question we will soon become repeat guests.", 
            "growing up in beverly hills i have attended the mastro's on ca\\u00f1on close to 100 times. they have the best steak in the game, i don't care what anyone try's to say. last night me and my friend paul had the night off in vegas so we decided to check out the mastro's here in las vegas at city center. it not the traditional mastro's setting but the food was still remarkable! our waiter deion was the man he helped my friend choose the perfect wine to accompany his <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> topped with foie gras! which just melted in ur mouth! (pause) i myself took down the 22oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> cooked medium rare plus like a beast and enjoyed every single bite! once again mastro's was an a+! pictured below was the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>.", 
            "wow, this place certainly earned every amazing review it received. i did extensive research before i picked a restaurant to take my mom for her 70th birthday dinner while in vegas for the weekend. i ordered the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>; she ordered the grilled salmon. the salmon was absolutely delicious, perfectly cooked, generous size, literally melted like butter. speaking of which, we ordered the heirloom tomato/cheese appetizer. omg, yum, yum, yum! again, the portion size huge for an appetizer. as for the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>, well, we both agreed the best steak we've ever tasted. oh, and the bread basket? huge, warm, ridiculously fresh variety of insane bread and butter. as for dessert, they brought her their signature warm butter cake with a side of whipped cream... okay, without questions, best dessert i have ever tasted! i literally brought the leftovers home on the plane the next day! as for service - top notch but not stuffy!!! our waiter tim was awesome!!! so funny, professional, accommodating, couldn't have asked for anything better. as for the prices - hey, it's vegas, it's going to be expensive; however, there are thousands of restaurants that are overpriced and you feel ripped off when you are done - not mastro's! worth every penny if you ask me (and my mom!). absolutely excellent dinner all the way around, would treat myself to this upscale dining experience any chance i could get!", 
            "i've been to the mastro's in costa mesa several times so i was pretty excited to try this mastro's. plus, i've always wanted to dine in the treehouse that they have here! i suggest making a reservation and requesting the treehouse. i guess it's not anything too special, but it is nice being in a different setting that you can't really get anywhere else on the strip. \n\nthe service here was excellent. janene was our server and provided excellent customer service. she constantly checked up on us, refilling our wines and making sure our meals were to perfection. \n\n// food & wine //\nwine- the prisoner: this wine is a blend of zinfandel, cabernet sauvignon, syrah, petite sirah and charbono. this wine had so many flavor profiles going on. it also went really well with all of the meat that we ordered. the wine was very smooth with plenty of fruity flavors to it. \n\nsauteed spinach: your basic saut\\u00e9ed spinach with garlic. i would rather suggest ordering the saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms.\n\n<mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>: it was good, but it wasn't excellent. i would have liked more cheese added to my <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>. also, the potatoes seemed to be slightly undercooked and hard. \n\n<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>: a great piece of meat with excellent meat to fat ratio and amazing flavor. i would definitely order this again. \n\n18 oz <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> mignon: ordered rare plus, this meat was so tender. unfortunately it wasn't seasoned that well so i had to add salt and pepper to each bite. \n\noverall, i enjoyed dining at this mastro's location, but if i had to choose between this location and the location in costa mesa, i would have to choose the costa mesa location. the service at both locations were excellent, but i would have to say that i slightly enjoyed the food more at the costa mesa location.", 
            "the best thing about this place was their level of service. the staff was amazing and i feel like my party was a lot of work for them and they remained pleasant, helpful, and toggled between utmost professionalism and fun and silly based on what we needed. \n\nthe food itself was good overall. i wasn't blown away. we had <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> for an appetizer, i'm not a connoisseur here but they were good. the main dishes were the highlight for me, we had <mark>Filet</mark> and a crusted <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. the <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> were pretty plain and blah, gorgonzola mac and cheese was decent. everyone at the table loved the butter cake, i'm not really a sweets person but it was good.",

            "18 oz <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> was the best and priciest piece of steak i had so far.  \n\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were good.  the portion was huge.  it can probably feed 3 to 4 people.", 
            "i regret not going back to jean george's prime restaurant. \n\ni wouldn't  go back to mastro's if you paid me. to be fair it wasn't because the service was bad because it was very good. props to our waiter troy.\n\nif you're a steak-snob you're going to weep for the cow who gave his life to the second rate chef who doesn't know how to season a cut of meat. i ordered the 18oz <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> which is a glorious piece of meat. it was the first time in my life i didn't finish a steak.\n\nif you're like most people you'll have one, maybe two, nights to eat out in vegas. if you're  considering going to masto's, that means you're likely considering other high-end restaurants like prime, cut, craftsteak etc. regardless where you go, you're going to spend $90-$150 a person so wouldn't you be disappointed if you weren't blown away?!\n\ngo to prime.", 
            "i did not get to enjoy my meal as much as i wish... =( but i know for a fact that the food was really good..\n\nme & my girl friend (amy l) made reservations for 6pm on a saturday. after dragging ourselves over here from vdara, we finally made it on time. it was an absolute drag because we were awake for 30+ hours & we felt really crappy from all the \"beverages\" we consumed... basically we felt like utter sh** and couldn't enjoy our meals =(\n\nlocated in the city center, the restaurant is pretty much in the very center of the building. service was good but a bit slow. i love the assortment of bread, my favorite is the crunchy cheesey-garlicky one =)\n\nhere's what we ordered:\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> - comes in a huge bowl, tastes very very veryy rich, not too many pieces of lobster but still pretty delicious\n\nseared <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> - i've had this before at mastro's in beverly hills, same thing, still delicious, comes with 3 scallops & yummy cheese/garlic bread. scallops from mastro's comes in 2nd place after providence's :p\n\n <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> - cooked medium. comes on a sizzling plate, very good rich flavors and good texture. i was only able to eat 2-3 bites. i did eat the leftovers the next morning & it was still pretty tasty. \n\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> - blacken cajun flavored, i think.. it was pretty damn good, texture is very similar to scallops.\n\n<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> - big enough to be an entree on it's own, holy sh*t, i don't know how this thing can just be a side dish lol it's meant to be shared amongst 4+ people.. i thought it was pretty yummy, i love cheese and king crab meat... but this is super duper heavy, i probably would not order this again...\n\ngarlic spinach - tasty but a bit too garlicky for me, it was so infused with garlic that it tasted a bit bitter to me..\n\n\ni am so sad that we were so full that i didn't get to try to butter cake, again! =( we didn't have much of an appetite at all, plus i think we ordered a little too much lol... we were stuffed after having a few bites of our appetizers.  service was good, our waiter was a bit slow though. our water glasses were never empty (thank goodness, we must have drank a total of 13 glasses each..)\n\nrestrooms are located on the second floor, kind of a hassle to look for. bad idea to go when you're intoxicated..\n\n\n\nlesson learned: do not attempt fine dining after a night of debauchery....excellent restaurant & food! must try the butter cake one day.... =(", 
            "in short, our meal was absolutely phenomenal-- perhaps one of the best we've ever had in vegas. with every element of the meal nearly flawless, i could not keep marveling over each little detail of our experience. yelp here has mastro's at a 4.5+ average on 250+ reviews..this is no fluke! \nwe came here for my mom's birthday dinner and my expectations were more than exceeded.\n\nwe were promptly seated for our 9:30 reservation within the \"tree house,\" as the hostess called it; it had a very loft feel to it yet was very quaint had a warm, welcoming atmosphere. i'll definitely ask to be sat in this area again. \nas we passed by the bar area, we were greeted by spectacular live music, consisting of a woman singing accompanied by a fantastic piano player (who also added in some vocals). big plus for this. \nafter immediately seating us, the hostess hurried to bring us black napkins to avoid the lint of white napkins attaching itself to our dark clothing. we didn't even ask. nice touch. \n\nrob, our waiter, and the rest of the waitstaff that took care of our table were nothing but spectacular. i was a bit worried at first as my water glass remained empty for a good 15 minutes, but this was the sole flaw of the entire evening (and a minor one at that). rob was extremely congenial, professional, yet very personable and extremely accommodating of our wishes. \n\nwe like to split things a lot when we go out to dinner so that we get our own little smorgasbord of items to try...and a smorgasbord we got! not only this, but the chefs made sure to split nearly everything that came to the table (even the bone-in steak we ordered!) now, where do i even begin...\n\n--<mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark>: caution: oxymoron... massive shrimp. the biggest shrimp i've seen in recent memory. the batter wasn't really too vanilla-tasting in my opinion, but this was a delicious starter regardless. three to an order! \n\n--burrata & heirloom tomato salad: mmm, burrata cheese is one of my favorites! yes, this was a typical salad, but the tomatoes were so fresh and the balsamic reduction was so tasty. we asked for a little bit more of this said reduction and they brought out an entire cup of it..whoops.\n\n--<mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark>: hands down the best i've ever had. not overly thick and creamy, yet perfect proportions of ingredients. piping hot when it arrived which i really appreciate with soups. \n\n--mac & cheese: ugh my mouth just waters at the thought of this. served in a skillet, the mac and cheese was perfect consistency: it wasn't drowning in sauce but it wasn't just a bowl of plain noodles with an ounce of cheese mixed in...perfect proportions (once again). on top was a layer of melted cheese that was just fantastic...i think that there were four cheeses or so just in this topper! \n\n--<mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> mignon: i really don't like throwing out the \"best i've ever had\" card very often. because, honestly, how many things can take that title? well, this definitely takes the \"best filet i've ever had\" title. join the club, <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark>. it had the taste of a ny strip, but was tender as a filet should be. and, to top it off, it is served on a 400 degree hot plate. i like my steak kept hot and this obviously got the job done. \n\n--warm butter cake: okay, now this piece of heaven really takes the cake (ha, horrible pun intended). my mom and sister are suckers for butter cake (who isn't..?) and we figured what better time to order it than for a birthday? out comes this large, circular cake and a behemoth side of whipped cream. really. view my picture to see how much there was. think of a frozen skillet just bombarded with thick, heavy whipped cream. fantastic dessert. and what's even better? rob comped this $16 dessert with the simple message of \"happy birthday, we're so happy you came in to dine with us tonight.\" winnnnnnn.\n\n\nfrom now on, every time i'm asked for a restaurant recommendation, mastro's will be the first word to escape my mouth. i cannot wait to go there again next time i've got a few bucks to blow.", 
            "<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, seafood tower, <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>, 5 star service, presentation, be sure to get a spot in the \"treehouse\" section. take a good look at menu prices beforehand though;)", 
            "it's not that we had a bad experience at mastro's. but for what we paid i was expecting a bit more. the bread basket was good, but not dazzling. the tomato and mozzarella salad we shared wasn't memorable. in fact, for burratta mozzarella it wasn't good at all. i thoroughly enjoyed my <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> which made up for the salad. the side of <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> was decent but not outstanding, same goes for the side of peas we shared. mostly we went because the location was conveniently close to the aria, where we stayed, and because after seeing the tree house on a previous visit to vegas i desperately wanted to eat there. being in the tree house wasn't the best experience. it's loud, since you are in the middle of the crystal's mall. all in all, it was decent but overpriced in my opinion. i probably won't be returning to this mastro's location.", 
            "it's the little things....\n\n1. providing dark napkins for those with dark clothing and white napkins for those with light clothing so customers can stay oh-so visibly lint-free.\n\n2. the hostess pulling out your chair to seat you because your date clearly forgot that it was his job.\n\n3. the server's extensive knowledge of the menu! she made it sound better than the menu itself. it's always nice when people convincingly show that they know what they're selling. makes me have more faith in the restaurant.\n\n4. although it was inside a shopping center, you could easily overlook it due to the dimly lit dining space and romantic ambiance.\n\n5. calling you within days to make sure you had a great experience.\n\n6. servers scooping serving size portions onto your plate, so you won't have to, because eating is so damn labor intensive.\n\n7. oh and the food:\n- <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> was cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. order it rare or medium rare.\n- order the gnocchi. do it. your tastebuds will thank you.\n\ntwo bone-in <mark>Filet</mark>, a side of roasted brussel sprouts, and the gnocchi ran about $180 with tax and tip.", 
            "a good friend of ours suggested mastro's when we asked for a recommendation for a seafood on the strip. so i made a reservation online for that night at 7pm on the mastro's website. what i didn't know was that i had somehow clicked on the chicago location. luckily i was walking around the crystals shopping center that afternoon and went to check out the venue and was chatting with one of the hostesses who offered to check on our reservation to confirm it .. good thing she did and we fixed my error. they were pretty booked that night but were able to squeeze us in. :) \n\nthe service was pretty much top-notch from start to finish, hostesses, servers, and bussers,  all were very attentive and knowledgeable as well as being friendly and personable. loved that they dish out our sides for us .. that's a really nice touch. \n\nthe food, we had a variety of items which were all delicious but at the top of our favorites were the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> and the signature <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. both are must haves to accompany any steak or seafood dish. we had the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious as well as the pan seared <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which my dining companions said was spectacularly prepared and seasoned. \n\ndessert was over the top .. we had three .. mastro's signature warm butter cake, \nthe cherry crisp, and the profiteroles. the first two were topped with vanilla bean gelato. both were to die for. i had read lots about the warm butter cake and it was everything i had expected and more :) .. and surprisingly i also loved the cherry crisp .. i am not huge on cherry anything but the flavor had just the right amount of sweetness and was not overpowering and the crisp part is a crumbly granola like topping which is an nice balance with the gelato and fruitiness of the dish. it's something i would definitely order again! \n\nmy only complaint is that the server didn't warn us about the size of the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> appetizer. mom and i each ordered our own, and when they came out .. they were absolutely gigantic and even though we had a party of 5 we were unable to finish both. being in the service industry myself, i would have definitely warned my guests about the size of the carpaccio dish and suggested something else to order with it. \n\nall in all it was a fabulous dinner, the restaurant, even though it is in a busy mall .. has a nice ambiance, and we will absolutely be back.", 
            "went to mastro's with friends for a belated birthday celebration. well worth the wait. opened with salad and calamari and our waiter, craig, recommended a nice wine. \n\nthe main event made my night: <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>, cooked to melt-in-your-mouth perfection. i suggest this as a place to visit with friends. you can find more intimate spots for a date, but it's perfect for enjoying an upscale dinner with a group.", 
            "i've been here twice and my second experience was even better than the first.  my hubby and i came here to celebrate our anniversary and we were so glad we did.  \n\nwe were greeted by the sweetest hostess as soon as we arrived, and she asked if we were here for a special occasion.  i let her know that it was our anniversary, and word traveled fast since our waiter greeted us with a congratulations.  \n\ni ordered the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> (8oz) and a side of <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>, and my husband ordered the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> (12oz) and the gorgonzola mac & cheese.  my steak was so tender that i could cut it with a butter knife and it practically melted in my mouth.  my husband is a steak connoisseur and he said that it was the best steak that he's ever had.  the <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> were buttery and pan seared to perfection, and the mac & cheese was rich and heavy.  i'm not a fan of blue cheese at all but the gorgonzola was really mild (i guess they use 4 kinds of cheeses).  \n\nalthough we didn't even have room for dessert, our waiter brought us a nice piece of chocolate cake with \"happy anniversary\" on the plate.  along with this came a giant serving of their homemade  whip cream.  i somehow found room in my belly and managed to scarf down 1/2 of it.  a really nice gesture that went a long way.  \n\nthe service was fantastic.  even if we looked in the waiter/servers' direction they would come over to see if we needed anything.  \n\nthe only thing odd about this location is that it is in the crystal cove mall, so the ambiance isn't what i'm used to with this kind of food.  at least we were surrounded by high end shops like jimmy choo.  the bathrooms are also upstairs which are kind of a bummer.  we didn't mind at all though, we were on cloud 9 with everything else about the place.", 
            "best <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> in my life.  the portion was much bigger than i was expecting, and because i ordered it medium rare, the fish was cooked just right!  everyone at our 8-person table had either the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, rib-eye, or <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>, and everyone's dish was delicious.  would definitely come back here!!!", 
            "party of 8 on a tuesday night.\ninteresting set up - there is a part of the restaurant that looks like a large wooden hornet's nest.  not sure what that's all about.  \n\nservice was impeccable from the hostess to the main server to his assistants.  everything was prompt, polite and timed well.  we were not rushed out even though we were one of the last parties to leave. \n\nfood:\ni ordered the gorgonzola mac and cheese $12 and the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> $48.  the mac and cheese was a little disappointing - very little flavor and it was dry,  very dry.  i had read that this was a great side dish so i was sad when it wasn't very palatable.  the portion is huge - consider sharing it if you do.  it easily fed our entire table.  i asked for the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> medium rare and it came out closer to medium.  regardless, the flavor was very smooth, not gamey.  the outside was a little too charred, but the rest of it was quite good.  it came with mint jelly, which was very tasty.  we also had a heirloom tomato and burrata salad $12 which was a very generous portion - the tomatoes were sweet and juicy.  the table got the seafood tower (have no idea how much that was but it was worth it).  this was friggin amazing.  honestly.  there were kumamoto oysters, fresh dungeness crab, snow <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>, humongous shrimp, great big lobster claws.  all fresh and tender meat.  it didn't require sauce.  none of it was briny or sandy.  so delicious and whatever we paid, i don't care.  it was unbelievable. other people in our party got the arctic char \"oreganato\" style, <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>, seared scallops and halibut.  every dish was served with mushrooms, asparagus, green beans and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (this had to have crack in it b/c <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> never tasted so good.)  no one had a single complaint and everyone finished what they ordered.  by this time, we're all about to pass out from food coma, but we insisted on the butter cake.  if you come here, no matter what you order, you must save room for this signature dessert.  i can't even describe it but it is amazing.  it comes out warm, w/ freshly made whipped cream and vanilla ice cream.   must.  must.  must have.  \n\noverall, great experience.  cost us a total of $1400 for 7 people.  you do the math.", 
            "the service of course is great. we had the 12 oz <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> (in the $50's range) and the 10oz filet ($48). if you like your steak tasting soft like butter it's best to order it medium rare. it comes in a 200 degree plate so it'll continue to cook the steak. \n\nfor sides, we had the lobster mashed potato ($39)-it was delicious, it was a bit salty for me  but my party liked it. \n\ncream spinach-bland- i think i had better at lawry's \n\ngorgonzola mac and cheese-best eat it while it's hot, once it's cold it's really bland.\n \nthe sides are generous, we order one of each  and it was more than enough for my party of 6.  we did have some appetizers prior. \n  the basket of bread of abundant- prezel bread, garlic parmesan bread, olive bread and some other stuff.",

            "this place is always pretty good! this location in particular is a bit odd, though. you're literally eating in the mall much like a food court (with a large bill). but hey, at least you're surrounded by designer names..ha!) \n\nthe seafood tower is the way to go. the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> is not the best thing on the menu despite what the masses say. it's a bit chewy. my girlfriend had a regular filet and it was much better and cooked perfectly.\n\nthe butter cake is terribly overrated. i always find that it's a bit dry and for lack-of-a-better thought....not worth the calories.", 
            "this restaurant is superb! i've been wanting to check this place out for a while now and it just so happened one of my long time friends was planning on having her birthday dinner here. the ambiance of the restaurant is high class and lavish. making a reservation is highly recommened, especially if you want to sit at a table in the tree house. in case you were wondering, the tree house is that giant structure across from louis vuitton. we had a 7pm reservation, but the birthday girl was running 10 min late. the hostesses and staff were more than accommodating and held our table. once everyone was there we were seated right away. the waiter went over the menu and highlighted his favorites as well as what they are known for. i was torn between surf or turf, but luckily my date wanted the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which i had my eye on, so i opted for the 18oz <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>. i ordered mine rare of course because i feel anything above medium rare ruins the true flavor of the meat. the cool thing about how they serve their steak is they actually under cook it and serve it on a 400 degree plate which allows the steak to cook more to exactly how you ordered so it's absolutely perfect when you take your first bite. they age all their steaks for 3 weeks, and omg they are perfect. juicy, full of flavor, and melt in you mouth like butter. now for the fish, the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was buttery, flakey, not too dry, not too wet, and just the right amount of oiliness. for sides, you order them seperately and they feed up to 5 which was perfect since there was so many of us. we all ordered different sides and got to share. we had brussel sprouts, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>, saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms, and truffle fries. oh my oh my, we were all beyond stuffed. every element of the meal was perfect, but dessert was what sealed the deal. two words, butter cake. if you don't think it is one of the most amazing desserts to ever exist, you need to reevaluate your life choices. they also make their own whipped cream which is euphoric. if you're looking to have a memorable dinner you need to check out mastro's, it's totally worth the money.", 
            "my wife and i came here for our anniversary and had a wonderful experience. we were happy with the service as well as the food. we were seated in the tree house as requested.  we started with the steamed mussles and bread basket. mussels were good however quite small. bread was aldo good no complaints. i had the 18oz <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>, oscar style something i've always wanted to try.  the amount of crab meat was generous and the bernaisse sauce was good. worth the extra $25.  my wife got the pan seared <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and it did not dissapoint. as for sides we ordered half orders of the lobster mash, green beans and the mushrooms. the amount of food was way too much for the two of us. the lobster mash was good but not worth the $18. we could've gone without it. better off using that money to get your steak oscar style. much more satisfying.  staff was professional and attentive. drinks were really good ad well. for dessert we got a complimentary butter cake which very good but we were to stuffed at that point to really enjoy it. \n\ni took one star away because i had my steak packed to-go for a midnight snack and when i open the box i find that there was only one piece of crab. i know i had at least 4-5 pieces left. i really wouldn't have been able to eat it all but it's the principle.\n\nanyway i would visit mastro's again but order less.",

(pause) i myself took down the 22oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> cooked medium rare plus like a beast and enjoyed every single bite! once again mastro's was an a+! pictured below was the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>.", 
            "wow, this place certainly earned every amazing review it received. i did extensive research before i picked a restaurant to take my mom for her 70th birthday dinner while in vegas for the weekend. i ordered the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>; she ordered the grilled salmon. the salmon was absolutely delicious, perfectly cooked, generous size, literally melted like butter. speaking of which, we ordered the heirloom tomato/cheese appetizer. omg, yum, yum, yum! again, the portion size huge for an appetizer. as for the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>, well, we both agreed the best steak we've ever tasted. oh, and the bread basket? huge, warm, ridiculously fresh variety of insane bread and butter. as for dessert, they brought her their signature warm butter cake with a side of whipped cream... okay, without questions, best dessert i have ever tasted! i literally brought the leftovers home on the plane the next day! as for service - top notch but not stuffy!!! our waiter tim was awesome!!! so funny, professional, accommodating, couldn't have asked for anything better. as for the prices - hey, it's vegas, it's going to be expensive; however, there are thousands of restaurants that are overpriced and you feel ripped off when you are done - not mastro's! worth every penny if you ask me (and my mom!). absolutely excellent dinner all the way around, would treat myself to this upscale dining experience any chance i could get!", 
            "i've been to the mastro's in costa mesa several times so i was pretty excited to try this mastro's. plus, i've always wanted to dine in the treehouse that they have here! i suggest making a reservation and requesting the treehouse. i guess it's not anything too special, but it is nice being in a different setting that you can't really get anywhere else on the strip. \n\nthe service here was excellent. janene was our server and provided excellent customer service. she constantly checked up on us, refilling our wines and making sure our meals were to perfection. \n\n// food & wine //\nwine- the prisoner: this wine is a blend of zinfandel, cabernet sauvignon, syrah, petite sirah and charbono. this wine had so many flavor profiles going on. it also went really well with all of the meat that we ordered. the wine was very smooth with plenty of fruity flavors to it. \n\nsauteed spinach: your basic saut\\u00e9ed spinach with garlic. i would rather suggest ordering the saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms.\n\n<mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>: it was good, but it wasn't excellent. i would have liked more cheese added to my <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>. also, the potatoes seemed to be slightly undercooked and hard. \n\n<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>: a great piece of meat with excellent meat to fat ratio and amazing flavor. i would definitely order this again. \n\n18 oz <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> mignon: ordered rare plus, this meat was so tender. unfortunately it wasn't seasoned that well so i had to add salt and pepper to each bite. \n\noverall, i enjoyed dining at this mastro's location, but if i had to choose between this location and the location in costa mesa, i would have to choose the costa mesa location. the service at both locations were excellent, but i would have to say that i slightly enjoyed the food more at the costa mesa location."

            "i'm not sure if it was me expecting too much because all my other mastro's experiences in california were uh-ma-zing, but this experience at mastro's in las vegas was very much so a disappointment.  i'm with brad t, only 3 stars.... =(\n\n1.  kunomoto oysters were ordered off menu and pretty fresh and tasty, but i've had better.\n2.  by the time we finished our oysters, which was only a few minutes because we eat fast, we started our cold <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>.  i don't know about other people's experiences, but we've always had our <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> kind of toasty.  though it was crab-a-licious, i was put off by the temperature.\n3.  our 22 oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was cooked rare plus and it was delicious!  the extra sear with clarified butter is fantastic.  however, i was not pleased with the amount of connective tissue in my half of the steak.  i felt like i was prepping my own meal by having to cut through all that chewy stuff!\n4.  here's the moment of utmost disappointment.  i was thinking about my fluffy, warm and tasty butter cake all night long, and it was a butter cake fail.  it was not warm and fluffy as i remember.  it was actually almost grainy and almost cold on the outside, save the inside was warm but almost soggy.  the wonderful airy whipped cream was actually heavy and too sweet.\n\nconclusion:  for being open for 6 months, should i expect it to be where its other mastro counterparts are in amazing-ness, or should i expect it to be working out its kinks and be amazing 6 more months down the line?  regardless of kinks or not, i'm a sad puppy because other than the yummy steak mixed with connective tissue bits, everything else was just average compared to my other mastro's experiences.  mastro's did not rise to the occasion to it's reputation.  will i go back?  for the love of butter cake, i will after more time has passed for this particular establishment.\n\n[side note: if you do try this particular mastro's, do asked to be sit in the nice atrium with the mollusk looking wooden structure and not right outside of it.  i think you will get better service.  it seems as if the table we were sitting at is a \"blind spot\".  the servers liked to walk over an peer over the railing next to you and chat about the stores and patrons below as if you weren't there.]", 
            "as a newer yelper, this is only my second review and beyond deserved.  on our most recent trip to las vegas last weekend, my boyfriend and i ended up unexpectedly at mastro's ocean club in crystals inside city center for the first time.  we go to vegas quite a bit (about once every 2 months or so) and have passed by this place quite a few times.  \n\nthe interestingly constructed architecture of the main dining area has been quite the source of amusement to us in the past... it resembles something like the shell of a wooden submarine that has exit chutes above and below it to spit you out into crystals when you are done with your meal (btw, this is a joke.  you do not get ejected from your seat.  it is only my strange sense of humor that comes up with this stuff).  my imaginative uses for the architecture aside, the design/layout is nice; it makes you feel as if the restaurant is floating in the middle of crystals with a very open and airy feel.\n\nas we were walking through crystals on our way back to our hotel room at aria from a long day of shopping, we decided to make an impromptu stop at the ejection submarine and see if there was any chance they would take us as walk-ins on a busy friday night.  with it being such an upscale spot, i was sure we would either be turned away without a reservation or asked to wait for a ridiculous amount of time.  au contraire!  they offered us immediate seating in the bar/lounge area or a few minute wait for the main dining room.  since we felt a bit underdressed for the location, we opted for the bar/lounge area and were glad we did.  we had the perfect seat right next to the piano player and fiery red-headed chanteuse, who was pleasantly entertaining. \n\nwe were promptly greeted by our amazing server, sara.  the only reason i know her name is because i made sure to ask her for it when we were leaving as i knew i wanted to review this place.  sara was so attentive, knowledgeable about menu, friendly, and always two steps ahead of us -  really as perfect as a server can get.  all of her recommendations were great as well.\n\ni had the swordfish (i hadnt met my mercury quota for the month yet) and my boyfriend had the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>.  we shared the most delicious side dish - the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>.  my swordfish paired very well with gnocchi and it was the perfect combo of light and creamy.  however, my boyfriend's ribeye wasnt anything stellar.  it wasnt as flavorful as a most quality ribeyes should be.  it's on our do-not-order-again list.  this is an \"ocean club\" though so maybe that was his error for ordering one of the few non-seafood options.  now,  for the absolute best part of the meal.... the most heavenly dessert ever - mastro's signature warm butter cake.  even if the rest of the meal and service had been horrible, which it was far from, i would have given this place 5 stars just for this dessert!  i dreamt about this cake the rest of our stay in vegas and cant wait to go back again on our next trip just to have it.  this creation alone makes mastro's ocean club one of my top 5 all-time favorite restaurants.  i would happily get ejected from this sea-faring vessel any time! ;)\n\nsorry for the ridiculously long review, but i had so much to comment on and didnt know where to shorten it.", 
            "my first thought when seated was, \"it's a good thing all of these world class stores aren't doing any business because it sure takes the edge off a high-dining experience along the mall food court railing\". our table felt like a satellite location for a sparkling contemporary version of daddy's classic steak house. and we weren't even seated in the satellite (you'll get it if you visit). it just seemed surreal for a \"room\" with such distinguishing attributes. i won't hold that against them, much.\n\nit was just my son and i that visited to celebrate his 21st. matt was our dining guide and he was fun. not like, \"let's have a vegas night!\", fun. just that he carried his demeanor well and kept his smile on. he was very, very consistent in that his presentation to each of the three tables nearby was identical, and specific. he was meticulous to ensure accuracy and satisfaction.\n\nwe were completely impressed by the young lady and gentleman entertaining the room. we later learned that it was their first night at mastro's. their acoustics in that challenging environment are absolute perfection and their talents are superior.  \n\nwe went light on the openers which were supplemented by an abundant variety of stellar bread choices. my son is all-american in his need for a calamari appetizer. it was the best we'd ever had, and maybe will. i had the <mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark> and, again, maybe the best complete salad i've ever enjoyed. my son ordered the <mark>Bone-In KC Strip</mark> a little less than medium and he dubbed it the crown jewel of his steak experiences. he couldn't finish it and he finishes everything. i asked for the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. matt helped me herd descriptives into a perfectly cooked finish. i'm still thinking it's the fact that i live in colorado, where even onions and garlic sometimes have difficulty offering flavor, but if it's possible to have too much natural flavor in a steak, it happened. i'm taking accountability on that one, because it's not mastro's fault i live at high altitude. this was a huge steak and i hardly dented it. we sided up a strong contender for best garlic mashed, which we carried out more of than we ate. so we get this this lovely shopping bag, consistent with the elevated neighborhood, to carry our midnight snack down the strip with. \n\ni have so many reasons to go 5 star all over this place and fractions of thoughts about why i wouldn't. those fractions, the bulk of which are carried by the food court railing ambiance, add up to one. and i won't insult matt because i liked him.\n\nwhen i return in may, i might just take the other half of the family because i can't go wrong on this one.", 
            "great steak!\nhad the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>... delicious. \nminimal sides as the vegas \"eating tour\" had me full, but definitely couldn't miss the dessert (chocolate cake, crumb cake and whipped cream). \na must-do next time you are in las vegas!", 
            "my first visit to a mastro's was this past weekend and they didn't disappoint.  my girlfriend and i had the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> (x2) and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  the steak? cooked and seasoned to perfection.  nice buttery taste to it even though it doesn't come out in a plate of butter (like that other steakhouse.. heehee).  the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>?  heaven on a dish.  it is definitely a must order the next time i go to a mastro's.", 
            "seems like i've been on a steak kick recently, which makes me realize that my stomach and wallet are inversely proportional. after visiting gordon ramsay and old homestead recently my gut has increased exponentially while my wallet is shrinking dramatically. mastros, of course, had the same effect.\n\nour party of four dined family-style and sampled the following:\n\na dozen oysters (kusshi and bluepoint). all were delicious but, personally, i prefer the smaller kusshi.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> was beautifully presented in a cylindrical stack with, perhaps, too much avocado, but contained plenty of fresh tuna and a variety of textures and flavors.\n \nocean club crab cake. there was very little filler, nice big chunks of lump meat, and a perfectly balanced tartar sauce.\n\nthe scallops were too rich and buttery and was drowning in sauce. the accompanying toast was deliciously crisp and cheesy.\n\nthe 22 oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, cooked medium-rare, was tender and had a decent amount of fat, as was to be expected. a solid steak, but not as mind-blowing as the beef from the top steakhouses around town.\n\n<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. a little dense with a rich, cheesey truffle flavor. pieces of crab were scarce, but there were plenty of gnocchi for the four of us to share.\n\n<mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>. 5 large legs, slightly warm, with clarified butter and lemon. each yielded plenty of tender meat.\n\nthat was plenty of food for all of us, but we couldn't leave without trying their infamous warm butter cake. it was large enough for each of us to get a few bites. it came with a ridiculously large side of fresh whipped cream. i was expecting the cake to have a very moist texture, but instead it was a bit more firm with a slightly crispy exterior. the flavor was as sweet and buttery as you would expect. as delicious as it was, it's not something that my arteries and heart can take too frequently.\n\nmastors is pricey, but not as pricey as other steak or seafood houses along the strip. the atmosphere isn't the greatest either. it is located in the center of a shopping mall, afterall. there's no dim, mood lighting. just the bright florescent  lights of the mall. the tree house thing looked cool, so request that if you have the chance. we sat just outside of it and it had all the appeal of eating at a food court.\n\nthere was also live entertainment in the lounge area when we dined. i had to do a double-take because the girl performing looked like aubrey o'day. i didn't stick around long enough to see if she had the voice or attitude to match.\n\ni'm not sure how this mastros compares to the ones in california that people rave about, but relative to vegas steakhouses it's a solid option. it's a step below the top ones in town, but is great for seafood and, of course, the butter cake.", 
            "been to two mastro's: costa mesa and vegas. both amazing food, but vegas is in a treehouse -- awesome! i've always wanted to dine in a treehouse!\n\nmastro's is my favorite steakhouse. mastro's ocean club was by far the most expensive dinner i've ever had (almost a grand including tips for two), but it was so @#$%^&!%$#! good! \n\nwhat we ordered:\n\n- cosmo with dry ice\n- mastro's signature seafood tower with caviar* and <mark>Lobster Cocktail</mark>\n- escargot with puff pastry\n- tomahawk (<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>)\n- <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>\n- dessert? i'll pass. i just want my steak and lobster mash!!\n\n* seafood tower with caviar was the main item that drove up the bill. (i think it was 200-300 just for that). it's definitely feasible to have a more affordable dinner at mastro's.\n\nwriting this review makes me wanna go back to vegas and order the tomahawk again. oh. my. gosh. sooooo amazing!!\n\nseafood tower: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gi-caiz_gg3h21pwranb4q?select=opezjjzr1ulqm-cn83ifrg#dtvcn9pnhwnehy8bq6xlfw",

            "while in vegas for a friend's birthday, we decided to have a nice dinner and settled on steak. after reading about mastro's, i made a reservation, and we were seated in the large wooden structure thing. screw it, i'm just gonna go straight to the steak.\n\nwhen our waiter mentioned that their special was an a5 grade 33oz. wagyu tomahawk, i was sold. it's basically a thick cut, <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, and i knew i was in for something special just by looking at it. the first thing that immediately caught my attention was the rim - it was humungadunga. normally, the rim just encircles the outer edge of about half the eye, but this rim was almost the same size as the eye! why is this such a big deal? of all the steak cuts, the rim of the ribeye is the absolute best tasting piece in the entire beef carcass. i always separate it from the rest of the ribeye so i can save it for last. the muscle fibers in the rim are very loosely bound, and marbling of ribeyes is second to none. what this means is that you have a piece of meat that's super tender (just as tender as a filet), super juicy, and super flavorful, which perfectly describes the wagyu tomahawk. each bite was a blast of rich and savory goodness. the juices coat your mouth in a sheen of happiness. there truly is nothing to criticize. the only thing i could wish for is that they serve just the rim as its own cut of steak.\n\nthe next time you're in vegas, forget the crappy frozen <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> at the buffets, and treat yourself to something really worth the trip and big bucks.", 
            "make no mistake, this place is awesome.  the service was excellent, the menu has lots of unique offerings (the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> are unreal).  everything was flavorful and prepared perfectly.  i had a <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>.  it was seasoned well and cooked to perfection.  it was not the best steak i have ever eaten, but it was up there.  the drinks are aggressively poured (for what they cost, they certainly should be). dessert was equally impressive and the attentiveness of the wait staff was some of the best i have ever seen.  the dining experience as a whole was in my top 5.  i very strongly recommend this place if you are seeking a top notch dinner in las vegas.  that said, be forewarned that it is also in the top 3 most expensive dinners i have ever had.  the entrees are not really that exorbitant, but when you tie in a side like <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> for $40 and multiple alcoholic beverages, it gets expensive in a hurry.  although expensive, the entire experience makes it worth every penny.", 
            "very nice steak and seafood restaurant with impeccable service. our waitress sam was wonderful and did a great job selecting a wine for us.\n\ni had a <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and my wife had  a baked sole dish. we shared <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, (awesome) and green beans (meh) with the couple with us and it was plenty for all of us. \n\nhad one of the best desserts i have ever had, butter cake... freaking awesome. yellow cake based with butter and cream cheese and god knows what else. i promise it is better than it sounds. comes with a big scoop of ice cream and fruit. way more than one person could (or certainly should) eat, so share!\n\ngreat upscale dining experience in a beautiful, unique architectural setting.", 
            "mastro's is a very good steak and seafood restaurant in the crystal's shopping mall next to aria on the second floor. \nit's best to make reservations ahead of time or you wait. \nservice was prompt and courteous. i enjoyed a delicate malbec (it doesn't give me migraine headaches like other wines do). my husband and i split a wedge salad that was perfectly mixed with blue cheese, cheddar cheese, bacon and onions. my husband really enjoyed the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and i couldn't finish the delicious artic char i was served. the double <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> was gargantuan and awesomely scrumptious, but the best part was ordering creme brulee' and to be served a giant wallop of real whipped cream bigger than the dessert portion!  simply delightful.", 
            "i love mastro's!  we went for our first anniversary dinner after having gone on our honeymoon last year. the food was so amazing we had to come back.  we were greeted at our table with 2 glasses of champagne to celebrate. we spilt the most delicious wedge salad and it was good. last year we had apps and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> as a side. those were so good they'll make you wanna slap your momma!  we were so full i am embarrassed to say we didn't even finish our steaks. this year we switched to gorgonzola mac & cheese...epic!  i had the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and my wife ordered the 12oz filet mignon.  both were the finest steaks we've ever had. you will never appreciate any other steak after that. mastros ruined steak for me, talk about melt in your mouth. our server mark was phenomenal and super attentive. a really nice guy. for desert they brought out the warm butter cake...wonderful!  mastros is the only place i would eat in my life if i had the choice. thank you  for a wonderful first anniversary dinner. go there!!!!", 
            "my favorite place to dine in las vegas!\n\n(1) service - i forgot his name but awesome, awesome server! best service ever. he was hot too! drools! 5 stars for amazing service and seating me with a hot server.\n\n(2) seafood tower - massive shrimp, king crab, lobster, three types of oysters, and massive mouth jizzy. \n\n(3) <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> - mouth jizz... must get! 5 stars\n\n(4) lobster mash potato - one of my favorite dishes. drenched in butter... yum! 5 stars\n\n(5) asparagus - well cooked! 5 stars!\n\n(6) bone marrow - 5 stars!\n\n(7) <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> - 5 stars\n\n(8) birthday chocolate cake - i got this for free... so sweet of them... but it wasn't my birthday... i think they gave it to the wrong person.\n\n(9) coffee - a little weak... i wanted a strong one... so i can get ready for the clubbb... yeahhhhh... woots!\n\noverall** yup! that was all for 2 people... haha! i eat a lot! massive bill... but worth every of my penny!", 
            "you can do a lot of interesting things in vegas.  i had no idea fine dining in a funky abstract treehouse was one of them.  mastro's is quite the experience -- from the structure itself, to the wondrous items and their presentations, to the exceptional and classy staff.  you salivate as you picture-perfect dishes being carried by.  \n\nthe seafood tower is a spectacle - double tiered dish with dry ice smoke surrounding it.  i have no idea how the waitstaff can carry that giant concoction.  it came to the table and shocked us at first sight.  the shrimp were the size of my fist, the <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> were monstrous, and everything was overwhelming.  if you can eat after that appetizer, then hats off to you!  \n\nas luck would have it, i was crazy hungry, so i went for the 22 oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>.  it came out on a plate sizzling at 400 degrees.  perfection!  medium rare to the t.  that was the second best ribeye i've ever had (first being v&a).  i wanted to pick up the bone and start gnawing.  \n\nsomeone else got the halibut cheek which also looked very unique and delicious.  i really wanted to order it.  alas, as a texan, ribeyes speak to my heart (on so many levels?)  \n\nthis is definitely one of classiest places that i've been to.  what an upscale vegas experience.", 
            "first off, the service was outstanding. as per my request, they were able to save us a table inside the tree house near the edge, so we had a nice view of the architecture around us. our server sam managed to be attentive and informative without being too intrusive and asking us how the food was every few seconds, which i thoroughly appreciated. \n\nusually i don't talk about the bread basket, but this one was pretty good. the bread was warm and soft, but waay too much for two people. on to the main courses: the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> was tender, juicy, and perfectly medium rare..kind of wish there was a bit more seasoning though. the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was just as tender and more to my liking, although the outside seemed pretty charred...\n\nafter we were done with the mains, we barely had any room left for dessert, but i kept reading reviews for the warm butter cake, so we ordered it to share. the cake came with a huge helping of whipped cream on the side and a big scoop of ice cream on top...naturally, we couldn't finish it and asked to have it wrapped up. the cake was moist and the layer of crunch outside from the caramelized sugar was great, but overall, it was too sweet. =(  \n\nwe definitely made a good choice coming here. the food and service was all really good. will definitely try to come back again next time we're in town.", 
            "i was out here celebrating my birthday for the second straight year (yes, it's clich\\u00e9 - i'm perfectly ok with that) with my baby brother. we wanted steak, but didn't necessarily want to spend an arm and a leg. well, we succeeded at the former, if not the latter, but we left very happy and very, very full.\n\nwe settled into the bar and i asked the bartender about the dry-iced martini. it was at that point i discovered the bar was much more about the fufu martinis rather than classic. i'm partial to the classics, so i was a bit disappointed. that said, that's e-me - i should have checked out the menu in advance, or read a couple more yelp reviews. (take note if you're looking for a classic cocktail here, you won't find it.) i wound up going with the on the menu manhattan, which was very good, but not great.\n\nnow it was time to settle into the real reason for going - meat. we had a bit of a conversation with the very friendly bartender about what was good and must-haves on the menu. we already knew we were having the bone marrow, which she did recommend. we talked steak and sides, when she insisted we have the brussel sprouts. now, i'm not much of a brussel sprout fan, but given the recommendation that was given i figured we had to have them.\n\nthe bone marrow came out and it was two huge bones. i could have slid down them - i'd have been a very happy man if i had. the marrow was plentiful and delicious. you won't have to scrape just to get a little, you'll be scraping just to get the last little bit of all that wonderful marrow goodness.\n\nnow for the steak. i did the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, which came out perfectly rare - if not maybe a touch too rare, which is very weird for me to say. that said, it was amazingly flavorful and near melt-in-your-mouth. and the brussel sprouts - well, i'm not a true convert yet, but if you keep serving me more like these i might change my ways.\n\nthen, on to dessert. a huge, and delicious, butter cake. we couldn't stop eating it despite the fact that we were absolutely stuffed.\n\nin the end, and for the money, i do think there are better steak experiences to be had on the strip. that said, you absolutely can't go wrong with a stop to mastro's.", 
            "i've only been to one steakhouse before this and i wasn't too impressed, but i decided to give this place a shot since our friends were really excited for some fine dining in vegas. \n\nour group of eight was seated at a round table underneath the massive open-air structure. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were so buttery and delicious. this was a table favorite and it was devoured in minutes. i honestly think the garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> would have probably tasted just as good and would have been much cheaper. \n\nthe 22oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was enormous. my friends and i were joking how maybe half the steak would just be bone, but it turns out we were sorely wrong .the bone was maybe 4-5 ounces and the rest of it was delicious, flavorful meat. i opted for medium rare, my friend opted for rare, and i think most of the table preferred the medium rare since it had more flavor although the rare meat was more tender. it really depends on your steak preferences.\n\nthe dessert was butter cake. the first couple bites i thought were way to sweet, but that's why it came with a side of heavy whip cream. top the dessert with the whip cream and it really tones down the sweetness.\n\nthe things that stood out the most was the ambiance and quality of food.", 
            "i've been to this place maybe about 3 times, and one of its sister locations in costa mesa about 3 times as well. both restaurants exude that high end feeling and you will leave feeling... well feeling awesome that you spent 50 bucks on a slab of meat. but that's not all.\n\nif you make an open table reservation they will always call you the day of to confirm and remind you that you are going to attend. one of the times i've been to this mastro's ocean club and they were fully committed, and suggested to look for a seat at the bar area, and then one of the waitress or hostesses asked if i would mind eating on the piano (they had live music that time) which i found it hilarious, a $1k+ grand piano with me eating on it. regardless i told her i would wait for a party at the bar to be seated but that was another time. \n\nyou're going to pay at least $70+ per person but the food along with the service makes it all worth it. every time i go to mastro's, the waiters/waitresses are always so nice, helpful, professional, and willing to answer any and all questions you may have about the menu. if you haven't been there before they will let you know the vastness of the menu and how they operate as a steakhouse/ocean club.\n\nmy reccemondations as far as mastro's ocean club in las vegas?\n\nbone-in fillet\n<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> (although the filet wins my money by a mile)\n<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>\ngarlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>\n<mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark>\nand their raw oysters - wherever it is from because it is super fresh\n\nif you go in on a special occasion like a birthday or a graduation, most of the time they'll give you a slice of chocolate cake as dessert and the most kick ass whipped cream you would have ever had the chance to have. yes it is just that good.\n\nhope you guys enjoy it as much as i do. after writing this review, i'm just vying to go back.", 
            "food and service is impeccable! my fianc\\u00e9 and i went and can't wait to go back! i had the filet and he had the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, both we great! their twice backed potato was too good to just consider it a potato and the king <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> on ice was delicious! we go to steak houses often everywhere we travel but this is definitely in the top for us.", 
            "so i am a huge fan of mastro's and frequent their costa mesa and newport locations. i gotta say that this was pretty close to the ca locations, minus a few minor details. from the pretzel bread to the seafood tower appetizer, i was pleasantly reminded of home sweet home (oc). the atomic horseradish is the perfect paring with your chilled seafood, and that is the perfect way to kick off you meal at mastro's. i ordered my usual <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and sides of <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, grilled asparagus and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> - all were pretty good. the finale aka warm butter cake, is where they finally dropped the ball. they brought it out and it was cold. now this is a dessert that you absolutely must eat piping hot, and considering i had just ordered a dinner for 9 people and 2 bottle of caymus, was not too thrilled at the anticlimactic ending to my meal. the service was great and i would definitely eat here again. maybe was just a minor miss on the dessert? anyways, mastro's remains my favorite steakhouse and i will definitely give it another shot next time i am in vegas.", 
            "what a great spot!\n\nwe made 9 pm reservations for dinner after the zarkana cirque du soleil show at the neighboring aria.  no vegas trip is complete without a nice dinner, and we couldn't have picked a better spot for what we were looking for that night: delicious food and wine in a classy, yet relaxed atmosphere.   located within the crystals shopping complex, you don't get amazing views of strip, but the environment still exudes class and modern decor.\n\nwe had the works.  a bottle of pinot shared among the three of us while we nibbled on the best damn bread assortment i've seen.  two salads: caesar and a wedge, standard fare and did not disappoint.  and then....drumroll....the entrees!  juicy, thick <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> for my two burly man-pals, who both only ate about half before conceding to the dish's fate as leftovers.  and for myself: perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, jumbo <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> sauteed in a rich butter sauce and served with a few parmesan-crusted crostinis.  crisp golden brown on the surface while tender and delicate within, the plate came with about 6 jumbo scallops, but try as i might, i couldn't finish the dish for lack of stomach space!  wonderful side pairings of garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and sauteed mushrooms to share.\n\nabsolutely no room for dessert.  it was a fantastic meal.", 
            "we were in vegas for a bachelorette party for one of my besties and decided on this place for our fancy dinner night. we had 11 girls and people ordered a variety of things from the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> to the bone-in steaks. this is one of those fancy places where you order just the protein and then sides are extra. here's the breakdown:\n\nbread basket - good. normally, i'm not a fan of loading up on carbs, but we were getting bottle service the night and i was already starving, so i had to put something in the stomach. i was pleasantly surprised at the freshness of the bread! so soft and slightly warmed.\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> - giant serving (probably enough for 2!). rich and creamy with actual chunks of lobster!\n\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> - good and buttery. it was a big serving size and i only finished probably half of it.\n\n<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> - good, but slightly under cooked according to my friend's order.\n\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> - i'm not really a fan of <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and these were okay. small pieces of lobster mixed in.\n\nsea salt & <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark> - pretty good! nice little break between bites of our main courses.\n\n<mark>Creamed Corn</mark> - pretty good! nice side dish without being overpowering.\n\nthe food was pretty good, but for a place of this caliber, i expected a lot more. they either under cooked or over cooked several steak orders, which had me thinking: what kind of steak house is this?!\n\nthe service was top notch at least and our bride-to-be got a special warm butter cake delivered to our table.\n\nwould i return? probably not.", 
            "this was actually my first time at mastros, and the food was delicious, although a bit on the salty side.\n\nfirst of all.. the bread was to die for.. my friends and i had to restrain ourselves from devouring two baskets of bread so we won't be too full for our meal.\n\nwe ordered a caesars salad split between three people, but it didn't come out until after our meal and sides came. i didn't think that was very professional, but everyone makes mistakes. \n\nwe got the cream corn and <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> for our sides. they were both to die for! i ordered the saut\\u00e9ed scallops which were delicious but a little too salty for my taste. my two friends ordered the filet mignon and the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, which they loved. \n\nwe also ordered two bottles of the argyle pinot noir, which our server recommended for us. it was wonderful.. not too sweet, not too dry. \n\nwe also informed our waiter that it was our friend's birthday, so at the end of our meal, they brought out an amaaaazing butter cake with a candle! \n\noverall, the experience was great, especially sitting in the nest! lol",

            "mastro's ocean club is a fine dining establishment located in the aria hotel and casino. the ambiance is set well, the architecture is particularly astounding, and the service is exquisite. our server, joe, was on his game. my water glass and wine glass never reached half empty (or half full). ordered the bone marrow, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, sauteed broccoli, gorgonzola mac and cheese, 22 oz. <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, and mastro's signature warm butter cake. \n\nbone marrow - holy donkey punching jesus this is astounding. i have never had bone marrow before but its alluring presence on the menu was enough for me to sample it. the bone marrow comes half charred on a split bone with a serving of toasted baguette to spread on. the flavor, the texture, the taste and everything about it was amazing. i will order this every time and you should as well.\n\n<mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> - hearty <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> with more crab than cake. in fact the cakes fall apart to the softest touch, the chunks of crab meat separating with ease as only a minimal amount of filler has been used. flavor and spice is more than enough to accent the cakes.\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> - oftentimes <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> comes heavily buttered, even in the most finest of dining establishment. butter is an easy thing to add to a dish to increase its flavor without actually improving on its originality and substance. however, mastro's <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> does not perpetuate this and, rather, has a full-bodied bisque with a generous portion of lobster inside. the thickness is akin to how a bisque should be.\n\nsauteed broccoli - opting to go a slightly healthier route with one of the dishes i was still impressed but of course, it's sauteed broccoli, and only so much can be done while keeping it true.\n\ngorgonzola mac and cheese - a perfect compliment to my <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and a hearty side at that. it's a shame our hotel fridge has a monitored scale with a restocking fee otherwise i would have had no issue taking the remainder of this with me.\n\n22 oz. <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> - one of the finer ribeyes i have had. a generous amount of fat and it was seared and salted well enough to make it exceedingly juicy. cooked to perfection (rare) with a cool red center while the black crust of searing on iron was still present. \n\nmastro's signature warm butter cake - fuck. that's amazing.\n\nthe servings sizes of sides are plentiful and the prices are what you'd expect at such an establishment. be wary of those giving mastro's a bad review due to price or service, such an establishment would be careful to hire only proven servers and i would wager that the reviewers themselves to be the standoffish party.",

            "this is top notch dining. located in crystals at aria on the 2nd level. five of us came to celebrate a birthday last night and we requested the \"tree house\". this is a wooden structure which almost floats in the air, very unique for sure. \n\nwe were seated in the center and were lucky enough to get paul as our waiter. paul is everything in a waiter you could ever ask for. knowledgeable, very attentive, funny and yet professional giving us excellent service during our meal. \n\nhe was helpful when selecting wines as well as explaining the menu. i ordered the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> and the 22 oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. i love seafood and was planning on the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> but couldnt resist the ribeye. our table split sides of gorgonzola mac & cheese, creamed spincach and gnocci with alaskan king crab. \n\nthe <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> was excellent. served in a dish with 2 sauces and dry ice it comes out smoking. it was about 10 large pieces of crab ($28). the ribeye was also very good ($58), although a tad to fatty for me. it had good marbling like a ribeye should but parts were a bit too fatty. 3 of us ordered our steaks medium rare and they all came out rare. beware they do tend to undercook  a bit, but we all finished them as the meat was so good. \n\nthe gorgonzola mac and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> ($14) were both really good. we were a little disappointed with the gnocci however ($33). i found very little king crab in the dish but the flavor was there. for dessert we ordered 3 of mastro's famous butter cakes which come with vanilla ice cream. \n\npaul was nice enough to personalize one of the plates with a \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate. the butter cakes were awesome (and quite large). they can easily be split  between two or three people. \n\nmastro's provided us an excellent meal with outstanding service. the steaks could have been cooked a little longer but with that being about the only flaw the 5 stars are well deserved.",

(pause) i myself took down the 22oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> cooked medium rare plus like a beast and enjoyed every single bite! once again mastro's was an a+! pictured below was the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>.",

            "we made reservations for 7:30 pm for a return visit for our annual visit vegas.  last year our service was so over the top, the food so good, and the unique ambiance made it a great meal. \n\nit was still a great, er good meal. we arrived at 7:20 for our party of seven reservations. both cabs got lost. \n\nwe were seated at 8:30. the management seemed unable to deal with people camping at the table. we suggested they offer to buy them a drink at the bar l get them off their butts and get out!!  once we were seated, we had the wonderful seafood tower. our wait staff was good, not great (like last year). examples is very pedestrian descriptions of the specials or main dishes. our waiter went through the list rote. our meals were deliverd together, but several times we had to ask for water, the bus staff made comments and interrupted conversations with their removal of plates. i think bus boys should not participate in table conversation, unless asked. \n\nmy <mark>Bone-In KC Strip</mark> steak, ordered charred medium rare was neither, and nobody askede if i was satisfied with the steak, which surprised me.  my steak wasn't charred and it was rare.  i know, some people say medium rare and really want medium. i know the difference. i like 120 to 130 degrees max. my steak was rare or actually cool and uncooked in the middle. i'm in the food business and actually run a meat wholesaler. my steak was just so-so, it had some tough parts and the undercooked aspect make me leave at least 30% of the meat on the plate. \n\nthe gnocchi and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> are worth the trip. \n\ni'm not sure how to avoid the hour wait for a table, but it was frustrating. \n\nlast year it was a 5 star meal, but due to average service, the long wait, my steak being undercooked and average quality, it was a 3 star night, and it was over $1,000.  ouch.", 
            "my first thought when seated was, \"it's a good thing all of these world class stores aren't doing any business because it sure takes the edge off a high-dining experience along the mall food court railing\". our table felt like a satellite location for a sparkling contemporary version of daddy's classic steak house. and we weren't even seated in the satellite (you'll get it if you visit). it just seemed surreal for a \"room\" with such distinguishing attributes. i won't hold that against them, much.\n\nit was just my son and i that visited to celebrate his 21st. matt was our dining guide and he was fun. not like, \"let's have a vegas night!\", fun. just that he carried his demeanor well and kept his smile on. he was very, very consistent in that his presentation to each of the three tables nearby was identical, and specific. he was meticulous to ensure accuracy and satisfaction.\n\nwe were completely impressed by the young lady and gentleman entertaining the room. we later learned that it was their first night at mastro's. their acoustics in that challenging environment are absolute perfection and their talents are superior.  \n\nwe went light on the openers which were supplemented by an abundant variety of stellar bread choices. my son is all-american in his need for a calamari appetizer. it was the best we'd ever had, and maybe will. i had the <mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark> and, again, maybe the best complete salad i've ever enjoyed. my son ordered the <mark>Bone-In KC Strip</mark> a little less than medium and he dubbed it the crown jewel of his steak experiences. he couldn't finish it and he finishes everything. i asked for the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. matt helped me herd descriptives into a perfectly cooked finish. i'm still thinking it's the fact that i live in colorado, where even onions and garlic sometimes have difficulty offering flavor, but if it's possible to have too much natural flavor in a steak, it happened. i'm taking accountability on that one, because it's not mastro's fault i live at high altitude. this was a huge steak and i hardly dented it. we sided up a strong contender for best garlic mashed, which we carried out more of than we ate. so we get this this lovely shopping bag, consistent with the elevated neighborhood, to carry our midnight snack down the strip with. \n\ni have so many reasons to go 5 star all over this place and fractions of thoughts about why i wouldn't. those fractions, the bulk of which are carried by the food court railing ambiance, add up to one. and i won't insult matt because i liked him.\n\nwhen i return in may, i might just take the other half of the family because i can't go wrong on this one.", 
            "mastro's where to begin. located in the crystals mall just outside the main entrance to aria, sister restaurant to scottsdale & beverly hills' location. we embarked on night one in vegas.  so let's start with the drinks at the piano bar a very nice opening where a piano man and gorgeous singer belt out a few tunes prior to dinner where we were seated in the tree house so to speak.  bright open and airy we were treated service wise very nicely.  8 tonight and waiters and staff were brisk and efficient.  the standard push for bottled water well you get the drill. a high end steak house and fish place that needs no preamble.\n\ngreat start bread basket with pretzel breads and such excellent! \n\ni'll run it down.  <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> is a highlight with the dry ice making the fog come off the shrimp it's an eye catcher.  asked for horseradish on the side oh boy the hottest dam thing i've ever consumed. one drop in the sauce made my dry stuffed nose wince and my head was cleared like a nitrate ammonia pack from my football days. yea baby it was good! a <mark>Lobster Cocktail</mark> was also equally outstanding.  multiple salads were also ordered and shared from a chopped house salad, a cesar salad and beefsteak tomatoes & mozzerella.  skip the last one. \n\nentrees: 7 steaks one piece of fish.\nevery single steak was absolutely delicious from the bone in filet to the strip to the bone in <mark>Bone-In KC Strip</mark> there were outstanding. one was cooked or shall i say undercooked and the handled it not only by fixing the dish but removing it from the bill.  the hawaiian big eyed tuna was horrible only way to describe it. sorry but another get this out of here moments. \n\nsides: all very generous in size and easily splittable among the group 4 sides way too much for 8 people.\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> a die for moment outstanding\nsauteed mushrooms yummy\ngorgonzola mac & cheese another to die for moment\n\n<mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> excellent.\n\nall and all a fine dining experience with the drawback of a couple of 1 undercooked steak and one bad entree both removed from bill make this a nice experience.", 
            "this was my first time trying mastro's and i'm glad it was in vegas.  and let me tell you, everything here was expensive.  i probably won't be coming back but i'm glad i finally got to try it.\n\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> - it was actually pretty good!  the lobster taste and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> really mixed in well together.  i've heard that this dish wasn't as good in the costa mesa one\n\nbone-in-filet - very tender and very good!\n\nbone-in-<mark>Bone-In KC Strip</mark> - i loved it\n\ni loved everything that was bone in.  i didn't get to try the bone-in-ribeye because it was too big\n\nwe also got a side of asparagus which is like $10 (not worth it).  although it was good, it tasted like i can cook this at home for so much cheaper, and it would taste the same.  nothing special at all", 
            "being a vegas local, living on the strip, i get to try amazing vegas eats weekly. i must say by far mastros is a step above the rest & my personal favorite restaurant on the strips.\n\nservice is top notch, as good as it gets! some of my fav dishes are the scallops, <mark>Bone-In KC Strip</mark>, hamachi, <mark>Petite Filet</mark> mignon, & of course the amazing buttercake dessert. must try."

            "the las vegas-mastro's ranks among our top dining experiences anywhere in the world.  on this labor day weekend visit, our initial disappointment, of not being seated in the unique & always fascinating \"tree-house\", was quickly extinguished by shauna, our culinary captain extraordinaire, menu \"tour guide\" and libation/wine aficionado.  turns out... our \"terrace\" seating near the piano bar was as enjoyable as it was entertaining, resulting in yet another \"positively outrageous\" fine dining adventure.\n\nshauna introduced us to mastro's participation in \"las vegas restaurant week\", a worthy nationwide charity drive to raise money for & donate meals to 3-square food bank in southern nevada.  she offered a special 4-course dinner deliciously flanked by beefsteak tomato & onion salad, an 8 oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> & garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and key lime pie all for a reasonable price, part of which was ultimately donated for a worthy cause.  \n\nas there were 5 of us on this visit, the aforementioned special meal was joined by collection of our menu favs and shauna's recommendations. she perfectly paired our appetizers & meals with wonderful riesling, cabernet, and sauvignon blanc.\n\nsooo, included in the culinary delight were: the legendary seafood tower (ohhh yes!!), <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (best in class!), <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark> (delightful), <mark>New York Strip</mark> (absolute perfection), <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> (sweet & outa this world), saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> (oh yeah!), <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (buttered and seasoned to perfection), saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms ( a fav of favs), <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> (these aren't yo mama's sprouts, believe it!), 1 lb. <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> (huge), triple chocolate layer cake (nothing but delish), and...(drum roll)... the mastro's signature warm butter cake!!...once again to die for!!!\n\nwithout fail, and to paraphrase the writings of t. scott gross,... mastro's was again a \"positively outrageous\" dining experience where the culinary expectations were always far exceeded.  shauna's unsurpassed service & superior guidance was unexpected, delivered-at-random, fun, entertaining, and so very memorable!  it doesn't get any better!", 
            "i have been here 2 times in the last year  the staff is freely and very attentive. this time we got to sit in the bird house which is really cool.  \n\nthe first time was great had the <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark>*24oz, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> soup & heirloom tomato & burrata, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, grilled asparagus but the best part was the dessert that mastro's signature warm butter cake is by far the best dessert you will every taste.  \n\nso on our second visit we wanted to see if they could repeat it.  again we got the <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark>*24oz - it really is very good and enough for two to share.  we got the blue cheese wedge and the  for the sides this time we stuck to the same <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> but added the <mark>Colossal Onion Rings</mark> )which are fantastic) and the grilled <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>(i have to admit these were not bitter at all.)  then came the end that mastro's signature warm butter cake was even better then i remembered its so gooey it melts in your mouth, you have to have it warm because we have stopped by just got the cake to go and it was server cold s not the same.  \n\ni recommend to anyone weather you live in vegas or visiting try this place you will not be disappointed.",

            "my hubby and i celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary here with my daughter and parents. we started off with mastro's seafood tower. you can create your own seafood tower to your liking and size. our seafood tower had shrimp, <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> and oysters. we all enjoyed especially my daughter; the cool dry ice effect and seafood tower presentation. the seafood was fresh and the oysters tasted amazing. my hubby had the <mark>Lemon Sole</mark>, my mom had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, my dad had the <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark>, i had <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> and my daughter got to sample a little bit of everything. we shared two sides family style of their signature <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (love this combo) and the other side dish of <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>. the seafood and chicken entrees and sides were served hot, fresh and perfectly seasoned. at the end, they complimentary served us their yummy signature warm butter cake dessert with vanilla ice cream and added happy anniversary wish which was a nice added personal touch. we had a wonderful time and food experience on our first visit here, and the service was friendly and excellent."

            "my boyfriend and i came here with his parents and the first point i'll make to get your attention is that our bill came out $450. now that i've got your attention.\n\nservice: one word excellent. i'd like to start off by saying that i came here for my 21st birthday and you know how usually you'll mention it to restaurants in hopes of getting something free and they'll come out with some weak bite sized dessert. my boyfriend's parents were the one who mentioned it and i quickly got a happy birthday and i expected nothing of it after. but for dessert i actually got a full on, very generous portion of a piece of chocolate cake (with raspberries!). it had come while i was in the bathroom so i wasn't expecting the waiter to relight it again but he actually did! the waiters were very nice, they made jokes and conversation (not just about food but where we were from, etc) they really knew their stuff, like not just knew what the specials were but they were very knowledgeable about their menu.\n\nfood: for starters we ordered escargot, chilled seafood, and <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>. the escargot was probably the disappointment of the evening. i've had much better elsewhere. there was just no taste or not a great taste. it wasn't gross or anything but i've just basically tasted better marinated or sauced escargot. for the chilled seafood, you're allowed to pick however many pieces you want and what seafood you want on it. it came in this platter that had dry ice in it. the shrimp were so plump and juicy. the crab was the best part though. i don't even know how to describe it but my boyfriend and i were fighting for the last pieces, just popping them into our mouths one by one. \n-<mark>Rack of Lamb</mark>: so juicy! it was probably the best lamb i've ever had. the taste was there, it was perfectly cooked. \n\ndessert: we ordered their signature cake and it was very unique. i don't think i\"ve ever tasted anything like it but i wasn't raving about it as much as the rest of my table were. it tasted like butterscotch or toffee angel/sponge cake. i couldn't really put my foot on what it was, it was just so different. \n\nbathroom: this is actually the first bathroom i've been to where it had a bathroom attendant who handed you towels. they had tampons and other amenities on the counter. she opened and closed the door for me. it's too bad i didn't have my wallet to tip her but she was very nice. \n\nview: where we were seated, you could basically look out into the mall and people watch. \n\nmy boyfriend and i will definitely be back to this chain, maybe for an anniversary.", 
            "my wife and i celebrated her recent birthday here on monday evening 10/25/10 and enjoyed and amazing dinner that far exceeded our highest expectations. this new outpost of mastros is romantic and elegant with all of the true hallmarks of five star dining. \nwe have previously been to mastros in beverly hills and i much preferred this location as food and service were flawless as we've come to expect with the added touch of refinement and class that mastro beverly hills seems to lack with the nightclub atmosphere and hollywood infused scene. \n\nthe food:\n\nappetizer:\n\nseared <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> -  perfectly seared and prepared in a garlic cream sauce. accompanied by 2 garlic toasted bread crisps. delicous.\n\nentrees:\n\n<mark>Petite Filet</mark> (medium) - hers - simple but perfect. mastro's signature entree and they do it to perfection\n\n<mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> (medium rare) - mine -  i love lamb above all other meats and this is one of the best i can ever remember having. bold but not gamey it flavor.\n(jiraffe in santa monica is a close 2nd.)\n\nsides:\n\nsauteed mushrooms w/ onions  - sweet & earthy. the perfect compliment to tender filet & lamb when combined with mastro's fries. \n\nsea salt shoestring fries (no vinegar) - crisp and salty which just the right amount of texture.\n\ndessert - \n\nchocolate birthday cake - brought out complimetary. nothing special but a nice birthday gesture. \n\nwarm butter cake ala mode - you simply have to get this! \nno meal at mastro's would be complete without it. my wife talked about this for days before our meal and reminisced about it for days after. it's simply the best enormous warm, buttery sugar cookie you've ever had paired with the smoothest vanilla bean ice cream you can imagine.\n\n i have to say we left very impressed with our mastro's las vegas experience. it definitely raises mastro's to our favorite special occasion restaurant from now on (just not the beverly hills location.)with food, service and atmosphere this wonderful you just can't go wrong. \n\nnext up for us is mastros in thousand oaks.",

            "party of 8 on a tuesday night.\ninteresting set up - there is a part of the restaurant that looks like a large wooden hornet's nest.  not sure what that's all about.  \n\nservice was impeccable from the hostess to the main server to his assistants.  everything was prompt, polite and timed well.  we were not rushed out even though we were one of the last parties to leave. \n\nfood:\ni ordered the gorgonzola mac and cheese $12 and the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> $48.  the mac and cheese was a little disappointing - very little flavor and it was dry,  very dry.  i had read that this was a great side dish so i was sad when it wasn't very palatable.  the portion is huge - consider sharing it if you do.  it easily fed our entire table.  i asked for the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> medium rare and it came out closer to medium.  regardless, the flavor was very smooth, not gamey.  the outside was a little too charred, but the rest of it was quite good.  it came with mint jelly, which was very tasty.  we also had a heirloom tomato and burrata salad $12 which was a very generous portion - the tomatoes were sweet and juicy.  the table got the seafood tower (have no idea how much that was but it was worth it).  this was friggin amazing.  honestly.  there were kumamoto oysters, fresh dungeness crab, snow <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>, humongous shrimp, great big lobster claws.  all fresh and tender meat.  it didn't require sauce.  none of it was briny or sandy.  so delicious and whatever we paid, i don't care.  it was unbelievable. other people in our party got the arctic char \"oreganato\" style, <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>, seared scallops and halibut.  every dish was served with mushrooms, asparagus, green beans and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (this had to have crack in it b/c <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> never tasted so good.)  no one had a single complaint and everyone finished what they ordered.  by this time, we're all about to pass out from food coma, but we insisted on the butter cake.  if you come here, no matter what you order, you must save room for this signature dessert.  i can't even describe it but it is amazing.  it comes out warm, w/ freshly made whipped cream and vanilla ice cream.   must.  must.  must have.  \n\noverall, great experience.  cost us a total of $1400 for 7 people.  you do the math.", 
            "it looks like it's all been said before, so i'll keep this short (as much as i can manage) and sweet.  \n\nimpressive digs: the sculptural treehouse dining room is a gem.  the bar is impressive (a two story shelf of bottles).  \n\nthe service is absolutely top notch: when we arrived for our 8:30 pm reservations, the hosts apologized but there was going to be a twenty minute delay.  we weren't bothered at all by the wait, but we were still given glasses of complimentary champagne--and we were treated to the restaurant's signature warm butter cake for dessert.  i have absolutely no complaints about the delay in getting seated.  mastro's handled a difficult situation appropriately, and in my opinion, went above and beyond for myself and the other guests that were also seated late.\n\nmy boyfriend and i went all out for dinner and ordered the seared ahi appetizer as well as the hamachi with fried onions.  please, oh please make sure you get this.  i've never seen anything like it before.  the perfectly fried onions melt on your tongue like butter, and the hamachi was perfect.  what an amazing combination.\n\nwe ordered the bone-in 12 oz filet and the 22 oz <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> with a side of gorgonzola mac & cheese and <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>. \n\nthe proteins were cooked perfectly and were absolutely delicious, but the stand out dish on the table was the flippin' amazing mac & cheese.  we talked about it at the restaurant, as we were leaving the restaurant, while we were next door at the aria casino, on our flight home, and ever since we've been back home.  they are out of this world.  we were so sad that we weren't able to take home the leftovers.\n\ndessert: what hasn't been said about the warm butter cake already?  just get it already.\n\nthis place is spendy--and totally worth every penny.", 
            "first off, the service was outstanding. as per my request, they were able to save us a table inside the tree house near the edge, so we had a nice view of the architecture around us. our server sam managed to be attentive and informative without being too intrusive and asking us how the food was every few seconds, which i thoroughly appreciated. \n\nusually i don't talk about the bread basket, but this one was pretty good. the bread was warm and soft, but waay too much for two people. on to the main courses: the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> was tender, juicy, and perfectly medium rare..kind of wish there was a bit more seasoning though. the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was just as tender and more to my liking, although the outside seemed pretty charred...\n\nafter we were done with the mains, we barely had any room left for dessert, but i kept reading reviews for the warm butter cake, so we ordered it to share. the cake came with a huge helping of whipped cream on the side and a big scoop of ice cream on top...naturally, we couldn't finish it and asked to have it wrapped up. the cake was moist and the layer of crunch outside from the caramelized sugar was great, but overall, it was too sweet. =(  \n\nwe definitely made a good choice coming here. the food and service was all really good. will definitely try to come back again next time we're in town.", 
            "amazing restaurant! we had <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark> and bone marrow for appetizer. both were superb! ribeye and <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> for main course were absolutely delicious. the atmosphere was very inviting. the only draw back was the location in the mall. will come back here every time  were in vegas.", 
            "for starters i really wanted to give this place a great review because the food was good, but after receiving my bill i just can't do it.\n\nour total bill came up to $243.23. that's not my complaint. my complaint is that we left a cash tip and when we saw the charge on the card, it was for $291.88. i'm glad i kept my receipt.\n\nthis prompted a call from me to the restaurant today to find out why there was an additional $47.00 charged to my card without disclosing it to me. the manager told me that the company they use automatically adds a 20% gratuity to the bill. \n\nthis was not disclosed to us by the waitress. it was not disclosed on our receipt. in fact, when i called, he said they receive that complaint at least 5 times a day, as if that's the normal order of business. fix it if people are complaining. you have no right to charge them an additional 20% without disclosing this before  they eat.\n\ntips are voluntary, not mandatory unless disclosed. i leave my tips in cash and i always cross out the tip line on the receipt.  the money isn't the issue,its the principle that they have no right to take my money without my permission. that is basically theft. \n\nso now, i have to wait 2-3 business days for the additional $47 to be refunded to my card, which means i won't see my money until tuesday or wednesday, since we ate there friday night. other than this absurd experience with my bill, here is a review on the food.\n\n1) the customer service is great except for not disclosing that i'll be charged an additional 20% even if you leave a cash tip.\n\n2) the  <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> were good, but both my wife and i had a small piece of shell. nothing worth complaining about.\n\n3) my wife had the blackened ribeye. it was delicious.\n\n4) i had <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark>. it was delicious.\n\n5) twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> was good.\n\n6) gorgonzola mac & cheese was good.\n\n7) <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> was good.\n\n8) calamari was just ok.\n\n9) the complimentary bread was mostly hard except for the pretzels. i don't mind a mix of breads, but when the majority are hard, its just not for us. \n\noverall, the food was good, but we will not be going back until the change they policy of charging people an additional 20% without their knowledge.\n\nif you eat here pay cash.", 
            "i was back to vegas with my work team. first time at mastro's ocean club, a restaurant in the middle of crystal mall. we booked dinner reservation for 9:45 pm for 6 on sunday may/18/14 after the show. i arrived 7 mins early, but our table was not ready and we were seated 10:10 pm (empty table needs to set up for 6). our waiter was very tentative and recommend us the seafood platter.\nthe alaskan red king <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> & the jumbo <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> were awesome. \nmy <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> was cooked medium rare as i requested on a super hot plate. perfect!. the rest of the food and side dishes were great. the only less desirable thing was by the time we got our main course it was 11:40 pm at night. \nfor sure it was a bit pricey, our bill came to $1200 usd for 6 of us.\noverall, it was a good experience.\nmaybe we will try again an earlier dinner time when we have a chance again.", 
            "i brought clients here on a thursday evening for dinner around 800 pm. i recommend reservations since  the place gets busy. my clients who arrived from denver around a year ago and never experienced mastro's previously so i knew they were in for a treat.\n\nwe started off with drinks at the table  once we were  seated and were brought the awesome bread basket -  i indulged in the pretzel bread yum! we ordered a few appetizers - scallops, <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> and ordered our starter salads. i opted for just the 1/2 salad of the <mark>Iceberg Wedge</mark> - it's plenty large and so yummy. for my main entree i went for he <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> and we shared several twice cooked potatoes and cream spinach. everything was spectacular and the service was stellar! my lamb was cooked to perfection and  my clients were impressed as i expected. the only con was nobody had room for buttercake!\n\ni received a telephone call from mastrro's the following day thanking me for my business which again is so out of the box. i'm happy to see even with the change of ownership that nothing has changed here!", 
            "so as we walk into this place i was very skeptical to think that they would produce good food because on the outside all you see if the tree house and you kind of don't understand how to get in here but then we walked in and it finally made sense.we were celebrating our cousins birthday so there was four of us.\n\nso let's start with appetizers we had the <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> which here they were your typical <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> nothing special but still tasted petty good.\n\nbone marrow!! i'm telling you it's the business here! they were served with mini toasted bagettes buttered on the grill and the little salad they had on the side was an awesome pairing.i would definitely order it again yummy!\n\nso the waiter recommended that we try the 33oz wagyu tomahawk ribeye and i'm glad we ordered this steak. and for 88 bucks i expected another mediocre steak but boy was i wrong. i asked the waiter when the steak came out if i needed any sauces for this steak and i was thrown off on how he immediately said no trust me eat it as is.. the most awesome steak i've had in my life so far..i was so satisfied from first bite to finish and now look to have this steak on a regular.my wife also agreed and sister and cousin felt that was a phenomenal steak! thank you so much for the experience\n\nour cousin and sister had the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> and for me i'm not too much of a lamb guy but they insisted that i try it and i was amazed because normally when i eat lamb it's too gamy for me but this was an awesome prepared lamb chop so thank you for that because it totally changed my perspective on lamb.\n\nas for the sides that we enjoyed with our meal we had <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and asparagus and cream corn.they went with our meal and i will say my favorite thing was the cream corn and the recommended lobster mash felt like it was just your simple mash potatoes and gravy with lobster on top..still it was delicious\n\nsince we were celebrating a birthday or waiter gave us the also recommended butter cake on the house which was very nice and i think the dessert is not as good as they say. but we all enjoyed it overall the steak is what i will come back for it was such a great meal.", 
            "we couldn't make our initial reservation and was disappointed but when we checked in to the aria and noticed it was located in the crystal shops, we decided to have a late dinner after shopping. \n\nthe ambiance was unique, in a good way. our server daniel gave us exceptional service - he was very attentive and accommodating. we ordered the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark>, scallops and the gorgonzola mac n cheese! everything was cooked to perfection and well seasoned aka tasty. \n\nwe were not disappointed and happy we were able to experience mastro's ocean club before leaving vegas.", 
            "has 7:45 reservations, arrived at 7:30 and was sat promptly. our server dalin was great and made sure we had everything we wanted. the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> was excellent and the lobster mash was delicious. we started with the calimari which was lightly breaded and very juicy rings. save room for the buttercake desert. enough for 2 and tastes great with the fresh whipped cream they serve with it. overall, great place to eat dinner for steak and seafood. great atmosphere and service.", 
            "we went last night as a party of seven for a farewell dinner before i head to the middle east.  we requested the tree house and a round table and it was perfect.  the service all night was outstanding, water glasses never got less than half empty.  we all ordered apps, salad/soups, main course and dessert.  the escargot was great, very garlicky and the <mark>Sauteed Shrimp</mark> were excellent.  the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was good, but you could really taste the anchovy, if you don't like anchovies, stay away.\n  i had a bone in filet and it was the best, most melt in your mouth steak i have ever had.  all the steaks, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, scallops and lobster were great.  the only critique i have is that my father's <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> was quite under done.  we should have sent it back, but he refused.  overall, a great place for fine dining, bring your $$$$.", 
            "one of the top 3 restaurants in vegas! third time coming here this year and i have never been disappointed. service from the waitress was on point and she was very thorough with explaining the specials on the menu. the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> is probably the best i've ever had along with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.  i had the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> as my main course which was amazing. <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> as a side is brilliant also. the one thing you cannot leave this restaurant without ordering is the legendary butter cake!!", 
            "mastros you were very disappointing. we were very excited to give this place a try because of the reviews that were given. \n\nfirst off the service was horrible. and keep in mind i'm not asking for you guys to bend over backwards to keep us happy, but the attitude needs a lot of improvement from the host to the server. \n\ni didn't keep that in mind for long because we were here for the food anyway and i thought the food will make up for it. we order the hamachi appetizer, which was the only decent tasting dish. we ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> and scallop. they were all just super basic dishes. it was literally just a protein with no sauce whatsoever! i could have done this at home and this would have tasted better at a local bjs. i expected much better from you guys. \n\nthen when we were about to leave i asked for a box so i could take the bread to go so that we could snack on it later. i got attitude and was asked twice am i sure i did not want to take the courses to go. there's a reason why we didn't ask for box to go and we obviously thought it was not good enough to take it to go, and i understand why our server gave us attitude. he thought we were wasteful, but the food sucked so just leave us alone and don't ask twice with an attitude. \n\ni would skipped this place if you're in vegas, you can find much better places to eat around here. i understand sometimes it sucks to be working on a holiday or the weekend, but keep in mind we all work too and we spend good money to have a good meal out here too. we don't deserve any of this nasty attitude or food.", 
            "i've had a number of people recommend mastro's in cities across the country, it wasn't until recently i realized there was a location right here at home. oddly enough i was familiar with the space, but never put two and two together. it's the bird's nest, the unmistakable structure in the crystals.\n\nwe were started with a huge bread basket. all of which was fresh and delicious. i also had the strawberry mule ($15), which was a refreshing twist on the moscow mule.\n\nif i'm being honest, it was the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> ($28) that swayed me to try mastro's. it's my favorite crab and this was scrumptious. all the flavor, but without the fuss. it is served over dry ice so the presentation is rather striking.\n\nwith \"ocean room\" in the name i had to try the fish. i was tempted by the halibut on special, but i chose the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> ($49). it was a huge filet, that was moist and flaky. surprisingly, their turf seems to be just as good as their surf, the husband had the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> ($49) and it was fantastic. i really like that the preparation is simple, just properly seasoned to allow the flavor of the meat to shine. we went for decadence when selecting our sides. i had to try the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> ($33) and the gorgonzola mac & cheese ($14) piqued his interest. both were rich, creamy and gooey. the crab in the gnocchi was too delicate for this dish it was overpowered by the creamy sauce and the bold truffle flavor. both were mighty tasty, however.\n\nwe ate until we could eat no more, and there was a bunch leftover. rarely do we have leftovers to box up, but it seemed like we hadn't even touched our sides. the portions are quite large and will satisfy the heartiest of appetites. we were much too full to attempt dessert. their famous butter cake will have to wait. service was attentive; overall, a really great experience. it's nice to have another option for seafood in the desert.", 
            "mastro's never disappoints.\n\nbut their ocean club locations, in my opinion is the better than their \"steak house\" locations, because the ambiance is quieter and more enjoyable. \n\nthis is our second time visiting this location, and both times we have left extremely happy and full.\n\nthe first visit we didn't make reservations, but they were able to accommodate since it was a monday, this visit we made reservations, but it was on a monday as well, so they weren't busy anyway.\n\nthe staff was very helpful and provided excellent service; never had to ask for our water to be refilled and were always attentive asking if we were doing okay. \n\nfood: we started the meal off with escargot and bone marrow. both items were very delicious. mastro's is honestly the only restaurant where their marrow is enjoyable because it is cooked to the point where there is zero blood, i don't know if that is the correct way to cook marrow, but that's my personal preference. my boyfriend loves their escargot. it is cooked, buttered, and seasoned perfectly. as for our entree we shared their colorado <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> as well as their saut\\u00e9ed spinach. both items were cooked excellent as well. to end the night we ordered their famous warm butter cake. in all honesty, their butter cake is the main reason we love mastro's. there isn't anything like it. the warm, sweet, soft cake paired with the vanilla ice cream just go so well together. \n\noverall, we love mastro's and anytime there is a location we are staying at, we make it a goal to check that location off the list. so far we have been to the newport beach and beverly hills location here in socal, and the location in chicago. it is so good, how can you not!",

            "mastro's ocean club is a gem that you cannot miss next time you're on the strip.  located in the newly designed city center, just look for the beautifully designed \"tree house\", which hangs high above the ultra chic boutiques in crystals that only the richest of the rich can actually shop in.  be sure to request a table inside the tree house...it's where all the cool kids sit. \n\nmastro's is not cheap, but then again, nothing in vegas is.  in any case, it's worth every penny because the food is outstanding.  i started off with a very rich and tasty new england <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark>.  for my entree, i went with the porcini mushroom crusted <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with fried spinach.  it was light but delicious!! perfect for lunch.  for the side dish, what else but the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>! i'm not talking about lobster flavored <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  no, no, not at mastro's.  i'm talking about over a pound of lobster mixed in the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  it was soooo good and was big enough that all four of us could enjoy it with plenty to spare.  although we were happily stuffed, our waiter brought out their signature butter cake with fresh whipped cream on the side for dessert; with his compliments (a very nice touch, which only further highlighted the tremendous service that we had during our entire meal). i highly recommend getting this dessert no matter how full you are. we all loved it.\n\ni should note that the cocktails were also great.  make sure you get one of their signature martinis, which comes with dry ice on the bottom of the glass that makes the drink bubble and emit smoke.  pretty cool. \n\nalthough i was able to get a table for four for lunch on a saturday with ease through opentable, that won't last long because the restaurant only opened up 2 weeks ago and the buzz is still building.  soon, mastro's will one of the hottest tables in vegas so get in while you can.", 
            "delicious! we came for \"linner\" and i just wish i was hungrier! at morel's in the palazzo, we met the most amazing waiter and totally chatted it up with him. he let us know that he also works at mastro's ocean club so we also had to go visit him there...\n\nthis restaurant is gorgeous to look at and basically looks like a tree house with the crystal's shopping area of city center. it's gorgeous!\n\nwe started with amazing cappuccinos in the bar area since our favorite waiter, dion, was not quite ready yet. i noticed that a cocktail that one girl in the bar was drinking was \"smoking\"... i think they put dry ice in it for effect!\n\nwhen we were seated for lunch, we ordered the fried onion strings as an appetizer and the escargot. the bread including \"pretzel bread\" was a great appetizer too. the onion string serving size was huge and could have fed about 8 people. the escargot were in amazing sauce that i dipped my bread into afterward! \n\nthen, i ordered the cobb salad that came with a generous serving of huge prawns; it was delicious! he had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with the light bread crumb preparation and it was also amazing! we also shared the house <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> that included scallions, bacon, etc mixed in and were rich and delicious. \n\nwhat a fabulous late lunch/early dinner on the way to the airport! it was tough to leave vegas after an amazing meal like that though!", 
            "let me preface by saying we're here for the architecture. as such, it's a 5 star \"treehouse\" experience in a magnificently creative space. i felt like we were dining in a modern interpretation of a jack and the beanstalk tree house above superman's fortress of solitude. enough imagery, onward to the food review.\n\nthe <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was amazing, the cod was very good; but the blackened halibuts were overdone (even the one we had specified medium rare). we also had <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, a <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, and a salad - all done very well. sides of <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and mushrooms were also on cue.\n\nas such,  we made no mention of the less than perfect preparation of the halibut. yet, a dessert arrived at the conclusion of our dinners, compliments of the house, as if the chef could read our minds. maybe this is the real superman's fortress of solitude!", 
            "yes i know i am the only person on here to give them 3 stars but please hear me out for my reasoning behind all this. \n\non saturday, i had made reservations for a party of two at 730pm. when he arrived at 720pm, it was not really busy nor was it a ghost town in there. the hostess stand said it would be a moment as they got our table ready and for us to take a seat at the bar, enjoy a cocktail or two and they will get us. \n\nduring our 30 minute wait (yes maybe they were short staffed, not ready yet etc.... which i am ok with) they sat multiple tables of walk-in's and a few reservations of small 2-4 tops. (i know this because a few sat at the bar whom we spoke to and others i over heard when i stood by the hostess stand to wait to check on my table. off to a bad start..... \n\nanyway, we had a nice table overlooking the garden down stairs in the back of the restaurant. all the back-waiters were very prompt and professional with regards to keeping the water glasses full, serving the bread, clearing the table from the right and serving from the left etc... (after working in this industry for years, i get picky about this crap at high end restaurants) the server was pretty on the ball and friendly but a little to relaxed with us. (yes we are young and eating at a high end restaurant, i am ok with that)\n\non to the food, below is a list of what we ordered and what i thought about it: \n\ncalamari app: lightly breaded with light seasoning. dipping sauce complimented it very well. \n\nfillet mignon: very tender and medium rare is more of rare. but it is better to under cook the steak then burn the hell out of it. very tender, cut with your fork status. \n\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>: parmesan crusted.... a little on the very fishy side for my taste which overcame the rest of the flavors\n\ncream of spinach: very creamy and just was not my style. girlfriend liked it though.\n\nsea salt/<mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark>: these shoestring cut fries were epic! yes.... of everything i ate, i was most impressed by the large basket of $10 fries. \n\nwarm butter cake: once again.... this was the main reason we went here for my birthday and because the other half loves this dessert more than she loves me. :)\n\nmultiple layer chocolate birthday cake: now to be honest, this was what saved mastro's from getting the dreadful 2-star rating from me. in my reservation, i had noted \"birthday\" but no one had seemed to see it. hell, we even ordered desert and were half way finished with it before they brought out the cake. personally, did someone at the hostess stand go oops! we need to send a birthday cake over to table xx immediately even though they already are half way through their dessert? but to be honest, they did and it truly made my otherwise mediocre dining experience in to a pleasant one. \n\noverall mastros.... maybe i set my expectations to high and i understand, you have only been open for a few months now so maybe all the bugs are still getting worked out. in the words of my girlfriend, it was not as good as the crystal cove, ca location yet on par with the one in costa mesa, ca. \n\nsounds like i have to try all this again at the crystal cove location and compare! granted.... thanks for the last minute birthday cake. it was nice to see those little comments on open table actually mean something.", 
            "went to mastro's before a show. scott was our server and was excellent. had a full dozen oyster's on the <mark>Oysters On Half Shell</mark> which were just out of the ocean fresh and delicious! i ordered <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> blackened and it was melt in your mouth perfect! the lobster mashed were delish as was the house dessert, warm butter cake, served with loads of fresh homemade whipped cream! servings are large and we all had leftovers. loved sitting in the treehouse. we do have a few suggestions: the entrance is so boring and the piano is shoved way back in a back corner that you would never notice it. how about putting the piano up front somewhere? such a wonderful restaurant needs a a better first impression. also, we had called and asked for a 7:30 reservation and were told it was not available but 8:30 was. that was too late for us to make our show, so reservationist suggested 7. we arrived and were seated at 7 and the restaurant was no more than half full until past 8 pm!! so why couldn't we have come at 7:30 as we first asked? i mentioned this to a manager who approached our table mid-meal  and he said, \"well, sometimes things change.\" huh??? terrible response. nevertheless, we loved our dinner and the service was fabulous. we can't wait to go back. we're already saving up!", 
            "excellent \n\ncame here with a party of 30 so i got to sample everything. we reserved their private dining room and it was fantastic. service was great, the room was perfect because we could be as loud as we wanted, and the food stole the show. \n\nmust have....... would be their seafood platter. it's a 3 tier platter that comes with dry ice giving that smoky, cloudy look. it came with oysters, shrimp, <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>, and lobster over a bed of shaved ice. \n\nthe bone in rib eye, bone in kansas city, and bone in fillet were all perfectly cooked and seasoned. do not get the fish here. the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was a little overcooked and dry. then again, why the hell would you order fish at a steakhouse? \n\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> was great but not when this cost more than the entrees. i was told that this dish was featured in entourage and a few other magazines. \n\nwe celebrated 8 birthdays so the staff gave us 8 individual desserts which was very nice of them. their butter cake was to die for. my god that was good. their bread pudding and apple crisp were also very delicious.",

            "we walked by the place early last week while shopping and exploring the city center.  love the ambiance, menu looked great, have heard great things about other locations so we decided to make this our last nights meal in vegas.  glad we did because aside from mix, and jr's this has now become one of our favorite places in vegas. i would not hesitate to recommend. \n\nseated in the main dining area right in the middle of the coolest structure for a restaurant you will ever see. warm dining room, very welcoming as were the staff. ours were a attractive redhead young lady and a younger guy.  piano playing jazzy christmas tunes, nice touch.  immediate introduction by the servers, it looked as if there were two for every table. we started with the house special martinis, served chilled and shaken at the table and blended perfectly. really, perfectly.  scanned the menu,  server came back by to check on the drinks and announced the specials. decided on the following:\n\nsaut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark>\nwarm spinach salad\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>\nny strip w/o bone\nlobster mashed \n\nscallops arrived, great presentation. now i love scallops, being in the pnw we have lots of choices on seafood and some of the best scallops i have ever had are at the barking frog near the woodinville winery and home of the famous herbfarm. these were excellent, large but not too, perfectly seasoned and prepared. all sitting on tip of the most wonderful cheese bread cracker in a wonderful sauce. yum! \n\nsalad arrived, again great presentation, just made, plate warmed just enough you could smell all the ingredients. now this was key. onion, egg, bacon and greens all perfectly aligned to emit this wonderful fragrance that just made your mouth water.  none of the heat or tartness you sometimes get with places putting too much red vinegar on the greens.  and the taste, i shit you not this was the best salad i have ever tasted. the senses alive with the fragrance and the taste perfectly aligned. \n\nsteak and bass arrived, simple but elegant in preso.  bowl of steaming potatoes with over a pound of lobster and a beautiful sauce. steak done to perfection, one of the best cuts and flavors i have had. and i am a steak house freak.  steak was severed still sizzling on the plate, little bit of butter on top on a simple white plate.  wife's <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was served equally as elegant. simply in presentation, nice cut of fish perfect flavor.  \n\nservice was just right, friendly, genuine there when needed. asked the server to choose a wine for me to pair with the steak. perfect choice came back again.\n\ni don't work for this place, wish i owned stock or had ownership though. this was by far one of the best dining experiences we have had all year. we will be back. \n\nthanks to the wonderful staff and happy holidays!", 
            "my friend treated me to dinner here for my birthday, and it was fabulous. \n\ni would've rated it as five stars, but i had a couple things that bothered me. first, we had a reservation, and came about 15 minutes early so we could grab a drink at the bar first. we checked in, but were not seated until about 20 minutes past our reservation. not a big fan of having to wait that long past the reservation time. second, i'm not a big fan of the dress code. it's supposed to be fine dining, and it is a beautiful restaurant. but, the fact that you see customers simply wearing t-shirts and jeans kind of ruins the whole thing. \n\nother than that - all was dandy. service was impeccable, but i would hope so considering the amount you pay to eat there. \n\nfood wise - we got oysters as appetizers. they were very fresh and tasted great. the <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> we ordered was decent, but nothing to rave about. i've had plenty of other <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> that easily beat the one at mastro's. the steaks we ordered were cooked to perfection, and were complimented well by the sauteed mushrooms. \n\nsince it was my birthday - they did give us free chocolate cake, which was nice. very light, fluffy, & moist. but, we did also order the warm butter cake, which i think most would agree is a must. man, the chocolate cake was nothing in comparison. \n\noverall, great place. would definitely go back again, when i have the money to spare. \n\nand on a completely random note - they do serve <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> at this establishment, which surprised me. this fish is known to be highly over fished and is on seafood watch's list of fish to avoid. just thought i'd let you know.", 
            "this is our 1st time at any of the mastro's restaurants.  we have family & friends in the vegas area who recommended & accompanied this as a truly upscale & 4-to-5 star dining experience.  they were correct!  \n\nupon being seated practically in the center of their 60 ft teak or mahogany simulated treehouse, we asked the very crisply uniformed captain to recommend the appetizers.  he had us create our own \"seafood tower\" and we chose <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark>, shrimp, oysters & calamari... delish!  the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> & <mark>Iceberg Wedge</mark> were next.  the five of us then shared a filet, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, atlantic salmon & scallops with garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  our captain went over and above as he assisted us in choose the appropriate wine to pair with our culinary choices.\n\nnow.. we would come back for all of this goodness, but the mastro's butter cake is one of a kind and is worth the whole meal or just to drop in for dessert after shopping.  \n\nneedless to say & in keeping with my \"positively outrageously\" great dining recommendations, you have to enjoy mastro's if you're in vegas!", 
            "little late on this review, but didn't want to miss out on saying how wonderful this beautiful new restaurant is. service was impeccable. seafood tower was delicious and our steaks were perfectly prepared. not a <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> eater, but was told it was one of the tastiest. a don't miss vegas experience.", 
            "we stopped by at mastro's for our valentines day dinner last night.  when we arrived we were sat inside their treehouse.....a fairly unique dining experience.  the treehouse is their main dining area which is shaped like a treehouse that overlooks the center of the crystals' mall.\n\nfor starters, we ordered their stone crabs abd lobser bisque.....both were very average.   the bisque was watery....not very thick and rich.\n\nfor our entrees, we had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark>....both very flavorful and super tasty.  for sides, we had their <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> and lobster truffled gnocci....both were extremely, extremely rich (too much cream and truffled cheese).....but very flavorful.\n\nfor desert, we had their famous butter pound cake with ice cream and chocolate starwberrries......the cake was very average......i can get more flavorful pound cake at safeway...the chocolate strawberries were good, but nothing spectacular.\n\nthe service was average at best.   overall, the food was good, not great. one extra star for the cool treehouse dining experience.", 
            "best of the best! outstanding service and food. worth every dime! the seafood tower, grilled <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and best martinis. chef wayne schumaker is outstanding.", 
            "i love love love the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> at mastro's! delicious! mastro's maes my top 5 favorite restaurants list for sure!\n\nservice was excellent. entertainment (guy on the keyboard & a singer) at the bar was a nice touch, but we were right next to them, and it was a bit too loud. sittng further away woulda been better, but it was okay.\n\ncomplimentary bread & butter: yummy! boyfriend loved the pretzel bread.\n\n<mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>: yes, they give you 2 <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>. lol! hate when resataurants only give you 1 and charge you an arm and a leg. this is not the case here. they were big, chunky and delicious! great for sharing with 4 people.\n\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>: really...need i say more? like butter!\n\npetite fillet: melt in your mouth good!\n\nwarm butter cake served with ice cream and whipped cream: another must.", 
            "when in vegas, you gotta do it right and mastro's is well...doing it right.\n\nmastro's ocean club is owned by the same very popular chain steakhouses but focuses more on a seafood selection. it's located right in the crystals shopping center in city center. \n\ni came here with a group of 9 and we were able to be seated in the treehouse (ballin!). food was great. i had the bone in ribeye and but also nibbled on a <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> as well. both were delicious. the sides rocked as well with the wasabi <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> being my favorite. \n\noverall a great dining experience, highly recommend!", 
            "before heading out for a night of partying at xs, my buddy and i found ourselves wandering around the cosmopolitan looking for a good restaurant to try.  while the rest of our friends were grabbing dinner at the literal hole-in-the-wall pizza counter upstairs, we wanted to take advantage of the opportunity of trying something a little more unique.  well, that is, assuming we could find somewhere that didn't have a crowd; each of our first few tries were met with wait times of 45 mins or longer.  hoping for better luck at the mall at city center next door, we eventually worked our way over to mastro's ocean club to check things out there.  greeted by a friendly hostess and the opportunity for immediate seating, our search came to an end.  score for table seating by the bar!\n\nfor a while now, i've heard a number of good things about mastro's from friends in la.  from the service to the food, they've all mentioned how great their experiences were.  at the end of my meal, i could certainly see what they mean.  after perusing through the menu of seafood and steaks, i ended up going with the grilled <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with a side order of the garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> for my friend and i to split (rather, i wanted it for myself, but needed to \"share\" it to justify getting it).  now, i know...ordering a fish dish on my first ever trip to mastro's is pretty counter-intuitive considering their reputation as a steakhouse.  however, given that it's one of their two ocean club spots, i figured that maybe i should give the seafood a shot since i don't know if it'll be as readily offered at their pure steakhouse spots.\n\nwhen our orders were brought to our table, i have to admit that it wasn't stunning at first glance.  although the cut was larger than i had anticipated (which is never a bad thing), there wasn't much in terms of frills and dressing.  since everything is a la carte, you literally get just the fish on the plate, with half a lemon on the side of seasoning.  despite how lonely it may have looked though, there's no questioning the quality.  although <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> is generally more forgiving when it comes to cooking because of its fatty nature, this one was done perfectly regardless.  the meat was soft and tender, and it was moist throughout.  flavor-wise, you couldn't ask for much more - modest seasoning to it, with a great buttery and velvety sort of flavor from the fish.  excellent.\n\nas for our sides, the garlic mashed was pretty good.  i liked the consistency (thick, but not gloppy or too thin), and the flavor wasn't too potent.  while i would generally prefer a stronger punch to it, it worked well to not overpower the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  in addition, my friend also slipped in an order of the skinny fries, and let me tell you - a \"basket\" of fries here really is a basket of fries.  the order was this huge mound of fried potato goodness, and even after chipping away at it throughout our meal, there was still plenty left for our other friend to snack on when he joined us.  oh, and i can't forget to mention their bread basket either - all served hot and soft with salted butter.  all of the ones i tried were good, but my favorite was the toast-like bread with cheese...so good.\n\nas for the rest of the experience, everything else was spot on.  our server sarah was awesome - really attentive, friendly, and pretty damn cute.  now, i'm sure that last part might have had something to do with it, but seriously, really cute.  while it's kind of odd that it's located in a mall, i really liked the vibe of the place.  the main dining area is on a sort of a semi-open balcony (check out the pictures...quite a distinctive look), while they have a piano and singer by the bar.  while the music can make conversations a little tough, it's no worse than if you were sitting with a large group.\n \nwhile i do somewhat regret not having ordered beef instead of fish, i have no complaints about what i had either (plus, was still under that damn zero/reduced beef pledge).  that said, i know i'll be back to try more of their menu anyways (saw several tables with the seafood tower), as well as to get a table in their \"tree house\" section.  great ambiance for a date as well, and while not a cheap meal, it's certainly worth the price.  but then, that could just be my waitress-induced bias doing the talking too..", 
            "delicious!! the bread basket was warm and fresh out of the oven. i'm not a huge steak person so i ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. it was cooked perfectly. i'm a sucker for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. the mac & cheese was good and the lobster mashed potato was amazing!!! not only was the food good but the location and being in a treehouse was fun. service was top notch and i'll definitely come back for more.", 
            "perfect first experience at mastro's! went there to celebrate our anniversary and they really did make it feel like a special occasion. we were seated in the treehouse - beautiful and romantic, great date spot. \nreally unique cocktail list -definitely not the usual boring drinks. i tried the blueberry martini, didn't really care for the taste since i prefer sweet drinks, but it was strong and something different. cocktails were a little pricey at about $18 each, but you pay for the ambiance. \nstarted w escargot, i've never had it served in the shell before. very pretty and delish - served w clarified butter and garlic. great selection of yummy breads too. \nwe shared the 18oz bone in kansas city strip w <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark> (1 butter poached, 1 vanilla tempura fried). sides - twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> and brussel sprouts w bacon. steak was cooked perfectly medium, tender, juicy and flavorful. they knew we were sharing so everything was split for us. poached lobster was good, cooked perfectly. the tempura lobster... mmm i'm not a huge fan. it was good, but a lot of batter and i didn't really get even a hint of vanilla. glad we decided to try it both ways. \ntwice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> was good, but i've had better. they didn't bring it out till about 10min after the rest of the food because the chef didn't like how the first one looked, so he made a new one. they took it off the bill w out us asking. nice that the chef has attn to detail vs just cranking out the orders. brussel sprouts used to be fried w pancetta but they recently changed the menu, so no more pancetta. they did accommodate by doing it w bacon instead, but not really the same - thin sliced bacon just can't compare to chunks of pancetta.\nwe got the butter cake comp since it was an anniversary. super cute of them to do a candle. the cake is enough for 3 or 4 to share, served w vanilla ice cream and a huge bowl of fresh whipped cream. so bad, but soooo good! \nservice was excellent, our server mike was friendly and knowledgeable. the rest of the wait staff were great too. i checked out our neighbors food, i'm looking forward to trying the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, or crab salad next time. \nin the end there's not a huge difference w steak joints - they generally serve the same cuts, appetizers and sides. but mastro's stands apart with its service and intimate classy ambiance.", 
            "wow is all i can say.  we have a mastros steakhouse in chicago and i have not been able to get in as it's always so hoppin. so since we were in vegas, we decided to give mastros ocean club a try.  we were not disappointed.  the restaurant is located in the city center shopping area and fits in well with the high end shopping and the swanky d\\u00e9cor of the city center and surrounding hotels.  the d\\u00e9cor is simple contemporary.  it would be too simple if it wasn't for their amazing bar set up but more their \"tree house\" structure.  if you visit mastros, request that you sit in the tree house section.  they also have a lounge singer and piano player.  the volume was fine (as i've read other review that it was extremely loud) - but we were sitting in the tree house area so i can imagine if you had one of the tables next to the singer or in the booths behind them, it would be pretty loud.  regardless, the singer was very good and sang songs from all genres.  now to the important part - the food.  everything we ordered was amazing.  as all higher end restaurants, all sides are ala cart but big enough to share.  our entrees were delishous - <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, and scallops.  i have no complaints, all were cooked perfectly and extremely flavorful.  the portions were quite large.  the sides were equally amazing and big enough to share between 3-4 people.  one of the sides - the mac and cheese was ah. maz. ing.  if we're ever back i'd be happy to dive into the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  the wedge salad was enourmous, enough to share between 2 people.  i had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which was very tasty.  i've had it before at other places and it sometimes has had a \"fishy\" taste but not this. and there were big chunks of lobster.  service, supurb as expected.  the menu is pricey, but worth it.  i'll definitely be checking out mastros in chicago.", 
            "since i had a good experience at the mastro's steakhouse in oc, i decided to try this mastro's ocean club in las vegas and let me tell you, i had an even better experience.  it's probably due to the fact that i love seafood!!!\n\ni was tempted to get an appetizer tower but there were other things on the  menu that i wanted to try that were actually served hot so we opted out of the tower.  instead we ordered the following:\n\n*<mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> - (just as good as the first time i had it in oc)\n*<mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> - 3 pieces of jumbo scallops with three pieces of bread, in a rich creamy sauce.  amazing!!!  i just found out i'm moderately allergic to scallops but i love jumbo scallops so it doesn't stop me from trying them anyways. soo yummy.\n* chilled alaskan king <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> - came out served is a cool bowl with dry ice.  loved it.  way a lot more tasty than <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> or lobster option.  \n\nthis was definitely more than filling but it didn't stop me from ordering a <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> for my entree since my favorite fish are <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> or cod anything.  i'm use to ordering these type of fishes miso style but since it wasn't an option, i decided to order it pan seared.  it came out nice fluffy and buttery.  i ordered it cooked medium.  i really liked the consistency of the fish and how it was cooked but wouldn't have minded some type of sauce to give that extra umph.\n\nto be honest, i couldn't enjoy it as much because i was so stuffed!  i really wanted to try the infamous warm butter cake but i guess i'm just going to have to wait it out until the next time.  i will definitely come back :)", 
            "this place is still a 4 to 4 1/2.  pricey but great food and service.  the steaks, lobster tail, and <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> were all worthwhile.  they have a nice bar that you can grab a drink at before dinner and the music they play live is nice.  typically, standards.  leave room for dessert.", 
            "i will preface this review with the fact that family was in town and this dinner was free!\n\nwe had reservations for saturday night  at 8:30 pm for a group of 7. i am always leery of a restaurant that is in the middle of a mall. i don't care how fancy the mall is, i think mall food every time i dine at one. mastro's my friends is no mall food place.\n\nthe service was top notch, we had a waiter and 2 bussers, while i'm sure they had different tables, they were always there when we needed them. it was like they were our dedicated staff.\n\nthe meal was top notch, starting with the amazing bread basket, continuing through the entrees, the family style sides, and ending up with an amazing dessert (which they comped to the table).\n\nthe bread basket was a good start, it had pretzel bread, olive bread, a parmesan crisp, and few other breads. the sides were amazing, they are served family style in surprisingly large portions. we had <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (some of the best i've ever had), <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, and mushrooms. we also had a few salads to pass around the table, 2 caesars (one regular and one spicy), tomato and onion, and tomato and mozzarella. a seafood tower and <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> were also ordered, i'm not much of a seafood guy but everyone else loved it. \n\nthey entrees were pretty stellar as well, i was splitting the 33oz wagyu tomahawk cut with my uncle, but since he was too full from the salads and sides, i had to man up and eat the whole thing myself (the things i have to do). this was one of the best pieces of cow i've had in my life (and i've had a lot of cow). it was cooked just a touch under medium rare (perfect imo), the marbling in the meat was insane, and it came out on a scorching hot plate. i don't know how they cooked it but it was perfect. \n\ntable mates also got the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, a filet, and a few other meats, i was very impressed with the size of their portions, most places would serve about 4oz of fish, but their <mark>Filet</mark> were about 12oz servings.\n\nafter dinner, they brought out a warm butter cake with vanilla ice cream for the table, it was a great end to the meal, and comping it was a nice touch!\n\ni have no clue what the meal ran, but it was amazing. my only complaint is that their bar area isn't the best, if they're going to make you wait 10-20 mins for your table they need more room in the bar. they did however have a great piano player and singer who played a variety from christmas carols to current hits which only added to the amazing meal.\n\nwill i be back, hopefully, especially if someone else is picking up the tab!",

            "good, straight forward fish house / steakhouse.  best of all, you get to dine in a contemporary \"pod\" in the middle of crystals (they call it a tree house, either way its cool).  unfortunately, because of it's mall location, it doesn't feel like a special occasion, destination restaurant rather  \"i'm hungry after all your shopping, oh look, a restaurant, let's eat\".\n\nwith the exception of a few starters and a hand full of mains, you get exactly what the menu says, unadorned. no special sauces, no veg.  just fish or beef on a plate.  \n\nportions are large.  unless you're hungry, pass on the starters.  they are traditional (raw bar, seafood cocktails).  you can get them anywhere.  \n\nfish is expertly cooked to order.  the thick cut fillet of pan roasted <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and salmon are excellent.  cooked medium with no sign of albumin (white substance that comes out of fish if the cooking temperature is too high).  both were moist and naturally oily, exuding their naked fish flavors.  \n\ngood quality prime steaks.  decent aging.  good selection of bone in cuts.   sadly, nothing sets them apart from other quality steakhouses in vegas.  the bone in fillet is tender, mildly flavored.  no complaints.  \n\nfor sides, its gotta be the rich and incredibly flavorful, king crab and truffle dressed gnocchi or the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  chunks of lobster enveloped in a buttery mash that explodes with lobster flavor.  i could eat either an a main and be happy!  \n\nsolid wine list.  vegas resort pricing.\n\nsometimes \"a kiss is just a kiss...\"  and that's fine by me.", 
            "purpose of the visit: our signature meal event for the weekend get away with the guys. chose this place as an alternative to the meat temples that are typically selected and it was also close to the aria. the atmosphere was interesting, very open and spacious overlooking parts of city cent. the birdhouse was an interesting design and seating experience. we ordered mussels, <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> and sushi <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> ponzu. the ponzu was excellent lightly fried and tender. <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark> also was nicely flavored. main course was blackened <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. grilled <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was very flavorful. sides w french fries, saut\\u00e9ed spinach, desert was also fantastic. warm buttered cake was a great way to finish the meal.  atmosphere was lively and supported by a nice two person live band that sang some nice good old rock and roll covers.", 
            "this meal was fantastic!\n      we started with the calamari, it was so fresh with a spice on it and the sauce was tasty. the bread was fresh and i just love a good piece of bread yum! my husband had a salad and he enjoyed it greatly.\n\nfor the main course i ordered <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, omg! prepared just right. my fish just melted in my mouth. i forgot what my husband ordered but he was completely statisfied. we ordered the gnocchi and the sauteed broccoli as our sides, loved the gnocchi and the broccoli was good. \n\ni cannot recall if we had desert, but if we did i'm sure it was great. as far as ambiance goes, the place was nice and they had live music going thoughout dinner and we enjoyed it.",

            "oh boy, where do i start?\n\ni made reservations for my fiance here last saturday night :) it was his birthday, and so i wanted to take him out. we were in vegas celebrating, and seeing that this place had high ratings, i took him here to try it out. the restaurant itself is inside a mall, and though we didn't get seated in the treehouse looking part, it was still a pleasant visit. it was our first time dining at any mastro's restaurant, and definitely won't be our last! we got a waiter named tim (timothy), and he has got to be one of the best waiters we've ever had. he was very informative and was extremely nice. he showed us the different menus and helped us choose. i decided on the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. it was sooo good! the flavor was on point, and it was a perfect portion size. my fiance ordered the filet for himself, and his was overcooked, but they knew right away after he received it. dan asked him if he wanted to switch it for a new one, but he said it was fine, and ate it anyways. he liked the flavor and was genuinely fine with it and didn't think it was really a big deal. we also ordered calamari as an appetizer, and a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. (which was family sized, for sharing.. but we didn't know!) the calamari was awesome. we ended up only being able to eat about 10 fries out of that giant pile.. lol. we were too full! a different waiter served us sprite and ended up spilling it all over my fiance's shoulder.. yikes. they did help him clean it up though. in the end, my fiance got a warm butter cake as his birthday gift :d yay! it was so delicious, we ate it all.. despite the fact that we were super full! we were also given complementary wine for the steak being overcooked and for the sprite spill. now that's excellent customer service, and if vegas wasn't so far, i'd come back more often. i'll miss this place :( hope the one in newport is just as professional! but i know if we were in vegas visiting, this spot will be one of the first places i'd go to eat at. thanks for the wonderful experience mastro's! :) stay gold.",

            "i had made reservations here for my wife's birthday and when we got there the place was crowded.  the hostesses explained the wait, and offered for us to have a drink in the lounge until our table was ready.  they kept checking in on us until we were ready to be seated.  \n\nwe started with two cups of coffee and the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark>.  the crab came out on a cup of dry ice that was smoking and was a very good presentation, as well as being extremely tasty.\n\nfor dinner my wife had the 8oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark> and i had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  the waiter, piotr, explained that the sides are served family style and that we should share a couple.  we chose the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and the steamed broccoli.  my wife, when asked how she wanted her meat cooked, asked for it to be medium, piotr explained that medium would still have some pink in the center, and sensing the way that she likes hers cooked, recommended medium plus.  when it came out it was cooked perfectly, and was the most tender steak that she has ever had.  my <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was cooked so it had a nice, crispy shell of the outside, but was milky and soft on the inside.  the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> has spoiled me, now i find it hard to not expect that kind of perfection from all other potatoes.\n\nafter dinner they brought out a complimentary chocolate sin cake for us to share with a birthday message written in sauce on the plate.  \n\noverall, this was an amazing meal at an amazing restaurant, and i would highly recommend this to anyone.  the prices are high, but you will get what you pay for.  my only regret is not being able to try the warm butter cake everyone raves about, but i guess that means i have to go here again next time.",

            "a good friend of ours suggested mastro's when we asked for a recommendation for a seafood on the strip. so i made a reservation online for that night at 7pm on the mastro's website. what i didn't know was that i had somehow clicked on the chicago location. luckily i was walking around the crystals shopping center that afternoon and went to check out the venue and was chatting with one of the hostesses who offered to check on our reservation to confirm it .. good thing she did and we fixed my error. they were pretty booked that night but were able to squeeze us in. :) \n\nthe service was pretty much top-notch from start to finish, hostesses, servers, and bussers,  all were very attentive and knowledgeable as well as being friendly and personable. loved that they dish out our sides for us .. that's a really nice touch. \n\nthe food, we had a variety of items which were all delicious but at the top of our favorites were the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> and the signature <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. both are must haves to accompany any steak or seafood dish. we had the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious as well as the pan seared <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which my dining companions said was spectacularly prepared and seasoned. \n\ndessert was over the top .. we had three .. mastro's signature warm butter cake, \nthe cherry crisp, and the profiteroles. the first two were topped with vanilla bean gelato. both were to die for. i had read lots about the warm butter cake and it was everything i had expected and more :) .. and surprisingly i also loved the cherry crisp .. i am not huge on cherry anything but the flavor had just the right amount of sweetness and was not overpowering and the crisp part is a crumbly granola like topping which is an nice balance with the gelato and fruitiness of the dish. it's something i would definitely order again! \n\nmy only complaint is that the server didn't warn us about the size of the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> appetizer. mom and i each ordered our own, and when they came out .. they were absolutely gigantic and even though we had a party of 5 we were unable to finish both. being in the service industry myself, i would have definitely warned my guests about the size of the carpaccio dish and suggested something else to order with it. \n\nall in all it was a fabulous dinner, the restaurant, even though it is in a busy mall .. has a nice ambiance, and we will absolutely be back.",

            "3.5 stars- definitely better than 3 stars, but not quite 4.\n\nthis restaurant is location in the middle of crystals on the strip.  from the outside looking in, the restaurant is inside a neat sculptured \"treehouse\". it sort of made me feel like if would be cool to eat in there, but sitting on the inside of the treehouse looking out i feel a little disappointed, because i felt like i was eating in an \"upscale\" food court with views of retail stores, such as  lv, jimmy choo, and zegna.  not exactly, the scene i expected  from an expensive restaurant, however on the other side there was a piano bar.\n\nhowever, service was impeccable, except we were only told the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> was out when we ordering rather than beforehand.  in a rush we picked <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> as our appetizer, husband ordered mac & cheese, we shared the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>,  <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> and <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  \n\nwe ordered a bottle of schramberg blanc de blanc for $70. given it is about $27 in retail that markup isn't terrible, beside by the glass ranged from $15 to $30. the wine list is comprehensive.\n\ni am kind of bored with <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark>, but it was definitely above average and the portion size of the appetizer is the size of a meal.  it is presented like a tower with the base made of crushed fried wontons, then avocado almost like guacamole, then the seasoned tuna.  \n\nthe mac & cheese was a huge portion that could feed 4 people on its own or 6 side servings.  i just had to have a bite, it was creamy, cheesy and tangy all the same time; i like the addition of gorgonzola, which still remained subtle.   definitely an adult upscale mac & cheese. \n\n<mark>Chopped Salad</mark> was solid and i like how we were told the ingredients and asked if we wanted to omit anything.\n\nthe king crab comes warm when it is an entree and that was a bit unexpected, but tasted sweet and drowned in the drawn butter....ooooh, so good. i was surprised how meaty the 1 lb of legs were...easily filling up one person.  \n\ni love <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> prepared any way, but i it was pan-fried to perfection.  the outside crusty and the inside soft and buttery. the seasoning was just salt.  the serving size is probably 8 oz, which is ample and justifies the price.\n\nno room for dessert, but a slice of  chocolate layer cake with schlag (whipped cream) was on the house since it was my birthday.  very generous.\n\noverall, pretty good, but again i couldn't get past the view which cheapened the ambiance. we left with enough food for another dinner so that was good too.\n\ndon't know why it is called \"beach club\".  the environment doesn't in any way demonstrate a \"beach club\".  that may be a good thing, though.\n\nwill i go again? probably not, i think joe's seafood (not the crab shack) has a better ambiance and food, except the fish here is better.",

            "this place is a tree house.. no really, it is!  their main dining area is called the tree house; quite cute actually.  but regarding the experience:\n\nfood:4 stars\nservice: 1 star\nprice:2 start\naverage:2.5 star.. but i rounded up because my meal was courtesy of mgm... thanks casino host!\n\ni was seated by the hostess.. then i waited.. and waited... and waited.. for menus.  after making continuous eye contact with the wait staff, displaying my need for service, i was ignored.  then maybe after 10 mins, i received a menu, but still had to ask for water.  shocking, as this is supposed to be a nicer restaurant.. you would think with these prices, would come service.  also, during our dinner, i had numerous times where i was looking an empty champagne glass.. and no i'm not a fast drinker... if you are going to place the bottle in a ice bucket stand on the other side of the table, please be mindful of when to fill my glass... i know this may sound snobby, but i have no problem pouring my own glass.. however, i believe they should keep a close eye, especially since there was plenty of staff just standing around.\n\nthe mussels were probably one of the best i've had! this was a nice surprise, as most <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark> are quite standard with white wine, garlic and parsley.  but this had some sort of light and creamy sun-dried tomato sauce! it was thin enough to compliment these under the sea delights, but hearty enough to dip with bread!  the crab cake was also divine!  definitely no fillers here.. instead, a cake-shaped form of literally pure crab!  the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was prepared really great, especially for a white fish!\n\noverall, i would definitely check this place out, especially if you have a food/bev comp through mgm hotels.  however, i still prefer sage over this place.  the service really stood out to me, and it was horrible!\n\ndear waitstaff.- please be kind to your customers, especially in the city of where splurge-worthy tips are common!  and to the tall, 60 year old server with some salt and pepper action going on ontop of that head.. stop winking at ladies.. you're creeping people out!!", 
            "what is there to say about mastro's ocean club that has not already been said? it's funny . . . we live in scottsdale, home of the original mastro's and mastro's ocean club, and yet, this is where we decided to dine in las vegas. having never been to mastro's ocean club in scottsdale, but knowing friends far and wide have been so delighted there, we thought on our vacation, we should give the sister restaurant a try! we are so glad we did!\n\nthe space itself is very unique in design. we were seated in the \"tree house\". it is quite a spectacle from inside as well as outside as the wood towers from the lower level of the crystals shopping center to the very top with a rounded platform area, that kind of resembles an open wooden spaceship, within which is the dining room seating. it is very light and airy. there is plenty of room between tables and despite some of other reviewers complaints that the music is loud, we had no problem with it, even on a friday night.\n\nour waiter (i think his name is robert) was one of the best servers we have ever had, in just about any restaurant in which we have dined. he was knowledgeable, friendly, didn't hover, and was not pushy at all. he gave us time to order, time in between courses, time to finish the humongous plates of food.  the rest of the waitstaff was also attentive. having sat outside at the pool all day, my husband was parched, and i think he drank at least eight glasses of water . . . he never had to wait for the glass to be refilled! when i couldn't finish a course, the attendant asked if he could wrap the remaining up to go. i didn't have to flag anyone down.\n\nthe food was top notch, bar none!  we started with the <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark>. it was a massive appetizer of tiny cubed ahi piled above avocado and what i believe were panko chips. fresh, flavorful and enough for a table of four (not two) to share! not knowing how large the portion was going to be, we also ordered an <mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark> to split - fabulous! and, huge! it had chopped egg, onion, shrimp, lobster, blue cheese . . . you could eat one as a meal. at that point, i issued a proclamation to my husband, aside from our main entrees, we could only order one side. hubby ordered the bone-in rib eye . . . a hunka hunka burnin' love of meat, perfectly seasoned, perfectly seared to medium rare. bliss for my hubby who gets no red meat at home!  i ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> oreganata . . . melted in my mouth . . . and, it too was a giant piece of fish! i couldn't even finish it. the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> was delish, even luke warm, as we couldn't even finish it during our meal, but instead had it as a midnight snack back in our hotel room!  \n\none other note . . . and this was pure genius. i couldn't finish my wine. if i put anything more into my stomach, i think i would have exploded! our waiter said on the way out, take my drink to the hostess and she will give it to me to go. apparently, the hostess can do this, but the waiter can't. thinking i am going to get my wine in a plastic cup . . . the hostess actually poured it into another wine glass and told me to keep it! \n\nwithout a doubt, this was the best meal we had in vegas over this three-day holiday. and despite what some would say is a hefty price tag, i beg to differ. the quality of the service and food were spot on. we had dinner at two other similarly priced restaurants and left feeling robbed. not so at mastro's ocean club. \n\ni think i have finally convinced my husband to make the scottsdale mastro's ocean club on our regular rotation for fine dining . . . i hope it lives up to the las vegas outlet!", 
            "beautiful restaurant that catches your eye. the staff was really nice and knowledgeable. the food is pricey but it's located inside of crystals so that's to be expected. the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> was delicious, the oysters were fresh and my mom ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which was perfectly cooked and tasty. i told them that it was my mother's birthday and they brought out a cake with a candle for her on the house. great surprise. great staff, great food and overall great experience! a must to check out.",

            "i decided on this place for my boyfriends birthday because he loves steak and i love seafood. he tried to convince me to go somewhere cheaper but i wouldnt allow it. at first i was not a fan of our server- took about 15 minutes to get menu's and an introduction. i think he heard me bitching about it because after that he went out of his way to attend to us. he was an odd fellow but he was trying very hard. i am a sucker for expensive glasses of wine and love it when a restaurant offers such- the server gave a very on point description of the wine i ordered. for entree i had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and my boyfriend had steak- something with a bone in it- i guess the rib eye? im not sure about that as i dont eat beef...i was loving my <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> until my darling mentioned that his steak was extremely salty...and in that moment i noticed that mine was also extremely salty...and i love salt. the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was cooked to perfection and was so flaky and delicious with just the perfect amount of crust on the outside. but- it was almost too salty to eat. my boyfriend said the same thing about the steak- that it was perfectly cooked and a great piece of meat but too salty to really enjoy. \n\noverall the meal cost me an arm and at least 2 legs...service b+, wine a+, entree c, bread a+, price for what you get c+.", 
            "i've always said that you can judge a restaurant by it's bread as an indication of it's food. the bread basket at this particular mastro's was a bad omen in itself. \n\ni've better had better escargot's at a vietnamese restaurant in little saigon. my <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was a tragedy, usually my favorite fish. it had to be the oil or butter that they pan seared it in that tastes like gasoline and left me nauseated. it was the fist time i left <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> half eaten.\nthe shoe string fries was mostly fried in the same horrific lard. even ketchup couldn't salvage the flavor.\n\nthe mushrooms were good but my nausea keep me for enjoying them. \n\nthe 18 oz bone in filet was had no character what so ever. such a disappointment compared to other mastro's that we dined at.\n\ni've had good steaks at good restaurants. this place isn't it.",

            "food did taste delicious, but average among the restaurants at the similar premium price mark. service was also up on par with other fine dining restaurants.\n\nhowever, i'm not sure if all these are worth the week long food poisoning torture i have to go through. i nearly missed half of my maroon5 concert that was right after the meal. still carrying stomach ache as i'm typing this review. after finding another reviewer's complaint about food poisoning at mastro's after ordered the same plate <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> on trip advisor, i figured i should share my experience and warn the yelpers.\n\nbeing a sushi lover (eat raw fish almost every other week if not more often), i consider myself a foodie with a tough stomach. however, my trained stomach cannot win over this meal. my husband and i shared every other plate except for the entr\\u00e9es and the cocktails and he turned out fine. (for the record, i ordered pan seared <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and dream berry.) so i'm guessing it's either this <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> that still cannot rest in peace and enjoys surfing in my belly, or it's the berries used in the cocktail that may not be as fresh as these should be.\n\ntried to contact mastro's but so far no luck. i will follow up with an updated review if i do hear back from mastro's.", 
            "we went to mastro's on a sunday early evening for dinner.  there were maybe three to four other tables occupied but other than that there was plenty of good seating available.  \n\nspeaking of seating, i found the set up a little off-putting...we were seated at a two person table that butted directly against the back of a circular seating arrangement, which just so happened to contain 3-4 lovely active young children on this day.  somehow your ability to enjoy a nice meal is a bit inhibited with a 5 year old staring at you from 1.5 feet away.  perhaps it was our fault for not requesting one of the 50 odd other empty tables.\n\nas other yelpsters have stated it is also a bit weird to be enjoying a $$$$ meal with miley cyrus cranking in the background due to the open seating overlooking/hearing the mall like crystal shops.  enough nit picking though, on to the food!\n\nour server was very attentive and started us out promptly with ice water and tea.  micro demerit for including a lemon in my iced tea after asking to hold the lemon, but no big deal.  huge stars go out to the staff for keeping the beverages brimming full, a frequent problem for such an iced tea addict as myself.  the bread service came with enough to feed a small army.  mini-loaves of sourdough, pretzel, bruschetta, and french.  \n\nwe ordered the calamari ($15).  there was plenty for the two of us, lightly breaded and including a lemon side and a dipping sauce very similar to the outback sauce you get with bloomin onions.  \n\ntaking the \"go big or go home\" philosophy i decided to order the <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark> ($69) and 22 oz ribeye ($55) for my entree.  my girlfriend ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> ($50) and we split a side of <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> ($38).  \n\nthe steak was wonderfully charred, cooked medium.   the server was nice enough to \"de-shell\" the <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark>.  the lobster was perfectly cooked and delicious with melted butter.  the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was also excellent.  i let my date enjoy the majority of the potatoes as they were a bit soupy due to the sauce but the small portion i had did taste good.  \n\nwe got the butter cake to go, not sure on the price, it came complete with detailed instructions on how to best prepare it from our server.  final bill with tip $325.", 
            "i made reservations for dinner on a thursday evening and my hotel was nearby so i was able to walk here. i heart the decor of the tree house dinning which we were seated at. see it: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-las-vegas?select=veyizprriievg0x5eyxb7q#veyizprriievg0x5eyxb7q this mastro's has three levels dinning areas and tree house is on the second floor with views of the crystal mall.  \n\nordered a a bottle of napa cabernet sauvignon after the yummy bread basket arrived. followed with the <mark>Iceberg Wedge</mark> salad which contained smoked maple bacon and chunks of blue cheese - refreshing and so yummy. for the main entree i opted for the 22 oz bone in rib eye - cooked medium rare and a side of the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. as with every mastro's i've dined at, the food and service were impeccable. if you're a fish eater check out the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> here, it was incredibly fresh and delicious. we ended the meal with the chocolate sin cake which was moist and a perfect ending to conclude the meal. \n\neven though mastro's was bought out last year, the quality and service in my opinion are at the top tier of the industry. btw, have a beverage in the bar before or after dinner for some interesting people watching.\n\nthank you to the entire staff at the las vegas mastro's for an awesome dinning experience!",

(why i knocked off 1 star) we were expecting a loud, energetic \"vegas\" style restaurant (much like the one back home here in chicago) but it was very quiet, bright, and just low energy. more suitable for a quiet dinner with your significant other, not a crazy group of 8 guys and 2 girls lol. but hey maybe that's the feel this mastros is going for, which i can totally appreciate.", 
            "when my husband and i visited vegas this weekend, we both had a craving for delicious seafood.  unfortunately for us, many of the restaurants that served seafood were primarily steakhouses.  we read a few yelp reviews for mastro's among others and eventually made a reservation here for dinner that same night.\n\nwhen we arrived, we were seated inside the \"tree house\" that's suspended in the center of the shops.  we ordered a bottle of shiraz, the halibut and the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> encrusted with their special seasoning, and macaroni and cheese.  our water was never more than half empty at any given time throughout our entire meal.  \n\nthe food and wine turned out to be amazing!  our waiter (i wish i remembered his name) was kind enough to ask if we wanted the rest, including the wine, boxed up since i had been feeling sick to finish it.  \n\na few tips if you visit, the sides are quite large, probably enough to split with up to 4 people.  trust your waiter/waitress.  ours suggested the preparation we had on our fish and we were not disappointed.  and the price is a bit high but well worth it in the end.  i would definitely go back here again.", 
            "when you are looking for an incredible meal, look no further then mastro's ocean club located in the crystals shopping mall at the city center. \n\ni started with the jalape\\u00f1o <mark>Jalapeno <mark>Ahi Tuna Sashimi</mark></mark>. i loved this dish. thin slices of tune w just the right amount of jalape\\u00f1o made each bit the perfect amount of spicy. only down side was the dish was a bit oily. \n\nfor my entree i went w the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. i can't express enough.. this was hands down the best <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> i've ever had. \n\nlast but definitely not least.. i finished w the famous mastro's butter cake. mind blown. it gets better every time.",

            "this restaurant is superb! i've been wanting to check this place out for a while now and it just so happened one of my long time friends was planning on having her birthday dinner here. the ambiance of the restaurant is high class and lavish. making a reservation is highly recommened, especially if you want to sit at a table in the tree house. in case you were wondering, the tree house is that giant structure across from louis vuitton. we had a 7pm reservation, but the birthday girl was running 10 min late. the hostesses and staff were more than accommodating and held our table. once everyone was there we were seated right away. the waiter went over the menu and highlighted his favorites as well as what they are known for. i was torn between surf or turf, but luckily my date wanted the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which i had my eye on, so i opted for the 18oz <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>. i ordered mine rare of course because i feel anything above medium rare ruins the true flavor of the meat. the cool thing about how they serve their steak is they actually under cook it and serve it on a 400 degree plate which allows the steak to cook more to exactly how you ordered so it's absolutely perfect when you take your first bite. they age all their steaks for 3 weeks, and omg they are perfect. juicy, full of flavor, and melt in you mouth like butter. now for the fish, the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was buttery, flakey, not too dry, not too wet, and just the right amount of oiliness. for sides, you order them seperately and they feed up to 5 which was perfect since there was so many of us. we all ordered different sides and got to share. we had brussel sprouts, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>, saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms, and truffle fries. oh my oh my, we were all beyond stuffed. every element of the meal was perfect, but dessert was what sealed the deal. two words, butter cake. if you don't think it is one of the most amazing desserts to ever exist, you need to reevaluate your life choices. they also make their own whipped cream which is euphoric. if you're looking to have a memorable dinner you need to check out mastro's, it's totally worth the money.", 
            "we went last night as a party of seven for a farewell dinner before i head to the middle east.  we requested the tree house and a round table and it was perfect.  the service all night was outstanding, water glasses never got less than half empty.  we all ordered apps, salad/soups, main course and dessert.  the escargot was great, very garlicky and the <mark>Sauteed Shrimp</mark> were excellent.  the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was good, but you could really taste the anchovy, if you don't like anchovies, stay away.\n  i had a bone in filet and it was the best, most melt in your mouth steak i have ever had.  all the steaks, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, scallops and lobster were great.  the only critique i have is that my father's <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> was quite under done.  we should have sent it back, but he refused.  overall, a great place for fine dining, bring your $$$$.",

            "what's that expression that a lot of us foolhardy guys toss about as soon as we get to vegas? \"go big, or go home\"? it basically gives us a free pass to indulge in things that are extravagant, luxurious and potentially dangerous. and mastro's fits well within this criteria: the place holds meals fit for royalty, the decor is immaculate, and it can be hazardous to your wallet's health if you are not prepared. but for those of us still reading, and certainly for those of us who have had the honor, mastro's is a must-dine destination if you're in town.\n\nlocated pretty centrally in the city center shopping district, it's almost impossible to miss mastro's: the opulent, wood-like \"fishbowl\" perched precariously at an elevation is definitely eye-catching, and i'm pretty sure i inadvertently photobombed countless tourists as they stopped to take pictures of this structure, which is actually a dining room. before you can get to your table, you stop by a tiny hostess desk flanked by two gals who wasted no time getting us seated once we checked in with our reservation. you'll more than likely walk past an offshoot to another, more private dining room, a pretty spectacular bar and then make your way into the main dining room that is expertly laid out: whoever did the layout here did so in such a way that seating is maximized but not once does it feel crowded. and this is even more impressive when you consider the polished staff is zipping about without hesitation or collision.\n\nand let's talk about the staff, right quick: simply put, these are professionals who know their craft inside and out. our waiter, lionel, was the epitome of providing an exceptional customer service experience. we were -that- table that upfront told him we had a show to catch later that evening, and without missing a beat, he assured us he would keep us on schedule and would not let the meal be compromised. his service, along with the refills and bussing provided by other staff members, made for the best, most efficient dining experience i have seen yet in years of visiting vegas. add in a visit from a manager who just stopped by to chat and make sure everything was cool, and you have a place with a team that cannot be topped.\n\nbut all the friendliness and attention to detail means nothing if the food is bogus, and mastro's has this base covered, too. oh, do they ever. my folks started with a bowl of <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, while i went with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. all three were perfect pre-show snacks for the main courses, and just typing this sentence out is making me drool with fond remembrance. ahem. \n\nmom went with a <mark>Gulf Red Snapper</mark> that was cooked to perfection and my surf-and-turf combo of a filet and lobster tail (which lionel was gracious enough to de-shell table side like a boss) ranks among the best i've had at any place around the world. but the most surprising part was when dad sheepishly admitted he had somehow never had <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> before... and now that bar is set unfathomably high as his <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> here was his favorite meal of this trip. a side of <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> and <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark> rounded out dinner, and wiped out my stomach. somehow, my folks found room for mastro's signature dessert, a butter cake that made me question how a chef can bake happiness, joy and euphoria into one pastry. it's that good (even though i had two bites and almost went into a coma with the straight gin i was drinking).\n\ni cannot say enough positive things about mastro's. from the staff to the overall \"look\" of the place, and most assuredly the culinary satisfaction each plate offers, it's a place that rewards all those who stop by for a drink or a bite to eat. take those winnings from the casino and invest them here: i promise it's a much better deal than your favorite variation of blackjack.", 
            "what an amazing experience with mastro's!\\u00a0\nwe came in with a large party for a christmas dinner. this was most of my guests first time dining here. we had a view of the treehouse, love the architecture! there was no wait for a table.\\u00a0\nwe started with calamari, <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>. the bread basket was to die for! we enjoyed <mark>New York Strip</mark>, filet, chicken, artic char, and my favorite the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>! we had so many sides, they were all wonderful!\\u00a0\nour servers trista and daniel were wonderful. very friendly, always made sure we had a drink and were happy. and the manager luciana checked on us a few times making sure we were enjoying each course.\\u00a0\nbest dinner in vegas ever! can't wait to return!", 
            "went here for christmas dinner, very disappointed. food was not good. <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark> were outrageously huge (3x the size of jumbo shrimp, might want to note that on the menu) and too thick and chewy for me. i ordered my 8oz filet medium well; the waiter confirmed it would be lightly pink in the center, and it came out charred, crunchy and bone dry. absolutely terrible.  a proper steakhouse always asks you if the steak was cooked to your liking; my waiter never asked me. \n\nmy girlfriend ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, also overcooked, and she pushed it aside after a few bites.  this place specializes in steak and seafood?  what a joke. any high class restaurant in vegas blows this place away, i've eaten at almost all of them. of all the restaurants in the $100 per person class, i'd rate mastro's dead last. \n\nservice was good, albeit a little slow. the bright spots of our meal were the pretzel bread and chocolate pudding cake, they were delicious. dining in the birdhouse was nice, but not worth the terrible food.", 
            "although it is called mastro's ocean club, i actually think that one may be better off getting steak here.  i had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and felt as though it was pretty dry and maybe over cooked.  the appetizers / sides were all good, but the highlight for me was the dessert.  i had the vanilla cake, and it was outrageously good.  it was like a chocolate lava cake, but vanilla.  i never had anything like that before, and it was great.  if the main dish was better, mastro's would be a 4 star meal.\n\nthe prices were what one would expect.  by no means is it a cheap meal, but it was \"a-ok\" (for the price).  this has to be rated based on cost / enjoyment.", 
            "mastros you were very disappointing. we were very excited to give this place a try because of the reviews that were given. \n\nfirst off the service was horrible. and keep in mind i'm not asking for you guys to bend over backwards to keep us happy, but the attitude needs a lot of improvement from the host to the server. \n\ni didn't keep that in mind for long because we were here for the food anyway and i thought the food will make up for it. we order the hamachi appetizer, which was the only decent tasting dish. we ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> and scallop. they were all just super basic dishes. it was literally just a protein with no sauce whatsoever! i could have done this at home and this would have tasted better at a local bjs. i expected much better from you guys. \n\nthen when we were about to leave i asked for a box so i could take the bread to go so that we could snack on it later. i got attitude and was asked twice am i sure i did not want to take the courses to go. there's a reason why we didn't ask for box to go and we obviously thought it was not good enough to take it to go, and i understand why our server gave us attitude. he thought we were wasteful, but the food sucked so just leave us alone and don't ask twice with an attitude. \n\ni would skipped this place if you're in vegas, you can find much better places to eat around here. i understand sometimes it sucks to be working on a holiday or the weekend, but keep in mind we all work too and we spend good money to have a good meal out here too. we don't deserve any of this nasty attitude or food.", 
            "we went here last night for my girlfriend's birthday.  mixed feelings about our experience.  to start off with, the service was impeccable.  daniel and tim made sure to constantly check in and my water glass was never empty.  we started out with the strawberry mules which tasted good and strong.  we skipped an appetizer and just munched on the bread basket which was also tasty.  for dinner, we ordered the lobster mash and steamed broccoli to share as our family style sides.  our server came back to apologize that they were out of broccoli so we switched to spinach.  both were good.  we loved the lobster mash.\nfor our entrees, we ordered the 8oz <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, saut\\u00e9ed scallops and another fish dish that i cannot recall at this time.  my scallops were great.  my friend said the other fish i can't recall was great as well.  birthday girl had the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> and stated after her first bite that the quality of meat was definitely lacking.  after us all trying a bite, we agreed it did not taste like a very high quality meat.  the server confirmed it was corn fed beef sourced from various midwestern farms.  surprising for such a high quality restaurant to source corn fed beef.  the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> our other friend ordered was a bit over cooked making it dried out as well.  we mentioned our dislike of the steak to our server and he did apologize and offer to get us started on something else.  we were all sharing our meals and noted it was fine and we didn't need a replacement dish.  for dessert, we were treated to a happy birthday slice of chocolate cake (a bit dry) as well as the butter cake (which was phenomenal).  in the end, the steak was taken off our bill and both desserts were comped.  the service made our experience enjoyable despite some of our dishes being off.  5 stars for service, 3 stars for taste of food, 3 stars for price in comparison to quality of food.  unfortunately, not sure the price is worth the quality of food you receive at this one.", 
            "we were in vegas for a bachelorette party for one of my besties and decided on this place for our fancy dinner night. we had 11 girls and people ordered a variety of things from the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> to the bone-in steaks. this is one of those fancy places where you order just the protein and then sides are extra. here's the breakdown:\n\nbread basket - good. normally, i'm not a fan of loading up on carbs, but we were getting bottle service the night and i was already starving, so i had to put something in the stomach. i was pleasantly surprised at the freshness of the bread! so soft and slightly warmed.\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> - giant serving (probably enough for 2!). rich and creamy with actual chunks of lobster!\n\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> - good and buttery. it was a big serving size and i only finished probably half of it.\n\n<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> - good, but slightly under cooked according to my friend's order.\n\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> - i'm not really a fan of <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and these were okay. small pieces of lobster mixed in.\n\nsea salt & <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark> - pretty good! nice little break between bites of our main courses.\n\n<mark>Creamed Corn</mark> - pretty good! nice side dish without being overpowering.\n\nthe food was pretty good, but for a place of this caliber, i expected a lot more. they either under cooked or over cooked several steak orders, which had me thinking: what kind of steak house is this?!\n\nthe service was top notch at least and our bride-to-be got a special warm butter cake delivered to our table.\n\nwould i return? probably not.", 
            "my husband brought me here for an early valentine's dinner.  reservations were at 7:30 pm and we were seated immediately. we were seated in the half booth half tables that are right next to the bar. you know, the ones that are right on top of each other. i was annoyed, because i would think they would save these seats for walk-ins. i was determined to not let that upset me and i'm so happy i didn't. our waiter was awesome as was our food. they bring this beautiful bread basket with a variety of wonderful fresh bread, served with butter of course. \nwe started with the colossal dungeness crab which came out with dry ice so it was smoking. it was pretty neat. the crab was very fresh.  i drank water, but my ordered a double shot crown and coke. there was so much crown when the waiter brought the drink that he couldn't put but a splash of coke in it (sodas come in little aluminum bottles). i ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and my husband ordered the 12oz filet. we shared the garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and mushrooms. my <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was cooked to perfection and it was huge, i couldn't even finish it.  my husband's filet was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor.  the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> had a soft garlic flavor. they were my husband's favorite. the mushrooms were saut\\u00e9ed with rosemary. i've never had mushrooms with rosemary. it was a new flavor for me and i liked it. our waiter brought us the butter cake for dessert complimentary for dining with them. this was my favorite. it came with a ginormous side of homemade whipped cream. it was the greatest, most delicious thing i've had. i've been dreaming about it ever since! i love this restaurant and have told all my friends and family about it. definitely going back!",

            "best service and amazing food. my husband and i came for our anniversary and had a great time with good drinks and food. my <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> pan seared was cooked to perfection. my husband had the bone in filet which was not only cooked perfect but the flavor  was fantastic. simple yet flavorful and then the sides just amazing. the mac and cheese could be a meal in itself with how cheesy and delicious it was. the garlic mash so creamy and almost melted in your mouth. last but not least their signature desert, butter cake. to die for. came with home made whipped cream and vanilla ice cream.  highly recommend this restaurant.", 
            "my fiance and i went here to celebrate our engagement. his parents had gotten us a very generous gift card to use for exactly that purpose since they live far away and couldn't be here to celebrate with us.  based on all the great reviews, we decided to spend it here.\n\ni wouldn't go so far as to say it was the best steakhouse we've ever been to, but it was pretty damn good. we ordered blue point oysters, which were fresh and delicious. the <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> were absolutely to die for. it comes with bread to dip in the buttery sauce and it was so amazing.  then we ordered a filet, the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and gorgonzola mac n cheese. while still very tasty, each item had some issues.  the lobster in the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were a bit overcooked and slightly chewy.  the mac n cheese had no hint of gorgonzola at all and as soon as it slightly cooled while sitting at our table, the thick top layer of cheese became hard and rubbery.  the filet was good and perfectly cooked, but i've had much better steak elsewhere.  and last, the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> wasn't the melt in your mouth buttery bite of heaven as i expected. \n\nthe service is great. everyone said congratulations since we had put that we were celebrating our engagement in the reservation details. our server was super busy but she checked on us often. the ambiance is definitely strange as you're in a mall. it's really loud and not intimate at all. you're very close to other tables. ours was right on the back of a booth, and the guys in that booth kept accidentally knocking over our table lamp. \n\noverall, i'm really glad we tried it out, but will stick to our favorite next time we want to splurge on a dinner.", 
            "this is top notch dining. located in crystals at aria on the 2nd level. five of us came to celebrate a birthday last night and we requested the \"tree house\". this is a wooden structure which almost floats in the air, very unique for sure. \n\nwe were seated in the center and were lucky enough to get paul as our waiter. paul is everything in a waiter you could ever ask for. knowledgeable, very attentive, funny and yet professional giving us excellent service during our meal. \n\nhe was helpful when selecting wines as well as explaining the menu. i ordered the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> and the 22 oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. i love seafood and was planning on the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> but couldnt resist the ribeye. our table split sides of gorgonzola mac & cheese, creamed spincach and gnocci with alaskan king crab. \n\nthe <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> was excellent. served in a dish with 2 sauces and dry ice it comes out smoking. it was about 10 large pieces of crab ($28). the ribeye was also very good ($58), although a tad to fatty for me. it had good marbling like a ribeye should but parts were a bit too fatty. 3 of us ordered our steaks medium rare and they all came out rare. beware they do tend to undercook  a bit, but we all finished them as the meat was so good. \n\nthe gorgonzola mac and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> ($14) were both really good. we were a little disappointed with the gnocci however ($33). i found very little king crab in the dish but the flavor was there. for dessert we ordered 3 of mastro's famous butter cakes which come with vanilla ice cream. \n\npaul was nice enough to personalize one of the plates with a \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate. the butter cakes were awesome (and quite large). they can easily be split  between two or three people. \n\nmastro's provided us an excellent meal with outstanding service. the steaks could have been cooked a little longer but with that being about the only flaw the 5 stars are well deserved.", 
            "dinner in a treehouse! \n\nit was my first time visiting mastro's located in the shops at crystals.  this beautiful and elegant dining can be seen while walking through.  the 'treehouse' as they call it sits directly in the center so it's very hard to miss.  the wooden structure will catch your eye in a heartbeat.  \n\nwe made reservations for our group and were seated early.  i would like to give a tremendous thank you to paul our waiter.  i don't think i've ever been so entertained while receiving the best service anyone could ask for.  he went above and beyond to make our evening memorable. \n\nthe table is brought a bread basket which has 3 options. i will say their pretzel bread called my name.  i asked for more in which paul graciously brought an entire basket of just those.  fantastic! \n\ni started with the wedge salad.  perfect and delicious.  the crumbled bacon had a great flavor combined with the creamy blue cheese.  for my entree i chose the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> accompanied by <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, gorgonzola mac and cheese and <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>.  of course all of the sides are huge and were shared between all of our group.  the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was so light, fresh and baked perfectly.  the gnocchi was a disappointment.  i don't think there were any crab pieces in this. but the other two sides definitely made up for it.  they were so creamy.  anything with gorgonzola will make me happy. simply delicious!\n\nif the appetizer, bread basket or main meal didn't fill you up, they have a great dessert list.  on top of that list is their signature butter cake.  it's topped with vanilla bean ice cream with strawberry drizzled around the cake.  it's calorie free and fat free... in my dreams! it's moist and delectable.  after the huge meal, i would suggest splitting this huge cake.  \n\nmastro's delivered an impeccable meal with first class service.  it was surely a memorable evening!", 
            "wow! great food great atmosphere and amazing service. everything was prepared perfectly and was piping hot. the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was light and buttery while the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> was so savory my mouth is still watering two days later. wine list was sophisticated and the <mark>Clear Lobster Roll</mark> is a must get. would recommend for anyone who has $100 a person to spend on dinner.", 
            "i've debated about how many stars i should rate mastro's ocean club, technically it deserves one less due to what happened during my dinning experience here but the customer service made up for a lot of the mistakes.\n\ni was in vegas with my girlfriend who had been there for a company conference, it so happened to also be my birthday weekend and i wanted an amazing meal on my birthday before we headed back to la. mastro's had always been well recommended by friends and family so i was excited to have a birthday meal there. we have a few locations in the los angeles area but never had a opportunity to dine at one. \n\nwe arrived a few minutes after opening and were seated promptly, our server (i forget his name :( so sorry) was amazing! was very informative and accommodating. my girlfriend ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and one prawn. i had the bone in rib eye steak and we shared a side of green beans and asparagus. my girlfriend ordered a delicious drink and while i couldn't decide on what to have myself our waiter brought out a amazing whiskey drink for me. \n\nonce the food arrived it all looked so yummy, and here is when the problems began. i had ordered my steak medium rare, when i cut into the steak it was more medium / medium well. i thought maybe it was just the surrounding edges that were overcooked because that tends to happen with rib eye steaks. once i cut closer to the bone it was evident it was overcooked. i called over the waiter and quickly had my steak sent back and a new one was on its way out. my girlfriends <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was amazing but the prawn she ordered was overcooked. while i waited for my replacement steak to arrive the manager came to our table to offer their apologies which was much appreciated. my replacement steak took quite some time enough time for my girlfriend to finish her meal while i sat there waiting for my food. \n\nonce my new steak arrived i was eager to eat, the manager had them bring out fresh new sides which was unexpected but very appreciated. manager had me cut into the steak to see if it was cooked properly and sadly it was also overcooked. i was disappointed and as i cut further in to check the center of the steak it was evident this steak was overcooked as well as chewy. the manager acknowledged it was overcooked and offered a replacement but at this point i just wanted to eat! i told him it was ok and that i would finish my steak and be on our way, needless to say my steak was comped. a few minutes into my second steak the manager let me know that they had another steak for me and i should slow down on finishing this one. i advised him i had no desire for a third steak and that there was no way i could finish it but he insisted.\n\nmy third steak was brought out and my second was taken away, again the manager asked me to check the cook on this third steak. upon cutting into the steak it was raw, very raw...almost a blue steak. i was really disappointed at this point and the manager just walked away. our server came to our table and asked me \"do you like your steak like that?\" acknowledging how undercooked it was. at this point i was so upset that i just wanted to eat but could only finish a few extra bites. the manager brought out a free dessert with happy birthday written on the dish which was freaking delicious. the customer service is is really fantastic i can't stress that enough. drinks are fantastic and the wait staff is top notch! and the steak was fantastic the next day when i had to for lunch and was reheated to a proper temp ;) \n\ni'll definitely return here for a second meal regardless of all the problems i experienced as i truly believe they deserve a second chance and i'll update my review accordingly. thanks again to the staff at mastro's ocean club for great service and attention. special thanks to our waiter who was fantastic and to the manager who went above and beyond.", 
            "my wife and i came here for our anniversary and had a wonderful experience. we were happy with the service as well as the food. we were seated in the tree house as requested.  we started with the steamed mussles and bread basket. mussels were good however quite small. bread was aldo good no complaints. i had the 18oz <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>, oscar style something i've always wanted to try.  the amount of crab meat was generous and the bernaisse sauce was good. worth the extra $25.  my wife got the pan seared <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and it did not dissapoint. as for sides we ordered half orders of the lobster mash, green beans and the mushrooms. the amount of food was way too much for the two of us. the lobster mash was good but not worth the $18. we could've gone without it. better off using that money to get your steak oscar style. much more satisfying.  staff was professional and attentive. drinks were really good ad well. for dessert we got a complimentary butter cake which very good but we were to stuffed at that point to really enjoy it. \n\ni took one star away because i had my steak packed to-go for a midnight snack and when i open the box i find that there was only one piece of crab. i know i had at least 4-5 pieces left. i really wouldn't have been able to eat it all but it's the principle.\n\nanyway i would visit mastro's again but order less.", 
            "<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> is a must! the fillet mignon is superb too. unfortunately, my warm butter cake was way too hard and dry. even the ice cream didn't help the dryness.",

            "poor customer service. very rude hostess (asian young lady with dyed blond hair working on the evening of 09/26/15). no eye contact when we arrived, no eye contact as we were speaking to her. we understood that there were extremely busy during the time and we had to wait, but interaction with the first person you encounter makes a big difference in your whole experience. the first encounter ruined our whole dining experience. we made the mistake of staying because we were so hungry even though we had to wait an extra half hour even with reservations. we were hoping the service after the first encounter would be better but the whole experience just felt rushed. the food was so so. the one star is for the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which was excellent but the rest you can find at other similar restaurants. for the price you spend at a restaurant such as this, we expected better customer service at the very least.  would not recommend as there are much better coptions in vegas with similar menus, much better service, and much better ambiance (not in a mall).", 
            "good service. ok food. expensive.\n\nwent here on expense account with group of 12. love the look of the wooden structure but we were seated outside of it so it was more like eating in the aria mall (which is also beautiful but not as distinctive). very good bread. mixed seafood appetizer was nice, with all the classic things you would expect like lobster and prawns prepared adequately. jalape\\u00f1o sashimi was also added and was great. cocktails well prepared but not imaginative. \n\nfor dinner i had <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which was overcooked. when you order any of the fish, they ask if you want it pan seared or encrusted. therefore there is nothing imaginative about any of the fish entrees. it's just a piece of fish on a plate. i think this approach can work for steak, but i'd really rather the chef put some effort into a creative method and flavor for each fish on the menu.  sides were good but nothing noteworthy.\n\noverall par for the course for vegas. unjustifiably expensive food with service that is excellent but also a little pushy, so you end up with more food than you want to eat. very beautiful venue. none of the food or cocktails stood out.", 
            "the food here is sooooooooo good! all i have to say is go here! i had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and my boyfriend has the halibut and the were both amazing. we also had the tower with crab, lobster oysters and shrimp and everything was great! highly recommended!",

            "my hubby and i celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary here with my daughter and parents. we started off with mastro's seafood tower. you can create your own seafood tower to your liking and size. our seafood tower had shrimp, <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> and oysters. we all enjoyed especially my daughter; the cool dry ice effect and seafood tower presentation. the seafood was fresh and the oysters tasted amazing. my hubby had the <mark>Lemon Sole</mark>, my mom had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, my dad had the <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark>, i had <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> and my daughter got to sample a little bit of everything. we shared two sides family style of their signature <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (love this combo) and the other side dish of <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>. the seafood and chicken entrees and sides were served hot, fresh and perfectly seasoned. at the end, they complimentary served us their yummy signature warm butter cake dessert with vanilla ice cream and added happy anniversary wish which was a nice added personal touch. we had a wonderful time and food experience on our first visit here, and the service was friendly and excellent.",

            "let's begin with, this location is in the middle of a mall.. which alot of other reviewers have brought up i know - but it's the main reason for 4 stars instead of 5. it does get a bit loud and the view is of a shopping mall.. a high-end shopping mall, but still. not my ideal view for a such an awesome spot. it is what it is though!\n\nthe room itself is very nice, lots of seating, lively atmosphere, great looking staff. i have been a couple of times now and the service is always great when i have gone and the food spectacular. \n\ni have ben to ocean club a couple of times, but this most recent visit was a dinner of 'dungeoness <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark>', 'ribeye' and '10 oz <mark>Ahi Tuna Sashimi</mark>' . we shared everything with a side of sauteed spinach .. and a few martinis. :) i loved was the personal style serving from the individual pans that the food items were seemingly prepared in. the service staff has always been very pleasant and makes the experience very comfortable. \n\nthe ahi was fantastic with a really beautiful presentation laid out on a long plate with a finish of a really tasty sauce. the ribeye was prepared expertly, perfect medium rare with still  a beautiful grill flavor. the spinach was .. spinach, sauteed.. but was excellent nonetheless! haha.. i was having such a great time and enjoying the vibe of the place overall. \n\nthere was a piano player in the corner of the room playing standards and old-school vegas tunes.. sinatra and the like. it gave a beautiful feel to an elegant style dinner. my friends and i aren't the most refined diners, but we know how to have a good time, and maestro's made us feel welcome within that setting.\n\nnow don't get me wrong... this ain't your downtown steakhouse with a $4.99 steak special.. you will drop a pretty penny to have some seriously tasty grub.. but i do believe it's worth it.  at over $150 a head when we dined there last, it was worth the money but definitely be ready for a big bill. it's nearly unavoidable. \n\nhave a great time, and happy eating!", 
            "mastro's ocean club located in crystals at citycenter is absolutely the best place restaurant with the best service on the latest vegas business trip. in fact, i was more impressed with the non-swanky mall location than its orange county siblings.\n\nthe mall is incredibly quiet and the piano acoustics are phenomenal, making dinner at the bar or at a quiet table a very nice experience. victor is a great bartender and the service is wonderful. as with all mastro's, the wine list is incredible and goes on and on. tonight was a darioush cabernet starter night as i pondered this wonderful menu, trying to stay light and healthy, amongst some decadent alternatives. \n\neventually, i decided on a starter of <mark>Jalapeno <mark>Ahi Tuna Sashimi</mark></mark> which is <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>\nsliced sashimi style, topped with fresh squeezed key lime juice, thinly sliced jalapenos, and ponzu chili sauce. this is light despite looking like a lot of chili sauce. \n\nnext, a salad of beefsteak tomato and onion with balsamic was a refreshing without being super oldtime steakhouse heavy! \n\nfor an entree, i ordered another small plate: the <mark>Lobster Cocktail</mark> which is 1.25 pounds (including shells). now after eating all of this, i have slowed down and am just enjoying my wine when a couple of friends show up and we decide to end the evening with the <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> which are excellent.\n\nwhat an incredible meal, great services, great music and very relaxing.",

            "the name mastro's is known to a lot of people for their steaks already.  we happened to be in vegas for our anniversary, so we decided to have dinner there as our celebration.\n\nbecause this place is located at the city center right in the middle of the mall, so it doesn't carry the same kind of \"exclusiveness\" as the one in costa mesa or b hill.  dress code is also easier, only required hotel casual, so shorts and tees are welcome.\n\njust as mentioned by most, the staff are extremely polite and friendly, that was a great start already.  we got seated fairly quickly and our waiter brought us the wine / cocktail list quickly.  i asked for the mastro's mojito cocktail, which is rum with lime and mint.  it's not very strong and i like it a lot.\n\nwe were aware of the portion at mastro's, and since my wife is pregnant she can't eat too much.  so i asked the waiter if it's ok for us to split the steak and allow us to try more other dishes.  they were very understanding and said absolutely no problem at all.\n\nfor appetizer, we went ahead and ordered the <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark>.  we were both very very impressed with the dish.  three gigantic scallops, all prepared and seared to perfection, and the sauce was awesome together with the bread.  it was very rich and good.\n\nwe also ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, and they went ahead and split the soup between two bowls for us, that was very nice.  the waiter also came and helped us split the scallop appetizer on our dish, that's great service.  we also tried the pretzel bread together with the soup, they all paired together very well!!!!!!\n\nmy wife particularly loved the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.  she commented that a lot of times the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> she has is way too salty, but the one we had was just right.  very smooth and rich in lobster flavor, but it doesn't get overpowered by the saltiness.\n\nfor steak, we ordered the bone-in 18oz filet and we asked them to split a small portion for my wife (medium well).  mine was cooked medium rare.  it was simply fabulous.  meat was very tender and juicy, and even my wife's portion, though cooked medium well, was still very tender.  \n\nand i have to say one of the most important thing they did right was resting the steak well before serving.  most of the time when i eat steak, by the end it was juice all over the dish.  but not this time, all the juice was retained inside, that was awesome.\n\nwe also got the lobster mashed potato as side dish.  it's good, a lot of lobster as stated by others, though i agree with my wife, while it's good, for $36 bucks, it's basically lobster mixed with mashed potato.  it doesn't have that \"specialness\" in some sense.\n\nsince it was our anniversary, they gave us a big chocolate cake.  it was big, and it tasted really good too!\n\nat the end of the day, we were impressed with the dinner.  it's not cheap by any means, but for special occasions, the quality and quantity of food?  i think it's worth it.  although part of me still wonder how the experience would differ if we were to go to the one at costa mesa.", 
            "my wife and i celebrated her recent birthday here on monday evening 10/25/10 and enjoyed and amazing dinner that far exceeded our highest expectations. this new outpost of mastros is romantic and elegant with all of the true hallmarks of five star dining. \nwe have previously been to mastros in beverly hills and i much preferred this location as food and service were flawless as we've come to expect with the added touch of refinement and class that mastro beverly hills seems to lack with the nightclub atmosphere and hollywood infused scene. \n\nthe food:\n\nappetizer:\n\nseared <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> -  perfectly seared and prepared in a garlic cream sauce. accompanied by 2 garlic toasted bread crisps. delicous.\n\nentrees:\n\n<mark>Petite Filet</mark> (medium) - hers - simple but perfect. mastro's signature entree and they do it to perfection\n\n<mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> (medium rare) - mine -  i love lamb above all other meats and this is one of the best i can ever remember having. bold but not gamey it flavor.\n(jiraffe in santa monica is a close 2nd.)\n\nsides:\n\nsauteed mushrooms w/ onions  - sweet & earthy. the perfect compliment to tender filet & lamb when combined with mastro's fries. \n\nsea salt shoestring fries (no vinegar) - crisp and salty which just the right amount of texture.\n\ndessert - \n\nchocolate birthday cake - brought out complimetary. nothing special but a nice birthday gesture. \n\nwarm butter cake ala mode - you simply have to get this! \nno meal at mastro's would be complete without it. my wife talked about this for days before our meal and reminisced about it for days after. it's simply the best enormous warm, buttery sugar cookie you've ever had paired with the smoothest vanilla bean ice cream you can imagine.\n\n i have to say we left very impressed with our mastro's las vegas experience. it definitely raises mastro's to our favorite special occasion restaurant from now on (just not the beverly hills location.)with food, service and atmosphere this wonderful you just can't go wrong. \n\nnext up for us is mastros in thousand oaks.", 
            "we walked by the place early last week while shopping and exploring the city center.  love the ambiance, menu looked great, have heard great things about other locations so we decided to make this our last nights meal in vegas.  glad we did because aside from mix, and jr's this has now become one of our favorite places in vegas. i would not hesitate to recommend. \n\nseated in the main dining area right in the middle of the coolest structure for a restaurant you will ever see. warm dining room, very welcoming as were the staff. ours were a attractive redhead young lady and a younger guy.  piano playing jazzy christmas tunes, nice touch.  immediate introduction by the servers, it looked as if there were two for every table. we started with the house special martinis, served chilled and shaken at the table and blended perfectly. really, perfectly.  scanned the menu,  server came back by to check on the drinks and announced the specials. decided on the following:\n\nsaut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark>\nwarm spinach salad\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>\nny strip w/o bone\nlobster mashed \n\nscallops arrived, great presentation. now i love scallops, being in the pnw we have lots of choices on seafood and some of the best scallops i have ever had are at the barking frog near the woodinville winery and home of the famous herbfarm. these were excellent, large but not too, perfectly seasoned and prepared. all sitting on tip of the most wonderful cheese bread cracker in a wonderful sauce. yum! \n\nsalad arrived, again great presentation, just made, plate warmed just enough you could smell all the ingredients. now this was key. onion, egg, bacon and greens all perfectly aligned to emit this wonderful fragrance that just made your mouth water.  none of the heat or tartness you sometimes get with places putting too much red vinegar on the greens.  and the taste, i shit you not this was the best salad i have ever tasted. the senses alive with the fragrance and the taste perfectly aligned. \n\nsteak and bass arrived, simple but elegant in preso.  bowl of steaming potatoes with over a pound of lobster and a beautiful sauce. steak done to perfection, one of the best cuts and flavors i have had. and i am a steak house freak.  steak was severed still sizzling on the plate, little bit of butter on top on a simple white plate.  wife's <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was served equally as elegant. simply in presentation, nice cut of fish perfect flavor.  \n\nservice was just right, friendly, genuine there when needed. asked the server to choose a wine for me to pair with the steak. perfect choice came back again.\n\ni don't work for this place, wish i owned stock or had ownership though. this was by far one of the best dining experiences we have had all year. we will be back. \n\nthanks to the wonderful staff and happy holidays!", 
            "since i had a good experience at the mastro's steakhouse in oc, i decided to try this mastro's ocean club in las vegas and let me tell you, i had an even better experience.  it's probably due to the fact that i love seafood!!!\n\ni was tempted to get an appetizer tower but there were other things on the  menu that i wanted to try that were actually served hot so we opted out of the tower.  instead we ordered the following:\n\n*<mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> - (just as good as the first time i had it in oc)\n*<mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> - 3 pieces of jumbo scallops with three pieces of bread, in a rich creamy sauce.  amazing!!!  i just found out i'm moderately allergic to scallops but i love jumbo scallops so it doesn't stop me from trying them anyways. soo yummy.\n* chilled alaskan king <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> - came out served is a cool bowl with dry ice.  loved it.  way a lot more tasty than <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> or lobster option.  \n\nthis was definitely more than filling but it didn't stop me from ordering a <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> for my entree since my favorite fish are <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> or cod anything.  i'm use to ordering these type of fishes miso style but since it wasn't an option, i decided to order it pan seared.  it came out nice fluffy and buttery.  i ordered it cooked medium.  i really liked the consistency of the fish and how it was cooked but wouldn't have minded some type of sauce to give that extra umph.\n\nto be honest, i couldn't enjoy it as much because i was so stuffed!  i really wanted to try the infamous warm butter cake but i guess i'm just going to have to wait it out until the next time.  i will definitely come back :)", 
            "i came here for a nice dinner with a special person, and i absolutely loved it. \n\nfirst of all, the xmas decorations in the mall were amazing. set the mood very well for our dinner. we checked in with the hostess, and the hostess who walked us to our seats was very friendly. \n\nwe sat next to the live band, a lady singer and a guy pianist/singer. they played really good music ranging from older american pop songs to older r&b songs with their own twist. i couldn't help but to quietly sing along during dinner. \n\nwe ordered the following:\n\n1. <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> - this was the best <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> i've had in my life. they really don't skimp on the lobster meat either you would find huge chunks, and it was like digging for treasure! the meat was also cooked just right, and it was really fresh. if you go to this restaurant, this side dish is a must get if you like lobster. \n\n2. sauteed asparagus - pretty standard just got this dish to get some veggies. \n\n3. <mark>Petite Filet</mark> mignon - usually i like more flavorful cuts like ribeyes, and i don't really like filet mignons because they are lean. however this steak was so tender and cooked just right. i enjoyed it a lot. it was just the right portion, 8 oz, since i wasn't too hungry.\n\n3. <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> - i had a small bite, the scallop was cooked just right, medium rare, and the meat was so sweet!!\n\ndefinitely recommend to come here on a special occasion, or if you won from gambling!", 
            "delicious! i started with conundrum mixed white from cali, then had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> ponzu (freaking amazing) and the jalepeno tuna shashimi... both are amazing appetizers. i then ordered the <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> and the side of brown butter brussel sprouts... i've never had a side as good as those brussel sprouts! addicting. i was dreaming about them last night! the scallops are in a butter sauce that i could drink! thankfully they serve the dish with bread to soak up some of the amazing sauce! please do yourself a favor and visit this restaurant! the staff is amazing!", 
            "how can anyone not love this place?  \n\namidst yelp's spring break festivities and other dining excursions we had in vegas, the dining experience at moc was one of the most memorable.  \nfrom the amazing \"eighth wonder of the world\" tree house we were sitting in, to a generous martini offering, to excellent overall service....it was beyond a five star experience. and i haven't even scratched the surface yet.   \n\nwith all the eating going on in vegas, i could have been very content with just their fresh pretzel rolls and a fantastic campagna burrata salad.  \nbut i couldn't resist and...\n\n...order more pretzel rolls.  they were just too addicting.\n...try their brussel sprouts.  lightly salted to perfection.\n...taste the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  one order can feed an army.  \n...sample their <mark>Petite Filet</mark>.  medium rare truly melted in my mouth.\n...and savor the seared <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark>.  cooked just right with an orgasmic garlic butter sauce.

            "purpose of the visit: our signature meal event for the weekend get away with the guys. chose this place as an alternative to the meat temples that are typically selected and it was also close to the aria. the atmosphere was interesting, very open and spacious overlooking parts of city cent. the birdhouse was an interesting design and seating experience. we ordered mussels, <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> and sushi <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> ponzu. the ponzu was excellent lightly fried and tender. <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark> also was nicely flavored. main course was blackened <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. grilled <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was very flavorful. sides w french fries, saut\\u00e9ed spinach, desert was also fantastic. warm buttered cake was a great way to finish the meal.  atmosphere was lively and supported by a nice two person live band that sang some nice good old rock and roll covers.",

            "the las vegas-mastro's ranks among our top dining experiences anywhere in the world.  on this labor day weekend visit, our initial disappointment, of not being seated in the unique & always fascinating \"tree-house\", was quickly extinguished by shauna, our culinary captain extraordinaire, menu \"tour guide\" and libation/wine aficionado.  turns out... our \"terrace\" seating near the piano bar was as enjoyable as it was entertaining, resulting in yet another \"positively outrageous\" fine dining adventure.\n\nshauna introduced us to mastro's participation in \"las vegas restaurant week\", a worthy nationwide charity drive to raise money for & donate meals to 3-square food bank in southern nevada.  she offered a special 4-course dinner deliciously flanked by beefsteak tomato & onion salad, an 8 oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> & garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and key lime pie all for a reasonable price, part of which was ultimately donated for a worthy cause.  \n\nas there were 5 of us on this visit, the aforementioned special meal was joined by collection of our menu favs and shauna's recommendations. she perfectly paired our appetizers & meals with wonderful riesling, cabernet, and sauvignon blanc.\n\nsooo, included in the culinary delight were: the legendary seafood tower (ohhh yes!!), <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (best in class!), <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark> (delightful), <mark>New York Strip</mark> (absolute perfection), <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> (sweet & outa this world), saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> (oh yeah!), <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (buttered and seasoned to perfection), saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms ( a fav of favs), <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> (these aren't yo mama's sprouts, believe it!), 1 lb. <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> (huge), triple chocolate layer cake (nothing but delish), and...(drum roll)... the mastro's signature warm butter cake!!...once again to die for!!!\n\nwithout fail, and to paraphrase the writings of t. scott gross,... mastro's was again a \"positively outrageous\" dining experience where the culinary expectations were always far exceeded.  shauna's unsurpassed service & superior guidance was unexpected, delivered-at-random, fun, entertaining, and so very memorable!  it doesn't get any better!", 
            "i wanted to try mastro's for two reasons: (1) if possible, i would gorge myself to death on seafood; and (2) i wanted to eat in the weird looking treehouse in crystals.\n\ni got both (except for death...unless....).\n\nthe ambiance of this place is weird, to say the least.  a few tables are enclosed in a traditional restaurant space with, you know, walls.  the rest are inside the \"treehouse,\" a very cool, wood-slated structure dangling in the middle of crystals.\n\nalthough very cool looking, it's very loud.  in between the awwfffulll live music (really, they need to stop that) and the echo of everyone's conversations (no walls = no muffling of noise), it's almost difficult to have a conversation.  i would say this is not a romantic spot to eat.  \n\nthere were also lots of middle-aged dudes in jeans.  like, packs of them.  very weird.\n\nfood\n\nas we were in a \"small plate\" mood, we went crazy on the appetizers as follows:\n\n<mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> ($22)- three medium-sized scallops, three slices of parmesan toast, diced tomatoes and cream sauce.  unfortunately, the scallops were a tad overcooked and chewy. i'd probably pass on scallops next time.\n\nbeef bone marrow (around $18) - two huge bones and baguette toast.   delicious, decadent and full of flavor.  we gobbled it all up.\n\n<mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> encrusted in sesame seeds and served with julienned carrots ($22).  overall, it lacked flavor although perfectly cooked. \n\nwedge salad - ($12) big portion and very good.  i liked that they didn't cover the iceberg in dressing and instead left it on the bottom of the plate, surrounding the salad.  this allowed the diner to control how much dressing on each bite.  the dressing was a tad watery, the way i like it. well executed.  but, it's a salad, so......\n\nthen we got a half and half side of the following (they give you a half portion of each to let you try everything ($38):\n\nking crab black truffle gnocci - salty, rich and so delicious.  lots of king crab chunks. my favorite thing i tried.\n\nlobster cheese <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> -although rich, it wasn't that flavorful. mostly salty, not complex. i did love the enormous pieces of lobster, though. \n\ni have to add they were really generous with the wine pour ($12 for a glass of shiraz).\n\noverall, good service and big portions.  it's a bit pricey but they serve up some tasty food.  \n\ndefinitely come here if you're 40 and have a penchant for denim.  this is your mecca.", 
            "***short version of this review***\n\nmastro's is the cheesecake factory of fine dining.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n***long version of this review***\n\ni dropped by mastro's in the crystals mall for a quick dinner before a night on the town.  i'd heard of the mastro's chain before, especially their swanky steakhouses in orange county and la, but this was my first time hearing of their seafood restaurant.  it seemed like the perfect opportunity to lose my mastro's virginity without being subjected to massive slabs of red meat.\n\nfirst thing's first -- mastro's is enormous, and it's absolutely stunning.  in terms of architectural design, this place is a feast for the eyes.  the interior of the restaurant is bold and stunning.  much of the dining room is suspended over the rest of the mall in a giant wooden \"treehouse\".  i sat at the bar, which was a veritable mountain of mirrors and glass.  just being at mastro's feels glamorous.\n\nafter being seated, i ordered a glass of the \"grace lane\" riesling (which was fabulous) and was promptly offered a complementary breadbasket, filled with pretzel bread, toasted baguette, and various other goodies.  \n\ni noticed that most of the plates being carted around the restaurants were pretty large, so i decided to build a dinner out of two different appetizers.  i opted for the <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> and the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tostada.\n\nneedless to say, two appetizers were more than enough food, since these so-called \"appetizers\" were really entree portions.  the <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> included 3 giant scallops, soaking in a rich and buttery sauce and served alongside huge slabs of cheesy baguette.  the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tostada was actually 3 separate tostadas, each loaded to the hilt with big-<mark>Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna</mark>, avocado, and ponzu chili sauce.\n\nof the two dishes, i preferred the scallops, which were simply prepared and oh so silky and indulgent.  the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tostada was less enjoyable, since the tuna was served warm and had a slightly mealy consistency.  \n\nservice was efficient, formal, and bland -- fairly typical for a chain restaurant, but especially a vegas chain restaurant.  \n\nall in all, i'd really glad i had the chance to experience mastro's for the first time.  the behemoth portions, straightforward food, and stiff service felt like cheesecake factory -- not a bad place per se, but not somewhere that i'd visit on the reg, either.", 
            "what a great spot!\n\nwe made 9 pm reservations for dinner after the zarkana cirque du soleil show at the neighboring aria.  no vegas trip is complete without a nice dinner, and we couldn't have picked a better spot for what we were looking for that night: delicious food and wine in a classy, yet relaxed atmosphere.   located within the crystals shopping complex, you don't get amazing views of strip, but the environment still exudes class and modern decor.\n\nwe had the works.  a bottle of pinot shared among the three of us while we nibbled on the best damn bread assortment i've seen.  two salads: caesar and a wedge, standard fare and did not disappoint.  and then....drumroll....the entrees!  juicy, thick <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> for my two burly man-pals, who both only ate about half before conceding to the dish's fate as leftovers.  and for myself: perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, jumbo <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> sauteed in a rich butter sauce and served with a few parmesan-crusted crostinis.  crisp golden brown on the surface while tender and delicate within, the plate came with about 6 jumbo scallops, but try as i might, i couldn't finish the dish for lack of stomach space!  wonderful side pairings of garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and sauteed mushrooms to share.\n\nabsolutely no room for dessert.  it was a fantastic meal.",

            "my fiance and i went here to celebrate our engagement. his parents had gotten us a very generous gift card to use for exactly that purpose since they live far away and couldn't be here to celebrate with us.  based on all the great reviews, we decided to spend it here.\n\ni wouldn't go so far as to say it was the best steakhouse we've ever been to, but it was pretty damn good. we ordered blue point oysters, which were fresh and delicious. the <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> were absolutely to die for. it comes with bread to dip in the buttery sauce and it was so amazing.  then we ordered a filet, the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and gorgonzola mac n cheese. while still very tasty, each item had some issues.  the lobster in the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were a bit overcooked and slightly chewy.  the mac n cheese had no hint of gorgonzola at all and as soon as it slightly cooled while sitting at our table, the thick top layer of cheese became hard and rubbery.  the filet was good and perfectly cooked, but i've had much better steak elsewhere.  and last, the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> wasn't the melt in your mouth buttery bite of heaven as i expected. \n\nthe service is great. everyone said congratulations since we had put that we were celebrating our engagement in the reservation details. our server was super busy but she checked on us often. the ambiance is definitely strange as you're in a mall. it's really loud and not intimate at all. you're very close to other tables. ours was right on the back of a booth, and the guys in that booth kept accidentally knocking over our table lamp. \n\noverall, i'm really glad we tried it out, but will stick to our favorite next time we want to splurge on a dinner.",

            "went to ocean club for dinner on our last nite in las vegas-had been there before and loved it. well, this time it was even better than we remembered!  almost as soon as you sit down, the waiter brings an amazing bread basket with the prize being the hot pretzel bread.  we split the bacon wedge blue cheese salad and my wife had the <mark>Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna</mark> rare. it was a huge portion of incredible, slightly seared sashimi. i ordered the new york medium and it was perfect medium with no grizzle or fat.  it comes on a plate that is 400 degrees with clarified butter on the bottom. i can honestly say it was one of the best steaks i've ever eaten. sure its $50 bucks, but i've had lots of crappy 50 dollar steaks in my life and this was worth every penny.  we ordered the side dish that the waiter suggested.-home made gnocchi with either lobster or crap meat and <mark>Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese</mark>. maybe the best 29 dollars i've ever spent!  we had a great bottle of merlot and unfortunately, couldn't finish all of  the food so we passed on the amazing selection of desserts but will leave room for one next time. and no, i'm not related to the owners!  just had a fabulous meal and want to share our experience!!", 
            "***short version of this review***\n\nmastro's is the cheesecake factory of fine dining.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n***long version of this review***\n\ni dropped by mastro's in the crystals mall for a quick dinner before a night on the town.  i'd heard of the mastro's chain before, especially their swanky steakhouses in orange county and la, but this was my first time hearing of their seafood restaurant.  it seemed like the perfect opportunity to lose my mastro's virginity without being subjected to massive slabs of red meat.\n\nfirst thing's first -- mastro's is enormous, and it's absolutely stunning.  in terms of architectural design, this place is a feast for the eyes.  the interior of the restaurant is bold and stunning.  much of the dining room is suspended over the rest of the mall in a giant wooden \"treehouse\".  i sat at the bar, which was a veritable mountain of mirrors and glass.  just being at mastro's feels glamorous.\n\nafter being seated, i ordered a glass of the \"grace lane\" riesling (which was fabulous) and was promptly offered a complementary breadbasket, filled with pretzel bread, toasted baguette, and various other goodies.  \n\ni noticed that most of the plates being carted around the restaurants were pretty large, so i decided to build a dinner out of two different appetizers.  i opted for the <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> and the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tostada.\n\nneedless to say, two appetizers were more than enough food, since these so-called \"appetizers\" were really entree portions.  the <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> included 3 giant scallops, soaking in a rich and buttery sauce and served alongside huge slabs of cheesy baguette.  the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tostada was actually 3 separate tostadas, each loaded to the hilt with big-<mark>Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna</mark>, avocado, and ponzu chili sauce.\n\nof the two dishes, i preferred the scallops, which were simply prepared and oh so silky and indulgent.  the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tostada was less enjoyable, since the tuna was served warm and had a slightly mealy consistency.  \n\nservice was efficient, formal, and bland -- fairly typical for a chain restaurant, but especially a vegas chain restaurant.  \n\nall in all, i'd really glad i had the chance to experience mastro's for the first time.  the behemoth portions, straightforward food, and stiff service felt like cheesecake factory -- not a bad place per se, but not somewhere that i'd visit on the reg, either.", 
            "the service and food were incredible.  this meal was worth every penny. we started with the wedge salad. my husband and i split the salad,  which i'm glad we did because it was large.  for the entree i had the <mark>Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna</mark> served sushi style and it was fantastic.  we ordered the sweet potato side dish and it was heaven in a bowl.  i will eat here again the next time we are in vegas.", 
            "the food and service was on point here at mastro's. \n\ni always heard great things about it and i am so glad i finally tried it. \n\nto start, i had the <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark>. although the mussels were small the sauce and cheeses croutons were incredible. i took advantage of all the various breads they had in the basket just to dip in the sauce and\nindulge more. \n\nfor dinner i had the <mark>Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna</mark> served sashimi style. it was seared with asian inspired flavors and didn't make you feel so heavy. i will say that it is a quite a portion and initially seeing it can be overwhelming. \nthey warn about the size of the side portions so please think it through or else you will have way too much. i had a table of 4 and we battled to eat everything cause it was yummy but man i came out of there a fatty wack. i loved the cream corn and <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. done deal with those two! i had the lobster mash and yes it had big chunks of lobsters and it was good but not as great as it's hype was. we also had saut\\u00e9ed broccoli and honestly it looked steamed. they serve you the sides which i thought was a great service. \n\nthey gave us their signature butter cake. topped with ice cream and fresh fruit with a side of whipped cream. if you even last this long to have dessert then order it. warning-the portion is again good for 3-4 person so think it through before you order. \n\ni would highly recommended this place. it's ambiance is okay because it still does feel like you are still in the shopping area even though you can't see it too much. great service and great food. you really can't go wrong."

            "food poisoning!!! it was my birthday dinner no less. we had heard good things about this city place seafood restaurant so we gave it a try. i ordered the breaded <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. first, my fish didn't taste right and was on the cold side. i sent it back and they cooked it a little bit more and brought back the same fish but it still tasted wrong so i asked them to take it away. i only had 4 or 5 bites total and thankfully no more b/c i can't imagine how sick i would have been if i had eaten the whole thing or even half! i asked my husband to taste it before i sent it back and his stomach felt unsettled all night but he didn't get sick like me! the \"took off\" my <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> but when we got the bill my they charged us for the fish special of the evening ($57). my fish was supposed to be $47 and my husband ordered the blackened <mark>Gulf Red Snapper</mark> ($44 i think). i felt so bad by the end of dinner i didn't even get to have a birthday desert.\n\ntheir <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> were overly salty (appetizer) but good sized. the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were good and my husbands fish was seasoned well and didn't get him sick. save the overpriced meal and associated stomach ache and go somewhere else.", 
            "we had dinner one night at mastro's, and what a great choice!  i can honestly say everyone on staff made our dining experience a complete delight.\n\nfor dinner i got the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>, <mark>Gulf Red Snapper</mark>, and the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark>.  in addition, our server also brought some warm, fresh bread out to the table.  everything was so good.  truly, the fish was so fresh i would not be surprised if it had been caught that very same day.  the seasoning on all the food was perfect, and i didn't have to add salt, pepper or anything.  truly tantalizing.  the portions were also large.  the potato was definitely big enough to split with at least one other person.\n\nto top off my experience, someone from the restaurant actually called me the next day to ask how our experience was!  that was a first for me, and i was majorly impressed.  the next time i go back to vegas, we will definitely be stopping in at mastro's again.", 
            "my girlfriend and i fell in love with this place for several reasons.  the staff, the atmosphere, and the food combined to bring us back the next night as well  we were able to make reservations through yelp and opentable but we arrived early each night and sat in the first come, first serve bar area.  the piano entertainment was first class. our server, racqel, was always timely, willing to meet our every request, and helpful in navigating the menu to ensure we got the most of the food choices we desired with the least amount of waste.  her name escapes me now but there was a corporate employee there the second night who recognized us from the night before.  she not only bought our first round of drinks but when we were leaving insisted we try their \"butter cake\" so much so that she ended up giving it to us.  very good stuff. i can't imagine anyone not feeling good upon receipt of this restaurant \"regular\" type of treatment on a 3 day, 2 night trip.  sheri and i can't wait to return to town and visit the place again!  i highly recommend any of the <mark>Filet</mark>, shriimp cocktail, king crab, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, gorgonzola mac and cheese, and the <mark>Gulf Red Snapper</mark>.  they will split any plate they have, upon request.", 
            "staying at the aria and a small group of us went to mastros for dinner. no reservation so sat at high top in bar area. i had the griller <mark>Gulf Red Snapper</mark> which was well prepared. a couple split a filet and other had chop salad and all said great. the cocktails were friendly and plentiful with quick service. i split mac and cheese with a buddy but we only ate half despite great flavor. a little expensive but would definately do again.", 
            "what's that expression that a lot of us foolhardy guys toss about as soon as we get to vegas? \"go big, or go home\"? it basically gives us a free pass to indulge in things that are extravagant, luxurious and potentially dangerous. and mastro's fits well within this criteria: the place holds meals fit for royalty, the decor is immaculate, and it can be hazardous to your wallet's health if you are not prepared. but for those of us still reading, and certainly for those of us who have had the honor, mastro's is a must-dine destination if you're in town.\n\nlocated pretty centrally in the city center shopping district, it's almost impossible to miss mastro's: the opulent, wood-like \"fishbowl\" perched precariously at an elevation is definitely eye-catching, and i'm pretty sure i inadvertently photobombed countless tourists as they stopped to take pictures of this structure, which is actually a dining room. before you can get to your table, you stop by a tiny hostess desk flanked by two gals who wasted no time getting us seated once we checked in with our reservation. you'll more than likely walk past an offshoot to another, more private dining room, a pretty spectacular bar and then make your way into the main dining room that is expertly laid out: whoever did the layout here did so in such a way that seating is maximized but not once does it feel crowded. and this is even more impressive when you consider the polished staff is zipping about without hesitation or collision.\n\nand let's talk about the staff, right quick: simply put, these are professionals who know their craft inside and out. our waiter, lionel, was the epitome of providing an exceptional customer service experience. we were -that- table that upfront told him we had a show to catch later that evening, and without missing a beat, he assured us he would keep us on schedule and would not let the meal be compromised. his service, along with the refills and bussing provided by other staff members, made for the best, most efficient dining experience i have seen yet in years of visiting vegas. add in a visit from a manager who just stopped by to chat and make sure everything was cool, and you have a place with a team that cannot be topped.\n\nbut all the friendliness and attention to detail means nothing if the food is bogus, and mastro's has this base covered, too. oh, do they ever. my folks started with a bowl of <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, while i went with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. all three were perfect pre-show snacks for the main courses, and just typing this sentence out is making me drool with fond remembrance. ahem. \n\nmom went with a <mark>Gulf Red Snapper</mark> that was cooked to perfection and my surf-and-turf combo of a filet and lobster tail (which lionel was gracious enough to de-shell table side like a boss) ranks among the best i've had at any place around the world. but the most surprising part was when dad sheepishly admitted he had somehow never had <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> before... and now that bar is set unfathomably high as his <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> here was his favorite meal of this trip. a side of <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> and <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark> rounded out dinner, and wiped out my stomach. somehow, my folks found room for mastro's signature dessert, a butter cake that made me question how a chef can bake happiness, joy and euphoria into one pastry. it's that good (even though i had two bites and almost went into a coma with the straight gin i was drinking).\n\ni cannot say enough positive things about mastro's. from the staff to the overall \"look\" of the place, and most assuredly the culinary satisfaction each plate offers, it's a place that rewards all those who stop by for a drink or a bite to eat. take those winnings from the casino and invest them here: i promise it's a much better deal than your favorite variation of blackjack."

            "this was the most over rated restaurant i have ever dined at.  the food was just ok. actually the pretzel rolls were the best part of the meal.  my husband's <mark>Lemon Sole</mark> was over cooked and his <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> was just ok.  i had the tomatoes and buratta cheese.  the cheese was very good.  my <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark>:  one baked and one in a vanilla batter were both over cooked.  we shared the butter cake which was good but not spectacular.  along with this our service was horrible.  we had to ask for bread which eventually came had no butter with it.  we had a different person for each course and were totally ignored in between.  in the meantime a woman manager in a business suit and the waiter were busy fawning over the people at the next table.  eat at sinatra's if you want a first class meal and exceptional service.\nrenee p.", 
            "my hubby and i celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary here with my daughter and parents. we started off with mastro's seafood tower. you can create your own seafood tower to your liking and size. our seafood tower had shrimp, <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> and oysters. we all enjoyed especially my daughter; the cool dry ice effect and seafood tower presentation. the seafood was fresh and the oysters tasted amazing. my hubby had the <mark>Lemon Sole</mark>, my mom had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, my dad had the <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark>, i had <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> and my daughter got to sample a little bit of everything. we shared two sides family style of their signature <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (love this combo) and the other side dish of <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>. the seafood and chicken entrees and sides were served hot, fresh and perfectly seasoned. at the end, they complimentary served us their yummy signature warm butter cake dessert with vanilla ice cream and added happy anniversary wish which was a nice added personal touch. we had a wonderful time and food experience on our first visit here, and the service was friendly and excellent."

            "excellent \n\ncame here with a party of 30 so i got to sample everything. we reserved their private dining room and it was fantastic. service was great, the room was perfect because we could be as loud as we wanted, and the food stole the show. \n\nmust have....... would be their seafood platter. it's a 3 tier platter that comes with dry ice giving that smoky, cloudy look. it came with oysters, shrimp, <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>, and lobster over a bed of shaved ice. \n\nthe bone in rib eye, bone in kansas city, and bone in fillet were all perfectly cooked and seasoned. do not get the fish here. the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was a little overcooked and dry. then again, why the hell would you order fish at a steakhouse? \n\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> was great but not when this cost more than the entrees. i was told that this dish was featured in entourage and a few other magazines. \n\nwe celebrated 8 birthdays so the staff gave us 8 individual desserts which was very nice of them. their butter cake was to die for. my god that was good. their bread pudding and apple crisp were also very delicious.", 
            "wow i was pretty impressed with this place and i've done my share of dining in vegas. the decor was modern and in the middle had this treehouse area where there are more tables. that night, they happened to have the treehouse rented out so there was live music playing which got a bit annoying since it was loud. that was my main complaint. \n\non to the food. we started with the seafood tower and i wasn't even hungry going into this dinner but i gobbled everything up. it had jumbo <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, kunumoto oysters, <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark>, lobster, and <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>, the works. it was presented with dry ice. they served it with cocktail sauce, this mustard sauce and atomic horseradish, when you mix all 3 it was a pretty good sauce that way too. \n\ni was pretty full so i opted to get a salad and i chose the iceberg salad. now i have to say i always get dressings on the side but this dressing was a red wine vinaigrette but it was creamy looking. the waitress said it was emulsified but there was no cream in it. it was the best salad dressing i have ever had! i think i wanted to dip every lettuce in a spoonful of dressing, that's how much i liked it.  it just had this tangy taste (from the red wine) but a smooth creamy texture but it had no creme. yum!\n\ni tried my bf's steak and he had the rib eye and it was delicious, melt in your mouth meat. our favorite steak houses in vegas are michael's (southpoint) and cut (palazzo) but i think mastro's takes the cake on this. we had so many sides, potato's au gratin, snow peas, yam fries, mac and cheese but i heard the gnocci here was delicious from the rest of our party although i was too stuffed to try. \n\nbut the best part of dinner was the dessert! we had the warm butter cake, it tasted like a mix of pound cake and maybe cheesecake but it is served with vanilla ice cream and had a creamy inside, and sugar flakes line the cake to give it texture. oh and it comes with homemade whip cream! i think that was better than the ice cream, i wanted to eat gobs of it. \n\nthis is definitely a favorite now although the seafood tower is very pricey, it was probably half of the price of the meal, and we were with a party of 10. n", 
            "stopped in to mastro's ocean club recently on a work related dinner.  we got to sit under the tree house that overlooks the crystals shopping center.\n\nafter waiting about 15 minutes to be seated, we started with the seafood tower because nothing says over the top lv dining like a seafood tower.  on this tower were jumbo shrimp, a variety of <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>, and some oysters.  served on the side were a traditional cocktail sauce, their atomic horseradish, and a mustard sauce.  i was a little too liberal with the horseradish sauce and can confirm that the \"atomic\" description is accurate.\n\nfor my main, i went with the ribeye steak and the table ordered a variety of sides: lobster mac and cheese, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, gnocchi, asparagus, and au gratin potatoes.  \n\nunfortunately, the highlight of my meal were a few of the sides.  i really enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese, the gnocchi, and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, all of which were excellent.  but my steak left a little to be desired.  it was flavorfull, but the piece of meat simply had too much gristle.  i appreciate a bit of fat on my steak, but this piece of meat had just a bit too much on and i had to cut around quite a bit of my meal.  based on the other reviews, it sounds like my experience may have been out of the ordinary, but from my experience, there are better places to try in lv.", 
            "seems like i've been on a steak kick recently, which makes me realize that my stomach and wallet are inversely proportional. after visiting gordon ramsay and old homestead recently my gut has increased exponentially while my wallet is shrinking dramatically. mastros, of course, had the same effect.\n\nour party of four dined family-style and sampled the following:\n\na dozen oysters (kusshi and bluepoint). all were delicious but, personally, i prefer the smaller kusshi.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> was beautifully presented in a cylindrical stack with, perhaps, too much avocado, but contained plenty of fresh tuna and a variety of textures and flavors.\n \nocean club crab cake. there was very little filler, nice big chunks of lump meat, and a perfectly balanced tartar sauce.\n\nthe scallops were too rich and buttery and was drowning in sauce. the accompanying toast was deliciously crisp and cheesy.\n\nthe 22 oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, cooked medium-rare, was tender and had a decent amount of fat, as was to be expected. a solid steak, but not as mind-blowing as the beef from the top steakhouses around town.\n\n<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. a little dense with a rich, cheesey truffle flavor. pieces of crab were scarce, but there were plenty of gnocchi for the four of us to share.\n\n<mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>. 5 large legs, slightly warm, with clarified butter and lemon. each yielded plenty of tender meat.\n\nthat was plenty of food for all of us, but we couldn't leave without trying their infamous warm butter cake. it was large enough for each of us to get a few bites. it came with a ridiculously large side of fresh whipped cream. i was expecting the cake to have a very moist texture, but instead it was a bit more firm with a slightly crispy exterior. the flavor was as sweet and buttery as you would expect. as delicious as it was, it's not something that my arteries and heart can take too frequently.\n\nmastors is pricey, but not as pricey as other steak or seafood houses along the strip. the atmosphere isn't the greatest either. it is located in the center of a shopping mall, afterall. there's no dim, mood lighting. just the bright florescent  lights of the mall. the tree house thing looked cool, so request that if you have the chance. we sat just outside of it and it had all the appeal of eating at a food court.\n\nthere was also live entertainment in the lounge area when we dined. i had to do a double-take because the girl performing looked like aubrey o'day. i didn't stick around long enough to see if she had the voice or attitude to match.\n\ni'm not sure how this mastros compares to the ones in california that people rave about, but relative to vegas steakhouses it's a solid option. it's a step below the top ones in town, but is great for seafood and, of course, the butter cake.", 
            "as a party planner, i do not gratuitously provide 5-star ratings. however, i believe mastro's ocean club to be the perfect location for an intimate dinner party in las vegas. we booked the private rooms upstairs for a reception and sit-down dinner for a party of 40 on saturday, september 15, 2012 and our discerning guests who came from all around the country could not have been more pleased with the entire experience.  we were expertly guided from start to finish by carly smith, director of events. carly was assessable, professional, flexible and an essential resource regarding local vendors to compliment the comprehensive services offered by mastro's.  the ambiance was charming and elegant... photos of the gorgeous chandeliers, golden leather seats and flat screens which are viewable on their website, do not do this venue any justice.  we were in full view of the delightfully lit tree house and even the restrooms which came with very courteous attendants, were a pleasant surprise. their technology is also top of the line. all we needed to do was bring our slide show on a flash drive and our ipad playlist and our music soared through the rooms and our slideshow displayed brilliantly on two flat screens. mastro's provided all of the equipment and cords and made it easy for us to make our party truly surround sound fun!  no event is a success without delicious food and this is where mastro's clearly shines brightly. we started with an extraordinary seafood tower and brochetta during the reception. guests could not get enough of the colossal shrimp and split/<mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> and the wait staff kept everyone's wine glass full which added to the fun and excitement during the reception. as we moved into dinner, the asparagus tempura seemed to disappear from the tables as guests ordered their choice of salads and entrees. and, talk about entrees...the generous portions of prepared-to-order salmon, chicken, steak or sword fish provided additional shock and awe. even the side dishes, saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms, saut\\u00e9ed broccoli and garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were absolutely delicious. in addition to carly smith, we also have the highest praise sherie ritzler, general manager, brandon s., banquet captain, as well as, l.r, alex and all of the wait staff and hostesses.", 
            "while in vegas for a friend's birthday, we decided to have a nice dinner and settled on steak. after reading about mastro's, i made a reservation, and we were seated in the large wooden structure thing. screw it, i'm just gonna go straight to the steak.\n\nwhen our waiter mentioned that their special was an a5 grade 33oz. wagyu tomahawk, i was sold. it's basically a thick cut, <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, and i knew i was in for something special just by looking at it. the first thing that immediately caught my attention was the rim - it was humungadunga. normally, the rim just encircles the outer edge of about half the eye, but this rim was almost the same size as the eye! why is this such a big deal? of all the steak cuts, the rim of the ribeye is the absolute best tasting piece in the entire beef carcass. i always separate it from the rest of the ribeye so i can save it for last. the muscle fibers in the rim are very loosely bound, and marbling of ribeyes is second to none. what this means is that you have a piece of meat that's super tender (just as tender as a filet), super juicy, and super flavorful, which perfectly describes the wagyu tomahawk. each bite was a blast of rich and savory goodness. the juices coat your mouth in a sheen of happiness. there truly is nothing to criticize. the only thing i could wish for is that they serve just the rim as its own cut of steak.\n\nthe next time you're in vegas, forget the crappy frozen <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> at the buffets, and treat yourself to something really worth the trip and big bucks.", 
            "3.5 stars- definitely better than 3 stars, but not quite 4.\n\nthis restaurant is location in the middle of crystals on the strip.  from the outside looking in, the restaurant is inside a neat sculptured \"treehouse\". it sort of made me feel like if would be cool to eat in there, but sitting on the inside of the treehouse looking out i feel a little disappointed, because i felt like i was eating in an \"upscale\" food court with views of retail stores, such as  lv, jimmy choo, and zegna.  not exactly, the scene i expected  from an expensive restaurant, however on the other side there was a piano bar.\n\nhowever, service was impeccable, except we were only told the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> was out when we ordering rather than beforehand.  in a rush we picked <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> as our appetizer, husband ordered mac & cheese, we shared the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>,  <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> and <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  \n\nwe ordered a bottle of schramberg blanc de blanc for $70. given it is about $27 in retail that markup isn't terrible, beside by the glass ranged from $15 to $30. the wine list is comprehensive.\n\ni am kind of bored with <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark>, but it was definitely above average and the portion size of the appetizer is the size of a meal.  it is presented like a tower with the base made of crushed fried wontons, then avocado almost like guacamole, then the seasoned tuna.  \n\nthe mac & cheese was a huge portion that could feed 4 people on its own or 6 side servings.  i just had to have a bite, it was creamy, cheesy and tangy all the same time; i like the addition of gorgonzola, which still remained subtle.   definitely an adult upscale mac & cheese. \n\n<mark>Chopped Salad</mark> was solid and i like how we were told the ingredients and asked if we wanted to omit anything.\n\nthe king crab comes warm when it is an entree and that was a bit unexpected, but tasted sweet and drowned in the drawn butter....ooooh, so good. i was surprised how meaty the 1 lb of legs were...easily filling up one person.  \n\ni love <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> prepared any way, but i it was pan-fried to perfection.  the outside crusty and the inside soft and buttery. the seasoning was just salt.  the serving size is probably 8 oz, which is ample and justifies the price.\n\nno room for dessert, but a slice of  chocolate layer cake with schlag (whipped cream) was on the house since it was my birthday.  very generous.\n\noverall, pretty good, but again i couldn't get past the view which cheapened the ambiance. we left with enough food for another dinner so that was good too.\n\ndon't know why it is called \"beach club\".  the environment doesn't in any way demonstrate a \"beach club\".  that may be a good thing, though.\n\nwill i go again? probably not, i think joe's seafood (not the crab shack) has a better ambiance and food, except the fish here is better.",

            "party of 8 on a tuesday night.\ninteresting set up - there is a part of the restaurant that looks like a large wooden hornet's nest.  not sure what that's all about.  \n\nservice was impeccable from the hostess to the main server to his assistants.  everything was prompt, polite and timed well.  we were not rushed out even though we were one of the last parties to leave. \n\nfood:\ni ordered the gorgonzola mac and cheese $12 and the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> $48.  the mac and cheese was a little disappointing - very little flavor and it was dry,  very dry.  i had read that this was a great side dish so i was sad when it wasn't very palatable.  the portion is huge - consider sharing it if you do.  it easily fed our entire table.  i asked for the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> medium rare and it came out closer to medium.  regardless, the flavor was very smooth, not gamey.  the outside was a little too charred, but the rest of it was quite good.  it came with mint jelly, which was very tasty.  we also had a heirloom tomato and burrata salad $12 which was a very generous portion - the tomatoes were sweet and juicy.  the table got the seafood tower (have no idea how much that was but it was worth it).  this was friggin amazing.  honestly.  there were kumamoto oysters, fresh dungeness crab, snow <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>, humongous shrimp, great big lobster claws.  all fresh and tender meat.  it didn't require sauce.  none of it was briny or sandy.  so delicious and whatever we paid, i don't care.  it was unbelievable. other people in our party got the arctic char \"oreganato\" style, <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>, seared scallops and halibut.  every dish was served with mushrooms, asparagus, green beans and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (this had to have crack in it b/c <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> never tasted so good.)  no one had a single complaint and everyone finished what they ordered.  by this time, we're all about to pass out from food coma, but we insisted on the butter cake.  if you come here, no matter what you order, you must save room for this signature dessert.  i can't even describe it but it is amazing.  it comes out warm, w/ freshly made whipped cream and vanilla ice cream.   must.  must.  must have.  \n\noverall, great experience.  cost us a total of $1400 for 7 people.  you do the math.", 
            "you can do a lot of interesting things in vegas.  i had no idea fine dining in a funky abstract treehouse was one of them.  mastro's is quite the experience -- from the structure itself, to the wondrous items and their presentations, to the exceptional and classy staff.  you salivate as you picture-perfect dishes being carried by.  \n\nthe seafood tower is a spectacle - double tiered dish with dry ice smoke surrounding it.  i have no idea how the waitstaff can carry that giant concoction.  it came to the table and shocked us at first sight.  the shrimp were the size of my fist, the <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> were monstrous, and everything was overwhelming.  if you can eat after that appetizer, then hats off to you!  \n\nas luck would have it, i was crazy hungry, so i went for the 22 oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>.  it came out on a plate sizzling at 400 degrees.  perfection!  medium rare to the t.  that was the second best ribeye i've ever had (first being v&a).  i wanted to pick up the bone and start gnawing.  \n\nsomeone else got the halibut cheek which also looked very unique and delicious.  i really wanted to order it.  alas, as a texan, ribeyes speak to my heart (on so many levels?)  \n\nthis is definitely one of classiest places that i've been to.  what an upscale vegas experience.",

            "freakin' awesome!!! i have never had another steak like at mastro's. i don't normally eat seafood but when i was here i had tried the <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> and they were super tender and buttery and succulent. they serve these huge <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> that are already split and cracked so you don't have to spend an hour trying to suck a little piece of meat out of the shell. \n\nmy steak was ridiculously good, medium-well filet mignon, i don't even have words to explain it because i start to stttttuudder, it was that good. the gorgonzola mac and cheese was excellent, i wish we would have taken our left over mac but we were in vegas and we weren't going back to our hotel room right after dinner.  the mushrooms were soooo good, nice meaty mushrooms, i believe they were shittake shrooms.  bread basket was awesome, all kinds of different breads to snack on. \n\nordered a vodka 7up and dang was that strong. the waiters were super nice and you feel like royalty when you dine here. i would definitely suggest mastro's.", 
            "yes yes yes! took some friends and clients for a beautiful dinner here. what can i say? amazing food. highest quality i've had in a very long time. the steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked and all topped off with their truffle butter (highly recommended but an extra $15 add-on, i know. i can buy a lot of butter for $15, but worth it). yum! also ordered a fairly large seafood tower. it was stocked with lobster, large <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark>, oysters, <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>. can you say, unbelievable! with our steaks, we ordered the following sides. <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, mac and cheese, and the gnocci. all amazing. obviously the price here is fairly hefty but was well worth it. impeccable service with our waiter anticipating our every need. we ordered so much food that they ultimately comped us on a free desert. way to go maestros. will most definitely come again!",

            "the fourth new discovery that was a five-star worthy dining experience was at mastro's ocean club.  i had heard good things about this place for at least two years, and before then espied its distinctive wooden bird's nest with admiration at its quite innovative and modern design just before the restaurant's opening inside the shops at crystals.\n\nit was the day of our 25th wedding anniversary, and our request for seating inside the nest was granted.  it actually felt like being two young birds sheltered inside a protective nest.  not only that, but we were surprised at meal's end with a complimentary warm butter cake ala mode, mastro's signature dessert.  this was a great mouth-watering end to a very memorable meal, as the soft cake seemed to melt in the mouth. \n\nbut the beginning of our meal was no less auspicious.  after enjoying a bread basket that included large homemade pretzel breadsticks, diane and i dove into succulent hot <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark>.  these big crustaceans bursting with flavor really deserve to be called \"prawns\" rather than \"shrimp,\" and did deliver a taste of vanilla in the light batter--but not overpoweringly so.\n\nfor our main we each ordered an 8-oz filet, which here is called a \"<mark>Petite Filet</mark>,\" along with 1-1/2 lbs. of <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>.  both tender steaks were cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, and with little char on top.  accompanying bearnaise sauce was drinkable, and a peppercorn sauce was not far behind.  the hot and long sections of <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> were pulled out of the pot at exactly the right moment  and presented as already opened legs, so no prying with tools was necessary.  they tasted great dunked in warm drawn butter.  and while diane praised her large and cheesy twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark>, i delighted in a huge mound of skinny sea salt & <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark>, which was reported to be a small rather than regular-sized version.  sauteed mushrooms were lovely, too, but i hardly needed them.  we were stuffed.  \n\nwith a ratio of about one waiter for every four guests, service was great.  our knowledgeable and conscientious server checked on us several times, and water refills were regularly poured without any need to request them.  even with the restaurant packed with guests, the ambiance inside the bird's nest section of the restaurant was romantic, intimate, and classy.\n\nmastro's is pricey to be sure.  but, executing well at delivering artfully prepared high-quality offerings from both land and sea, there is a reason why several local diners in the know call this one of the best restaurants in las vegas.  without question we will soon become repeat guests.", 
            "the best thing about this place was their level of service. the staff was amazing and i feel like my party was a lot of work for them and they remained pleasant, helpful, and toggled between utmost professionalism and fun and silly based on what we needed. \n\nthe food itself was good overall. i wasn't blown away. we had <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> for an appetizer, i'm not a connoisseur here but they were good. the main dishes were the highlight for me, we had <mark>Filet</mark> and a crusted <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. the <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> were pretty plain and blah, gorgonzola mac and cheese was decent. everyone at the table loved the butter cake, i'm not really a sweets person but it was good.", 
            "great place and location in the upscale crystal mall.  the service was great and matched what you would expect in a high end restaurant.  the food was good but not great blow your sox off.  we had <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> (a little dry) and halibut also overcooked and dry.  both had an ok taste however.  the tuna jalapeno appetizer was quite tasty and the serving size was nice too.  it was a great experience but i am not sure the meal matched the price."

            "we were celebrating my wife's birthday and decided that we would go out for a nice dinner.  after a couple of our first choices were not available, we did get a reservation at mastro's.  i can see why they had availability on a saturday night.\n\nthe night started out really well.  the live music in the lounge was very good, and our server in the bar recommended a fantastic riesling.\n\nonce we were seated, our server recommended a couple of salads.  i had a spinach/bacon salad.  nothing special, but ended up being the star of the meal. \n\nfor the main course, i decided to try the vanilla batter <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark>, because i read that it was a specialty of the chef.  i should have known something was up when the server also said i could get the tails baked or steamed, or a combination of those options.  i chose steamed and the vanilla batter.  the steamed tail was just fine, as expected.  the battered tail tasted like something from long john silvers.  it was so salty, and greasy, it ruined what should have been a great dinner.  \n\nwe also ordered a twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> to share.  this should be a very safe and tough to screw up dish.  they managed to do so.  my wife and i both commented that we get better twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> from the grocery store, and we certainly prepare them better.  these must have been sitting out for a while, and were probably over cooked to begin with.  they were so dry, we could not finish it.\n\nwe had two waiters for the evening, and we never saw them.  i'm sure they saw our meal and did not want to check in with us.  no refills on our water, much less filling our wine glasses.  i did see the manager at another table, but she did not stop by to see us about our meal.\n\nthe star of the meal if there was one, was the portion size of the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> sashimi.  it was reasonably priced, but loaded with seeds, so bad that it was a chore to wade through them.",

            "perfect first experience at mastro's! went there to celebrate our anniversary and they really did make it feel like a special occasion. we were seated in the treehouse - beautiful and romantic, great date spot. \nreally unique cocktail list -definitely not the usual boring drinks. i tried the blueberry martini, didn't really care for the taste since i prefer sweet drinks, but it was strong and something different. cocktails were a little pricey at about $18 each, but you pay for the ambiance. \nstarted w escargot, i've never had it served in the shell before. very pretty and delish - served w clarified butter and garlic. great selection of yummy breads too. \nwe shared the 18oz bone in kansas city strip w <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark> (1 butter poached, 1 vanilla tempura fried). sides - twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> and brussel sprouts w bacon. steak was cooked perfectly medium, tender, juicy and flavorful. they knew we were sharing so everything was split for us. poached lobster was good, cooked perfectly. the tempura lobster... mmm i'm not a huge fan. it was good, but a lot of batter and i didn't really get even a hint of vanilla. glad we decided to try it both ways. \ntwice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> was good, but i've had better. they didn't bring it out till about 10min after the rest of the food because the chef didn't like how the first one looked, so he made a new one. they took it off the bill w out us asking. nice that the chef has attn to detail vs just cranking out the orders. brussel sprouts used to be fried w pancetta but they recently changed the menu, so no more pancetta. they did accommodate by doing it w bacon instead, but not really the same - thin sliced bacon just can't compare to chunks of pancetta.\nwe got the butter cake comp since it was an anniversary. super cute of them to do a candle. the cake is enough for 3 or 4 to share, served w vanilla ice cream and a huge bowl of fresh whipped cream. so bad, but soooo good! \nservice was excellent, our server mike was friendly and knowledgeable. the rest of the wait staff were great too. i checked out our neighbors food, i'm looking forward to trying the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, or crab salad next time. \nin the end there's not a huge difference w steak joints - they generally serve the same cuts, appetizers and sides. but mastro's stands apart with its service and intimate classy ambiance.", 
            "we were celebrating my wife's birthday and decided that we would go out for a nice dinner.  after a couple of our first choices were not available, we did get a reservation at mastro's.  i can see why they had availability on a saturday night.\n\nthe night started out really well.  the live music in the lounge was very good, and our server in the bar recommended a fantastic riesling.\n\nonce we were seated, our server recommended a couple of salads.  i had a spinach/bacon salad.  nothing special, but ended up being the star of the meal. \n\nfor the main course, i decided to try the vanilla batter <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark>, because i read that it was a specialty of the chef.  i should have known something was up when the server also said i could get the tails baked or steamed, or a combination of those options.  i chose steamed and the vanilla batter.  the steamed tail was just fine, as expected.  the battered tail tasted like something from long john silvers.  it was so salty, and greasy, it ruined what should have been a great dinner.  \n\nwe also ordered a twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> to share.  this should be a very safe and tough to screw up dish.  they managed to do so.  my wife and i both commented that we get better twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> from the grocery store, and we certainly prepare them better.  these must have been sitting out for a while, and were probably over cooked to begin with.  they were so dry, we could not finish it.\n\nwe had two waiters for the evening, and we never saw them.  i'm sure they saw our meal and did not want to check in with us.  no refills on our water, much less filling our wine glasses.  i did see the manager at another table, but she did not stop by to see us about our meal.\n\nthe star of the meal if there was one, was the portion size of the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> sashimi.  it was reasonably priced, but loaded with seeds, so bad that it was a chore to wade through them.",

            "nothing short of amazing.  we spent our anniversary dinner here.   the food was amazing, and the service was top notch.  we had saut\\u00e9ed shrimp as an app, and split the bone in filet, garlic mashed and 2 <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark>.  all was great, but he highlights....\n    1.  the saut\\u00e9ed shrimp was one of the bet things i have ever eaten.  perfectly cooked.  and the sauce was to die for.  it came with soft garlic bread to sop up the sauce.  i would have been happy with this for my entire meal.  \n   2.  i got lobster tail two ways, but the vanilla fried was amazing.   \n \n   lastly and maybe most important was the dessert.  i am it a huge dessert fan, and we probably wouldn't have ordered dessert if it wasn't for them offering it for free for our anniversary.   we are fans for life.   i think they call it butter cake.   it was insane.   we had leftovers and ate it for breakfast.   soooo good.", 
            "at first glace, the menu, the photos on their website and on yelp all seemed very appealing; how could you not choose to come here after being exposed to all that? i was able to easily booked reservations with mastro's oc the same day (on a sunday) through yelp/open table.\n\nafter sealing the deal on this place, i had somewhat high expectations of what my experience and food was going to be like. mastro's is located on the second floor of city center and is surrounded by the endless amount of high end stores (prada, gucci, jimmy choo etc. etc.) so these visual cues added to my high expectations. my date and i were comfortably seated along their edge where we were able to gaze out into the nicely, holiday decorated city center as well as watch 90% of the people window shop...guess it's too expensive and not the right time of year to treat yourself to these classy brands?\n\nanyway, to get down to it, i was cool with the service and location but the food was ok; it wasn't to my liking and it wasn't to my disliking either.\n\nmy date ordered the bone in ribeye medium rare and it came to our table sizzling hot, at the right temperature (or so we thought) until he got down to the middle. it was not warm but not cold either...just this weird temperature that didn't seem right. at least we were able to get that replaced asap. \n\ni decided to go with 2 <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark>--i had one regularly prepared and one vanilla battered. i should have just  had it reguarly prepared because the battered one wasn't really anything special; i didn't even taste the vanilla...or perhaps there might have been a hint of it that my taste buds were unable to pick up on. \n\nand the sides...geez, it was expensive and nothing extraordinary! i felt like i could have chosen the potatoes and mushrooms out myself and made the garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and sauteed mushrooms myself. actually, i think i could actually do mastro's up in these items (not saying i'm some kind of professional chef or anything like that, just emphasizing that these items were nothing impressive). \n\nso after 2 ice teas, the 2 entrees and 2 sides the bill came up to about $160 without tip. i can't say the price and food quality ratio was appropriate, though again, the service was top notch. oh and their artisan breads were delicious as well. i will also say i appreciated the follow up call they did with me the next day; i never had that happen and i thought that was nice of them to do. i guess i might come back here again but purchase something else that might tickle my fancy.",

            "outstanding...and i live at the ocean and love steak!\n\nnot my first \"surf and turf\" experience, heck, not my first of the week but probably the best i've ever had.  we went with the <mark>Broiled Live Maine Lobster</mark> table side shelled by tanya and the bone in fillet.  lobster cooked to perfection (not over cooked) and steak was so tender it cut with a fork.  drinks and sides were also wonderful...house special lemon drop, crab and <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> and mushrooms.  wow!\n\nhigh end vegas at its best.  shops with million dollar dresses in the window surround and live \"vegas style entertainment\" abounds.  definitely highly recommended (and the only five star review i've even written on yelp!).*\n\n*((edit: ok at the time the only fiver i had given...found you need to do fives sometimes to bring up the average from the unwashed...sorry to be misleading in anyway ';-))", 
            "i love this place! \n\nmy boyfriend and i came here to celebrate our 6 months semi-anniversary and we certainly had a great time! the only down side is it burnt a hole in our wallet. but it is a special occasion and we both think it is worth it. \n\ni made a reservation on line at open table and i mentioned our occasion. when we were at the hostess stand, we were greeted by our last name which really surprised me. we waited for about 2 min before we got seated in the tree house, just like how i requested in my reservation. our server came right away to take our drink orders and also gave us some recommendations. \n\nwe decided to go with the surf and turf they have which comes with a 3 pound <mark>Broiled Live Maine Lobster</mark> and steak of our choice. one thing about the meal here is that it does not come with any sides. you only get what you order. if you want to have mashed potatos or <mark>Colossal Onion Rings</mark>, you do have to order them seperately which again raises the cost. \n\nthe food came fairly fast after we ordered and the busser divided the meal for us right by the table. the lobster tasted great so did the steak! the server was telling us that they have a live fishtank in the back and all the lobsters they have came in daily directly from maine! you can't get anything fresher than that in vegas! the steak is flavorful and juicy. my boyfriend said it could be more tender. as for the side, we ordered <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark> and corossal <mark>Colossal Onion Rings</mark>. we both like the potatoes it was yummy but not too impressed by the <mark>Colossal Onion Rings</mark>, for some reason it tastes a bit soft. \n\nupon we were finishing up our meal, so stuffed at that point, our server actually surprised us with a complimentary desert for our celebration! what a nice gesture! so definitely put in the occasion if you are celebrating anything at mastro's! \n\nthe environment is elegant and classy with live performance. it is expensive but you definitely get what you pay for. we return on our next special occasion.", 
            "as always, mastro's does not disappoint! their food tasted just as i remembered it, amazing. the service we received was great! i love how attentive they are with everything! \n\nwe got the chef's special - ribeye with <mark>Broiled Live Maine Lobster</mark> and let me tell you, the food was so delicious. \nthey also comped their famous butter cake since it was our anniversary. \n\nbeing that we've dined at their beverly hills location, this place seemed a bit more casual and less romantic since it's inside a mall.", 
            "my friend and i were looking for a simple sushi restaurant near our hotel, aria but the one inside the hotel was booked.  so we walked over to the next building and finally decided on mastro's since i loved the one in beverly hills.  \n\nit didn't disappoint..the service was a+..our waitress kept a close eye on us to refill any drinks and was very knowledgable about the menu.  the <mark>Broiled Live Maine Lobster</mark> was exquisite and the asparagus crisp and seasoned.  my poor friend ordered sushi which she didn't like because there was chocolate in the sauce.  chocolate?!?  the lemon drop martini was awesome.  it came to the table smoking and kept on smoking for awhile. . we shared a delicious dessert.  $250 dinner for two..well worth it.\n\nambiance was superb in the treehouse..\nservice was respectful, reliable and solid..\nfood was delish..", 
            "wow!  we had <mark>Broiled Live Maine Lobster</mark> and a new york steak which were absolutely perfect but the highlight might have been the blue point oysters which were sweet, tender and delicious. wait a minute, that wasn't the highlight!  the highlight was the service which was attentive, friendly and helpful. our waitress was so genuine that i thought i had been transported to somewhere in the midwest. this place is a must go!",

            "went to ocean club for dinner on our last nite in las vegas-had been there before and loved it. well, this time it was even better than we remembered!  almost as soon as you sit down, the waiter brings an amazing bread basket with the prize being the hot pretzel bread.  we split the bacon wedge blue cheese salad and my wife had the <mark>Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna</mark> rare. it was a huge portion of incredible, slightly seared sashimi. i ordered the new york medium and it was perfect medium with no grizzle or fat.  it comes on a plate that is 400 degrees with clarified butter on the bottom. i can honestly say it was one of the best steaks i've ever eaten. sure its $50 bucks, but i've had lots of crappy 50 dollar steaks in my life and this was worth every penny.  we ordered the side dish that the waiter suggested.-home made gnocchi with either lobster or crap meat and <mark>Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese</mark>. maybe the best 29 dollars i've ever spent!  we had a great bottle of merlot and unfortunately, couldn't finish all of  the food so we passed on the amazing selection of desserts but will leave room for one next time. and no, i'm not related to the owners!  just had a fabulous meal and want to share our experience!!"

            "came here with a couple friends.  we were sat in the modern tree house which over looked the crystals mall, i would definitely ask to be sat there.  everyone was hungry so we got right down to business, <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark> and <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> to start followed by the 22oz bone in ribeye for myself with <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.   apps were flavorful,  steak was cooked perfectly midrare and the sides dishes were great .  service was impeccable as expected. overall great dinning experience, wasn't the best steak i've had but definitely worth trying even though technically this restaurants prime focus is seafood.", 
            "the ambiance was pretty rad. it's not you're usual dimly lit steakhouse. it's right in the middle of crystal and very bright. i liked the modern decor and the live music was a nice touch. the service was great. the bathroom attendant made me feel like i was a a club. \n\nmy <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> (12ox) was tasty, but i personally miss the crisp edges and extra butter on the ruth chris' steak. the mastro side dishes though, definitely beat ruth chris'. i loved the truffled gnocchi, lobster mash potatoes, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark>. \n\nmy highlight of the night was the butter cake! yummy!", 
            "had an absolutely fantastic dinner at mastro's the other day. our server, shauna, was more than helpful in helping us navigate the great menu. we started off with the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, which was super fresh and delicious, followed by a great <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. for the main course i had a fantastic filet cooked to perfection. but the best was the sides. our table shared the gorgonzola mac & cheese, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and sauteed broccoli. they were all fantastic, but the mac & cheese was to die for.\n\nshauna said the warm butter cake was not to be missed and she wasn't kidding. i'm surprised my arteries survived that cake after everything we'd already eaten, but it was worth risking it. :)", 
            "my wife and i can be fussy with restaurants, but mastro's was so perfect on a recent vegas visit, that we cancelled plans at another restaurant the following night and did mastro's all over again...with equally perfect results.\nsteaks were delicious, tender, and done to perfection. the sides are overly generous and delicious (recommend the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>). salads very fresh and tasty. but don't leave without having the butter cake dessert. that was the happiest my tastebuds have been in a long, long time.\nour waiter mario was sensational. bright, friendly, and efficient.\nand the setting is as fun and charming as others here describe it.", 
            "delicious!! the bread basket was warm and fresh out of the oven. i'm not a huge steak person so i ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. it was cooked perfectly. i'm a sucker for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. the mac & cheese was good and the lobster mashed potato was amazing!!! not only was the food good but the location and being in a treehouse was fun. service was top notch and i'll definitely come back for more.", 
            "a culinary delight!  started off with the beefsteak tomato and mozzarella salad.  chose the salmon blackened for dinner and shared a mountain of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and the cream corn.  for desert i ordered the butter cake which topped the meal off perfectly!  the mastro's martini is a must have if you like martinis.  don't be scared off by the $19.00 price...they bring the shaker out and it fills the glass three times!  superior service.  a great evening out!", 
            "i am usually a four star reviewer.  if the food is good and the server is attentive, that is good enough for me.\n\n5 stars are for the rare occasions both the food and server are over the top good.  mastro was both.  first mastro is in the middle of the almost new city center construction project and mausoleum for the lost profits of dubai and the mgm group.  it is a really nice place filled with shops people can no longer afford.\n\nmastro from the outside looks like a brown tree house in this glitzy cloud.  it is a really beautiful build out with a long and a two dining areas, one in the tree house and one outside said house.\n\nit is a traditional steakhouse with tons of cuts of cow cooked to your liking and ubiquitous sides:  4 different types of spuds, veggies, etc.  i do not eat steak, but most of these places will have one chicken dish and really decent seafood.\n\ni ordered the salad, scallops and split the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  the salad was huge and could have/should have been the meal, especially after the  box of 6 kinds of different breads.  the scallops really excelled with a parmesan flavoring, but the hit was my friends arctic char, which was perfect....and i mean perfect\n\nwhere is there fish that good in a desert?\n\nthe waiter was excellent and goaded us into dessert.  we asked him about the praline vs house special batter cake.  he said try one as they were his favorite.  he would let us try the other.  both were phenomenal....\n\nas is this place....really great food and total culinary experience", 
            "oh boy, where do i start?\n\ni made reservations for my fiance here last saturday night :) it was his birthday, and so i wanted to take him out. we were in vegas celebrating, and seeing that this place had high ratings, i took him here to try it out. the restaurant itself is inside a mall, and though we didn't get seated in the treehouse looking part, it was still a pleasant visit. it was our first time dining at any mastro's restaurant, and definitely won't be our last! we got a waiter named tim (timothy), and he has got to be one of the best waiters we've ever had. he was very informative and was extremely nice. he showed us the different menus and helped us choose. i decided on the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. it was sooo good! the flavor was on point, and it was a perfect portion size. my fiance ordered the filet for himself, and his was overcooked, but they knew right away after he received it. dan asked him if he wanted to switch it for a new one, but he said it was fine, and ate it anyways. he liked the flavor and was genuinely fine with it and didn't think it was really a big deal. we also ordered calamari as an appetizer, and a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. (which was family sized, for sharing.. but we didn't know!) the calamari was awesome. we ended up only being able to eat about 10 fries out of that giant pile.. lol. we were too full! a different waiter served us sprite and ended up spilling it all over my fiance's shoulder.. yikes. they did help him clean it up though. in the end, my fiance got a warm butter cake as his birthday gift :d yay! it was so delicious, we ate it all.. despite the fact that we were super full! we were also given complementary wine for the steak being overcooked and for the sprite spill. now that's excellent customer service, and if vegas wasn't so far, i'd come back more often. i'll miss this place :( hope the one in newport is just as professional! but i know if we were in vegas visiting, this spot will be one of the first places i'd go to eat at. thanks for the wonderful experience mastro's! :) stay gold.",

            "this is the second mastro's location that i have gone to. i've been to the one in thousand oaks, ca a few times and thought i would give this location a try. it is located in the crystals shopping plaza that is next to the aria hotel. this place is really nice and you feel a little bit underdressed if you aren't in your sunday best. \n\ni made reservations ahead of time but the place didn't looked too packed for a saturday night. we had a nice table an attentive waiter. we got our drinks pretty quickly and the martinis were strong.  there was some live music being heard from the lounge area near the bar area which had a nice touch to it. \n\ni still went with the meat selection even though this was the ocean club. my boyfriend and i both had petite which is served on a searing hot plate. the meat continues to cook on the plate and just easily cuts like butter. the steak just melts in your mouth as the seasoning of the meat and light butter from the plate meet in your mouth, i call it meaty symphonic harmony. \n\nwe also ordered the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> as a side. this is no mere small side dish but a mound of fries is delivered. each fry is seasoned with an almost tempura like batter on the outside that leaves you craving more and more. i was stuffed after the filet and the fries and the yummy bread basket they bring you (with warm pretzel bread and other goodies). \n\ndessert is something that just can't be missed and i suggest the sinful delight of the signature warm butter cake and whipped cream. the butter cake is rich and heavy with deliciousness and the whipped cream is no ordinary whipped cream. it almost has the consistency of ice cream as it hits your palate. \nthis is my treat for the year, it is expensive so be warned but it is also a high class meal. i highly recommend it.", 
            "have you ever been called a day later from a restaurant you ate at the night before? yeah, me neither- until i ate at maestro's ocean room.  it was like a one night stand you want to call you again. real classy joint. the whole family went to vegas for christmas. since we are jews, we decided to forego the stereotypical chinese food and step it up a bit.  we were looking for a nice steakhouse and we were torn between craft steak or maestros- since we were staying at vdara, maestro's was closer.  thank goodness- hands down best steak i've ever had. even my picky eater girls loved it. i had the filet- melted in my mouth like butter.  we ordered the mussels, <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark>, bone marrow, salmon, broccoli, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, spinach- i don't normally eat seafood but i was so stuffed and satisfied when i left- i'll let you make the one night stand joke this time. eat here.", 
            "i think it is actually called the \"tree house\", but i kept calling it the birds nest. whatever it was, it was cool!! now, keep in mind, this was a business dinner that i was at, so anything goes when it comes to ordering!! \n\nas far as what i had, i started with the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>. delish! for dinner i got the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> special. this was different than the regular <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, because it came with the most delicious king crab leg meat as well in a yummy butter sauce. i honestly could only eat half of the steak, this was just too much food all around. \n\nfor sides, we got the mushrooms, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>. holy bananas these were all so good.\n\nthen we finished with the butter cake!! which is gigantic, way to big for two people. we all got some of it (there were six of us), but keep in mind we were stuffed at this point! the noise level was reasonable in this restaurant, so it was perfect for a dinner with colleagues.", 
            "atmosphere: huge plus for being inside crystals mall. classy, a bit on chatty side.\nfood: amazing!\nservice: he meant well, but...\n\nthe <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> was by far the best i've had. it's served cracked, fresh, and insanely cold with a dramatic dry ice presentation. \n\nfood and service deserves 5 stars, but here's what i want to take a point off of. nobody warned us that portions were huge. we left half the food on the table, which was meant for one person. \n\nkeep in mind i am a size 0, it's not hard to guess i won't have a huge appetite.\n\nthe smooth talking waiter talked us into getting the steak special, 20oz bone in for $90-100, not on menu. he said it was for one person. also he suggested the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> as a side and sushi roll. \n\nthe steak was good, but too big for both of us to finish. \nthen the server hands me the charred bone bit - actually, more like plop it in the mashed potato - and tells me to eat the meat off of it. really? are you expecting me to lick my fingers off after i chew off the meat with my teeth and hands like a classy lady?\n\nwe opted for half portion <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> instead of a full, which was still a whole bowl of potato mash swimming in a pool of butter. whatever happened to mixing?\nthe half portion of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> had so much breading that i couldn't taste the sweet potato. i'm sure there's a lot of people who drool over this type of side dish, but i was certainly not one of them.\n\ni'll give 4stars, but next time, please don't suggest ordering extra food when it's clear we can't even finish one plate. it's too good to waste!", 
            "fab!\n\nmake a reservation and sit in the 'treehouse.'\n\ni was a bit concerned when i read reviews because i am a huge fan of the la location but everything was great! \n\nwho knew items from the seafood tower can be served warm?!?! pre-cracked <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>? 2lbs heated up please!\n\nthe 12oz petit filet was devine.\n\ngnocci with truffle and crab, shrimp scampi, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>... oh boy!\n\nthe staff was also very aware of show times and kept asking to ensure we did not miss our show.", 
            "one of the best meals our group agrees we've had. even the simplest details, from the almost-double-portion martinis to the piping hot pretzel rolls are well-considered and designed to impress and welcome. steak was incredible, portions were generous. we couldn't decide if the \"blackened\" finish or the truffle butter won more accolades, but i doubt you can go wrong. \n\ni had the petit (6oz) filet mignon with a crab cake to create my own little \"surf & turf\". again, portions were above and beyond so it was almost more than i could finish. having lived in boston and maryland i'm extremely well-versed in seafood, especially lobster and <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, so i tend not to order these items freely elsewhere. the crab cake was pan-fried but still great. (i tend to prefer broiled.) the steak was better than top steak houses in dc/ny. honestly. find a way to get steak and seafood into your meal!\n\nfor \"family style\" sides we ordered <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> (unnecessary), <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> (food heaven), <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (must get), and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (i didn't even bother as i had too much more interesting food already). the server actually walks around to distribute the sides as you like, which again was a wonderful touch for our group of 9. \n\nother winners: shrimp sushi roll, all martinis, espresso drinks, tomato/burrata salad. \n\nour server was really fantastic. friendly, efficient, doting, and plenty loud which again, is very important when you have lists of specials to communicate enthusiastically and a long table of 9 semi-rowdy friends.\n\nwe used to actually go off the strip to find hidden top steakhouse gems but now maestro's in crystal center will be the go-to. \n\nif you have only one good/fancy/formal meal for your trip: go here."

            "i was introduced to mastro's by a friend of mine.  he had nothing but good things to say about it, so last year, we gave it a shot. mastro's is the perfect hybrid of really good seafood and classic steakhouse.  when you walk in the first thing you smell is the juicy steaks coming out of the kitchen. this was our second time here and i'm not going to lie, i was a little worried that it wouldn't be as good as i remembered. lucky for us, it was just as good. i remembered that they had a nice wine list and they still do. gramercy guy was able to get darioush (one of our favorite napa wineries) by the glass, which is really hard to find. \n\nwhile our waiter was walking us through the menu, some specials, and suggestions, i zeroed in on a salad called, the spicy mambo, which is a take on a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, without croutons but has horseradish and blue cheese crumbles. it was really tasty and i'm looking forward to going home and adjusting my caesar dressing recipe with some fresh horseradish. \n\na secret menu item is the mastro's mash. it used to be on the menu but has recently come off, if you ask, they will make it for you. it's like a loaded <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> but mashed. we also got sauteed spinach, don't forget your greens.\n\nthe design of mastro's is really amazing, they have what they call a 'tree house', a wooden structure that has two levels. the bottom is the crystal's information desk and the top level is the mastro's tree house. when we booked our reservation, we requested a table in the tree house. once you step inside, the atmosphere totally changes, the band (which is really good) gets muffled and it's very relaxing and feels almost private (there are about a dozen tables).\n\nmy advice for anyone going to mastro's...share...the portions are huge and unless you have a place to store your left overs, it will all go to waste. also, the pretzel rolls in the bread basket are amazing. \n\nto see pictures and read more, go to http://gramercygirl.blogspot.com/2012/03/mastros-ocean-club-las-vegas.html", 
            "we were celebrating my wife's birthday and decided that we would go out for a nice dinner.  after a couple of our first choices were not available, we did get a reservation at mastro's.  i can see why they had availability on a saturday night.\n\nthe night started out really well.  the live music in the lounge was very good, and our server in the bar recommended a fantastic riesling.\n\nonce we were seated, our server recommended a couple of salads.  i had a spinach/bacon salad.  nothing special, but ended up being the star of the meal. \n\nfor the main course, i decided to try the vanilla batter <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark>, because i read that it was a specialty of the chef.  i should have known something was up when the server also said i could get the tails baked or steamed, or a combination of those options.  i chose steamed and the vanilla batter.  the steamed tail was just fine, as expected.  the battered tail tasted like something from long john silvers.  it was so salty, and greasy, it ruined what should have been a great dinner.  \n\nwe also ordered a twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> to share.  this should be a very safe and tough to screw up dish.  they managed to do so.  my wife and i both commented that we get better twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> from the grocery store, and we certainly prepare them better.  these must have been sitting out for a while, and were probably over cooked to begin with.  they were so dry, we could not finish it.\n\nwe had two waiters for the evening, and we never saw them.  i'm sure they saw our meal and did not want to check in with us.  no refills on our water, much less filling our wine glasses.  i did see the manager at another table, but she did not stop by to see us about our meal.\n\nthe star of the meal if there was one, was the portion size of the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> sashimi.  it was reasonably priced, but loaded with seeds, so bad that it was a chore to wade through them.", 
            "delicious! best steak i've had compared to: del frisco's, papa's, perry's, ruth chris, flemings, the strip house, vic and anthony's, morton's .... all of them and more. \n\ni don't remember what my cocktail was but it was a strawberry drink with a sugar rim. the shaker had an endless amount. i ended up with at least 3 full refills for $18.\n\nthe calamari was crispy and deceptively flavorful. they appeared to be plain, but the seasoning was just right. i did not care for the horseradish/mustard type sauce though, but i think that was just my dislike for those types of condiments. \n\ni ordered the 12oz filet medium rare. it had a beautiful seared crust that was crispy and not burned. the inside was so perfectly tender juicy red and melted in my mouth. the texture of the two was perfect. \n\nfor sides we had the <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> which was huge! but was the least appetizing item all night. the gorgonzola mac and cheese was delicious! i don't tend to like blue cheeses or very much cheese, but this cheese goodness was devine. i enjoyed it so much i'm going to try to remake this this week for dinner! it was served in it's own skillet and was more than enough for myself and my two othe dinner companions. \n\nwarm butter cake. what can i say but order this! i usually love tiramisu and cream br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e but mmmm this cake was so moist and had a crunch sugar top under the vanilla ice cream. the cream br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e was actually disappointing. i didn't care for the crust or vanilla flavored cream... or perhaps the butter cake just stole my heart.\n\nthe live small band sounded great with dinner. they werent too loud and the music was a good mix, classy good sounding modern and hit music, not clubby like stk. you wo t leave with a headach and sore throat.the atmosphere of the restaurant was light and elegant. i didn't mind that it was located in the crystals. honestly i liked being able to walk around while we waited for our reservation we made through aria, our hotel. if you do have a bit of a wait go down stairs to the little water tornadoes. they are touch sensitive and you can control how they spin!", 
            "the las vegas-mastro's ranks among our top dining experiences anywhere in the world.  on this labor day weekend visit, our initial disappointment, of not being seated in the unique & always fascinating \"tree-house\", was quickly extinguished by shauna, our culinary captain extraordinaire, menu \"tour guide\" and libation/wine aficionado.  turns out... our \"terrace\" seating near the piano bar was as enjoyable as it was entertaining, resulting in yet another \"positively outrageous\" fine dining adventure.\n\nshauna introduced us to mastro's participation in \"las vegas restaurant week\", a worthy nationwide charity drive to raise money for & donate meals to 3-square food bank in southern nevada.  she offered a special 4-course dinner deliciously flanked by beefsteak tomato & onion salad, an 8 oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> & garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and key lime pie all for a reasonable price, part of which was ultimately donated for a worthy cause.  \n\nas there were 5 of us on this visit, the aforementioned special meal was joined by collection of our menu favs and shauna's recommendations. she perfectly paired our appetizers & meals with wonderful riesling, cabernet, and sauvignon blanc.\n\nsooo, included in the culinary delight were: the legendary seafood tower (ohhh yes!!), <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (best in class!), <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark> (delightful), <mark>New York Strip</mark> (absolute perfection), <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> (sweet & outa this world), saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> (oh yeah!), <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (buttered and seasoned to perfection), saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms ( a fav of favs), <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> (these aren't yo mama's sprouts, believe it!), 1 lb. <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> (huge), triple chocolate layer cake (nothing but delish), and...(drum roll)... the mastro's signature warm butter cake!!...once again to die for!!!\n\nwithout fail, and to paraphrase the writings of t. scott gross,... mastro's was again a \"positively outrageous\" dining experience where the culinary expectations were always far exceeded.  shauna's unsurpassed service & superior guidance was unexpected, delivered-at-random, fun, entertaining, and so very memorable!  it doesn't get any better!", 
            "the food is great & the portions are generous.  i had the <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> & the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> & my boyfriend had the filet & <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  this place never disappoints!  i always look forward to eating here & the one back home in la.", 
            "mastro's is a very good steak and seafood restaurant in the crystal's shopping mall next to aria on the second floor. \nit's best to make reservations ahead of time or you wait. \nservice was prompt and courteous. i enjoyed a delicate malbec (it doesn't give me migraine headaches like other wines do). my husband and i split a wedge salad that was perfectly mixed with blue cheese, cheddar cheese, bacon and onions. my husband really enjoyed the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and i couldn't finish the delicious artic char i was served. the double <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> was gargantuan and awesomely scrumptious, but the best part was ordering creme brulee' and to be served a giant wallop of real whipped cream bigger than the dessert portion!  simply delightful.",

            "what is there to say about mastro's ocean club that has not already been said? it's funny . . . we live in scottsdale, home of the original mastro's and mastro's ocean club, and yet, this is where we decided to dine in las vegas. having never been to mastro's ocean club in scottsdale, but knowing friends far and wide have been so delighted there, we thought on our vacation, we should give the sister restaurant a try! we are so glad we did!\n\nthe space itself is very unique in design. we were seated in the \"tree house\". it is quite a spectacle from inside as well as outside as the wood towers from the lower level of the crystals shopping center to the very top with a rounded platform area, that kind of resembles an open wooden spaceship, within which is the dining room seating. it is very light and airy. there is plenty of room between tables and despite some of other reviewers complaints that the music is loud, we had no problem with it, even on a friday night.\n\nour waiter (i think his name is robert) was one of the best servers we have ever had, in just about any restaurant in which we have dined. he was knowledgeable, friendly, didn't hover, and was not pushy at all. he gave us time to order, time in between courses, time to finish the humongous plates of food.  the rest of the waitstaff was also attentive. having sat outside at the pool all day, my husband was parched, and i think he drank at least eight glasses of water . . . he never had to wait for the glass to be refilled! when i couldn't finish a course, the attendant asked if he could wrap the remaining up to go. i didn't have to flag anyone down.\n\nthe food was top notch, bar none!  we started with the <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark>. it was a massive appetizer of tiny cubed ahi piled above avocado and what i believe were panko chips. fresh, flavorful and enough for a table of four (not two) to share! not knowing how large the portion was going to be, we also ordered an <mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark> to split - fabulous! and, huge! it had chopped egg, onion, shrimp, lobster, blue cheese . . . you could eat one as a meal. at that point, i issued a proclamation to my husband, aside from our main entrees, we could only order one side. hubby ordered the bone-in rib eye . . . a hunka hunka burnin' love of meat, perfectly seasoned, perfectly seared to medium rare. bliss for my hubby who gets no red meat at home!  i ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> oreganata . . . melted in my mouth . . . and, it too was a giant piece of fish! i couldn't even finish it. the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> was delish, even luke warm, as we couldn't even finish it during our meal, but instead had it as a midnight snack back in our hotel room!  \n\none other note . . . and this was pure genius. i couldn't finish my wine. if i put anything more into my stomach, i think i would have exploded! our waiter said on the way out, take my drink to the hostess and she will give it to me to go. apparently, the hostess can do this, but the waiter can't. thinking i am going to get my wine in a plastic cup . . . the hostess actually poured it into another wine glass and told me to keep it! \n\nwithout a doubt, this was the best meal we had in vegas over this three-day holiday. and despite what some would say is a hefty price tag, i beg to differ. the quality of the service and food were spot on. we had dinner at two other similarly priced restaurants and left feeling robbed. not so at mastro's ocean club. \n\ni think i have finally convinced my husband to make the scottsdale mastro's ocean club on our regular rotation for fine dining . . . i hope it lives up to the las vegas outlet!", 
            "oh my goodness!!! i'm so full i may need to be rolled back to my hotel... we were told to share food so we did, thank god. we started with a bottle of chateu st michell chardonnay. we had a wedge salad and i'm pretty sure i've never tasted tomatoes like that before, they were so flavorful. then split a <mark>New York Strip</mark> steak, delish, cooked perfectly, i could only eat 1/4. paired it with a twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> that could have been a meal of it's own. to finish it off we had their famous warm butter cake, holy cow! it's like nothing you have ever tasted before, it's a must!!!", 
            "for starters i really wanted to give this place a great review because the food was good, but after receiving my bill i just can't do it.\n\nour total bill came up to $243.23. that's not my complaint. my complaint is that we left a cash tip and when we saw the charge on the card, it was for $291.88. i'm glad i kept my receipt.\n\nthis prompted a call from me to the restaurant today to find out why there was an additional $47.00 charged to my card without disclosing it to me. the manager told me that the company they use automatically adds a 20% gratuity to the bill. \n\nthis was not disclosed to us by the waitress. it was not disclosed on our receipt. in fact, when i called, he said they receive that complaint at least 5 times a day, as if that's the normal order of business. fix it if people are complaining. you have no right to charge them an additional 20% without disclosing this before  they eat.\n\ntips are voluntary, not mandatory unless disclosed. i leave my tips in cash and i always cross out the tip line on the receipt.  the money isn't the issue,its the principle that they have no right to take my money without my permission. that is basically theft. \n\nso now, i have to wait 2-3 business days for the additional $47 to be refunded to my card, which means i won't see my money until tuesday or wednesday, since we ate there friday night. other than this absurd experience with my bill, here is a review on the food.\n\n1) the customer service is great except for not disclosing that i'll be charged an additional 20% even if you leave a cash tip.\n\n2) the  <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> were good, but both my wife and i had a small piece of shell. nothing worth complaining about.\n\n3) my wife had the blackened ribeye. it was delicious.\n\n4) i had <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark>. it was delicious.\n\n5) twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> was good.\n\n6) gorgonzola mac & cheese was good.\n\n7) <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> was good.\n\n8) calamari was just ok.\n\n9) the complimentary bread was mostly hard except for the pretzels. i don't mind a mix of breads, but when the majority are hard, its just not for us. \n\noverall, the food was good, but we will not be going back until the change they policy of charging people an additional 20% without their knowledge.\n\nif you eat here pay cash.", 
            "omg. warm butter cake = better than most anything i can think of, yes including that thing! one serving feeds 3-4 easily. the steak was perfect as was the salmon. the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> was very good. service like no other. even an oops was handled with grace and gentle self-deprecating humor that made it charming instead of annoying. i had heard \"it's in the middle of a mall\" which is technically true, but i found the atmosphere lovely and private, so i would disagree with that criticism. worth every penny of the splurge.", 
            "i live in orange county and have always wanted to try mastro's steakhouse but have never had the chance. a short trip to vegas and we needed a place to dine- so mastro's ocean club was the choice for the evening! when we made reservations, we asked to be seated in the treehouse- what a cool ambience! bread basket was super yummy but pace yourself- don't want to fill up before that delicioussteak gets to your table! orders at the table included: mastro's salad, filet mignon, shoestring french fries, <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark>, side of mushrooms, and the sauteed asparagus. all were delicious! all 3 of us had the filet and it was perfectly cooked and delicious. can't wait to go back! we were so full but had to have dessert so ordered the butter cake and we were not disappointed. i'm not a huge fan of cake but this was one of the best desserts i have ever had. great service and great food!", 
            "food was amazing. the discount on this review is based on the hostess service upon check in. \n\ni wanted to have dinner with my dad for his 73rd birthday. i made a reservation for 5pm for a party of two. i showed up early at 4:20pm and hostess said she could not seat us however we can sit by the bar and have drinks and appetizers. the two hostesses asked for my name multiple times for the reservation. we sat by the bar and the bartender says only non cooked items are available for appetizers. i wish the hostess mentioned this before offering the bar side option. 5pm passes by and i see the hostess seating other parties to the tables. i went back to the reception and the same hostess asked for my name twice. she points at another host and i assume to follow her. she doesn't acknowledge or provide a greeting. i realize she is the one supposed to seat is. maybe the host station wasn't organized or wasn't ready for the evening but i didn't appreciate the confusion and cold reception upon check in. i understand names are complicated but i must have said my generic name seven times to two different people, \"cheryl garcia\". to add additional confusion, i received an email saying i did a 'no show' for my reservation on open table. i'm not certain how that happened even when i checked in on yelp as well. \n\nthe server provided better service and made excellent recommendations. i have an issue with over ordering but that's because i want to taste everything. for a party of two, i ended up ordering the chowder, calamari, sides of <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>, sauted asparagus, twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark>, sea salt & <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark>, and twelve oz bone in filet. the bread service was warm with an assorted selection. i enjoyed all the sides except the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark>- i thought it was too salty & the chowder was slightly watered down and boring. the calamari was flavorful and crispy. the bone in filet was served sizzling on a ceramic platter and was super tender cooked to perfection. \n\nthe server brought out a complimentary butter cake for my dad's birthday. the cake was warm and rich topped with a vanilla bean ice cream and strawberries. this was very special and made the overall experience much better.", 
            "my lovely girlfriend took me here for my birthday. being a non-practicing hindu, i hold a special love for a medium-rare steak. our reservation was for 7:30pm and once we got there we were escorted to our table and seated promptly. it's a very busy place; so do reserve a table ahead of time.\n\nour server was very nice and professional. we ordered soups for starters, my girlfriend ordered <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> and i ordered the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, both soups were delicious, especially the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was cream and not too sweet and as an added bonus there were big piece of delicious lobster meat. \n\nafter we were done with both soups we both ordered filet mignon. i went with 12 oz. medium rare cut while my girlfriend went with 8 oz. well done cut (sacrilege!!!). we also ordered <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> with cheese and saut\\u00e9ed asparagus. after a 20-25 minute wait we were served our delicious meal. the steak was exquisite, the seasoning was perfect and the meat was like butter. it melted in our mouth. the sides were also delicious, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> in particular complimented the steak well.  the only complaint of mine was that the <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> had too much cheese on it, but everything else was amazing. \n\ni think this is best steak house i've been to in las vegas and if you are on the strip, then this is the place to go.", 
            "wow! great food great atmosphere and amazing service. everything was prepared perfectly and was piping hot. the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was light and buttery while the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> was so savory my mouth is still watering two days later. wine list was sophisticated and the <mark>Clear Lobster Roll</mark> is a must get. would recommend for anyone who has $100 a person to spend on dinner.", 
            "the fourth new discovery that was a five-star worthy dining experience was at mastro's ocean club.  i had heard good things about this place for at least two years, and before then espied its distinctive wooden bird's nest with admiration at its quite innovative and modern design just before the restaurant's opening inside the shops at crystals.\n\nit was the day of our 25th wedding anniversary, and our request for seating inside the nest was granted.  it actually felt like being two young birds sheltered inside a protective nest.  not only that, but we were surprised at meal's end with a complimentary warm butter cake ala mode, mastro's signature dessert.  this was a great mouth-watering end to a very memorable meal, as the soft cake seemed to melt in the mouth. \n\nbut the beginning of our meal was no less auspicious.  after enjoying a bread basket that included large homemade pretzel breadsticks, diane and i dove into succulent hot <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark>.  these big crustaceans bursting with flavor really deserve to be called \"prawns\" rather than \"shrimp,\" and did deliver a taste of vanilla in the light batter--but not overpoweringly so.\n\nfor our main we each ordered an 8-oz filet, which here is called a \"<mark>Petite Filet</mark>,\" along with 1-1/2 lbs. of <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>.  both tender steaks were cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, and with little char on top.  accompanying bearnaise sauce was drinkable, and a peppercorn sauce was not far behind.  the hot and long sections of <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> were pulled out of the pot at exactly the right moment  and presented as already opened legs, so no prying with tools was necessary.  they tasted great dunked in warm drawn butter.  and while diane praised her large and cheesy twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark>, i delighted in a huge mound of skinny sea salt & <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark>, which was reported to be a small rather than regular-sized version.  sauteed mushrooms were lovely, too, but i hardly needed them.  we were stuffed.  \n\nwith a ratio of about one waiter for every four guests, service was great.  our knowledgeable and conscientious server checked on us several times, and water refills were regularly poured without any need to request them.  even with the restaurant packed with guests, the ambiance inside the bird's nest section of the restaurant was romantic, intimate, and classy.\n\nmastro's is pricey to be sure.  but, executing well at delivering artfully prepared high-quality offerings from both land and sea, there is a reason why several local diners in the know call this one of the best restaurants in las vegas.  without question we will soon become repeat guests.", 
            "had a 4.5 star meal, but not quite 5 star, at mastro's on a friday night.  it was very crowded, as in full, but we were seated promptly at our reservation time of 8:00.  we were seated in a high top kind of half-booth type table.  i'd not sat in something like this before, but it was comfortable.  the place was humming, but since it's open to the mall, it wasn't so loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation.  \n\nour server immediately approached us to take our water and drink orders.  she also provided a wine list, which was above average but pricey, which was expected given that mastro's is located in crystals on the strip.  i didn't think it was out of line with other lists at similar places on the strip.  \n\nto start, i went with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.  this was one of the best versions of this dish i've had.  it was velveety smooth with a lot of chunks of lobster.  the sherry came through, and it was seasoned very well.  just a creamy lobstery soup.  you may get some sticker shock given that it's soup, but i think it was worth it (i can't recall the exact price, i believe it was either $16 or $18).  additionally, a friend and i shared the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tostada.  these come 3 to an order, but i could have easily eaten another dozen.  the tuna serving is substantial, and all of the accompaniments (avocado, onion salsa, and chili sauce) are fantastic.  crispy, flavorful, but not too heavy.  loved it.\n\nwe split steaks among the table, opting for the traditional bone in ribeye and the wagyu bone in ribeye from australia.  it was $110, but well worth it.  it was noticeably better than the other steak.  not that the \"regular\" ribeye wasn't good.  it was.  but, the depth of flavor with the wagyu was significantly better.  absolutely re-order if they have it available.  plus, since we were sharing they offered to cut it for us in the back of the house, which we appreciated.\n\non the side, we had the peppercorn steak sauce.  it's good, but i don't know that it's worthy of its reputation.  i didn't think the steaks needed it, so i only had a couple of bites with it.  the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> are incredibly decadent, nearly swimming in lobster and butter.  the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> is good, but it's typical for this type of dish.\n\nfor dessert, we went with the famous butter cake.  it easily lives up to its reputation.  warm, a little crispy on the outside, but impossibly moist and buttery.  served with berries, ice cream, and plenty of whipped cream, it was an excellent end to a great meal.  \n\nservice was fantastic the entire time.  our server was there when we needed her but not overbearing.  our food came out quickly, but we never felt rushed, despite knowing how busy they were that evening.  all in all, a great experience.  i can see why mastro's has its reputation, i would absolutely return."

            "mastro's ocean club is a gem that you cannot miss next time you're on the strip.  located in the newly designed city center, just look for the beautifully designed \"tree house\", which hangs high above the ultra chic boutiques in crystals that only the richest of the rich can actually shop in.  be sure to request a table inside the tree house...it's where all the cool kids sit. \n\nmastro's is not cheap, but then again, nothing in vegas is.  in any case, it's worth every penny because the food is outstanding.  i started off with a very rich and tasty new england <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark>.  for my entree, i went with the porcini mushroom crusted <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with fried spinach.  it was light but delicious!! perfect for lunch.  for the side dish, what else but the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>! i'm not talking about lobster flavored <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  no, no, not at mastro's.  i'm talking about over a pound of lobster mixed in the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  it was soooo good and was big enough that all four of us could enjoy it with plenty to spare.  although we were happily stuffed, our waiter brought out their signature butter cake with fresh whipped cream on the side for dessert; with his compliments (a very nice touch, which only further highlighted the tremendous service that we had during our entire meal). i highly recommend getting this dessert no matter how full you are. we all loved it.\n\ni should note that the cocktails were also great.  make sure you get one of their signature martinis, which comes with dry ice on the bottom of the glass that makes the drink bubble and emit smoke.  pretty cool. \n\nalthough i was able to get a table for four for lunch on a saturday with ease through opentable, that won't last long because the restaurant only opened up 2 weeks ago and the buzz is still building.  soon, mastro's will one of the hottest tables in vegas so get in while you can.", 
            "delicious! we came for \"linner\" and i just wish i was hungrier! at morel's in the palazzo, we met the most amazing waiter and totally chatted it up with him. he let us know that he also works at mastro's ocean club so we also had to go visit him there...\n\nthis restaurant is gorgeous to look at and basically looks like a tree house with the crystal's shopping area of city center. it's gorgeous!\n\nwe started with amazing cappuccinos in the bar area since our favorite waiter, dion, was not quite ready yet. i noticed that a cocktail that one girl in the bar was drinking was \"smoking\"... i think they put dry ice in it for effect!\n\nwhen we were seated for lunch, we ordered the fried onion strings as an appetizer and the escargot. the bread including \"pretzel bread\" was a great appetizer too. the onion string serving size was huge and could have fed about 8 people. the escargot were in amazing sauce that i dipped my bread into afterward! \n\nthen, i ordered the cobb salad that came with a generous serving of huge prawns; it was delicious! he had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with the light bread crumb preparation and it was also amazing! we also shared the house <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> that included scallions, bacon, etc mixed in and were rich and delicious. \n\nwhat a fabulous late lunch/early dinner on the way to the airport! it was tough to leave vegas after an amazing meal like that though!", 
            "in less than 3 months, mastros is already one of the very best steak and seafood restaurants in las vegas.\n\na truly gorgeous architectural creation. \ndon't eat in the bar area; eat in the main room. \nthey call it the \"treehouse\"; i call it the ufo (seems more suitable to the nevada location!)\n\ni had the 22 oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>; charred outside; warm and red inside. quite deliciious. (envy's <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> is a touch more juicy and succulent however.)\n\nthe sides: string fries excellent; mac and cheese addictive; mastros <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> very tasty.\n\nservice is friendly and attentive.\nwine list is very good, but not mind-blowing.\n\ni'd go there soon if i were you, because it won't be long before getting a table will be as challenging as getting super-bowl tickets.\n\na close-to-perfect experience. i just wish they had a local's discount to encourage mid-week action.", 
            "a couple of weeks ago i went to dinner by myelf at mastro's ocean club, the wooden donut shaped eatery located in the middle of the new crystal's shopping mall at city center. \n\nit was tempting to fill up on the bread basket filled with pretzel and rye bread sticks, parmesan crackers, and teardrop sourdough boules, but i restrained myself and saved room for a half order of the <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark> ($7.99) and the <mark>Sauteed Shrimp</mark> appetizer ($18.95). everything at mastro's is fairly expensive, so these dishes were a great way to test their quality without spending a ton. the <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark> was essentially a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with horseradish in the dressing, and being a huge fan of horseradish, i very much enjoyed it. i always ask for light dressing (or dressing on the side) in less expensive restaurants because more expensive restaurants generally know how to dress a salad properly, and mastro's was no exception. if anything, the salad bordered on verge of being under-dressed, so if you are a fan of heavy salad dressing, i would ask for extra. the <mark>Sauteed Shrimp</mark> were nothing less than wonderful, and hit the spot for my seafood craving. the huge shrimp were cooked just right and served over a broth that tasted like a <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> reduction rich with butter. the cheesy garlic bread croutons absorbed this liquid on one end, but remained crunchy at the other, providing some textural contrast. it was fun to dip all the different kinds of bread from the basket in the sauce as well to see how they each paired differently. overall it was a really successful dish, and because the shrimp were so plump and the sauce so rich, it was certainly enough for my entree. one item that i might have tried as a side had i been with someone, however, was the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> - they looked fantastic. i wasn't too disheartened by not getting them, as i still had a terrific meal that was plenty filling.\n\ni wanted to order their signature butter cake dessert, but because it was $14 and i was full by that point, i decided to pass. i'm sure it's enough for two to three people so maybe next time i go and i'm not by myself i'll splurge and get it.", 
            "i was on a trip to vegas on a shopping trip with my mother and my husband demanded that we went to this restaurant.  my mom loved that the restaurant was in a tree-house. our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. we both had the petite fillet, cook amazingly to both our liking. we also had the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (amazing as well). unfortunately, we didn't have room for desert, but it a reason to go back! i even got a phone call the next day asking about my experience which makes me feel valued.", 
            "we went to mastro's for my friend's birthday dinner.  we were all impressed with the staff - they were very friendly and accommodating (we were 30 minutes late for our reservation).  our waiter was attentive and made sure we all had our drinks and that the food was to our liking.  speaking of the food, we loved everything!  a few of us ordered steaks (that were cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth!!)  some ordered fish and they raved about their dishes.  we shared a variety of sides including asparagus (steamed and sauteed), <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, and <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> (which was out of this world!!!!!)   \n\nbottom line, it's definitely worth a visit.  we will be going back next time we are in vegas.", 
            "excellent \n\ncame here with a party of 30 so i got to sample everything. we reserved their private dining room and it was fantastic. service was great, the room was perfect because we could be as loud as we wanted, and the food stole the show. \n\nmust have....... would be their seafood platter. it's a 3 tier platter that comes with dry ice giving that smoky, cloudy look. it came with oysters, shrimp, <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>, and lobster over a bed of shaved ice. \n\nthe bone in rib eye, bone in kansas city, and bone in fillet were all perfectly cooked and seasoned. do not get the fish here. the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was a little overcooked and dry. then again, why the hell would you order fish at a steakhouse? \n\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> was great but not when this cost more than the entrees. i was told that this dish was featured in entourage and a few other magazines. \n\nwe celebrated 8 birthdays so the staff gave us 8 individual desserts which was very nice of them. their butter cake was to die for. my god that was good. their bread pudding and apple crisp were also very delicious.", 
            "i have been to the mastro's in los angeles and when i saw the ocean club at the city center in las vegas - i have to say i was a bit taken a back. do not get me wrong reader - here is this amazing bird's nest modern structure that looks like it should be in a museum somewhere....nested in a mall. given the shops were all upscale. but still, a mall to say the least. it had that new mall smell that you'll just never get out of your clothes. it left me wondering what the restaurant and atmosphere would be like during dinner service. well, i didn't have to wonder. my group had planned a bachelorette dinner for the lucky bride to be. \n\nstaff - these people are pros. seriously, every person works together like a well oiled machine. we had a group of nine girls, which is not easy but i'm sure they see that pretty often. it is vegas. and the service was fantastic. our waiter and the whole wait staff was really great and accommodating. our reservations were at 745pm and we had to be out of there by 915pm to catch our ride. they were so mindful of that the whole time, but also didn't take away from the experience. \n\nthe meal - what can i say about the food that has not already been said? pretty much nothing - so i'll just reinforce what my fellow yelpers have been saying the whole time - it's amazing. i ordered the salmon and one of the other girls ordered a fillet and we shared both plates. both cooked perfectly. for sides - <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, regular <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and asparagus. all delicious. \n\nthe whole experience was wonderful. and i had serious reservations about what this was going to entail when i walked in. but mastro's did not disappoint. i enjoyed stepping back and being able to compare my experience in la to vegas. and although each restaurant had their similarities whether it be with the menu or just how the staff serves you, both restaurants still had a their own uniqueness which made each experience stand out.", 
            "was there while in las vegas for business. my hosts were contractors on the project and we maybe got a little extra pampering. there were 7 of us. \n\nfood is incredible. we didn't order appetizers, but a couple of us did have salads. the entrees around the table were steaks, swordfish, and <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>. we shared the stellar <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, along with <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> and broccoli. for desert, they just left us the desert tray. we couldn't finish it! \n\nservice is second to none. everything you would expect.", 
            "love this restaurant! we had a wonderful experience there. top-notch service and great food. came here last week with my sister and my bf. we made reservation for 7:30 but we were about 15 mins late. the staff were really nice and didn't make us wait for our seats. we were seated almost immediately. right when we were seated, the server asked us if we cared for any drinks and offered us a warm towel to wipe our hands with. he also explained everything on the menu which i thought was awesome. \n\nmy sister and i ordered two cocktails ($18/each for the cocktails) and we shared the salmon as a main course. for appetizer we had the escargot and oysters on the <mark>Oysters On Half Shell</mark>. my bf ordered the filet mignon ($50+) but it was really tender and cooked to perfection. we also had the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> which i thought was great. the bill came out to be over $250 but i think it was well worth it for the great food, atmosphere and service.\n\ni would suggest requesting for a seat inside the birdnest because every table is separated with a glass so it's very unique.", 
            "i am glad i tried this great restaurant out.  the restaurant is located in the aria city center in a mall called the crystals.  it is located on the second floor that looks like a wooden aladdin lamp.  \n\nthe ambiance was great.  it was comfortable, cozy, and had live music.  the food was pretty awesome.  i ordered the cowboy ribeye cut bone in steak.  it's the second largest steak on the menu.  it is probably by far the best cut of steak i've had.  it was tender, soft, and juicy.  the potatoes au gratin was alright.  next time i am going to try the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  the bread they serve is pretty impressive.  you actually get a bread basket full of different assortment of bread.  there is pretzel bread, wheat, white, bread sticks, and others that i can't recall right now.  tasted like it was freshly baked that day.\n\nthe service is the reason why i gave this place 5 stars instead of 4.  our server was outstanding.  he was pretty knowledgeable about the food.  helped me make up my mind on what i want right away.  didn't give me too much info where it would confuse me (it doesn't take much to confuse me).  he checked up on us every now and then to see how we were doing on our meal.  he asked if we wanted to order dessert.  we declined because we were stuffed like a turkey at a thanksgiving dinner.  so we politely asked for the bill.  so our server brought us back a raspberry sorbet with our bill.  it was on the house and and he said he couldn't let us go without having dessert to complete our wonderful meal.  how cool was that!? i am not a sorbet fan, but i still take a few bites cause i'm a fatass.\n\ni recommend to go and enjoy the food, but i will return because of the service.", 
            "amazing food, drinks, service, and atmosphere.  make sure to get the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and request to sit in the \"tree house\"!", 
            "this is our 1st time at any of the mastro's restaurants.  we have family & friends in the vegas area who recommended & accompanied this as a truly upscale & 4-to-5 star dining experience.  they were correct!  \n\nupon being seated practically in the center of their 60 ft teak or mahogany simulated treehouse, we asked the very crisply uniformed captain to recommend the appetizers.  he had us create our own \"seafood tower\" and we chose <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark>, shrimp, oysters & calamari... delish!  the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> & <mark>Iceberg Wedge</mark> were next.  the five of us then shared a filet, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, atlantic salmon & scallops with garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  our captain went over and above as he assisted us in choose the appropriate wine to pair with our culinary choices.\n\nnow.. we would come back for all of this goodness, but the mastro's butter cake is one of a kind and is worth the whole meal or just to drop in for dessert after shopping.  \n\nneedless to say & in keeping with my \"positively outrageously\" great dining recommendations, you have to enjoy mastro's if you're in vegas!", 
            "great ambiance and amazing service!  not to mention the food is just fabulous.  we started with <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> which was good but nothing spectacular.  but then for the main entree i got the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> with a side of mastro's <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  the meat was perfectly cooked to medium rare and the flavor was melt-in-your-mouth delicioso.  even the simple <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> was creamy and savory.  it sure is a splurge but i highly recommend it if you are in vegas and want to pamper your tastebuds.", 
            "who wouldn't love a restaurant that's positioned right next to tiffany's??  seriously.......\n\ni went for a company dinner so cannot attest to the price (although based on other yelpers, the cost is quite steep!)  started with a lovely bread basket with a wide variety of different breads, including \"pretzel bread\" which is quite similar to joe's stone crab bread.  the bruschetta appetizer came next which was very oniony, but it's a good thing i'm a big fan of onions because i absolutely loved it.  <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was just so-so.\n\nthen the main course....i got the mahi mahi in this fancy butter sauce which was excellent, but not as good as my husband's salmon (i almost stole his plate it was that good).  the fish portions were very large and filling.  sides for the table included creamy <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>.  the spinach was a little salty for my taste, but not grainy at all.\n\ndessert was cheesecake with whipped cream and berries which was creamy and decadent...a+ even though i was completely full i ate the whole thing.\n\nwould i return to mastros?  absolutely.  wonderful ambience and great salmon.....after all it is an \"ocean club\" so the fish has to be good right?  cheers!", 
            "actually 4.5, but not a choice here.\n\nso good! they know steak. the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> plate was delicious as well. mac and cheese was sinful. i also had the ceasar salad, mushrooms, garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and butter cake for dessert. everything was great, but the steak, ahi and mac and cheese were phenomenal. \n\nthe place is cool. we sat in the tree dome looking section. it's also nice to have tiffany's and louis v. right next door.\n\nour table was up against another seating booth which i didn't like. i don't like strangers so close to me, especially when i'm eating. don't want to listen to them and i'm sure they don't want to listen to me. service was decent, but they were busy.", 
            "the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> is absolutely delish!  we came here on a wednesday night and there was live music which was pretty cool.  we ordered kumomoto oysters and the scallops for appetizers and share the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  everything was delish and our server was super attentive.  will definitely go back.", 
            "obviously mastro's is really expensive but it's very much worth it. this is in vegas so my friends and i didn't have time for dinner so we decided to go to the bar and have some appetizers.\n\n<mark>Chopped Salad</mark>\ncalamari\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>\n\nthe chocolate covered strawberries are ridiculously good.\n\nwe ended up back at the bar the following night to do it all again. i wish i could remember both bartender's names but i can't. they were both great.\n\nif you don't mind paying for great food the this is the place to go.", 
            "when in vegas, you gotta do it right and mastro's is well...doing it right.\n\nmastro's ocean club is owned by the same very popular chain steakhouses but focuses more on a seafood selection. it's located right in the crystals shopping center in city center. \n\ni came here with a group of 9 and we were able to be seated in the treehouse (ballin!). food was great. i had the bone in ribeye and but also nibbled on a <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> as well. both were delicious. the sides rocked as well with the wasabi <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> being my favorite. \n\noverall a great dining experience, highly recommend!", 
            "before heading out for a night of partying at xs, my buddy and i found ourselves wandering around the cosmopolitan looking for a good restaurant to try.  while the rest of our friends were grabbing dinner at the literal hole-in-the-wall pizza counter upstairs, we wanted to take advantage of the opportunity of trying something a little more unique.  well, that is, assuming we could find somewhere that didn't have a crowd; each of our first few tries were met with wait times of 45 mins or longer.  hoping for better luck at the mall at city center next door, we eventually worked our way over to mastro's ocean club to check things out there.  greeted by a friendly hostess and the opportunity for immediate seating, our search came to an end.  score for table seating by the bar!\n\nfor a while now, i've heard a number of good things about mastro's from friends in la.  from the service to the food, they've all mentioned how great their experiences were.  at the end of my meal, i could certainly see what they mean.  after perusing through the menu of seafood and steaks, i ended up going with the grilled <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with a side order of the garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> for my friend and i to split (rather, i wanted it for myself, but needed to \"share\" it to justify getting it).  now, i know...ordering a fish dish on my first ever trip to mastro's is pretty counter-intuitive considering their reputation as a steakhouse.  however, given that it's one of their two ocean club spots, i figured that maybe i should give the seafood a shot since i don't know if it'll be as readily offered at their pure steakhouse spots.\n\nwhen our orders were brought to our table, i have to admit that it wasn't stunning at first glance.  although the cut was larger than i had anticipated (which is never a bad thing), there wasn't much in terms of frills and dressing.  since everything is a la carte, you literally get just the fish on the plate, with half a lemon on the side of seasoning.  despite how lonely it may have looked though, there's no questioning the quality.  although <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> is generally more forgiving when it comes to cooking because of its fatty nature, this one was done perfectly regardless.  the meat was soft and tender, and it was moist throughout.  flavor-wise, you couldn't ask for much more - modest seasoning to it, with a great buttery and velvety sort of flavor from the fish.  excellent.\n\nas for our sides, the garlic mashed was pretty good.  i liked the consistency (thick, but not gloppy or too thin), and the flavor wasn't too potent.  while i would generally prefer a stronger punch to it, it worked well to not overpower the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  in addition, my friend also slipped in an order of the skinny fries, and let me tell you - a \"basket\" of fries here really is a basket of fries.  the order was this huge mound of fried potato goodness, and even after chipping away at it throughout our meal, there was still plenty left for our other friend to snack on when he joined us.  oh, and i can't forget to mention their bread basket either - all served hot and soft with salted butter.  all of the ones i tried were good, but my favorite was the toast-like bread with cheese...so good.\n\nas for the rest of the experience, everything else was spot on.  our server sarah was awesome - really attentive, friendly, and pretty damn cute.  now, i'm sure that last part might have had something to do with it, but seriously, really cute.  while it's kind of odd that it's located in a mall, i really liked the vibe of the place.  the main dining area is on a sort of a semi-open balcony (check out the pictures...quite a distinctive look), while they have a piano and singer by the bar.  while the music can make conversations a little tough, it's no worse than if you were sitting with a large group.\n \nwhile i do somewhat regret not having ordered beef instead of fish, i have no complaints about what i had either (plus, was still under that damn zero/reduced beef pledge).  that said, i know i'll be back to try more of their menu anyways (saw several tables with the seafood tower), as well as to get a table in their \"tree house\" section.  great ambiance for a date as well, and while not a cheap meal, it's certainly worth the price.  but then, that could just be my waitress-induced bias doing the talking too..", 
            "truly a study of excess starting with the \"tree house\" in the middle of the crystals mall.  the excellent food is also a study of excess especially if you are not a huge eater!  starting with the escargot, served in the shell swimming in butter and garlic with a wonderful assortment of breads on the side.  best i have had in a long time.  the entree of <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> sashimi was huge (10 oz.) and perfectly cooked (virtually uncooked!) was a real treat.  the scallops were also more than generous, perfectly seared and served in a wonderful creamy sauce with toast points.  we decided to splurge and went for the $37 <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and were not disappointed, only bad part is this really would be too much for a table of four instead of 2 but we managed to eat all the lobster anyway.  service was flawless.  as you might imagine the bill was part of the excess, cocktails, wine, shared app, entrees with side and a shared desert came to about $260 but it was fun!", 
            "loud! we were first seated in the dining room right next to the piano/singer in the bar. i had to ask twice to be moved to somewhere more quiet because i could not be heard over the singer. fortunately we were seated shortly away from the bar, but the noise level was still very high. i would not return no matter how good the food just because of the noise level.\n\nthe food. we split a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, which was ok but too salty and over dressed. we had to ask for some bread. my wife loved her scallops. my swordfish was very thick and looked delicious. it, however, was a little over cooked, and fairly bland. it did not have that grilled flavor i love on fish. the waiter recommended the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> ($38), so we got that and the green beans with slivered almonds. if you do not absolutely love lobster, take the $10 <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> instead. i do not like my veggies over cooked, but the beans were way under done. after dinner decaf coffee was just ok and served in a large cup, but we not offer a refill until we were ready to leave. key lime pie was a large slice, but i've had much better.", 
            "i was more into the live entertainment than the food.  bone in ribeye was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  sides were just aiight - mac and cheese, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark>, salad, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, sauteed asparagus, sauteed mushrooms.  eating in a mall just doesn't feel as nice although we did see tyson chandler from the mavs.  i'd come back to try their seafood.",

            "thanks to the mad hattrix's mouth-watering review of the pretzel bread, mastro's became my top choice of the perfect vegas steakhouse to celebrate my steak-loving boyfriend's birthday.\n\nknowing that the restaurant is located in crystals--a shopping arcade (mall is far too down-market to describe this place) featuring tiffany, cartier, and lv--i had a feeling this would be an expensive celebration, and it was, but well worth it.\n\nour table in the treehouse wasn't ready when we arrived, so we sat at the bar and ordered a drink. i thought i was prepared for vegas prices, but i was wrong. martinis that cost $18?! but when in rome ...\n\nas our bartender raised the shaker to pour the martini into the oversize martini glass, i noticed that the cocktail shaker itself was about one and half times the size of your regular shaker. that's right, we got about three generous martinis out of that one shaker. unfortunately, we'd each ordered a martini, which is why the rest of my review will be a bit vague.\n\nthis mastro's features a variety of seafood, and you can create your own seafood tower appetizer, even if it's only for one. we passed on a seafood appetizer and ordered a very good <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, followed by a bone-in rib eye for him and a <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> mignon for me. our waitress also sold us on the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>--1 1/4 pounds of lobster chunks folded into buttery mashies--so we enjoyed some seafood too.\n\nbetween the monster martini and the addictive pretzel bread (soft with a slightly chewy exterior, sprinkled with salt), i had a hard time saving room for the entree and ended up taking half of it home. but it was one of the best <mark>Filet</mark> i've ever had. although i love the tenderness of filet mignon, i typically prefer the flavor of a rib eye. both were excellent, even as leftovers.\n\nthe restaurant provided a complimentary slice of chocolate cake to mark the occasion. and although it would have been nice if they'd given us their famous butter cake, which they'd talked up, it didn't really matter because i was too full to have even one bite.\n\ni guess i'll just have to go back for more pretzel bread and that butter cake. but next time, i'll definitely share a martini--and maybe remember a few more details.", 
            "wow is all i can say.  we have a mastros steakhouse in chicago and i have not been able to get in as it's always so hoppin. so since we were in vegas, we decided to give mastros ocean club a try.  we were not disappointed.  the restaurant is located in the city center shopping area and fits in well with the high end shopping and the swanky d\\u00e9cor of the city center and surrounding hotels.  the d\\u00e9cor is simple contemporary.  it would be too simple if it wasn't for their amazing bar set up but more their \"tree house\" structure.  if you visit mastros, request that you sit in the tree house section.  they also have a lounge singer and piano player.  the volume was fine (as i've read other review that it was extremely loud) - but we were sitting in the tree house area so i can imagine if you had one of the tables next to the singer or in the booths behind them, it would be pretty loud.  regardless, the singer was very good and sang songs from all genres.  now to the important part - the food.  everything we ordered was amazing.  as all higher end restaurants, all sides are ala cart but big enough to share.  our entrees were delishous - <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, and scallops.  i have no complaints, all were cooked perfectly and extremely flavorful.  the portions were quite large.  the sides were equally amazing and big enough to share between 3-4 people.  one of the sides - the mac and cheese was ah. maz. ing.  if we're ever back i'd be happy to dive into the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  the wedge salad was enourmous, enough to share between 2 people.  i had the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> which was very tasty.  i've had it before at other places and it sometimes has had a \"fishy\" taste but not this. and there were big chunks of lobster.  service, supurb as expected.  the menu is pricey, but worth it.  i'll definitely be checking out mastros in chicago.", 
            "best steak i've ever had. i had the bone in filet cooked medium rare and it was so tender it just dissolved in my mouth. i also shared the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and it was probably the best <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> i've ever had as well. it was super creamy and the lobster was cooked perfectly.\n\ni came here w/ a group of 20 other guys for my friends bachelor party and we were given a private room w/ a tv so we could watch some football. boys night out w/ steak, wine, and football? cant beat that. the bachelor kept saying this was way too fancy and it was all too much when he walked in the room. but one of our waiters told us \"this place is fancy...but you can act ghetto if you want. just relax and have a good time.\"\n\nwe had an excellent experience w/ even better food. this place is legit.", 
            "overall, i really enjoyed my meal but be prepared for a different ambiance! the restaurant is literally in the middle of the mall, with the tables pretty much out in the open. not a huge deal, but definitely not ideal. \n\ni had the <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark> (spicy <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with no croutons), 8 oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark> and cheese cake for dessert. the filet was perfectly prepared, served on a burning hot plate that sizzled and continued to cook the sides of <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, spinach and garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. our table also shared the <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark> appetizer, which was excellent! highly recommended!",

            "everything here was spectacular from beginning to end. i went here for dinner on a friday evening. the restaurant itself is located inside of crystals in an open area of the shopping center. despite the open area, the atmosphere was still very nice and the live music really added to it.\n\nmy experience:\nstarters\n-the bread was pretty good\n-the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> was delicious and the horseradish was spicy!\n\nmain course & sides\n-i ordered the filet, and having dined at another steakhouse earlier in the week, i must say, the filet here was incredible. this was probably one of the best <mark>Filet</mark> i have ever had!\n-the sides were just as amazing. we had the mac and cheese, <mark>Green Beans with Sliced Almonds</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>. i would recommend all of them as there wasn't one i did not like.\n\ndessert\n-i'm not a huge sweets guy, but i was told that i had to try the butter cake even though we were already stuffed. it definitely lived up to the hype as a must try dessert!\n\noverall, i had a great dining experience here. our waiter was awesome and we never felt rushed. i would highly recommend trying this place next time you are in vegas!", 
            "my husband and i are huge mastro's fans! we have dined frequently at the beverly hills location and thought it would be a perfect date night on our last trip to vegas to experience their ocean club. the location of this restaurant is in the crystals shopping center which is a little bit of a disappointment.  we dined in the tree house which was beautiful but the view of people shopping and the mall did take away from the ambiance, thus the four stars. i am a sweet wine type of girl and had the moscato, which was so smooth and sweet.   for an appetizer we ordered the scallops which were cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. for our entree my husband ordered the chicken and i ordered the bone-in rib eye.  the ocean club is the sea food version of their traditionally restaurant but offers many of their beef variations.  most of the appetizers are seafood options but they offer their regular sides with additional seafood options. the mac n cheese and garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were great as always.", 
            "yeah yeah, this place is great (ribeye, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, butter cake). \n\ncomparing craftsteak??\n\nservice: waaaaaaay better at mastro's. craftsteak reminds me of being on a caribbean cruise, and that's not a good thing.\n\nfood: larger portions and better execution at mastro's. craftsteak seemed oversalted on its steaks and lacking on everything else.\n\nambiance: *see service comments :)", 
            "i will preface this review with the fact that family was in town and this dinner was free!\n\nwe had reservations for saturday night  at 8:30 pm for a group of 7. i am always leery of a restaurant that is in the middle of a mall. i don't care how fancy the mall is, i think mall food every time i dine at one. mastro's my friends is no mall food place.\n\nthe service was top notch, we had a waiter and 2 bussers, while i'm sure they had different tables, they were always there when we needed them. it was like they were our dedicated staff.\n\nthe meal was top notch, starting with the amazing bread basket, continuing through the entrees, the family style sides, and ending up with an amazing dessert (which they comped to the table).\n\nthe bread basket was a good start, it had pretzel bread, olive bread, a parmesan crisp, and few other breads. the sides were amazing, they are served family style in surprisingly large portions. we had <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (some of the best i've ever had), <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, and mushrooms. we also had a few salads to pass around the table, 2 caesars (one regular and one spicy), tomato and onion, and tomato and mozzarella. a seafood tower and <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> were also ordered, i'm not much of a seafood guy but everyone else loved it. \n\nthey entrees were pretty stellar as well, i was splitting the 33oz wagyu tomahawk cut with my uncle, but since he was too full from the salads and sides, i had to man up and eat the whole thing myself (the things i have to do). this was one of the best pieces of cow i've had in my life (and i've had a lot of cow). it was cooked just a touch under medium rare (perfect imo), the marbling in the meat was insane, and it came out on a scorching hot plate. i don't know how they cooked it but it was perfect. \n\ntable mates also got the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, a filet, and a few other meats, i was very impressed with the size of their portions, most places would serve about 4oz of fish, but their <mark>Filet</mark> were about 12oz servings.\n\nafter dinner, they brought out a warm butter cake with vanilla ice cream for the table, it was a great end to the meal, and comping it was a nice touch!\n\ni have no clue what the meal ran, but it was amazing. my only complaint is that their bar area isn't the best, if they're going to make you wait 10-20 mins for your table they need more room in the bar. they did however have a great piano player and singer who played a variety from christmas carols to current hits which only added to the amazing meal.\n\nwill i be back, hopefully, especially if someone else is picking up the tab!", 
            "i came here for a nice dinner with a special person, and i absolutely loved it. \n\nfirst of all, the xmas decorations in the mall were amazing. set the mood very well for our dinner. we checked in with the hostess, and the hostess who walked us to our seats was very friendly. \n\nwe sat next to the live band, a lady singer and a guy pianist/singer. they played really good music ranging from older american pop songs to older r&b songs with their own twist. i couldn't help but to quietly sing along during dinner. \n\nwe ordered the following:\n\n1. <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> - this was the best <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> i've had in my life. they really don't skimp on the lobster meat either you would find huge chunks, and it was like digging for treasure! the meat was also cooked just right, and it was really fresh. if you go to this restaurant, this side dish is a must get if you like lobster. \n\n2. sauteed asparagus - pretty standard just got this dish to get some veggies. \n\n3. <mark>Petite Filet</mark> mignon - usually i like more flavorful cuts like ribeyes, and i don't really like filet mignons because they are lean. however this steak was so tender and cooked just right. i enjoyed it a lot. it was just the right portion, 8 oz, since i wasn't too hungry.\n\n3. <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> - i had a small bite, the scallop was cooked just right, medium rare, and the meat was so sweet!!\n\ndefinitely recommend to come here on a special occasion, or if you won from gambling!", 
            "loved the dungeness crab appetizer, crab and <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, and <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. the steaks were good but not better than other high end steakhouses but the sides and appetizers were amazing.", 
            "the food and service were both excellent. we tasted each other's main courses and i liked the fish better than the steak (i ordered the boned fillet). the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and their signature desert (butter cake) is an absolute must.", 
            "food poisoning!!! it was my birthday dinner no less. we had heard good things about this city place seafood restaurant so we gave it a try. i ordered the breaded <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. first, my fish didn't taste right and was on the cold side. i sent it back and they cooked it a little bit more and brought back the same fish but it still tasted wrong so i asked them to take it away. i only had 4 or 5 bites total and thankfully no more b/c i can't imagine how sick i would have been if i had eaten the whole thing or even half! i asked my husband to taste it before i sent it back and his stomach felt unsettled all night but he didn't get sick like me! the \"took off\" my <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> but when we got the bill my they charged us for the fish special of the evening ($57). my fish was supposed to be $47 and my husband ordered the blackened <mark>Gulf Red Snapper</mark> ($44 i think). i felt so bad by the end of dinner i didn't even get to have a birthday desert.\n\ntheir <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> were overly salty (appetizer) but good sized. the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were good and my husbands fish was seasoned well and didn't get him sick. save the overpriced meal and associated stomach ache and go somewhere else.",

            "wow!  if you like steaks, you have to try the bone in filet with a glass cabernet sauvignon.  we started with a shrimp appetizer, the shrimp was jumbo huge almost the size of a lobster. followed next was my 12 oz. bone in filet cooked medium rare which was perfect and tender. i am not a big fan <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark>, however my friend offered me a piece of her <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> which i thought was the best tasting rack i had. the seasoning used helped camouflage the gamy taste. we shared sides, garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, saut\\u00e9 mushrooms, snow peas and cream spinach. all tasted good. for the finale, the signature award winning warm butter cake ala mode.  ooooooo ahhhhhhh...  enough said.",

            "a good friend of ours suggested mastro's when we asked for a recommendation for a seafood on the strip. so i made a reservation online for that night at 7pm on the mastro's website. what i didn't know was that i had somehow clicked on the chicago location. luckily i was walking around the crystals shopping center that afternoon and went to check out the venue and was chatting with one of the hostesses who offered to check on our reservation to confirm it .. good thing she did and we fixed my error. they were pretty booked that night but were able to squeeze us in. :) \n\nthe service was pretty much top-notch from start to finish, hostesses, servers, and bussers,  all were very attentive and knowledgeable as well as being friendly and personable. loved that they dish out our sides for us .. that's a really nice touch. \n\nthe food, we had a variety of items which were all delicious but at the top of our favorites were the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> and the signature <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. both are must haves to accompany any steak or seafood dish. we had the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious as well as the pan seared <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which my dining companions said was spectacularly prepared and seasoned. \n\ndessert was over the top .. we had three .. mastro's signature warm butter cake, \nthe cherry crisp, and the profiteroles. the first two were topped with vanilla bean gelato. both were to die for. i had read lots about the warm butter cake and it was everything i had expected and more :) .. and surprisingly i also loved the cherry crisp .. i am not huge on cherry anything but the flavor had just the right amount of sweetness and was not overpowering and the crisp part is a crumbly granola like topping which is an nice balance with the gelato and fruitiness of the dish. it's something i would definitely order again! \n\nmy only complaint is that the server didn't warn us about the size of the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> appetizer. mom and i each ordered our own, and when they came out .. they were absolutely gigantic and even though we had a party of 5 we were unable to finish both. being in the service industry myself, i would have definitely warned my guests about the size of the carpaccio dish and suggested something else to order with it. \n\nall in all it was a fabulous dinner, the restaurant, even though it is in a busy mall .. has a nice ambiance, and we will absolutely be back.", 
            "vanilla batter shrimp appetizer - good but i was expecting more than 3 shrimp for $20\nbone in ribeye - good, i thought barrymore ribeye was clearly better (and cheaper)\nlobster tail - best lobster i've had, really good\nbroccoli side dish - this is just steamed broccoli, nothing special.  unless you are obsessed with broccoli i suggest spending your $10 and a different side.  \n\nlooking at other reviews it looks like i should have ordered the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and warm butter cake  instead of the shrimp and broccoli.\n\nalso while this is clearly a classy place, its also an open view restaurant where you are exposed to people walking by in the surrounding mall and there is not much space between you and other diners.  this gives off a somewhat casual flair to this place for guests expecting a more intimate and special occasion.", 
            "definitely one of the best meals i have had in a long time.  everything at mastro's is great-- from the service to the ambiance to the food, the whole evening was really enjoyable.  \n\ni don't even usually like <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, but it is really exceptional at mastro's.  the jumbo shrimp is delicious and the over the top \"smoking\" presentation is pretty amazing.  \n\nthe steak is obviously great, but i could have eaten just sides all night.  the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> were all delicious.\n\nsince i was there with a big group we also sampled several desserts.  i know a steak meal can be filling, but try to save room.  highlights included the chocolate pudding cake and the key lime pie.\n\na great restaurant for a special occasion.",

            "my girlfriend and i fell in love with this place for several reasons.  the staff, the atmosphere, and the food combined to bring us back the next night as well  we were able to make reservations through yelp and opentable but we arrived early each night and sat in the first come, first serve bar area.  the piano entertainment was first class. our server, racqel, was always timely, willing to meet our every request, and helpful in navigating the menu to ensure we got the most of the food choices we desired with the least amount of waste.  her name escapes me now but there was a corporate employee there the second night who recognized us from the night before.  she not only bought our first round of drinks but when we were leaving insisted we try their \"butter cake\" so much so that she ended up giving it to us.  very good stuff. i can't imagine anyone not feeling good upon receipt of this restaurant \"regular\" type of treatment on a 3 day, 2 night trip.  sheri and i can't wait to return to town and visit the place again!  i highly recommend any of the <mark>Filet</mark>, shriimp cocktail, king crab, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>, gorgonzola mac and cheese, and the <mark>Gulf Red Snapper</mark>.  they will split any plate they have, upon request.", 
            "i wanted to try mastro's for two reasons: (1) if possible, i would gorge myself to death on seafood; and (2) i wanted to eat in the weird looking treehouse in crystals.\n\ni got both (except for death...unless....).\n\nthe ambiance of this place is weird, to say the least.  a few tables are enclosed in a traditional restaurant space with, you know, walls.  the rest are inside the \"treehouse,\" a very cool, wood-slated structure dangling in the middle of crystals.\n\nalthough very cool looking, it's very loud.  in between the awwfffulll live music (really, they need to stop that) and the echo of everyone's conversations (no walls = no muffling of noise), it's almost difficult to have a conversation.  i would say this is not a romantic spot to eat.  \n\nthere were also lots of middle-aged dudes in jeans.  like, packs of them.  very weird.\n\nfood\n\nas we were in a \"small plate\" mood, we went crazy on the appetizers as follows:\n\n<mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> ($22)- three medium-sized scallops, three slices of parmesan toast, diced tomatoes and cream sauce.  unfortunately, the scallops were a tad overcooked and chewy. i'd probably pass on scallops next time.\n\nbeef bone marrow (around $18) - two huge bones and baguette toast.   delicious, decadent and full of flavor.  we gobbled it all up.\n\n<mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> encrusted in sesame seeds and served with julienned carrots ($22).  overall, it lacked flavor although perfectly cooked. \n\nwedge salad - ($12) big portion and very good.  i liked that they didn't cover the iceberg in dressing and instead left it on the bottom of the plate, surrounding the salad.  this allowed the diner to control how much dressing on each bite.  the dressing was a tad watery, the way i like it. well executed.  but, it's a salad, so......\n\nthen we got a half and half side of the following (they give you a half portion of each to let you try everything ($38):\n\nking crab black truffle gnocci - salty, rich and so delicious.  lots of king crab chunks. my favorite thing i tried.\n\nlobster cheese <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> -although rich, it wasn't that flavorful. mostly salty, not complex. i did love the enormous pieces of lobster, though. \n\ni have to add they were really generous with the wine pour ($12 for a glass of shiraz).\n\noverall, good service and big portions.  it's a bit pricey but they serve up some tasty food.  \n\ndefinitely come here if you're 40 and have a penchant for denim.  this is your mecca.", 
            "i love mastro's!  we went for our first anniversary dinner after having gone on our honeymoon last year. the food was so amazing we had to come back.  we were greeted at our table with 2 glasses of champagne to celebrate. we spilt the most delicious wedge salad and it was good. last year we had apps and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> as a side. those were so good they'll make you wanna slap your momma!  we were so full i am embarrassed to say we didn't even finish our steaks. this year we switched to gorgonzola mac & cheese...epic!  i had the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and my wife ordered the 12oz filet mignon.  both were the finest steaks we've ever had. you will never appreciate any other steak after that. mastros ruined steak for me, talk about melt in your mouth. our server mark was phenomenal and super attentive. a really nice guy. for desert they brought out the warm butter cake...wonderful!  mastros is the only place i would eat in my life if i had the choice. thank you  for a wonderful first anniversary dinner. go there!!!!", 
            "i will keep this short and simple. \nservice - awesome. everyone, and i mean everyone, is so nice and attentive! \ndining area- we requested to be seated in the wooden weavy basket area. love the layout. this is a nice place if you wanted to do a business dinner! (we were just a party of two though)\nappetizer- <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark>. okay. i am spoiled by seattle's seafood so i have high expectations. yes. the crab is good. cold and refreshing. however for $25 dollars i rather have tried something else as i can get much more up north. however it was good. \nsteak- bone in filet was their signature so that's the one we chose. i think they cooked it exactly the way we wanted. medium rare. it was tender and it was good, but not melt in your mouth fantastic. it was overshadowed by (dun dun dun) the fish!!! \nseafood- <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. i got it the \"arreganato\" way. i probably butchered the word too. holy crap this was amazing. it melted in your mouth and left you wondering where the heck it went so you just kept going back for more. \nsides: thanks to the yelper who gave the advice to get half the amt of gnocchi. omg this is soooo good. the truffle oil just perfected it. best gnocchi ever!!\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> was a huge portion (had to take it to go!) i am not really a mashed potato or lobster fan but my bf is and he really liked it so definitely try one of these sides. \ndidnt have room for dessert but we really wanted to try the butter cake. lame. next time! \noverall a good experience but expect to cough up some serious $$$. try the fish!!!", 
            "after living in vegas for about a year, this is easily the most disappointing high end meal i've had.  i'd give the food a 4/5 but the service was probably a 1/5.\n\nservice\nthe first disappointment was waiting.  we had a reservation and even so i can understand waiting by the bar for a few minutes.  however, we wanted far more than a few minutes.  our \"leader\" went up to the front to inquire and they said on someone will be by shortly to seat you.  that didn't happen so we had to check back again and someone gave us the apology of \"oh, i'm sorry i thought they came and got you.\"\n\nmaybe a miscommunication, but certainly something that could be excused.  however, things didn't get better from there.  it seems like about 10 minutes from when we seated until we even got drink menus, then another 10-15 before the drinks arrive.  easily 15 minutes before bread arrived at the table.  it just felt like everything was so slow.  after the first round of drinks came our waitress or waitresses seemingly disappeared.  i mean when you have a table of 10 people ordering rounds of $15 cocktails or better you'd figure service would be fast.  i think they easily missed out on  at least 1 extra round due to the slow service.\n\nif you look at the prices at mastro's and compare it to other places across town, you would expect to have a waiter or waitress that knows the menu back and forth and can describe all of the stars.  we got none of that.  i would say our service was at the level of an average chain restaurant.  you aren't adding any value when you ask about menu items and the waitress just lists 3 things that are \"good\".  we asked how the steaks come and the reply was something like \"what do you mean\"?  i mean are they seasoned, sauced, dry aged?  there is no explanation on the menu or listing of sauces or accompaniments for the steaks....\"oh yeah, they are seasoned and broiled\"....thanks.\n\nthis was followed up with no description or explanation of any sides.  during the meal we couldn't even locate the waitresses and people were still anxious to get more drinks.\n\ni will say that the food was good.  the steak was unique in the regard it was so warm when it came out.  usually food has somewhat cooled but their steak still had a sizzle and was warm for the first few bites, pretty good.  the asparagus was nothing special.  the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were good but at $40 can be steep for a side dish.  <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> was good, but i'm not crazy about gnocchi so i'm not an expert.  the problem in vegas is that you can find a place equal to mastro's food wise with probably lower prices so suffering through bad service can be a deal breaker.\n\nneedless to say, nobody ordered dessert or drinks after dinner.  with so many other options in town for steak i probably wouldn't come back for that.  i will say i tried the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> sashimi which seemed great for under $40.  i didn't try it but the swordfish looked the same.  i would come back if i was in the mood for seafood but would be nervous about the service, maybe with a smaller party and a better table things would be better.", 
            "ordered the australian ragu, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, mac and cheese, creamy spinach, brussel sprouts, and vanilla baked lobster. all extremely delicious and great service. the australian ragout is 33 oz, i shared with a friend and it was more than enough. another friend got the new york ragout which is also delicious but very, and i mean very fatty but just as tender and juicy. depending on your taste, i preferred the australian ragout.",

            "ordered the ny strip 16 oz. i asked for it to be cooked medium rare, but it was slightly more rare than i had expected. nonetheless, it was still an amazing piece of big juicy steak. i would like to say that i went a little overboard with the whole pound of steak. the 12 oz would've sufficed.\n\nwe had a side of <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were really creamy and the lobster blended well with the gravy. overall, i felt it was a decent side. don't know why people keep raving about it.\n\nwe had saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms for our second side. these were very juicy and well flavored. mushrooms and steak make an amazing combination.\n\ni will definitely be returning next time to try their seafood.", 
            "wow!  beautiful setting, great service, and the food was excellent.  absolutely one of the best meals to be had on the vegas strip.  we recommend:  the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, gorgonzola mac-n-cheese, <mark>Pacific Swordfish</mark>, and the lamb.  the filet was amazing, also.", 
            "we went to mastro's on a sunday early evening for dinner.  there were maybe three to four other tables occupied but other than that there was plenty of good seating available.  \n\nspeaking of seating, i found the set up a little off-putting...we were seated at a two person table that butted directly against the back of a circular seating arrangement, which just so happened to contain 3-4 lovely active young children on this day.  somehow your ability to enjoy a nice meal is a bit inhibited with a 5 year old staring at you from 1.5 feet away.  perhaps it was our fault for not requesting one of the 50 odd other empty tables.\n\nas other yelpsters have stated it is also a bit weird to be enjoying a $$$$ meal with miley cyrus cranking in the background due to the open seating overlooking/hearing the mall like crystal shops.  enough nit picking though, on to the food!\n\nour server was very attentive and started us out promptly with ice water and tea.  micro demerit for including a lemon in my iced tea after asking to hold the lemon, but no big deal.  huge stars go out to the staff for keeping the beverages brimming full, a frequent problem for such an iced tea addict as myself.  the bread service came with enough to feed a small army.  mini-loaves of sourdough, pretzel, bruschetta, and french.  \n\nwe ordered the calamari ($15).  there was plenty for the two of us, lightly breaded and including a lemon side and a dipping sauce very similar to the outback sauce you get with bloomin onions.  \n\ntaking the \"go big or go home\" philosophy i decided to order the <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark> ($69) and 22 oz ribeye ($55) for my entree.  my girlfriend ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> ($50) and we split a side of <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> ($38).  \n\nthe steak was wonderfully charred, cooked medium.   the server was nice enough to \"de-shell\" the <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark>.  the lobster was perfectly cooked and delicious with melted butter.  the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was also excellent.  i let my date enjoy the majority of the potatoes as they were a bit soupy due to the sauce but the small portion i had did taste good.  \n\nwe got the butter cake to go, not sure on the price, it came complete with detailed instructions on how to best prepare it from our server.  final bill with tip $325.", 
            "i didn't believe it when i heard the ribeye was hard to finish.\n\nfrom my experience, fine dining is hard to get full. this was not the case here. i was warned about the size of the steak and from the menu it was 22oz! that's ridiculous! even if the bone was about 5oz, that's still a whopping 17oz!\n\nall the servers here are exceptionally knowledgeable and professional. i felt like i was not treated as a kid eating at the adults' table. \n\nwe all shared a portion of the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and by far they are the best <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> i've ever had. i would highly recommend trying this dish.\n\nfor my main entree, i ordered the 22oz ribeye cooked medium rare. although next time i would probably get rare+, i thought the medium rare was still delicious. the steak was massive and amazingly flavored. by the end of the meal i felt overwhelmed and defeated. i have never been conquered by how much steak there was until mastro's.\n\nmy brain kept telling me to eat more but my stomach fought against this decision.\n\noverall, mastro's was a great experience. the steak here, so far, is only second to the kobe beef i had in japan. i would definitely come back for seconds.", 
            "i've only been to one steakhouse before this and i wasn't too impressed, but i decided to give this place a shot since our friends were really excited for some fine dining in vegas. \n\nour group of eight was seated at a round table underneath the massive open-air structure. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were so buttery and delicious. this was a table favorite and it was devoured in minutes. i honestly think the garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> would have probably tasted just as good and would have been much cheaper. \n\nthe 22oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> was enormous. my friends and i were joking how maybe half the steak would just be bone, but it turns out we were sorely wrong .the bone was maybe 4-5 ounces and the rest of it was delicious, flavorful meat. i opted for medium rare, my friend opted for rare, and i think most of the table preferred the medium rare since it had more flavor although the rare meat was more tender. it really depends on your steak preferences.\n\nthe dessert was butter cake. the first couple bites i thought were way to sweet, but that's why it came with a side of heavy whip cream. top the dessert with the whip cream and it really tones down the sweetness.\n\nthe things that stood out the most was the ambiance and quality of food.", 
            "this was my first time trying mastro's and i'm glad it was in vegas.  and let me tell you, everything here was expensive.  i probably won't be coming back but i'm glad i finally got to try it.\n\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> - it was actually pretty good!  the lobster taste and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> really mixed in well together.  i've heard that this dish wasn't as good in the costa mesa one\n\nbone-in-filet - very tender and very good!\n\nbone-in-<mark>Bone-In KC Strip</mark> - i loved it\n\ni loved everything that was bone in.  i didn't get to try the bone-in-ribeye because it was too big\n\nwe also got a side of asparagus which is like $10 (not worth it).  although it was good, it tasted like i can cook this at home for so much cheaper, and it would taste the same.  nothing special at all", 
            "the meal may have taken 3+ hours (we had a large group and were in no rush, but still) but man, was it fantastic.\n\nthe group started with the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, and some shrimp dish (i'm allergic so i don't remember what it was exactly). the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> was delicious. not anything special necessarily, but it sure was delicious. the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> was cooked perfectly and came with such a delicious sauce, a superb aioli as opposed to the more traditional tomato sauce.\n\none thing the group really appreciated was that mastro's agreed to specially make a burger for one individual who didn't want to eat steak. of course, the individual got sick, but we were so appreciative of their willingness to accommodate us that we asked to have the burger brought out and we all shared it - cut it up into sliders. they were melt-in-your-mouth incredible. for a classy steakhouse, mastro's sure makes an incredible burger.\n\ni had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> for my entree, most everyone else had steaks. boy am i glad i went with the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> though, i was already feeling a bit full from the appetizers and then the sides on top sure was a lot of food. the fish was cooked perfectly, seasoned excellently. flaky and fairly light actually, it was a good sized helping as well. would definitely get again.\n\nfor sides the table all raved about the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, but i'm allergic, so i couldn't eat it. which was fine by me because the gorgonzola mac & cheese was heavenly. and the portion of the side was enormous. honestly, i could've had the mac and cheese side as my entire meal and gone home happy.\n\nfood was great, service was as good as expected, just a wonderful meal overall. would go back again in a heart beat.", 
            "every time i hear mastros i always crave for everything in this restaurant. servers are amazing! some of the hostess' are amazingly nice some of them are okay.. everything is good in this restaurant.. i always order bone in rib eye (yum!), <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. just an fyi, if you're gonna have a huge party with you the side dishes is good for 4 people! which is really great :)", 
            "absolutely amazing! excellent service from the time i called to make a reservation (because open table didn't show availability for the time i wanted) to the hostess to the wait staff. we ordered the filet and it was cooked to perfection! the garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and spinach were generous and the butter cake lived up to expectations. we will definitely be back", 
            "i've been to this place maybe about 3 times, and one of its sister locations in costa mesa about 3 times as well. both restaurants exude that high end feeling and you will leave feeling... well feeling awesome that you spent 50 bucks on a slab of meat. but that's not all.\n\nif you make an open table reservation they will always call you the day of to confirm and remind you that you are going to attend. one of the times i've been to this mastro's ocean club and they were fully committed, and suggested to look for a seat at the bar area, and then one of the waitress or hostesses asked if i would mind eating on the piano (they had live music that time) which i found it hilarious, a $1k+ grand piano with me eating on it. regardless i told her i would wait for a party at the bar to be seated but that was another time. \n\nyou're going to pay at least $70+ per person but the food along with the service makes it all worth it. every time i go to mastro's, the waiters/waitresses are always so nice, helpful, professional, and willing to answer any and all questions you may have about the menu. if you haven't been there before they will let you know the vastness of the menu and how they operate as a steakhouse/ocean club.\n\nmy reccemondations as far as mastro's ocean club in las vegas?\n\nbone-in fillet\n<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> (although the filet wins my money by a mile)\n<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>\ngarlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>\n<mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark>\nand their raw oysters - wherever it is from because it is super fresh\n\nif you go in on a special occasion like a birthday or a graduation, most of the time they'll give you a slice of chocolate cake as dessert and the most kick ass whipped cream you would have ever had the chance to have. yes it is just that good.\n\nhope you guys enjoy it as much as i do. after writing this review, i'm just vying to go back.", 
            "awesome restaurant. order the special dry ice lemon drop and cosmopolitan martini's. they are definitely not for the unobtrusive. the <mark>Iceberg Wedge</mark> salad, crab cake and <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> are great and my husband enjoyed his swordfish but the piece de resistance is the butter cake with fresh whipped cream. the service was impeccable and friendly. this was such a pleasant experience that we want to try the mastro's in beverly hills, chicago and az as well.", 
            "i've been fascinated by this \"tree house\" for the longest. this was my first time visiting mastro's and i had long heard of the famous warm butter cake, so i was excited to come for a pharm. rep dinner, get to learn and try a new place. \n\nwe made our selections from a pre-set menu.\n\nmy first course i went with the caeser salad, this was pretty standard except for the bits of anchovie throughout, which is my favorite kind of caeser. \n\nfor my entree i chose the 8oz filet. i asked for it to be prepared medium. what came out was between rare and tartare. since we were in a small private dining room for the lecture, i didn't feel comfortable sending my steak back, it would be disruptive, and i didn't want to interupt the lecturer. i ended up giving it to my friend to take home to her dogs.\n\nthe family style shared sides weren't impressive either. <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> had no flavor, and the <mark>Sauted Sugar Snap Peas</mark> as well. only one i liked was the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>. \n\ndessert we had a choice between chocolate sin cake and cheesecake. i went with the chocolate cake, it came with a side of homemade whipped cream which i thought was better than the cake itself. \n\npretty disappointing meal all together. i would come back for a second try, just not in a hurry to do so. i definitely enjoyed the lecture more than dinner.", 
            "i've been to this location before and as always, they are on point with their customer service. it's always great to see them work together as a unit and are attentive to the guests. the glasses are never empty, offering of seconds on drinks and breads are consistent. \n\nthe waiters are very knowledgeable of their products. they know exactly how the meals are prepared and the taste of each item on their menu. they also offer great advices on how to maximize the flavor and food experience. \n\nthe side dishes are large enough for a party of 4 and the main course itself are large enough to satisfy your hunger.\n\ni have to be honest, the last time i was here, i ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and i was underwhelmed by the preparation. with that said, i wanted to give another fish another try since they are after all, the \"ocean club\". i  ordered their feature of the day, the halibut which comes 3 ways: pan seared, cajun/creole rub, or breaded. with the suggestion from the waiter, i chose to go through the pan seared route. it was a good size fish, served with tartar sauce on the side. the fish was prepared nicely. it was flaky and juicy. however, again i was underwhelmed with the flavor. in my opinion, it was bland and flat. the tartar sauce didn't do anything as far as offering another dimension on flavor. \n\nmy friend ordered the lamb chop and he was not impressed either. it was prepared well, pink in the middle and tender but he said he was expecting more flavors.\n\nthe other friend ordered a tomahawk steak and it was big! he said it was good and flavorful. from the look of it, the meat was prepared well also. perfectly pink in the middle throughout. he said it was good but had better. \n\nmy bestie ordered a wedge salad (of all the great options...she gets a salad!). she said it wasn't impressive. just another wedge. although she did mentioned that she liked their blue cheese crumbles. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was very rich in flavor and had a lot of lobster chunks. i love a good <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>...but the cream was a bit too rich. i wouldn't have been able to finish one by myself due to its richness, good thing it was split in half.  \n\nthe <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were full of flavors and is extremely rich in butter and cream. it was served onto our plates by the host. the <mark>Sauted Sugar Snap Peas</mark> were very tasty and had the perfect crunch and bite to it. the fries were just fries. \n\nwe were all too full to order a big dessert, i really wanted to order their butter cake but couldn't bring myself to do it so we ordered the creme brulee. it was served with a big bowl of homemade whipped cream and was a good compliment to the dessert. the brulee was sweet and the cream was not which balanced out the flavors nicely.\n\noverall, it is a great experience but i don't know if i can justify eating the fish here.", 
            "best steakhouse hands down! <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> are a few to name the best ever! <mark>Filet</mark> to die for! always a treat! love you mastros!",

            "mastro's to me is just another steak house. just like fleming's or morton's and ruth's chris, morton's offers a very classic steak restaurant. visiting vegas, i made a decision i shouldn't have made. not to say that going to matro's ocean club inside the shops at crystals was a mistake or a bad experience. i just have a dining out rule when i'm in vegas. \"if there's one in la or oc, don't go there.\" well, i broke my rule, but it was all for a birthday celebration. i figured, i probably won't be going to mastro's anytime soon, so might as well. and the bird's nest really attracted me. i was really happy with my decision for the most part.\n\nwe started things of with bread service. they offered pretzel, crouton, baguette, dinner roll, and wheat bread. the breadbasket had variety all were quite good. my favorite was the pretzel -- it was soft and airy.\n\ni had some of the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> to start. i needed some kind of greens to soak up all that meat juice. their <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was near perfect. the dressing was nice and creamy. the addition of parmesan cheese and cracked pepper made everything better.\n\ni was ready for the main event, the 22oz bone in rib eye. the rib eye is one of my favorite cuts because of the even fat marbling and soft texture. mine was cooked perfectly medium rare, though a bit more on the rare side. this actually caused the meat to be a bit tough. this cut did have some nice fat running through the steak. this helped with the tenderness and mouth feel of the meat. even though this wasn't the best steak i have had, the help of the amazing sides made it all better.\n\nthe real reason i came here wasn't the steak. well it is, and it isn't. the real reason i came here was for the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. i mean. it is mastro's ocean club -- ocean, meaning seafood is in order. this side dish was rich as can be -- full of butter. i believe the potato to butter ratio is near 1 to 1. with a whole lobster tail carefully chopped up and placed in a pool of butter, the potatoes were creamy and flavorful. the pure essence of the sea was encased in butter, and mixed with potatoes. eating this with steak was pure bliss. the kid in me wanted to order the mac and cheese. made with gorgonzola, the flavor was very rich. another cream heavy and dairy heavy dish, the mac and cheese was delicious. my favorite was the layer of melted cheese on top.\n\nmy favorite was dessert. we were celebrating a birthday, so they gave us a chocolate birthday cake. the cake was rich in chocolate and eating just a few bites was enough for me. the best thing about this dessert was their home made whipped cream. served on the side in a bowl, the homemade whipped cream was so dense and fluffy. the cold cream and the chocolate cake was a perfect mixture. honestly though, the whipped cream was the best thing ever. i wanted to take it all home.\n\neating at mastro's ocean club was a great experience. the location is a bit awkward. as you are enjoying your expensive meal inside an amazingly architectured \"bird's nest,\" you look out and you see people shopping. that is cool and all, but you can't help but think you are inside of a mall -- well, you are inside of a mall, and this mastro's makes sure you know that. i couldn't help but think i was at a very glorified food court at a mall. when i eat at a nice establishment, i want to feel secluded from the world. i just didn't get the at from here. the food is great, though as far as steakhouses go in las vegas, you can do a lot better. i guess i can only break my rule once. never eat at las vegas where you can at home.",

            "as always, maestros is on point. the blue cheese martin, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and the 12 oz steak, medium rare.", 
            "so i am a huge fan of mastro's and frequent their costa mesa and newport locations. i gotta say that this was pretty close to the ca locations, minus a few minor details. from the pretzel bread to the seafood tower appetizer, i was pleasantly reminded of home sweet home (oc). the atomic horseradish is the perfect paring with your chilled seafood, and that is the perfect way to kick off you meal at mastro's. i ordered my usual <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and sides of <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, grilled asparagus and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> - all were pretty good. the finale aka warm butter cake, is where they finally dropped the ball. they brought it out and it was cold. now this is a dessert that you absolutely must eat piping hot, and considering i had just ordered a dinner for 9 people and 2 bottle of caymus, was not too thrilled at the anticlimactic ending to my meal. the service was great and i would definitely eat here again. maybe was just a minor miss on the dessert? anyways, mastro's remains my favorite steakhouse and i will definitely give it another shot next time i am in vegas.", 
            "what a great spot!\n\nwe made 9 pm reservations for dinner after the zarkana cirque du soleil show at the neighboring aria.  no vegas trip is complete without a nice dinner, and we couldn't have picked a better spot for what we were looking for that night: delicious food and wine in a classy, yet relaxed atmosphere.   located within the crystals shopping complex, you don't get amazing views of strip, but the environment still exudes class and modern decor.\n\nwe had the works.  a bottle of pinot shared among the three of us while we nibbled on the best damn bread assortment i've seen.  two salads: caesar and a wedge, standard fare and did not disappoint.  and then....drumroll....the entrees!  juicy, thick <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> for my two burly man-pals, who both only ate about half before conceding to the dish's fate as leftovers.  and for myself: perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, jumbo <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> sauteed in a rich butter sauce and served with a few parmesan-crusted crostinis.  crisp golden brown on the surface while tender and delicate within, the plate came with about 6 jumbo scallops, but try as i might, i couldn't finish the dish for lack of stomach space!  wonderful side pairings of garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and sauteed mushrooms to share.\n\nabsolutely no room for dessert.  it was a fantastic meal.", 
            "we were in vegas for a bachelorette party for one of my besties and decided on this place for our fancy dinner night. we had 11 girls and people ordered a variety of things from the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> to the bone-in steaks. this is one of those fancy places where you order just the protein and then sides are extra. here's the breakdown:\n\nbread basket - good. normally, i'm not a fan of loading up on carbs, but we were getting bottle service the night and i was already starving, so i had to put something in the stomach. i was pleasantly surprised at the freshness of the bread! so soft and slightly warmed.\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> - giant serving (probably enough for 2!). rich and creamy with actual chunks of lobster!\n\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> - good and buttery. it was a big serving size and i only finished probably half of it.\n\n<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> - good, but slightly under cooked according to my friend's order.\n\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> - i'm not really a fan of <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and these were okay. small pieces of lobster mixed in.\n\nsea salt & <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark> - pretty good! nice little break between bites of our main courses.\n\n<mark>Creamed Corn</mark> - pretty good! nice side dish without being overpowering.\n\nthe food was pretty good, but for a place of this caliber, i expected a lot more. they either under cooked or over cooked several steak orders, which had me thinking: what kind of steak house is this?!\n\nthe service was top notch at least and our bride-to-be got a special warm butter cake delivered to our table.\n\nwould i return? probably not.", 
            "absolutely wonderful. probably the best meal i have eaten in vegas in years.\nit was my husband's birthday so i made reservations. i wasn't that impressed with the venue, almost like a food court in crystals, city center. but the service and attention from the moment we arrived more than made us feel special.\nwe had <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, mussels, filet and <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. super heated plates, everything cooked to perfection. we shared everything and had more than enough food for two. oh and a couple of bottles of wine. the prices were not silly! i had mentioned on the reservation that it was a birthday and an absolutely phenomenal dessert was brought to the table with no prompt from me. the manager personally visited the table and left a card.\nthe following morning i received a call asking how we enjoyed ourselves. who does that?? perfect attention to detail.", 
            "this was actually my first time at mastros, and the food was delicious, although a bit on the salty side.\n\nfirst of all.. the bread was to die for.. my friends and i had to restrain ourselves from devouring two baskets of bread so we won't be too full for our meal.\n\nwe ordered a caesars salad split between three people, but it didn't come out until after our meal and sides came. i didn't think that was very professional, but everyone makes mistakes. \n\nwe got the cream corn and <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> for our sides. they were both to die for! i ordered the saut\\u00e9ed scallops which were delicious but a little too salty for my taste. my two friends ordered the filet mignon and the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, which they loved. \n\nwe also ordered two bottles of the argyle pinot noir, which our server recommended for us. it was wonderful.. not too sweet, not too dry. \n\nwe also informed our waiter that it was our friend's birthday, so at the end of our meal, they brought out an amaaaazing butter cake with a candle! \n\noverall, the experience was great, especially sitting in the nest! lol", 
            "my husband brought me here for an early valentine's dinner.  reservations were at 7:30 pm and we were seated immediately. we were seated in the half booth half tables that are right next to the bar. you know, the ones that are right on top of each other. i was annoyed, because i would think they would save these seats for walk-ins. i was determined to not let that upset me and i'm so happy i didn't. our waiter was awesome as was our food. they bring this beautiful bread basket with a variety of wonderful fresh bread, served with butter of course. \nwe started with the colossal dungeness crab which came out with dry ice so it was smoking. it was pretty neat. the crab was very fresh.  i drank water, but my ordered a double shot crown and coke. there was so much crown when the waiter brought the drink that he couldn't put but a splash of coke in it (sodas come in little aluminum bottles). i ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and my husband ordered the 12oz filet. we shared the garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and mushrooms. my <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was cooked to perfection and it was huge, i couldn't even finish it.  my husband's filet was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor.  the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> had a soft garlic flavor. they were my husband's favorite. the mushrooms were saut\\u00e9ed with rosemary. i've never had mushrooms with rosemary. it was a new flavor for me and i liked it. our waiter brought us the butter cake for dessert complimentary for dining with them. this was my favorite. it came with a ginormous side of homemade whipped cream. it was the greatest, most delicious thing i've had. i've been dreaming about it ever since! i love this restaurant and have told all my friends and family about it. definitely going back!", 
            "mastro's literally is the best restaurant in las vegas. \n\nthe restaurant overlooks the main floor of crystal's and is absolutely gorgeous. very spacious with plenty of seating area.\n\ni've been here about 4 times and am never disappointed. in fact, i think i'm even more impressed each and every time i go and fall in love with the restaurant all over again. \n\nservice: impeccable, from the hosts to the servers. i've had a light skinned african american male with dreadlocks and glasses twice (embarrassing i should really remember his name) and he was quite delightful. i've had other servers as well who without a doubt, like the gentleman we had twice, ensured we were taken care of throughout our entire meal. \n\nfood: to die for. the best <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> i've ever had. i've tried quite a few steakhouses in las vegas (ribeyes because i am obsessed) and none compare to mastro's. their appetizers and sides are wonderful too! i've tried their scallops which are soft like butter, <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (a must try), gorgonzola mac and cheese, <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, and the <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> (gotta have some veggies).\n\nwine: they have one of my favorite cabernets here that pairs perfectly with the ribeye, chateau st. jean. highly recommend with your meal if you're enjoying steak, not seafood.\n\ndessert: do the butter cake. comes with a heaping pile of homemade whipped cream. sweet, warm, and delicious!\n\ni love this restaurant. writing this review makes me want to go there this week. a perfect 5!", 
            "the atmosphere is unique, the food is succulent and the service is second to none!\nthe <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> are a must! the bone in filet can't be beat! the warm butter cake is the best desert i've ever had! mastro's is hands down the best restaurant in vegas!", 
            "it has taken me a while to find the time to finally add a couple of posts. i decided to treat my girlfriend to a good dinner for her birthday and i remembered how she was saying that she wanted to try mastro's ocean club. i took her there on february 19th as a surprise dinner. for the amount i paid, the service could have definitely been better. started off great. had a 9:00 reservation and was seated as soon as we arrived an hour early. unfortunately the wait for drinks and food took a lot longer to come. the server was very pleasant, but whether she had too many tables, it just took way too long. the food was good. we absolutely loved the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, the steak was great, and the swordfish ( usually one of my favorites ) was a decent entr\\u00e9e. the dessert was pretty good too. it was the butter cake which they are known for. i may go back in the future, but there are many other places in town i think i would try first if i plan on spending over $250 on dinner again.", 
            "i was really dissapointed.  i had heard great things and i have been wanting to go here for a really long time. we came here to celebrate my husband's birthday and we made reservations a couple of weeks prior. when we got there, the hostesses were not only rude to the patrons, but also rude to each other.  they were talking back to each other, rolling their eyes and just plain unpleasant. \n\nthe servers were great to the patrons, but we were sitting pretty close to the kitchen/bar and could hear the conversations of the servers and management and could tell that they just don't get along well. that made the experience a little bit of a downer. \n\nas far as the food, i was just so disappointed!!!! talk about the biggest let down ever! we spent about $300 on everything and it was not worth it. \n\nfirst course was the <mark>Clear Lobster Roll</mark> which were ok but we could get better sushi for less elsewhere. we also got the <mark>Jalapeno <mark>Ahi Tuna Sashimi</mark></mark>, also good but had too many sesame seeds.  second course was the <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> which was really good! the part that upset me though was when our main course arrived, i was still eating the soup, but then they took my soup away mid-bite and didn't even ask if i was still eating or not. \n\nour main courses were the <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark>, which were really salty. my husband got the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which was pretty dry but my husband said the flavor was good, but since it was dry, it felt kind of dense. we also got the mushrooms and <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. both were delicious and seasoned well. \n\nall in all, we will probably never go back again. the only good thing was that they did give my husband a complimentary cake for his birthday. we enjoyed the cake and the cream that came on the side.\n\naverage food, mediocre service for a really high price. not good.", 
            "love at first sight when the bread basket came out.. what does that tell you? oh my goodness! this place was amazing! \n\n my husband made reservations to have dinner here and he requested a nice table in the tree house! so much fun! we were treated like royalty here!! everyone was! their customer service here at mastros was superb!! they know how to make customers feel like they're having a great eating experience. \n\nwe started with a bottle of moscato! nivole moscato d'asti is my favorite!! \n\ni had a little trouble deciding what i wanted to eat for dinner, but when i saw the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> in the menu, i was hooked! they rubbed panko bread crumbs and fried it lightly to perfection!! my husband had the rib eye cooked medium well! and guess what? it was medium well!! they had a long list of sides. we went with the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, which had big chunks of fresh lobster. the lobster and potatoes just melted in your mouth because of all the butter! and then we had the gorgonzola mac & cheese! \n\ni was so sad that our hotel room did not have a refrigerator. i would have definitely took our left overs with me. as we left the restaurant, i was devastated! the food was absolutely delicious and i wished i had room in my belly to finish all of it!", 
            "girlfriend and i celebrated our 3 year anniversary we each got a filet mignon steak which was great along with the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, but bad thing was there were some lobster shells that i bit into.  waiter was quite nice to comp us with a free butter cake desert which was delicious!", 
            "just had dinner at mastro's ocean club. we're not near the ocean in las vegas, but there are mastro's on the water in socal. had the bone in ribeye, absolutely mouth watering. had <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, which was a meal to itself. giant sauteed mushrooms and i was in heaven. outstanding service to boot. great experience. it's not cheap, but it is a top of the line strip restaurant.", 
            "my mom and i came to this restaurant because we got a gift card to the shops at crystals. i got the filet mignon and my mother got sushi. the filet mignon was cooked to perfection and the sushi was excellent. the sushi dish actually came with quite a large amount of sushi. the bread basket was pretty nice also. we also got the asparagus and the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. we actually had a miscommunication with our very very knowledgable waitress and wanted <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> instead. the manager came up to us and without hesitation brought us a <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> literally within 3 minutes. the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were also great. for dessert we had the butter cake and it was to die for. i'm not usually a cake person, but this was one of the best desserts i've ever had. highly recommended - great service, great food. the price tag of the meal is quite high however; with all of our food the total was still about $100 even with a $100 gift card.", 
            "yelpers enticed us here--and we are glad we came. \nwe started with the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark>. it was great, too tantalizing to wait and take a photo; we only could do so once we took a break. delicious morsels of crab stacked in a bowl over dry-ice. the red cocktail sauce has some horseradish-but if you like it hot, ask for some on the side. \nwe planned to order one of the healthy vegetable side dishes but our waiter jonathan (\"johnny\") gave such a wonderful description of the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> that we couldn't resist. \nunless you're big eaters, the way to go is to split a steak. at the next table over it looked as though their steak was cut in half before cooking. but jonathan suggested that he cut our bone-in kansas city strip into slices after cooking, served on a plate \"in the middle.\"  this was perfect.  highly recommended. we couldn't even finish our halves of this delicious, well-cooked \"medium\" steak. \nthe <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were just as described. great. a big splurge, but this dish added to our memorable meal. \ntoo bad no \"desert pocket\" left for the longed for butter cake.  next time. \nif you're looking for a place for one of those meals you savor not only at the time but also in your memory for a long time, excellent food served by a pro, mastro's is your place and jonathan, who's been here since they opened, is the waiter you want.", 
            "went here with my wife and two adult kids on recommendation from our concierge at the green valley resort. the ceasar salad and warm spinach salad were perfect and they let you split portions. we had the salmon and three boneless <mark>Filet</mark> with garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. again they let us split the potatoes 4 ways. steak and salmon was some of the best that i ever had. service was impeccable. prices are very fair especially because they let you split the salads and sides.", 
            "with all the 5 star reviews, i was expecting to get wowed by this place.\n\nthe restaurant is pretty cool looking, and the waitstaff was excellent though the hostesses were not very hospitable.\n\nthere were 4 of us dining here and we thought the food was not very good.  bland!!!\n\ni had the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> which is the only steak i order and the flavor was just bland. another person ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and we both agreed that it simply lacked flavor.  the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> did not taste good to all 4 of us.\n\nthe only thing i enjoyed there was the pretzel bread and their warm butter cake.", 
            "one of the best meals our group agrees we've had. even the simplest details, from the almost-double-portion martinis to the piping hot pretzel rolls are well-considered and designed to impress and welcome. steak was incredible, portions were generous. we couldn't decide if the \"blackened\" finish or the truffle butter won more accolades, but i doubt you can go wrong. \n\ni had the petit (6oz) filet mignon with a crab cake to create my own little \"surf & turf\". again, portions were above and beyond so it was almost more than i could finish. having lived in boston and maryland i'm extremely well-versed in seafood, especially lobster and <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, so i tend not to order these items freely elsewhere. the crab cake was pan-fried but still great. (i tend to prefer broiled.) the steak was better than top steak houses in dc/ny. honestly. find a way to get steak and seafood into your meal!\n\nfor \"family style\" sides we ordered <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> (unnecessary), <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> (food heaven), <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (must get), and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (i didn't even bother as i had too much more interesting food already). the server actually walks around to distribute the sides as you like, which again was a wonderful touch for our group of 9. \n\nother winners: shrimp sushi roll, all martinis, espresso drinks, tomato/burrata salad. \n\nour server was really fantastic. friendly, efficient, doting, and plenty loud which again, is very important when you have lists of specials to communicate enthusiastically and a long table of 9 semi-rowdy friends.\n\nwe used to actually go off the strip to find hidden top steakhouse gems but now maestro's in crystal center will be the go-to. \n\nif you have only one good/fancy/formal meal for your trip: go here.", 
            "my fiance and i went here to celebrate our engagement. his parents had gotten us a very generous gift card to use for exactly that purpose since they live far away and couldn't be here to celebrate with us.  based on all the great reviews, we decided to spend it here.\n\ni wouldn't go so far as to say it was the best steakhouse we've ever been to, but it was pretty damn good. we ordered blue point oysters, which were fresh and delicious. the <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> were absolutely to die for. it comes with bread to dip in the buttery sauce and it was so amazing.  then we ordered a filet, the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and gorgonzola mac n cheese. while still very tasty, each item had some issues.  the lobster in the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were a bit overcooked and slightly chewy.  the mac n cheese had no hint of gorgonzola at all and as soon as it slightly cooled while sitting at our table, the thick top layer of cheese became hard and rubbery.  the filet was good and perfectly cooked, but i've had much better steak elsewhere.  and last, the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> wasn't the melt in your mouth buttery bite of heaven as i expected. \n\nthe service is great. everyone said congratulations since we had put that we were celebrating our engagement in the reservation details. our server was super busy but she checked on us often. the ambiance is definitely strange as you're in a mall. it's really loud and not intimate at all. you're very close to other tables. ours was right on the back of a booth, and the guys in that booth kept accidentally knocking over our table lamp. \n\noverall, i'm really glad we tried it out, but will stick to our favorite next time we want to splurge on a dinner.",

            "mastro's beverly hills is in my top 3 steakhouses so i decided to give ocean club a try. it did not disappoint. the food is great and since you want everything the real problem becomes trying to not order too much. service is top notch and the staff is very friendly and knowledgable. <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> is served chilled with dry ice and the atomic horseradish that comes with it is sweet and will singe your sinuses in the best possible way. the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> are a must get, rich and filled with large pieces of lobster meat. we also got the wagyu tomahawk cut to share which was perfectly marbled. \n\nso why not 5 stars?  these items may seem nit picky but you can be the judge. we ordered the wagyu black and blue (seared rare) and while it did have the cool red center you really want a better crust on it. in addition i know we were sharing but they simply cut the steak down the middle with one person getting the bone piece. for something like this you would expect a presentation similar to a porterhouse. lastly although it shouldn't matter that it located inside a mall it does mean that the people next to you could be in shorts, flip flops and a backwards baseball cap. i know it's vegas but come on.",

            "i have never been to a fancy steakhouse before, and i have learned that they are incredibly awesome!\n\nwe booked a reservation ahead of time, so getting seats were very convenient and we were seated right away. our server for the evening was craig and he was a very personable man, who was very helpful throughout the entire evening. he had an answer for any question i threw his way and he explained things that they were offering off the menu very well as well. \n\nour appetizer came out first, which were their <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tostadas. they were very delicious. the tostada portion was very crunchy and had the perfect texture. the avocado and tuna that they served on the tostada were so soft and had a buttery texture, which was heaven in my mouth. our entrees then came out with our sides. i ordered the bone in ribeye with an 8oz prawn, while by brother ordered the kansas city strip. both of our steaks were cooked to perfection. i ordered mine medium and my brother ordered medium-well, and it came out exactly as expected. for our sides, we ordered the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> along with <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>. the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were supposedly their most popular side, and i can see why. they had a good amount of lobster in that dish and it added a nice change to plain <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was very creamy and rich. i personally could only handle so much, but they did prepare it very well. since we went there for my birthday, they provided a complimentary slice of cake for me to eat, and it was a 5 layered chocolate cake. their cake is some of the best cake i have ever had. i have no way to describe the taste besides \"clean.\" it stayed together very well, the flavor wasn't too strong, and the texture was perfect. \n\nto say the least, the service and food was some of the best i have ever had all in all. i definitely could not eat here on a regular basis, but for special occasions, this will definitely be on the list.", 
            "worth every penny! everything bite was beyond delicious. best <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> i've ever had. the filet with truffle butter was perfectly cooked and tender. we added <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and asparagus all were very good, especially the lobster mash potatoes. nothing but good things with the warm butter cake. even if you don't have room for dessert, you have to have the warm butter cake!!!", 
            "one of the many indulgences of la vegas. mastro's is a well known stop for those looking to treat themselves. \nfood: we went as a group of 7 girls and all got steak with a variety of shared sides. i split a 16oz filet made medium (almost half the price it would cost to get an 8 oz filet on your own). it was everything i expected from a good steakhouse, well seasoned, tender, and perfectly cooked. its only dressing was a melting slice of butter on the top. the sides were all generally well made. the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> had real chunks of lobster it in, though, between the 7 of us, not everyone got a piece. the brussel sprouts and asparagus were cooked to just the right texture but there was nothing really special about them. the <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> was sweet and luxuriously smooth but needed a little more savory to balance it out. \nservice: the service was excellent. the server was very accommodating and attentive. a few of us ordered steaks to split and they plated them separately for us. we also brought in our own cake since we were celebrating a birthday. they served the caked and repacked the leftover cake for us to go. \nlocations: mastro's unique architecture has made it a near icon among the casinos on the strip. floating in the middle of crystals, it makes up a beautiful view and provides one. the decor is subdued in an elegant way and it generally draws a quieter crowd.    \nwhile mastro's wasn't a life changing dining experience, between the high class menu and eye catching locale, it certainly did not disappoint.", 
            "one of my all-time favorite restaurants! if you have never tried the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, you are missing out! other items i would recommend are the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, and the cosmopolitan which is served with dry ice giving it an appealing presentation. the service here is the best and the food is amazing! i wish we had one of these in the 405, but until then, i will hit them up whenever i'm in vegas or dc. if you visit the vegas location, it is located in the crystal mall in its very own treehouse, which is very unique. there's no other place like it!", 
            "hand's down, some of the best seafood i've ever had.   everything was fresh and excellently prepared.  the sides are great for sharing and it's definitely worth it to take the plunge for the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  the service was exceptional and the interesting martinis were a treat!  great people watching with it being located in a fashion mall in las vegas as well.", 
            "oh my goodness!  i had one of the best meals of my life.  the calamari was delicious!  the scallops were divine!  i ordered the <mark>Pacific Swordfish</mark> (my first time having it) and it did not disappoint.  add to that the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and you've got a perfect meal!!   so wonderful!  if you get a chance to eat here, take it!", 
            "had a 4.5 star meal, but not quite 5 star, at mastro's on a friday night.  it was very crowded, as in full, but we were seated promptly at our reservation time of 8:00.  we were seated in a high top kind of half-booth type table.  i'd not sat in something like this before, but it was comfortable.  the place was humming, but since it's open to the mall, it wasn't so loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation.  \n\nour server immediately approached us to take our water and drink orders.  she also provided a wine list, which was above average but pricey, which was expected given that mastro's is located in crystals on the strip.  i didn't think it was out of line with other lists at similar places on the strip.  \n\nto start, i went with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.  this was one of the best versions of this dish i've had.  it was velveety smooth with a lot of chunks of lobster.  the sherry came through, and it was seasoned very well.  just a creamy lobstery soup.  you may get some sticker shock given that it's soup, but i think it was worth it (i can't recall the exact price, i believe it was either $16 or $18).  additionally, a friend and i shared the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tostada.  these come 3 to an order, but i could have easily eaten another dozen.  the tuna serving is substantial, and all of the accompaniments (avocado, onion salsa, and chili sauce) are fantastic.  crispy, flavorful, but not too heavy.  loved it.\n\nwe split steaks among the table, opting for the traditional bone in ribeye and the wagyu bone in ribeye from australia.  it was $110, but well worth it.  it was noticeably better than the other steak.  not that the \"regular\" ribeye wasn't good.  it was.  but, the depth of flavor with the wagyu was significantly better.  absolutely re-order if they have it available.  plus, since we were sharing they offered to cut it for us in the back of the house, which we appreciated.\n\non the side, we had the peppercorn steak sauce.  it's good, but i don't know that it's worthy of its reputation.  i didn't think the steaks needed it, so i only had a couple of bites with it.  the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> are incredibly decadent, nearly swimming in lobster and butter.  the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> is good, but it's typical for this type of dish.\n\nfor dessert, we went with the famous butter cake.  it easily lives up to its reputation.  warm, a little crispy on the outside, but impossibly moist and buttery.  served with berries, ice cream, and plenty of whipped cream, it was an excellent end to a great meal.  \n\nservice was fantastic the entire time.  our server was there when we needed her but not overbearing.  our food came out quickly, but we never felt rushed, despite knowing how busy they were that evening.  all in all, a great experience.  i can see why mastro's has its reputation, i would absolutely return.", 
            "my hubby and i celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary here with my daughter and parents. we started off with mastro's seafood tower. you can create your own seafood tower to your liking and size. our seafood tower had shrimp, <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> and oysters. we all enjoyed especially my daughter; the cool dry ice effect and seafood tower presentation. the seafood was fresh and the oysters tasted amazing. my hubby had the <mark>Lemon Sole</mark>, my mom had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, my dad had the <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark>, i had <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> and my daughter got to sample a little bit of everything. we shared two sides family style of their signature <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (love this combo) and the other side dish of <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>. the seafood and chicken entrees and sides were served hot, fresh and perfectly seasoned. at the end, they complimentary served us their yummy signature warm butter cake dessert with vanilla ice cream and added happy anniversary wish which was a nice added personal touch. we had a wonderful time and food experience on our first visit here, and the service was friendly and excellent.", 
            "my boyfriend and i came here to have a celebratory dinner. there was a bit of a mix up with our reservations (i used open table) but they were still able to accomodate us.\n\nmastro's is located inside the shops at crystals on the second floor. my boyfriend loved his hennessy sidecar cocktail and always talks about going back just for drinks and to try their dessert.\n\nwe decided to skip appetizers and just go straight into the main course. we got the 22 ounce <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> sashimi, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and sauteed broccoli. since we were sharing, they offered to plate and serve everything for us. we ordered with the intention that the tuna would be for me, and the steak would be for him but by the end of the meal, i enjoyed the steak so much i ended up eating most of it. i'm a fan of ribeye steaks because i find them to be more flavorful than <mark>Filet</mark> - and the steak here had a nice sear on the outside and perfectly tendor on the inside. the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were yummy but a little bit salty to me (although my boyfriend said it was fine and he loved it). the amount that we ordered was more than enough for two people, we didn't get to dessert because we were so stuffed.", 
            "i've been to the mastros and costa mesa, but this one in vegas probably has better customer service.\n\nthe food quality is the same, and tastes the same. they offer most of the same food items but for some reason vegas is a little cheaper. \n\nfor the appetizer i got the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and the mastros cobb salad? i suggest ordering the salad as a half size the portion was huge even split between two people. the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was soooooo good! i didn't want to share, but i did. i'd definitely pick that over the salad any day. \nwe ordered a bottle of red wine...forgot the name but it was pretty reasonable for $45. \nfor the main course i got the bone in ribeye, <mark>Sauted Sugar Snap Peas</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms. all were really good! i was super full from drinking and our appitizers we had to make most of it back to our hotel. but the leftovers were still amazing as a late night snack. \ni suggest sitting in the \"tree house\" it seems a little more intimate than in the other section.\nlastly thy brought us out the better cake and oh my gosh! they did not have this option at the costa mesa one. this seriously was so good!"

            "i love this place! \n\nmy boyfriend and i came here to celebrate our 6 months semi-anniversary and we certainly had a great time! the only down side is it burnt a hole in our wallet. but it is a special occasion and we both think it is worth it. \n\ni made a reservation on line at open table and i mentioned our occasion. when we were at the hostess stand, we were greeted by our last name which really surprised me. we waited for about 2 min before we got seated in the tree house, just like how i requested in my reservation. our server came right away to take our drink orders and also gave us some recommendations. \n\nwe decided to go with the surf and turf they have which comes with a 3 pound <mark>Broiled Live Maine Lobster</mark> and steak of our choice. one thing about the meal here is that it does not come with any sides. you only get what you order. if you want to have mashed potatos or <mark>Colossal Onion Rings</mark>, you do have to order them seperately which again raises the cost. \n\nthe food came fairly fast after we ordered and the busser divided the meal for us right by the table. the lobster tasted great so did the steak! the server was telling us that they have a live fishtank in the back and all the lobsters they have came in daily directly from maine! you can't get anything fresher than that in vegas! the steak is flavorful and juicy. my boyfriend said it could be more tender. as for the side, we ordered <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark> and corossal <mark>Colossal Onion Rings</mark>. we both like the potatoes it was yummy but not too impressed by the <mark>Colossal Onion Rings</mark>, for some reason it tastes a bit soft. \n\nupon we were finishing up our meal, so stuffed at that point, our server actually surprised us with a complimentary desert for our celebration! what a nice gesture! so definitely put in the occasion if you are celebrating anything at mastro's! \n\nthe environment is elegant and classy with live performance. it is expensive but you definitely get what you pay for. we return on our next special occasion.",

            "outstanding! we had planned to eat at sage at aria, but ran too late so  mastros was a happy last minute accident. even though our waitress was in training, the service was great, the food and ambience was excellent. had lamb chops and <mark><mark>Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails</mark></mark>, brussel sprouts & <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>....all cooked and seasoned perfectly. the piano bar singers were very good and not c+  cheesy like most vegas entertainment. dinner was very expensive, but excellent.",

            "this restaurant is superb! i've been wanting to check this place out for a while now and it just so happened one of my long time friends was planning on having her birthday dinner here. the ambiance of the restaurant is high class and lavish. making a reservation is highly recommened, especially if you want to sit at a table in the tree house. in case you were wondering, the tree house is that giant structure across from louis vuitton. we had a 7pm reservation, but the birthday girl was running 10 min late. the hostesses and staff were more than accommodating and held our table. once everyone was there we were seated right away. the waiter went over the menu and highlighted his favorites as well as what they are known for. i was torn between surf or turf, but luckily my date wanted the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which i had my eye on, so i opted for the 18oz <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>. i ordered mine rare of course because i feel anything above medium rare ruins the true flavor of the meat. the cool thing about how they serve their steak is they actually under cook it and serve it on a 400 degree plate which allows the steak to cook more to exactly how you ordered so it's absolutely perfect when you take your first bite. they age all their steaks for 3 weeks, and omg they are perfect. juicy, full of flavor, and melt in you mouth like butter. now for the fish, the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was buttery, flakey, not too dry, not too wet, and just the right amount of oiliness. for sides, you order them seperately and they feed up to 5 which was perfect since there was so many of us. we all ordered different sides and got to share. we had brussel sprouts, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>, saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms, and truffle fries. oh my oh my, we were all beyond stuffed. every element of the meal was perfect, but dessert was what sealed the deal. two words, butter cake. if you don't think it is one of the most amazing desserts to ever exist, you need to reevaluate your life choices. they also make their own whipped cream which is euphoric. if you're looking to have a memorable dinner you need to check out mastro's, it's totally worth the money.", 
            "what's that expression that a lot of us foolhardy guys toss about as soon as we get to vegas? \"go big, or go home\"? it basically gives us a free pass to indulge in things that are extravagant, luxurious and potentially dangerous. and mastro's fits well within this criteria: the place holds meals fit for royalty, the decor is immaculate, and it can be hazardous to your wallet's health if you are not prepared. but for those of us still reading, and certainly for those of us who have had the honor, mastro's is a must-dine destination if you're in town.\n\nlocated pretty centrally in the city center shopping district, it's almost impossible to miss mastro's: the opulent, wood-like \"fishbowl\" perched precariously at an elevation is definitely eye-catching, and i'm pretty sure i inadvertently photobombed countless tourists as they stopped to take pictures of this structure, which is actually a dining room. before you can get to your table, you stop by a tiny hostess desk flanked by two gals who wasted no time getting us seated once we checked in with our reservation. you'll more than likely walk past an offshoot to another, more private dining room, a pretty spectacular bar and then make your way into the main dining room that is expertly laid out: whoever did the layout here did so in such a way that seating is maximized but not once does it feel crowded. and this is even more impressive when you consider the polished staff is zipping about without hesitation or collision.\n\nand let's talk about the staff, right quick: simply put, these are professionals who know their craft inside and out. our waiter, lionel, was the epitome of providing an exceptional customer service experience. we were -that- table that upfront told him we had a show to catch later that evening, and without missing a beat, he assured us he would keep us on schedule and would not let the meal be compromised. his service, along with the refills and bussing provided by other staff members, made for the best, most efficient dining experience i have seen yet in years of visiting vegas. add in a visit from a manager who just stopped by to chat and make sure everything was cool, and you have a place with a team that cannot be topped.\n\nbut all the friendliness and attention to detail means nothing if the food is bogus, and mastro's has this base covered, too. oh, do they ever. my folks started with a bowl of <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, while i went with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. all three were perfect pre-show snacks for the main courses, and just typing this sentence out is making me drool with fond remembrance. ahem. \n\nmom went with a <mark>Gulf Red Snapper</mark> that was cooked to perfection and my surf-and-turf combo of a filet and lobster tail (which lionel was gracious enough to de-shell table side like a boss) ranks among the best i've had at any place around the world. but the most surprising part was when dad sheepishly admitted he had somehow never had <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> before... and now that bar is set unfathomably high as his <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> here was his favorite meal of this trip. a side of <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> and <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark> rounded out dinner, and wiped out my stomach. somehow, my folks found room for mastro's signature dessert, a butter cake that made me question how a chef can bake happiness, joy and euphoria into one pastry. it's that good (even though i had two bites and almost went into a coma with the straight gin i was drinking).\n\ni cannot say enough positive things about mastro's. from the staff to the overall \"look\" of the place, and most assuredly the culinary satisfaction each plate offers, it's a place that rewards all those who stop by for a drink or a bite to eat. take those winnings from the casino and invest them here: i promise it's a much better deal than your favorite variation of blackjack.", 
            "i've been to the mastro's in costa mesa several times so i was pretty excited to try this mastro's. plus, i've always wanted to dine in the treehouse that they have here! i suggest making a reservation and requesting the treehouse. i guess it's not anything too special, but it is nice being in a different setting that you can't really get anywhere else on the strip. \n\nthe service here was excellent. janene was our server and provided excellent customer service. she constantly checked up on us, refilling our wines and making sure our meals were to perfection. \n\n// food & wine //\nwine- the prisoner: this wine is a blend of zinfandel, cabernet sauvignon, syrah, petite sirah and charbono. this wine had so many flavor profiles going on. it also went really well with all of the meat that we ordered. the wine was very smooth with plenty of fruity flavors to it. \n\nsauteed spinach: your basic saut\\u00e9ed spinach with garlic. i would rather suggest ordering the saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms.\n\n<mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>: it was good, but it wasn't excellent. i would have liked more cheese added to my <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>. also, the potatoes seemed to be slightly undercooked and hard. \n\n<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>: a great piece of meat with excellent meat to fat ratio and amazing flavor. i would definitely order this again. \n\n18 oz <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> mignon: ordered rare plus, this meat was so tender. unfortunately it wasn't seasoned that well so i had to add salt and pepper to each bite. \n\noverall, i enjoyed dining at this mastro's location, but if i had to choose between this location and the location in costa mesa, i would have to choose the costa mesa location. the service at both locations were excellent, but i would have to say that i slightly enjoyed the food more at the costa mesa location.", 
            "i am usually a regular at the old homestead in ceasers, but this place had a high rating and the date i was with, who was looking awesome dressed in a miniskirt and hooker heels, convinced me with the innuendo of sexual favors to try something new, so as a sexually charged male, i obliged. mario, our server, was awesome. he hooked us up with a great wine and had some menu suggestions that would make anyones heart flutter. the bread basket was phenomenal and the staff we could see was very professional and classy. however, the staff we couldn't see undermined all forward progress made by the men in white suits. the steaks were overcooked, the <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark> were sour and cold, and the timing of the food was as coordinated as the dallas cowboys 2015 offensive line, or any play by the detroit lions since 1976. its worth a try, but i would have rather gone somewhere else.", 
            "let's start with the service, absolutely exceptional!! we were greeted and welcomed by several staff members just entering the restaurant and walking to our table. our waiter was awesome and very attentive. now to the food. i ordered a rib eye and asked for it medium well (which has a little pink inside.) it came well done and i didn't have the heart to complain since it was a $59 steak and sending it back would mean they would have to make a whole new one. it was also pretty flavorless. boyfriend ordered lobster tail and in his exact words \"best lobster tail i've ever had.\" i'm glad he felt that way since the rest was just ok. our <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark> were very salty, but the <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> was pretty good. it was $200 for just the two of us.", 
            "best restaurant in the entire world! its a hidden gem because its in a mall and less crowded than restaurants in casinos but dont let the crowd size fool you. ive been there probably 20 times and ive never had a bad anything. ive had everything on the menu because we often go to dinner with about 20 people so we order everything. great wines, really fresh seafood, but the side dishes and desserts is what really sets them apart from others. my fav sides are <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>, <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, gorgonzola mac n cheese and mushrooms. for desserts nothing is better than the butter cake and pecan pie. if youre not a fan of raspberry sauce like myself you can order the butter cake without the raspberry and its heavenly! its romantic enough for a date and trendy enough for dinner before going out with friends- like i said best restaurant in the entire world!"

            "yes i know i am the only person on here to give them 3 stars but please hear me out for my reasoning behind all this. \n\non saturday, i had made reservations for a party of two at 730pm. when he arrived at 720pm, it was not really busy nor was it a ghost town in there. the hostess stand said it would be a moment as they got our table ready and for us to take a seat at the bar, enjoy a cocktail or two and they will get us. \n\nduring our 30 minute wait (yes maybe they were short staffed, not ready yet etc.... which i am ok with) they sat multiple tables of walk-in's and a few reservations of small 2-4 tops. (i know this because a few sat at the bar whom we spoke to and others i over heard when i stood by the hostess stand to wait to check on my table. off to a bad start..... \n\nanyway, we had a nice table overlooking the garden down stairs in the back of the restaurant. all the back-waiters were very prompt and professional with regards to keeping the water glasses full, serving the bread, clearing the table from the right and serving from the left etc... (after working in this industry for years, i get picky about this crap at high end restaurants) the server was pretty on the ball and friendly but a little to relaxed with us. (yes we are young and eating at a high end restaurant, i am ok with that)\n\non to the food, below is a list of what we ordered and what i thought about it: \n\ncalamari app: lightly breaded with light seasoning. dipping sauce complimented it very well. \n\nfillet mignon: very tender and medium rare is more of rare. but it is better to under cook the steak then burn the hell out of it. very tender, cut with your fork status. \n\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>: parmesan crusted.... a little on the very fishy side for my taste which overcame the rest of the flavors\n\ncream of spinach: very creamy and just was not my style. girlfriend liked it though.\n\nsea salt/<mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark>: these shoestring cut fries were epic! yes.... of everything i ate, i was most impressed by the large basket of $10 fries. \n\nwarm butter cake: once again.... this was the main reason we went here for my birthday and because the other half loves this dessert more than she loves me. :)\n\nmultiple layer chocolate birthday cake: now to be honest, this was what saved mastro's from getting the dreadful 2-star rating from me. in my reservation, i had noted \"birthday\" but no one had seemed to see it. hell, we even ordered desert and were half way finished with it before they brought out the cake. personally, did someone at the hostess stand go oops! we need to send a birthday cake over to table xx immediately even though they already are half way through their dessert? but to be honest, they did and it truly made my otherwise mediocre dining experience in to a pleasant one. \n\noverall mastros.... maybe i set my expectations to high and i understand, you have only been open for a few months now so maybe all the bugs are still getting worked out. in the words of my girlfriend, it was not as good as the crystal cove, ca location yet on par with the one in costa mesa, ca. \n\nsounds like i have to try all this again at the crystal cove location and compare! granted.... thanks for the last minute birthday cake. it was nice to see those little comments on open table actually mean something.", 
            "i have had the chance to visit mastro's ocean club twice and both times were equally wonderful. everything from the wait staff, ambiance and the food are all beyond amazing. \n\ntheir service is probably as good as it gets. the hostesses are all very friendly in their greetings when you arrive. the wait staff is very attentive. i felt like i never had to flag someone down, there was always someone readily available. \n\nthe energy in the restaurant is very nice. there was live music being played on a piano which helped to set the tone. the restaurant itself is set up in a modern tree house space located inside of the crystal's shopping center. there is nice colorful lighting that helps set off the dark woods of the tree house and white table cloths of mastro's.\n\nthe food though is the real star of the show. i had the 12oz filet and it was phenomenal. it was cooked exactly the way i like it. perfectly seasoned. the other member of my party had the bone in rib eye which was just massive. the sides we ordered were more than enough to share. the side portions are a meal in themselves. their mac & cheese is a must have! so are their sea salt & <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark>. if possible, save room for dessert. their signature butter cake is by far one of the best desserts that i have ever had on the las vegas strip. i was lucky enough to receive a complimentary cake from the manager, so if i could, they would get an extra bonus star just for that.\n\nall in all, mastro's is a definite must visit. it's great for special occasions or even business dinners. it will become one of your new standards for what you expect in a restaurant.", 
            "food was amazing. the discount on this review is based on the hostess service upon check in. \n\ni wanted to have dinner with my dad for his 73rd birthday. i made a reservation for 5pm for a party of two. i showed up early at 4:20pm and hostess said she could not seat us however we can sit by the bar and have drinks and appetizers. the two hostesses asked for my name multiple times for the reservation. we sat by the bar and the bartender says only non cooked items are available for appetizers. i wish the hostess mentioned this before offering the bar side option. 5pm passes by and i see the hostess seating other parties to the tables. i went back to the reception and the same hostess asked for my name twice. she points at another host and i assume to follow her. she doesn't acknowledge or provide a greeting. i realize she is the one supposed to seat is. maybe the host station wasn't organized or wasn't ready for the evening but i didn't appreciate the confusion and cold reception upon check in. i understand names are complicated but i must have said my generic name seven times to two different people, \"cheryl garcia\". to add additional confusion, i received an email saying i did a 'no show' for my reservation on open table. i'm not certain how that happened even when i checked in on yelp as well. \n\nthe server provided better service and made excellent recommendations. i have an issue with over ordering but that's because i want to taste everything. for a party of two, i ended up ordering the chowder, calamari, sides of <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>, sauted asparagus, twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark>, sea salt & <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark>, and twelve oz bone in filet. the bread service was warm with an assorted selection. i enjoyed all the sides except the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark>- i thought it was too salty & the chowder was slightly watered down and boring. the calamari was flavorful and crispy. the bone in filet was served sizzling on a ceramic platter and was super tender cooked to perfection. \n\nthe server brought out a complimentary butter cake for my dad's birthday. the cake was warm and rich topped with a vanilla bean ice cream and strawberries. this was very special and made the overall experience much better.", 
            "we were in vegas for a bachelorette party for one of my besties and decided on this place for our fancy dinner night. we had 11 girls and people ordered a variety of things from the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> to the bone-in steaks. this is one of those fancy places where you order just the protein and then sides are extra. here's the breakdown:\n\nbread basket - good. normally, i'm not a fan of loading up on carbs, but we were getting bottle service the night and i was already starving, so i had to put something in the stomach. i was pleasantly surprised at the freshness of the bread! so soft and slightly warmed.\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> - giant serving (probably enough for 2!). rich and creamy with actual chunks of lobster!\n\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> - good and buttery. it was a big serving size and i only finished probably half of it.\n\n<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> - good, but slightly under cooked according to my friend's order.\n\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> - i'm not really a fan of <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and these were okay. small pieces of lobster mixed in.\n\nsea salt & <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark> - pretty good! nice little break between bites of our main courses.\n\n<mark>Creamed Corn</mark> - pretty good! nice side dish without being overpowering.\n\nthe food was pretty good, but for a place of this caliber, i expected a lot more. they either under cooked or over cooked several steak orders, which had me thinking: what kind of steak house is this?!\n\nthe service was top notch at least and our bride-to-be got a special warm butter cake delivered to our table.\n\nwould i return? probably not.", 
            "located in the crystals shopping center next to aria. park at crystals valet if you aren't staying at the hotel. they have electric car charging. consistently delicious food every time we come. 5 stars for service, food, everything. try to get a table inside the treehouse. few of the items we ordered:\n\n<mark>Petite Filet</mark>: absolutely melt in your mouth delicious. \nheirloom tomato and burrata cheese: very good but pricey at $20.\nsea salt and <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark>: addicting!\nalaskan halibut: hubby says was very good.\n<mark>Creamed Corn</mark> side: delish.\nsignature butter cake: so yummy!\n<mark>Sauted Sugar Snap Peas</mark> side: cooked perfect...super crunchy.\ntable bread and butter: even that was awesome!\n\nwould highly recommend and def be back, mastros!", 
            "so disappointed. i did not enjoy the experience at all. <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark> were burnt, chocolate cake was super dry, and my filet was pretty mediocre. the steaks are so much more flavorful and better prepared at the capital grille. the cocktail was the best part of my night. not to mention the waiter spilled the wine on the table while attempting to serve. maybe the one in bh or malibu is better. idk...", 
            "the fourth new discovery that was a five-star worthy dining experience was at mastro's ocean club.  i had heard good things about this place for at least two years, and before then espied its distinctive wooden bird's nest with admiration at its quite innovative and modern design just before the restaurant's opening inside the shops at crystals.\n\nit was the day of our 25th wedding anniversary, and our request for seating inside the nest was granted.  it actually felt like being two young birds sheltered inside a protective nest.  not only that, but we were surprised at meal's end with a complimentary warm butter cake ala mode, mastro's signature dessert.  this was a great mouth-watering end to a very memorable meal, as the soft cake seemed to melt in the mouth. \n\nbut the beginning of our meal was no less auspicious.  after enjoying a bread basket that included large homemade pretzel breadsticks, diane and i dove into succulent hot <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark>.  these big crustaceans bursting with flavor really deserve to be called \"prawns\" rather than \"shrimp,\" and did deliver a taste of vanilla in the light batter--but not overpoweringly so.\n\nfor our main we each ordered an 8-oz filet, which here is called a \"<mark>Petite Filet</mark>,\" along with 1-1/2 lbs. of <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>.  both tender steaks were cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, and with little char on top.  accompanying bearnaise sauce was drinkable, and a peppercorn sauce was not far behind.  the hot and long sections of <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark> were pulled out of the pot at exactly the right moment  and presented as already opened legs, so no prying with tools was necessary.  they tasted great dunked in warm drawn butter.  and while diane praised her large and cheesy twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark>, i delighted in a huge mound of skinny sea salt & <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark>, which was reported to be a small rather than regular-sized version.  sauteed mushrooms were lovely, too, but i hardly needed them.  we were stuffed.  \n\nwith a ratio of about one waiter for every four guests, service was great.  our knowledgeable and conscientious server checked on us several times, and water refills were regularly poured without any need to request them.  even with the restaurant packed with guests, the ambiance inside the bird's nest section of the restaurant was romantic, intimate, and classy.\n\nmastro's is pricey to be sure.  but, executing well at delivering artfully prepared high-quality offerings from both land and sea, there is a reason why several local diners in the know call this one of the best restaurants in las vegas.  without question we will soon become repeat guests."

            "as a newer yelper, this is only my second review and beyond deserved.  on our most recent trip to las vegas last weekend, my boyfriend and i ended up unexpectedly at mastro's ocean club in crystals inside city center for the first time.  we go to vegas quite a bit (about once every 2 months or so) and have passed by this place quite a few times.  \n\nthe interestingly constructed architecture of the main dining area has been quite the source of amusement to us in the past... it resembles something like the shell of a wooden submarine that has exit chutes above and below it to spit you out into crystals when you are done with your meal (btw, this is a joke.  you do not get ejected from your seat.  it is only my strange sense of humor that comes up with this stuff).  my imaginative uses for the architecture aside, the design/layout is nice; it makes you feel as if the restaurant is floating in the middle of crystals with a very open and airy feel.\n\nas we were walking through crystals on our way back to our hotel room at aria from a long day of shopping, we decided to make an impromptu stop at the ejection submarine and see if there was any chance they would take us as walk-ins on a busy friday night.  with it being such an upscale spot, i was sure we would either be turned away without a reservation or asked to wait for a ridiculous amount of time.  au contraire!  they offered us immediate seating in the bar/lounge area or a few minute wait for the main dining room.  since we felt a bit underdressed for the location, we opted for the bar/lounge area and were glad we did.  we had the perfect seat right next to the piano player and fiery red-headed chanteuse, who was pleasantly entertaining. \n\nwe were promptly greeted by our amazing server, sara.  the only reason i know her name is because i made sure to ask her for it when we were leaving as i knew i wanted to review this place.  sara was so attentive, knowledgeable about menu, friendly, and always two steps ahead of us -  really as perfect as a server can get.  all of her recommendations were great as well.\n\ni had the swordfish (i hadnt met my mercury quota for the month yet) and my boyfriend had the <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>.  we shared the most delicious side dish - the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>.  my swordfish paired very well with gnocchi and it was the perfect combo of light and creamy.  however, my boyfriend's ribeye wasnt anything stellar.  it wasnt as flavorful as a most quality ribeyes should be.  it's on our do-not-order-again list.  this is an \"ocean club\" though so maybe that was his error for ordering one of the few non-seafood options.  now,  for the absolute best part of the meal.... the most heavenly dessert ever - mastro's signature warm butter cake.  even if the rest of the meal and service had been horrible, which it was far from, i would have given this place 5 stars just for this dessert!  i dreamt about this cake the rest of our stay in vegas and cant wait to go back again on our next trip just to have it.  this creation alone makes mastro's ocean club one of my top 5 all-time favorite restaurants.  i would happily get ejected from this sea-faring vessel any time! ;)\n\nsorry for the ridiculously long review, but i had so much to comment on and didnt know where to shorten it.", 
            "outstanding...and i live at the ocean and love steak!\n\nnot my first \"surf and turf\" experience, heck, not my first of the week but probably the best i've ever had.  we went with the <mark>Broiled Live Maine Lobster</mark> table side shelled by tanya and the bone in fillet.  lobster cooked to perfection (not over cooked) and steak was so tender it cut with a fork.  drinks and sides were also wonderful...house special lemon drop, crab and <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> and mushrooms.  wow!\n\nhigh end vegas at its best.  shops with million dollar dresses in the window surround and live \"vegas style entertainment\" abounds.  definitely highly recommended (and the only five star review i've even written on yelp!).*\n\n*((edit: ok at the time the only fiver i had given...found you need to do fives sometimes to bring up the average from the unwashed...sorry to be misleading in anyway ';-))", 
            "a snobby canadian boy took me to the mastro's ocean club. the conversation didn't go that well and he was as full of himself as he could be. luckily, the delicious food and wine made up for the sour date.\n\nwe started with the oysters (blue points i think). they were fresh and delicious. we then shared the seared scallops and bone-in fillet mignon as our main dishes. the scallops were cooked perfectly. they were a bit creamy for my taste but overall a solid dish. the bone-in fillet mignon, omg, was soooo good, probably the best steak i've had in the us. the meat was tender yet full of flavor. i was in heaven and couldn't care much less about whatever mr. snobby was barking about. \n\noh and we shared <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> as the side dish (with a price tag of $30, a bit steep for a side dish.) i also had a glass of pinot noir (zd '09) to go with the steak - the wine didn't have enough body, but it went very well with the meat. \n\ni knocked off one star because they served the scallops and the steak at the same time in the same plate, which i really didn't like. i would prefer having them separately. the scallops should have come first and then the steak as two individual courses. this way i could have really taken my time to taste each dish. \n\noverall, i really liked this restaurant. as for my date, i found out he wasn't all that annoying anyways. he was kinda cute and was quite thoughtful when i wasn't feeling well at the end of the meal. i may come back to the mastro's next time i am in vegas. will i go out with mr. snobby again? i think so.", 
            "yeah yeah, this place is great (ribeye, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, butter cake). \n\ncomparing craftsteak??\n\nservice: waaaaaaay better at mastro's. craftsteak reminds me of being on a caribbean cruise, and that's not a good thing.\n\nfood: larger portions and better execution at mastro's. craftsteak seemed oversalted on its steaks and lacking on everything else.\n\nambiance: *see service comments :)", 
            "i will preface this review with the fact that family was in town and this dinner was free!\n\nwe had reservations for saturday night  at 8:30 pm for a group of 7. i am always leery of a restaurant that is in the middle of a mall. i don't care how fancy the mall is, i think mall food every time i dine at one. mastro's my friends is no mall food place.\n\nthe service was top notch, we had a waiter and 2 bussers, while i'm sure they had different tables, they were always there when we needed them. it was like they were our dedicated staff.\n\nthe meal was top notch, starting with the amazing bread basket, continuing through the entrees, the family style sides, and ending up with an amazing dessert (which they comped to the table).\n\nthe bread basket was a good start, it had pretzel bread, olive bread, a parmesan crisp, and few other breads. the sides were amazing, they are served family style in surprisingly large portions. we had <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (some of the best i've ever had), <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, and mushrooms. we also had a few salads to pass around the table, 2 caesars (one regular and one spicy), tomato and onion, and tomato and mozzarella. a seafood tower and <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> were also ordered, i'm not much of a seafood guy but everyone else loved it. \n\nthey entrees were pretty stellar as well, i was splitting the 33oz wagyu tomahawk cut with my uncle, but since he was too full from the salads and sides, i had to man up and eat the whole thing myself (the things i have to do). this was one of the best pieces of cow i've had in my life (and i've had a lot of cow). it was cooked just a touch under medium rare (perfect imo), the marbling in the meat was insane, and it came out on a scorching hot plate. i don't know how they cooked it but it was perfect. \n\ntable mates also got the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, a filet, and a few other meats, i was very impressed with the size of their portions, most places would serve about 4oz of fish, but their <mark>Filet</mark> were about 12oz servings.\n\nafter dinner, they brought out a warm butter cake with vanilla ice cream for the table, it was a great end to the meal, and comping it was a nice touch!\n\ni have no clue what the meal ran, but it was amazing. my only complaint is that their bar area isn't the best, if they're going to make you wait 10-20 mins for your table they need more room in the bar. they did however have a great piano player and singer who played a variety from christmas carols to current hits which only added to the amazing meal.\n\nwill i be back, hopefully, especially if someone else is picking up the tab!",

            "my girlfriend and i took a whole week vacation off to visit the west coast. it was our first time trip to visit las vegas, and the entire experience was amazing and unforgettable. amid the many alluring performing shows, the endless eyes-dazing slot machines, and the gigantic resorts were some of the most fantastic restaurants that vegas could offer. \n\nwe first passed by oc while exploring the riches on the famed strip. it was located within the beautiful crystal. upon seeing it, both of us were intrigued by the outstanding artistry presented by the original designer. the structure's frames were made out of steel and covered with fine, deep red wood. between the frames were giant crystal clear glasses that allowed a perfect view from both within and out. however, the most salient and attracting feature was that the entire structure was slanted. my words would be lacking and limited for the description, but just imagine an hourglass tilted like a forward-slash sign. bemused by its charm, we booked a table on a monday night and dressed in proper attires, girlfriend in a beautiful orange-red dress.\n\nwe arrived around 10pm after seeing the fantastic le reve at wynn. being monday night, the restaurant had only a few tables occupied. we were given a table near the crystal glasses, which allowed an excellent view for the outside. our waitress of the night was very friendly and polite. as she went slowly on explaining the menu she also told us that the structure was called \"the tree\", its name inspired by the tiny leaves spurting out of the joints of the steel frames. from the menu, we picked \"<mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark>\" and \"vanilla batter shrimp\" for appetizers, a \"fillet of arctic char oreganate\" with \"<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>\" as entree and side dish. the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> came in a special tall glass container filled with mist giving dry ice. each large lumps of crab meat was tender and fresh with the saltiness and sweetness of the ocean. the vanilla fried shrimps were gigantic in size, each crispy on the outside and tender within, a must try for shrimp lovers. the arctic char was perfect, cooked to medium-rare the way i loved. it was a huge fillet more than enough for the two of us to share. the oreganate style was foreign to me, but the combination of butter, spices, and bread crumbs had made a wonderful sauce suited well with the fish. the gnocchi was huge in portion, baked in large hot skillet and filled with delicious cheese and crab meat. the mix of crab meat, cheese, and truffle gave the dish an unique and saliva dripping aroma. however, due to the large portion, over-stuffing this huge amount of cheese, crab meat and gnocchi is not recommended. you would need to trust me on this, as the first 5 bites would have you mouthwatering for more, but double that you would start having the too-much-cream-stuck-in-your-stomach feeling, and beyond that would be just too much to handle.  alas, at the end, gf and i had to pick out the delicious crab meat along with the truffle to eat and wasted a large amount of the gnocchi.\n\nregrettably, since we were on a tight schedule for a night club to visit, we skipped the desserts - what a shame! dinning at ocean club was such a wonderful experience. my gf and i enjoyed every minute from beginning to end. yes, it was a very expensive place, but so was everything else in vegas and every penny spend was well worth it. so by chance if you ever stop by vegas, be sure to checkout this amazing restaurant.", 
            "this is my current pick for the #1 best place for a business dinner in town (assuming cost is no object). there's a nice variety of steaks and seafood, and the ambiance is quiet and fantastic. it's not too trendy or loud, and the food is classic and well prepared. the tree house area is especially nice. \n\nwe tried a bit of everything, and all of it was fantastic. the cold seafood tower appetizer was fantastic (the stone <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> were the stand out!). for our entrees most of us got seafood and were all pleased! i loved my arctic char, although it was huge - stupid huge. honestly it seemed like 16-20 ounces of freaking fish on my plate. with all the other yummy food floating around i could barely polish off a quarter of my fish. if i was dining with my husband, this is definitely a dish we could share. the best side with the crab and <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>... omg.. best gnocchi of my life ! the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were pretty incredible as well. \n\nso the butter cake did live up to the hype! moist, rich, delicious. four of us split this and felt like there was more than enough to go around. even if you don't think you have room for dessert - this cake is good enough to warrant making yourself sick !\n\ni can't say i tried any meat, but for seafood i really loved this place. great service, and great food.",

            "i do not get the great reviews this place is getting. main course was awful. the restaurants in orange county & la are so much better then this.\n\ni was there friday may 4th with a group of 20 people. i thought it would be amazing since it is mastro's after all. it was the opposite. good service, but food was so so. my twin lobsters were so over cooked. it was tough & crunchy. i ate half of one & gave up. felt bad not to eat it, but it was awful. i eat lobster all of the time & it's supposed to melt in your mouth. that was not the case here. the rest of my group ordered filet mignon & they were all complaining as well. over cooked & chewy is what i was told. the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> was fine. the oysters were ok. the asparagus wasn't good. the cremed corn was good. the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> was excellent. the creme brulee was great. but, i would never go there again. unless you are in the wooden dome seating area it fells like you're just eating at the food court in the mall. not what i expected. save your money please & go to stk in the cosmo or joe's at caesars. the lobster is to die for.", 
            "seems like i've been on a steak kick recently, which makes me realize that my stomach and wallet are inversely proportional. after visiting gordon ramsay and old homestead recently my gut has increased exponentially while my wallet is shrinking dramatically. mastros, of course, had the same effect.\n\nour party of four dined family-style and sampled the following:\n\na dozen oysters (kusshi and bluepoint). all were delicious but, personally, i prefer the smaller kusshi.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> was beautifully presented in a cylindrical stack with, perhaps, too much avocado, but contained plenty of fresh tuna and a variety of textures and flavors.\n \nocean club crab cake. there was very little filler, nice big chunks of lump meat, and a perfectly balanced tartar sauce.\n\nthe scallops were too rich and buttery and was drowning in sauce. the accompanying toast was deliciously crisp and cheesy.\n\nthe 22 oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>, cooked medium-rare, was tender and had a decent amount of fat, as was to be expected. a solid steak, but not as mind-blowing as the beef from the top steakhouses around town.\n\n<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. a little dense with a rich, cheesey truffle flavor. pieces of crab were scarce, but there were plenty of gnocchi for the four of us to share.\n\n<mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>. 5 large legs, slightly warm, with clarified butter and lemon. each yielded plenty of tender meat.\n\nthat was plenty of food for all of us, but we couldn't leave without trying their infamous warm butter cake. it was large enough for each of us to get a few bites. it came with a ridiculously large side of fresh whipped cream. i was expecting the cake to have a very moist texture, but instead it was a bit more firm with a slightly crispy exterior. the flavor was as sweet and buttery as you would expect. as delicious as it was, it's not something that my arteries and heart can take too frequently.\n\nmastors is pricey, but not as pricey as other steak or seafood houses along the strip. the atmosphere isn't the greatest either. it is located in the center of a shopping mall, afterall. there's no dim, mood lighting. just the bright florescent  lights of the mall. the tree house thing looked cool, so request that if you have the chance. we sat just outside of it and it had all the appeal of eating at a food court.\n\nthere was also live entertainment in the lounge area when we dined. i had to do a double-take because the girl performing looked like aubrey o'day. i didn't stick around long enough to see if she had the voice or attitude to match.\n\ni'm not sure how this mastros compares to the ones in california that people rave about, but relative to vegas steakhouses it's a solid option. it's a step below the top ones in town, but is great for seafood and, of course, the butter cake.", 
            "i did not get to enjoy my meal as much as i wish... =( but i know for a fact that the food was really good..\n\nme & my girl friend (amy l) made reservations for 6pm on a saturday. after dragging ourselves over here from vdara, we finally made it on time. it was an absolute drag because we were awake for 30+ hours & we felt really crappy from all the \"beverages\" we consumed... basically we felt like utter sh** and couldn't enjoy our meals =(\n\nlocated in the city center, the restaurant is pretty much in the very center of the building. service was good but a bit slow. i love the assortment of bread, my favorite is the crunchy cheesey-garlicky one =)\n\nhere's what we ordered:\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> - comes in a huge bowl, tastes very very veryy rich, not too many pieces of lobster but still pretty delicious\n\nseared <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> - i've had this before at mastro's in beverly hills, same thing, still delicious, comes with 3 scallops & yummy cheese/garlic bread. scallops from mastro's comes in 2nd place after providence's :p\n\n <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> - cooked medium. comes on a sizzling plate, very good rich flavors and good texture. i was only able to eat 2-3 bites. i did eat the leftovers the next morning & it was still pretty tasty. \n\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> - blacken cajun flavored, i think.. it was pretty damn good, texture is very similar to scallops.\n\n<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> - big enough to be an entree on it's own, holy sh*t, i don't know how this thing can just be a side dish lol it's meant to be shared amongst 4+ people.. i thought it was pretty yummy, i love cheese and king crab meat... but this is super duper heavy, i probably would not order this again...\n\ngarlic spinach - tasty but a bit too garlicky for me, it was so infused with garlic that it tasted a bit bitter to me..\n\n\ni am so sad that we were so full that i didn't get to try to butter cake, again! =( we didn't have much of an appetite at all, plus i think we ordered a little too much lol... we were stuffed after having a few bites of our appetizers.  service was good, our waiter was a bit slow though. our water glasses were never empty (thank goodness, we must have drank a total of 13 glasses each..)\n\nrestrooms are located on the second floor, kind of a hassle to look for. bad idea to go when you're intoxicated..\n\n\n\nlesson learned: do not attempt fine dining after a night of debauchery....excellent restaurant & food! must try the butter cake one day.... =(", 
            "on my third trip to vegas, my main priority was not to get sht-face wasted and it was not to shop until i dropped, but rather it was to eat in a treehouse. and that i did! i was sooo excited to try mastro's (mah-stro's or may-stro's?) after hearing ridiculously good things about this place. i made reservations online, and called ahead to request a seat in the treehouse. \n\nservice is impeccable here! everyone was super nice and friendly. we started with the lemon drop dry ice martini and it was possibly the coolest (pun intended) alcoholic drink i've ever had! the dry ice fizzles over the top and there is a mini tornado in your martini glass!! it tasted great as well! perfect blend of sweet and tart - with, of course, a kick of alcohol!\n\nto eat, i ordered the filet mignon and we split <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and <mark>Sauted Sugar Snap Peas</mark> as sides. my steak was perfectly cooked, silky and tender. the gnocchi and <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> took it over the top to glutton overload. those dishes are soooo richhhh and decadent and creammmyyy. yum. i definitely think i gained 10 pounds that night. \n\nbad for your waistline, bad for your wallet, but great for your taste buds!", 
            "mastro's is amazing. i had the best steak here (even though this restaurant heavily features seafood). we had an early reservation because we had an 8:30 show to go to. we were seated immediately and i think they gave us white or black napkins, which they placed across our laps for us, based on what color we were wearing. and that was just a hint of the level of service to come. we had a very attentive server, but someone in a suit, his supervisor (?) was also constantly checking on us. my water glass was never empty, a standard i use to base a restaurant's level of service. i had gotten up once to use the restroom and accidentally dropped my napkin. as i was leaning over to pick it up, our server appeared out of nowhere and immediately insisted that he would do it. when i came back a fresh napkin was folded at my seat. when the sides came, someone immediately offered to serve them to us. i was surprised no one offered to cut my steak...lol. the restaurant quickly filled up, but from the time that we were seated until we left, never once did the superb service lapse.\n\nok onto the food: there were a few different types of bread and i think i like most of them. they refilled our bread basket, but i wish they didn't lol because i ate way too much bread. i ordered a berry flavored cocktail and it came in a martini glass, but they also set down a shaker cup by my glass, and to my delight, there was enough to fill my glass a second time! =d we ordered the <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark> appetizer and they were delicious, so fresh, not fishy at all. just delicious. i could have inhaled an entire order myself. everyone ordered the ribeye and it was perfect. so, so good. we were trying to be kinda healthy so we got sauteed mushrooms and spinach and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> as sides. but afterwards i wish we had gotten the mac & cheese and the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. everything was so delicious and the portions were pretty big. i ate about a third of my ribeye and we didn't even finish all of the sides. luckily our hotel room had a fridge so we could take the leftovers. \n\nit was definitely pricey, but for the amazing service and food, i think it was well worth it. i would definitely go back or at least go to one of the socal locations. mastro's is the standard by which i compare all steakhouses and other fine dining establishments to.", 
            "4 stars: yay! i'm a fan.\n\nwhen i called to make reservations a few weeks in advance, i had asked to be seated inside the \"tree house\" and they were able to accomodate this request. \n\nmastro's is a steakhouse chain that is better than most. if your school of thought is that ruth's chris is the pinnacle of chain steak in america, then you will be pleasantly surprised to have broadened your horizons.  \n\nwhat i like about mastro's is that the dining experience is very consistent regardless of the location you choose to frequent.\n\nthis particular mastro's is inside a shopping mall. a very nice shopping mall, but still a shopping mall. it's slightly off-putting, but does not affect the food or the service. if you wish to eat at a \"proper\" steakhouse, with burnished leather, dark wood furnishings, and laguioles then perhaps mastro's is not the spot for you.\n\nif you're not too snobbish about your surroundings, i think this is a solid steakhouse in vegas that doesn't require you to traipse through a casino to get to it.\n\nthe food is consistent with any other mastro's so i won't dwell too much on it. \n\nstick with what you know. \n\nthe lobster mash, the crab and <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, biggest ribeye you can split with someone, or porterhouse if they insist on a tenderloin or filet.  \n\nthe butter cake is worth every last calorie, so please be sure to save room for it at the conclusion of your meal.", 
            "this is as good as it gets. three of us went to mastro's after deciding on seafood and reading the reviews on yelp. everything was top notch, including the attentive service, the gorgeous presentation of the food, and the portions. some of my favorites included the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> (with an abundance of crab meat), served over a bowl with dry ice, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (creamy and with actual meat), and the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. i had that night's special, which was a fantastic john dory with a chardonnay lemon sauce. \n\nsome of the other \"little touches\" to make the experience better? the server actually served side dishes on our plates for us, and we received a follow up phone call a couple of days later to ensure our satisfaction. very classy!\n\nexpect a hit to your wallet: three of us walked out of there at $600, though we did splurge on grey goose martinis (shaken table side), wine and lobster. i can assure you it's well worth it!", 
            "a good friend of ours suggested mastro's when we asked for a recommendation for a seafood on the strip. so i made a reservation online for that night at 7pm on the mastro's website. what i didn't know was that i had somehow clicked on the chicago location. luckily i was walking around the crystals shopping center that afternoon and went to check out the venue and was chatting with one of the hostesses who offered to check on our reservation to confirm it .. good thing she did and we fixed my error. they were pretty booked that night but were able to squeeze us in. :) \n\nthe service was pretty much top-notch from start to finish, hostesses, servers, and bussers,  all were very attentive and knowledgeable as well as being friendly and personable. loved that they dish out our sides for us .. that's a really nice touch. \n\nthe food, we had a variety of items which were all delicious but at the top of our favorites were the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> and the signature <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. both are must haves to accompany any steak or seafood dish. we had the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious as well as the pan seared <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which my dining companions said was spectacularly prepared and seasoned. \n\ndessert was over the top .. we had three .. mastro's signature warm butter cake, \nthe cherry crisp, and the profiteroles. the first two were topped with vanilla bean gelato. both were to die for. i had read lots about the warm butter cake and it was everything i had expected and more :) .. and surprisingly i also loved the cherry crisp .. i am not huge on cherry anything but the flavor had just the right amount of sweetness and was not overpowering and the crisp part is a crumbly granola like topping which is an nice balance with the gelato and fruitiness of the dish. it's something i would definitely order again! \n\nmy only complaint is that the server didn't warn us about the size of the <mark>Beef Carpaccio</mark> appetizer. mom and i each ordered our own, and when they came out .. they were absolutely gigantic and even though we had a party of 5 we were unable to finish both. being in the service industry myself, i would have definitely warned my guests about the size of the carpaccio dish and suggested something else to order with it. \n\nall in all it was a fabulous dinner, the restaurant, even though it is in a busy mall .. has a nice ambiance, and we will absolutely be back.",

            "my favorite place to dine in las vegas!\n\n(1) service - i forgot his name but awesome, awesome server! best service ever. he was hot too! drools! 5 stars for amazing service and seating me with a hot server.\n\n(2) seafood tower - massive shrimp, king crab, lobster, three types of oysters, and massive mouth jizzy. \n\n(3) <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> - mouth jizz... must get! 5 stars\n\n(4) lobster mash potato - one of my favorite dishes. drenched in butter... yum! 5 stars\n\n(5) asparagus - well cooked! 5 stars!\n\n(6) bone marrow - 5 stars!\n\n(7) <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> - 5 stars\n\n(8) birthday chocolate cake - i got this for free... so sweet of them... but it wasn't my birthday... i think they gave it to the wrong person.\n\n(9) coffee - a little weak... i wanted a strong one... so i can get ready for the clubbb... yeahhhhh... woots!\n\noverall** yup! that was all for 2 people... haha! i eat a lot! massive bill... but worth every of my penny!", 
            "can i just start off by saying, this specific mastro's set the bar for all future fine dining for me.  we were in vegas for my boyfriend's birthday and knowing that he loves steak, i got us a reservation at mastros after seeing the high reviews. i left a little note with my reservation on open table stating that it'll be my boyfriend's birthday and requested to be seated in the tree house. we got everything we wanted and more!!\n\nfirst off, we got there about 5-10 minutes early but the hostesses seated us right away. they even greeted him happy birthday and sparked a lovely conversation with us while walking us to our table. she was so friendly and made us feel comfortable knowing that it was our first time dining with them. \n\nwhen we were seated, our waitress (whom i wish i remembered her name because she was simply the greatest) got us all settled with drinks and everything. she too greeted my boyfriend happy birthday and went on to tell us her recommendations since we were new to their menu. my boyfriend jumped at hearing the tomahawk steak so we went with that for him. me, i'm not really a steak person but i really wanted to try their <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and their <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. i couldn't choose between the two so she said they can split half/half for me and make it an entree. ahh, she made life so much easier! after we placed our orders, my boyfriend realized that he wanted some sides since his plates was just going to be a huge hunk of meat. so we asked her if we can add some saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms and spinach if it wasn't too late. she made it happen! \n\nwhile we were waiting for our food, all the passing waiters or hosts all greeted my boyfriend happy birthday. we were so shocked cause damn, they made him feel like a king! everyone knew it was his birthday and they made him feel super special, which i lovedddd. our food came out after what seemed like barely 5-10 minutes, so quick! we didn't really hear her when she described how big the tomahawk was.. but when it came out, it was a huge 30-33 ounce steak..lol . he devoured that thing till he couldn't any longer. every bite melted in our mouths, it was delicious! they placed all the sides on our plates one by one, making us feel like royalty! everything was delicious!!! they even brought him out a complimentary birthday cake and offered to take pictures for us. overall, i was so mind blown by the superb service we had that night. my bf said i won best girlfriend of the year award for this dinner. (;\n\nexpensive? yes. but it was worth every penny!! i will definitely be coming back every time i'm in vegas!", 
            "i had by far the best dining experience of my life here! <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> and the wagyu steak are the way to go! also the dessert martinis are killer! beautiful restaurant and exceptional service. i will go back!", 
            "i've never ever thought in my life that i would find a perfect restaurant, but i guess i was proved wrong when i dined at mastro's. the service was absolutely amazing; the waiters practically catered to our every whim and made sure that our time at mastro's was warm and inviting. the appetizers were delicious. the escargot was average but the <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark> were very good. \n\ni ordered the petite fillet cooked to medium. my parents ordered their special of the night: the australian wagyu. let me just say the steaks were absolutely amazing. definitely 5 star status; both of the steaks were flavorful and tender. the juices from the meat blended incredibly well with the spices. these were probably some of the best steaks i've eaten and i've eaten at a ton of places. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> was just so delicious and filled with epic flavors, i give my kindest remarks to the chef. the meal was too amazing. \n\nwe were too stuffed for any dessert but the next time, i'll be sure to try something off of their dessert menu. this restaurant was way above expectation: service was extraordinary, food was delicious, amazing presentation and ambiance. absolutely perfect! i love mastro's and will be sure to visit again.", 
            "i made reservations for dinner on a thursday evening and my hotel was nearby so i was able to walk here. i heart the decor of the tree house dinning which we were seated at. see it: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-las-vegas?select=veyizprriievg0x5eyxb7q#veyizprriievg0x5eyxb7q this mastro's has three levels dinning areas and tree house is on the second floor with views of the crystal mall.  \n\nordered a a bottle of napa cabernet sauvignon after the yummy bread basket arrived. followed with the <mark>Iceberg Wedge</mark> salad which contained smoked maple bacon and chunks of blue cheese - refreshing and so yummy. for the main entree i opted for the 22 oz bone in rib eye - cooked medium rare and a side of the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. as with every mastro's i've dined at, the food and service were impeccable. if you're a fish eater check out the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> here, it was incredibly fresh and delicious. we ended the meal with the chocolate sin cake which was moist and a perfect ending to conclude the meal. \n\neven though mastro's was bought out last year, the quality and service in my opinion are at the top tier of the industry. btw, have a beverage in the bar before or after dinner for some interesting people watching.\n\nthank you to the entire staff at the las vegas mastro's for an awesome dinning experience!", 
            "top 5 in the city.. this place has it covered from great selections on the menu to great food to great service. the staff is on point. definitely get the seafood tower and the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>.", 
            "i'm no stranger to mastro's.  i have spent many a special occasion at the one in costa mesa.  this is now my local mastro's for the time being, so my boyfriend and i decided to have a nice valentine's day dinner at crystals.\n\nall-in-all, as with the other mastro's, the food and service are top-notch.  our waiter was attentive, friendly, and patient; other waiters provided the same level of attention to us even though they weren't assigned to our table.  like always, we shared a 22oz ribeye, and a side order of <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> with black truffle.  we grabbed a second order to-go because we love that dish that much.  for valentine's day, we also got a complimentary order of mastro's signature warm butter cake, which is incredibly sweet and rich.  love it.\n\nmy only complaint is the atmosphere of this location.  the main dining room is located in an open-air treehouse structure inside the crystals mall.  although for valentine's day we were seated in one of the private dining rooms upstairs, i would imagine the atmosphere between the two is similar.  i dig the dimly lit, quiet, romantic ambience of the costa mesa steakhouse.  since this location is in a mall and (mostly) open-air, you get ... a mall atmosphere.  which is okay, but not optimal.  there also seemed to be a lot of very loud, drunk people at the restaurant, but i figure they're everywhere on the strip on a friday night.", 
            "i've been to this place maybe about 3 times, and one of its sister locations in costa mesa about 3 times as well. both restaurants exude that high end feeling and you will leave feeling... well feeling awesome that you spent 50 bucks on a slab of meat. but that's not all.\n\nif you make an open table reservation they will always call you the day of to confirm and remind you that you are going to attend. one of the times i've been to this mastro's ocean club and they were fully committed, and suggested to look for a seat at the bar area, and then one of the waitress or hostesses asked if i would mind eating on the piano (they had live music that time) which i found it hilarious, a $1k+ grand piano with me eating on it. regardless i told her i would wait for a party at the bar to be seated but that was another time. \n\nyou're going to pay at least $70+ per person but the food along with the service makes it all worth it. every time i go to mastro's, the waiters/waitresses are always so nice, helpful, professional, and willing to answer any and all questions you may have about the menu. if you haven't been there before they will let you know the vastness of the menu and how they operate as a steakhouse/ocean club.\n\nmy reccemondations as far as mastro's ocean club in las vegas?\n\nbone-in fillet\n<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> (although the filet wins my money by a mile)\n<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>\ngarlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>\n<mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark>\nand their raw oysters - wherever it is from because it is super fresh\n\nif you go in on a special occasion like a birthday or a graduation, most of the time they'll give you a slice of chocolate cake as dessert and the most kick ass whipped cream you would have ever had the chance to have. yes it is just that good.\n\nhope you guys enjoy it as much as i do. after writing this review, i'm just vying to go back.", 
            "everything from the bread basket to my appetizer to my steak to dessert to service was outstanding at mastro's!!  i have nothing bad to say about this place.  okay, if i had to pick one thing... i would say if you're looking for a \"romantic\" dinner date setting, i would probably say this is not the place.  it's in the middle of a mall.  but, romance is what you create so to me, if the food is good and service is great, that's really what counts!  our server was awesome.  he made great recommendations, was attentive, was kind, was not annoying in the sense that he was trying to recommend only the most expensive things.  he was honest about what was good and not just based on price.  the steaks were cooked to perfection and they are huge!!!  you can seriously share a steak.  like really.  the sides were amazing and also huge.  i mean seriously... <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>!?!?  holy hell!  and lobster mash?!!!  yes please!  and you need to save room for the butter cake. you just have to.  it was so good.  i mean like really good.  i don't know what else to say, it really was that good!", 
            "not that this restaurant needs anymore reviews...\nso, i'll keep it short and sweet.\n\ni've been to this place twice now. it's awesome. hands down the best place for seafood i've been to in vegas. \n\nawesome service, love the ambiance and they have the yummiest breads.\n\ni would suggest:\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>\n<mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>\n<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>\n\nif you want a fancy dinner and you're dressed to impress, this would be a lovely place to hit up. just make reservations :)", 
            "wonderful! ultimate 5 star experience in vegas! we thoroughly enjoyed our experience here. we loved the appetizer tower that can be mixed and matched. oysters were fantastic. the cocktail shrimp vanilla  we sat inside the 'space ship' or 'ufo'... be sure to request this seating during your reservation.\n\nto begin... cocktails: paloma was fantastic for the tart drink lovers. elderflower martini was better for the sweet tooth! \n\nappetizer: cocktail jumbo shrimp, <mark>Vanilla Battered Shrimp</mark> & oysters... delish! \n\n\nsalad: we split the <mark>Iceberg Wedge</mark>, please note that in photo... it's only half. the bacon used was a sweet hickory smoked wisconsin bacon. amazing. \n\nsoup: <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. phenomenal. rich & creamy. \n\n\nentree: filet. ordered med well but the cut was too thick and it ended up well done on outside and almost rare in the middle, but it was still fantastic.\n\nside: king crab & <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>- to die for. an absolute must. yes, i actually chose this over my standard potatoes au gratin with steak and was do glad i did.\n\n<mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was fantastic. \n\nwe ended our meal with cappuccinos.\n\nthank you for well educated wait staff and quality service.", 
            "one of the top 3 restaurants in vegas! third time coming here this year and i have never been disappointed. service from the waitress was on point and she was very thorough with explaining the specials on the menu. the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> is probably the best i've ever had along with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>.  i had the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> as my main course which was amazing. <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> as a side is brilliant also. the one thing you cannot leave this restaurant without ordering is the legendary butter cake!!", 
            "the food and service was on point here at mastro's. \n\ni always heard great things about it and i am so glad i finally tried it. \n\nto start, i had the <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark>. although the mussels were small the sauce and cheeses croutons were incredible. i took advantage of all the various breads they had in the basket just to dip in the sauce and\nindulge more. \n\nfor dinner i had the <mark>Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna</mark> served sashimi style. it was seared with asian inspired flavors and didn't make you feel so heavy. i will say that it is a quite a portion and initially seeing it can be overwhelming. \nthey warn about the size of the side portions so please think it through or else you will have way too much. i had a table of 4 and we battled to eat everything cause it was yummy but man i came out of there a fatty wack. i loved the cream corn and <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. done deal with those two! i had the lobster mash and yes it had big chunks of lobsters and it was good but not as great as it's hype was. we also had saut\\u00e9ed broccoli and honestly it looked steamed. they serve you the sides which i thought was a great service. \n\nthey gave us their signature butter cake. topped with ice cream and fresh fruit with a side of whipped cream. if you even last this long to have dessert then order it. warning-the portion is again good for 3-4 person so think it through before you order. \n\ni would highly recommended this place. it's ambiance is okay because it still does feel like you are still in the shopping area even though you can't see it too much. great service and great food. you really can't go wrong.", 
            "mastro's literally is the best restaurant in las vegas. \n\nthe restaurant overlooks the main floor of crystal's and is absolutely gorgeous. very spacious with plenty of seating area.\n\ni've been here about 4 times and am never disappointed. in fact, i think i'm even more impressed each and every time i go and fall in love with the restaurant all over again. \n\nservice: impeccable, from the hosts to the servers. i've had a light skinned african american male with dreadlocks and glasses twice (embarrassing i should really remember his name) and he was quite delightful. i've had other servers as well who without a doubt, like the gentleman we had twice, ensured we were taken care of throughout our entire meal. \n\nfood: to die for. the best <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> i've ever had. i've tried quite a few steakhouses in las vegas (ribeyes because i am obsessed) and none compare to mastro's. their appetizers and sides are wonderful too! i've tried their scallops which are soft like butter, <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (a must try), gorgonzola mac and cheese, <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, and the <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> (gotta have some veggies).\n\nwine: they have one of my favorite cabernets here that pairs perfectly with the ribeye, chateau st. jean. highly recommend with your meal if you're enjoying steak, not seafood.\n\ndessert: do the butter cake. comes with a heaping pile of homemade whipped cream. sweet, warm, and delicious!\n\ni love this restaurant. writing this review makes me want to go there this week. a perfect 5!", 
            "i've had a number of people recommend mastro's in cities across the country, it wasn't until recently i realized there was a location right here at home. oddly enough i was familiar with the space, but never put two and two together. it's the bird's nest, the unmistakable structure in the crystals.\n\nwe were started with a huge bread basket. all of which was fresh and delicious. i also had the strawberry mule ($15), which was a refreshing twist on the moscow mule.\n\nif i'm being honest, it was the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> ($28) that swayed me to try mastro's. it's my favorite crab and this was scrumptious. all the flavor, but without the fuss. it is served over dry ice so the presentation is rather striking.\n\nwith \"ocean room\" in the name i had to try the fish. i was tempted by the halibut on special, but i chose the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> ($49). it was a huge filet, that was moist and flaky. surprisingly, their turf seems to be just as good as their surf, the husband had the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> ($49) and it was fantastic. i really like that the preparation is simple, just properly seasoned to allow the flavor of the meat to shine. we went for decadence when selecting our sides. i had to try the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> ($33) and the gorgonzola mac & cheese ($14) piqued his interest. both were rich, creamy and gooey. the crab in the gnocchi was too delicate for this dish it was overpowered by the creamy sauce and the bold truffle flavor. both were mighty tasty, however.\n\nwe ate until we could eat no more, and there was a bunch leftover. rarely do we have leftovers to box up, but it seemed like we hadn't even touched our sides. the portions are quite large and will satisfy the heartiest of appetites. we were much too full to attempt dessert. their famous butter cake will have to wait. service was attentive; overall, a really great experience. it's nice to have another option for seafood in the desert.", 
            "the best food i've ever had. filet, white fish special, lobster mash, <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>... service was on point. very classy. we planned a proposal in the treehouse and it was perfect", 
            "we enjoyed this dining experience immensely!  renee was our waitress and brandon was the manager on site.  first of all cocktail pours are twice the size of normal (of course at $23 per martini you would expect that!).  we started with the <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark> ( nothing out of the ordinary).  <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was great - a pretty decent portion as well.  i'd have to say that the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> was sublime!  from the manger, to our waitress to the runners, we have nothing but praise.  wonderful evening!", 
            "one of the best meals our group agrees we've had. even the simplest details, from the almost-double-portion martinis to the piping hot pretzel rolls are well-considered and designed to impress and welcome. steak was incredible, portions were generous. we couldn't decide if the \"blackened\" finish or the truffle butter won more accolades, but i doubt you can go wrong. \n\ni had the petit (6oz) filet mignon with a crab cake to create my own little \"surf & turf\". again, portions were above and beyond so it was almost more than i could finish. having lived in boston and maryland i'm extremely well-versed in seafood, especially lobster and <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, so i tend not to order these items freely elsewhere. the crab cake was pan-fried but still great. (i tend to prefer broiled.) the steak was better than top steak houses in dc/ny. honestly. find a way to get steak and seafood into your meal!\n\nfor \"family style\" sides we ordered <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> (unnecessary), <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> (food heaven), <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (must get), and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (i didn't even bother as i had too much more interesting food already). the server actually walks around to distribute the sides as you like, which again was a wonderful touch for our group of 9. \n\nother winners: shrimp sushi roll, all martinis, espresso drinks, tomato/burrata salad. \n\nour server was really fantastic. friendly, efficient, doting, and plenty loud which again, is very important when you have lists of specials to communicate enthusiastically and a long table of 9 semi-rowdy friends.\n\nwe used to actually go off the strip to find hidden top steakhouse gems but now maestro's in crystal center will be the go-to. \n\nif you have only one good/fancy/formal meal for your trip: go here.", 
            "dinner in a treehouse! \n\nit was my first time visiting mastro's located in the shops at crystals.  this beautiful and elegant dining can be seen while walking through.  the 'treehouse' as they call it sits directly in the center so it's very hard to miss.  the wooden structure will catch your eye in a heartbeat.  \n\nwe made reservations for our group and were seated early.  i would like to give a tremendous thank you to paul our waiter.  i don't think i've ever been so entertained while receiving the best service anyone could ask for.  he went above and beyond to make our evening memorable. \n\nthe table is brought a bread basket which has 3 options. i will say their pretzel bread called my name.  i asked for more in which paul graciously brought an entire basket of just those.  fantastic! \n\ni started with the wedge salad.  perfect and delicious.  the crumbled bacon had a great flavor combined with the creamy blue cheese.  for my entree i chose the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> accompanied by <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, gorgonzola mac and cheese and <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>.  of course all of the sides are huge and were shared between all of our group.  the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was so light, fresh and baked perfectly.  the gnocchi was a disappointment.  i don't think there were any crab pieces in this. but the other two sides definitely made up for it.  they were so creamy.  anything with gorgonzola will make me happy. simply delicious!\n\nif the appetizer, bread basket or main meal didn't fill you up, they have a great dessert list.  on top of that list is their signature butter cake.  it's topped with vanilla bean ice cream with strawberry drizzled around the cake.  it's calorie free and fat free... in my dreams! it's moist and delectable.  after the huge meal, i would suggest splitting this huge cake.  \n\nmastro's delivered an impeccable meal with first class service.  it was surely a memorable evening!", 
            "this place is first class.  the server was awesome.  second time eating here, got the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> both times.  out of the park good.\n\nthe service is top notch and the steaks are excellent.  good place for a group.", 
            "this is our 2nd time dining at mastro's ocean club.  lanford was our waiter for the evening.  he was extremely personable and very knowledgeable about the menu.  we dined on <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark>,  <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, scallops, lobster/<mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> and the brussel sprouts.  everything was wonderful.  we spoke to 3 of the on duty managers in passing: nicholas, brandon and dan(?).  we have nothing but praise for this restaurant and all who work there.  we will be back!"

            "everything here was spectacular from beginning to end. i went here for dinner on a friday evening. the restaurant itself is located inside of crystals in an open area of the shopping center. despite the open area, the atmosphere was still very nice and the live music really added to it.\n\nmy experience:\nstarters\n-the bread was pretty good\n-the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> was delicious and the horseradish was spicy!\n\nmain course & sides\n-i ordered the filet, and having dined at another steakhouse earlier in the week, i must say, the filet here was incredible. this was probably one of the best <mark>Filet</mark> i have ever had!\n-the sides were just as amazing. we had the mac and cheese, <mark>Green Beans with Sliced Almonds</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>. i would recommend all of them as there wasn't one i did not like.\n\ndessert\n-i'm not a huge sweets guy, but i was told that i had to try the butter cake even though we were already stuffed. it definitely lived up to the hype as a must try dessert!\n\noverall, i had a great dining experience here. our waiter was awesome and we never felt rushed. i would highly recommend trying this place next time you are in vegas!", 
            "absolutely amazing food and service! i had the swordfish, <mark>Green Beans with Sliced Almonds</mark>, and delicious mushrooms!", 
            "we recently dined here for my husband's birthday. having been at the mastro's in scottsdale, we knew what to expect: tasty appetizers, good drinks, and even better steak, so we were excited to check out this location.\n\nthe restaurant itself is in a unique setting: inside the high-end crystal mall in the aria in a wooden tree house sculpture - pretty unique! i will say that having dinner while being able to look out at the fendi & louis vuitton store did seem to downplay the high-end feel of this restaurant and it made me really annoyed (i know, hater) at all the women walking around with their chanel & prada shopping bags.\n\nwe were promptly seated outside of the tree house in the booths and as usual, service was second to none. they were aware of the gluten-free dining note on our open table reservation and brought me the gluten free menu which is pretty large and almost mirrors the regular menu with a few exceptions and some alterations.\n\nlarge signature cocktail, beer and wine menu - i liked that they denoted which cocktails were gluten free as this is usually a place in the gluten-free menus restaurants ignore. stunning and colorful bar - my husband liked the large selection of craft beers as well. the two tvs flanking the bar though did seem out of place.\n\nfor a starter, the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> is a great choice: presentation is really cool with the dry ice vapor, the shrimp are huge and the sauce is good. for an entr\\u00e9e, i went with the filet. instead of their regular rub which contains gluten, they will season it with salt & black pepper. it was a huge portion (had i known, i would have ordered the small filet) and it was cooked well and they even did a butterfly cut to ensure it cooked through. i also ordered a side of <mark>Green Beans with Sliced Almonds</mark> - tasty & fresh however, there were no almonds... \n\nour waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgeable and did a great job of checking up on us despite a busy saturday night.  he was even nice enough to bring out some chocolate covered strawberry with whipped cream on the house to celebrate my husband's birthday which was even more thoughtful because he made sure it was a dessert i could eat given my gluten-free diet.\n\nwe had an awesome time, with superb food and drinks and top of the line service. would highly recommend for a nice dinner, but be prepared to spend at least couple of hundred dollars on this indulgence!"

            "yummie!  this place was great. there was 9 of us for dinner for a friend's birthday, our table was ready and waiting for us when we arrived, they allowed us to decorate the table, the service was awesome, their menu includes steak & seafood so everyone could order whatever they wanted.  the restaurant was very busy i must say and every table had cocktails on it, both are good signs for me.\n\nthey have tons of steaks to choose from, lamb, vanilla fried lobster, scallops, and tons of fish. my only confusion came from how the fish was actually prepared b/c there wasn't really on the menu explaining how you can get your fish cooked. after asking the waitress, she explained the 5 fish preparations.\n\nhere's what we ate:\n1) sashimi tower -white fish, tuna, <mark>Clear Lobster Roll</mark> all very good [see pix]\n2) heirloom tomatoes and burrata salad-very tasty and tons to share\n3) escargot-my favorite very very good [see pix]\n4) <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>-typically not a fan but i did enjoy this very much\n5) <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>-eh they are good for you\n6) mac n blue cheese-yes for sure\n7) halibut oreganata - almost $50, but was a huge piece of fish, definitely could share this\n8) the fried lobster was another one of my favorites\n9) <mark>Ahi Tuna Tostada</mark> again very good [see pix]\n\ni wanted to try the crab cake but didn't have any room left. we had more leftovers in bags then arms to carry them on.\n\nother notable notes: waiters were exceptional with their service of our table, my glass of veuve was never empty and the waiter was calling me by name the whole time :).\nour bill was over a grand after everything was said and done. so it's on the pricer side.", 
            "the las vegas-mastro's ranks among our top dining experiences anywhere in the world.  on this labor day weekend visit, our initial disappointment, of not being seated in the unique & always fascinating \"tree-house\", was quickly extinguished by shauna, our culinary captain extraordinaire, menu \"tour guide\" and libation/wine aficionado.  turns out... our \"terrace\" seating near the piano bar was as enjoyable as it was entertaining, resulting in yet another \"positively outrageous\" fine dining adventure.\n\nshauna introduced us to mastro's participation in \"las vegas restaurant week\", a worthy nationwide charity drive to raise money for & donate meals to 3-square food bank in southern nevada.  she offered a special 4-course dinner deliciously flanked by beefsteak tomato & onion salad, an 8 oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> & garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and key lime pie all for a reasonable price, part of which was ultimately donated for a worthy cause.  \n\nas there were 5 of us on this visit, the aforementioned special meal was joined by collection of our menu favs and shauna's recommendations. she perfectly paired our appetizers & meals with wonderful riesling, cabernet, and sauvignon blanc.\n\nsooo, included in the culinary delight were: the legendary seafood tower (ohhh yes!!), <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (best in class!), <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark> (delightful), <mark>New York Strip</mark> (absolute perfection), <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> (sweet & outa this world), saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> (oh yeah!), <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (buttered and seasoned to perfection), saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms ( a fav of favs), <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> (these aren't yo mama's sprouts, believe it!), 1 lb. <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> (huge), triple chocolate layer cake (nothing but delish), and...(drum roll)... the mastro's signature warm butter cake!!...once again to die for!!!\n\nwithout fail, and to paraphrase the writings of t. scott gross,... mastro's was again a \"positively outrageous\" dining experience where the culinary expectations were always far exceeded.  shauna's unsurpassed service & superior guidance was unexpected, delivered-at-random, fun, entertaining, and so very memorable!  it doesn't get any better!", 
            "definitely one of the best meals i have had in a long time.  everything at mastro's is great-- from the service to the ambiance to the food, the whole evening was really enjoyable.  \n\ni don't even usually like <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, but it is really exceptional at mastro's.  the jumbo shrimp is delicious and the over the top \"smoking\" presentation is pretty amazing.  \n\nthe steak is obviously great, but i could have eaten just sides all night.  the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> were all delicious.\n\nsince i was there with a big group we also sampled several desserts.  i know a steak meal can be filling, but try to save room.  highlights included the chocolate pudding cake and the key lime pie.\n\na great restaurant for a special occasion.", 
            "my party came here to celebrate a milestone birthday and we all agreed that everything was top-notch.  located in the crystals shopping complex, mastro's cuts an imposing figure from its perch over and above the mall.  most of my party ordered seafood and all of it was delicious.  my <mark>Scottish Salmon Fillet</mark> was perfect and made me feel full and fabulous (thanks, omega-3's!).  all of the side dishes (<mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>, asparagus, etc.) were served by the wait staff and everyone's glasses were kept full.  mastro's gifted my birthday celebrating friend with a free dessert (butter cake) -- this dessert is worth another visit!  yum.  wait staff were also patient with another friend's toddler, who insisted on wandering about and mingling with the singers (dinner music) of the evening.  thanks for a lovely evening, mastro's!", 
            "i've been here twice and my second experience was even better than the first.  my hubby and i came here to celebrate our anniversary and we were so glad we did.  \n\nwe were greeted by the sweetest hostess as soon as we arrived, and she asked if we were here for a special occasion.  i let her know that it was our anniversary, and word traveled fast since our waiter greeted us with a congratulations.  \n\ni ordered the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> (8oz) and a side of <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>, and my husband ordered the <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark> (12oz) and the gorgonzola mac & cheese.  my steak was so tender that i could cut it with a butter knife and it practically melted in my mouth.  my husband is a steak connoisseur and he said that it was the best steak that he's ever had.  the <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> were buttery and pan seared to perfection, and the mac & cheese was rich and heavy.  i'm not a fan of blue cheese at all but the gorgonzola was really mild (i guess they use 4 kinds of cheeses).  \n\nalthough we didn't even have room for dessert, our waiter brought us a nice piece of chocolate cake with \"happy anniversary\" on the plate.  along with this came a giant serving of their homemade  whip cream.  i somehow found room in my belly and managed to scarf down 1/2 of it.  a really nice gesture that went a long way.  \n\nthe service was fantastic.  even if we looked in the waiter/servers' direction they would come over to see if we needed anything.  \n\nthe only thing odd about this location is that it is in the crystal cove mall, so the ambiance isn't what i'm used to with this kind of food.  at least we were surrounded by high end shops like jimmy choo.  the bathrooms are also upstairs which are kind of a bummer.  we didn't mind at all though, we were on cloud 9 with everything else about the place.", 
            "i have been here 2 times in the last year  the staff is freely and very attentive. this time we got to sit in the bird house which is really cool.  \n\nthe first time was great had the <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark>*24oz, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> soup & heirloom tomato & burrata, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, grilled asparagus but the best part was the dessert that mastro's signature warm butter cake is by far the best dessert you will every taste.  \n\nso on our second visit we wanted to see if they could repeat it.  again we got the <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark>*24oz - it really is very good and enough for two to share.  we got the blue cheese wedge and the  for the sides this time we stuck to the same <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> but added the <mark>Colossal Onion Rings</mark> )which are fantastic) and the grilled <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>(i have to admit these were not bitter at all.)  then came the end that mastro's signature warm butter cake was even better then i remembered its so gooey it melts in your mouth, you have to have it warm because we have stopped by just got the cake to go and it was server cold s not the same.  \n\ni recommend to anyone weather you live in vegas or visiting try this place you will not be disappointed.", 
            "it looks like it's all been said before, so i'll keep this short (as much as i can manage) and sweet.  \n\nimpressive digs: the sculptural treehouse dining room is a gem.  the bar is impressive (a two story shelf of bottles).  \n\nthe service is absolutely top notch: when we arrived for our 8:30 pm reservations, the hosts apologized but there was going to be a twenty minute delay.  we weren't bothered at all by the wait, but we were still given glasses of complimentary champagne--and we were treated to the restaurant's signature warm butter cake for dessert.  i have absolutely no complaints about the delay in getting seated.  mastro's handled a difficult situation appropriately, and in my opinion, went above and beyond for myself and the other guests that were also seated late.\n\nmy boyfriend and i went all out for dinner and ordered the seared ahi appetizer as well as the hamachi with fried onions.  please, oh please make sure you get this.  i've never seen anything like it before.  the perfectly fried onions melt on your tongue like butter, and the hamachi was perfect.  what an amazing combination.\n\nwe ordered the bone-in 12 oz filet and the 22 oz <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> with a side of gorgonzola mac & cheese and <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>. \n\nthe proteins were cooked perfectly and were absolutely delicious, but the stand out dish on the table was the flippin' amazing mac & cheese.  we talked about it at the restaurant, as we were leaving the restaurant, while we were next door at the aria casino, on our flight home, and ever since we've been back home.  they are out of this world.  we were so sad that we weren't able to take home the leftovers.\n\ndessert: what hasn't been said about the warm butter cake already?  just get it already.\n\nthis place is spendy--and totally worth every penny.",

            "shady rolled in to mastro's to commence his epic 8 night assault on vegas on a sunday evening 8.30. housed in the crystals mall(one word of caution-if u come to crystals with a special someone plan on dropping a few k$-its 5th ave on steriods). seated in the neat tree house, shady and co. started with some <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, well presented and delicious. shady and lucky guest split the bone in ribeye and the crusted halibut special and side of <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>. the steak and brussel sprouts were spot on. the halibut was a touch disappointing, undercooked in spots and with no real oomph in the flavor. the dessert had to be the signature warm butter cake. big enough for 8, shady and friend got 1/3 through and called it quits. the creme fraiche was outstanding and the cake as good as advertised. but why so huge? service was very good, and the vibe very enjoyable. shady always have reservations ordering fish in las vegas, and next time will stick with what shady thinks is their forte-the meats. 3.5 stars.", 
            "food was amazing. the discount on this review is based on the hostess service upon check in. \n\ni wanted to have dinner with my dad for his 73rd birthday. i made a reservation for 5pm for a party of two. i showed up early at 4:20pm and hostess said she could not seat us however we can sit by the bar and have drinks and appetizers. the two hostesses asked for my name multiple times for the reservation. we sat by the bar and the bartender says only non cooked items are available for appetizers. i wish the hostess mentioned this before offering the bar side option. 5pm passes by and i see the hostess seating other parties to the tables. i went back to the reception and the same hostess asked for my name twice. she points at another host and i assume to follow her. she doesn't acknowledge or provide a greeting. i realize she is the one supposed to seat is. maybe the host station wasn't organized or wasn't ready for the evening but i didn't appreciate the confusion and cold reception upon check in. i understand names are complicated but i must have said my generic name seven times to two different people, \"cheryl garcia\". to add additional confusion, i received an email saying i did a 'no show' for my reservation on open table. i'm not certain how that happened even when i checked in on yelp as well. \n\nthe server provided better service and made excellent recommendations. i have an issue with over ordering but that's because i want to taste everything. for a party of two, i ended up ordering the chowder, calamari, sides of <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>, sauted asparagus, twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark>, sea salt & <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark>, and twelve oz bone in filet. the bread service was warm with an assorted selection. i enjoyed all the sides except the twice <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark>- i thought it was too salty & the chowder was slightly watered down and boring. the calamari was flavorful and crispy. the bone in filet was served sizzling on a ceramic platter and was super tender cooked to perfection. \n\nthe server brought out a complimentary butter cake for my dad's birthday. the cake was warm and rich topped with a vanilla bean ice cream and strawberries. this was very special and made the overall experience much better.",

            "mastro's literally is the best restaurant in las vegas. \n\nthe restaurant overlooks the main floor of crystal's and is absolutely gorgeous. very spacious with plenty of seating area.\n\ni've been here about 4 times and am never disappointed. in fact, i think i'm even more impressed each and every time i go and fall in love with the restaurant all over again. \n\nservice: impeccable, from the hosts to the servers. i've had a light skinned african american male with dreadlocks and glasses twice (embarrassing i should really remember his name) and he was quite delightful. i've had other servers as well who without a doubt, like the gentleman we had twice, ensured we were taken care of throughout our entire meal. \n\nfood: to die for. the best <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> i've ever had. i've tried quite a few steakhouses in las vegas (ribeyes because i am obsessed) and none compare to mastro's. their appetizers and sides are wonderful too! i've tried their scallops which are soft like butter, <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (a must try), gorgonzola mac and cheese, <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, and the <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> (gotta have some veggies).\n\nwine: they have one of my favorite cabernets here that pairs perfectly with the ribeye, chateau st. jean. highly recommend with your meal if you're enjoying steak, not seafood.\n\ndessert: do the butter cake. comes with a heaping pile of homemade whipped cream. sweet, warm, and delicious!\n\ni love this restaurant. writing this review makes me want to go there this week. a perfect 5!",

            "my hubby and i celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary here with my daughter and parents. we started off with mastro's seafood tower. you can create your own seafood tower to your liking and size. our seafood tower had shrimp, <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark> and oysters. we all enjoyed especially my daughter; the cool dry ice effect and seafood tower presentation. the seafood was fresh and the oysters tasted amazing. my hubby had the <mark>Lemon Sole</mark>, my mom had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, my dad had the <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark>, i had <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> and my daughter got to sample a little bit of everything. we shared two sides family style of their signature <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (love this combo) and the other side dish of <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>. the seafood and chicken entrees and sides were served hot, fresh and perfectly seasoned. at the end, they complimentary served us their yummy signature warm butter cake dessert with vanilla ice cream and added happy anniversary wish which was a nice added personal touch. we had a wonderful time and food experience on our first visit here, and the service was friendly and excellent.", 
            "best restaurant in the entire world! its a hidden gem because its in a mall and less crowded than restaurants in casinos but dont let the crowd size fool you. ive been there probably 20 times and ive never had a bad anything. ive had everything on the menu because we often go to dinner with about 20 people so we order everything. great wines, really fresh seafood, but the side dishes and desserts is what really sets them apart from others. my fav sides are <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>, <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, gorgonzola mac n cheese and mushrooms. for desserts nothing is better than the butter cake and pecan pie. if youre not a fan of raspberry sauce like myself you can order the butter cake without the raspberry and its heavenly! its romantic enough for a date and trendy enough for dinner before going out with friends- like i said best restaurant in the entire world!"

            "the boyfriend decided to make a dinner reservation here for my birthday. he had to keep adding people to our reservation but they were accommodating and allowed our changes.\n\nthe place is located in the middle of crystals, the shopping center at city center. we arrived on time for our reservation but they did not have our table ready so we grabbed some drinks at the bar. there was live piano playing and singing so it was a pleasant wait.\n\ndinner was good and the service was good.\n\ni got the bone-in rib-eye and it was good. it was tender, juicy and flavorful.\n\nsides:\n<mark>Creamed Corn</mark>\n<mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>\ngarlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>\nsauteed mushrooms\n\nall the sides were delicious. it's family style so the servers will initially go around and ask if you want a serving and will serve you.\n\nit was an amazing birthday dinner and i would come back here if i ever get the chance.", 
            "i will preface this review with the fact that family was in town and this dinner was free!\n\nwe had reservations for saturday night  at 8:30 pm for a group of 7. i am always leery of a restaurant that is in the middle of a mall. i don't care how fancy the mall is, i think mall food every time i dine at one. mastro's my friends is no mall food place.\n\nthe service was top notch, we had a waiter and 2 bussers, while i'm sure they had different tables, they were always there when we needed them. it was like they were our dedicated staff.\n\nthe meal was top notch, starting with the amazing bread basket, continuing through the entrees, the family style sides, and ending up with an amazing dessert (which they comped to the table).\n\nthe bread basket was a good start, it had pretzel bread, olive bread, a parmesan crisp, and few other breads. the sides were amazing, they are served family style in surprisingly large portions. we had <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (some of the best i've ever had), <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, and mushrooms. we also had a few salads to pass around the table, 2 caesars (one regular and one spicy), tomato and onion, and tomato and mozzarella. a seafood tower and <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> were also ordered, i'm not much of a seafood guy but everyone else loved it. \n\nthey entrees were pretty stellar as well, i was splitting the 33oz wagyu tomahawk cut with my uncle, but since he was too full from the salads and sides, i had to man up and eat the whole thing myself (the things i have to do). this was one of the best pieces of cow i've had in my life (and i've had a lot of cow). it was cooked just a touch under medium rare (perfect imo), the marbling in the meat was insane, and it came out on a scorching hot plate. i don't know how they cooked it but it was perfect. \n\ntable mates also got the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, a filet, and a few other meats, i was very impressed with the size of their portions, most places would serve about 4oz of fish, but their <mark>Filet</mark> were about 12oz servings.\n\nafter dinner, they brought out a warm butter cake with vanilla ice cream for the table, it was a great end to the meal, and comping it was a nice touch!\n\ni have no clue what the meal ran, but it was amazing. my only complaint is that their bar area isn't the best, if they're going to make you wait 10-20 mins for your table they need more room in the bar. they did however have a great piano player and singer who played a variety from christmas carols to current hits which only added to the amazing meal.\n\nwill i be back, hopefully, especially if someone else is picking up the tab!", 
            "stopped in to mastro's ocean club recently on a work related dinner.  we got to sit under the tree house that overlooks the crystals shopping center.\n\nafter waiting about 15 minutes to be seated, we started with the seafood tower because nothing says over the top lv dining like a seafood tower.  on this tower were jumbo shrimp, a variety of <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>, and some oysters.  served on the side were a traditional cocktail sauce, their atomic horseradish, and a mustard sauce.  i was a little too liberal with the horseradish sauce and can confirm that the \"atomic\" description is accurate.\n\nfor my main, i went with the ribeye steak and the table ordered a variety of sides: lobster mac and cheese, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, gnocchi, asparagus, and au gratin potatoes.  \n\nunfortunately, the highlight of my meal were a few of the sides.  i really enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese, the gnocchi, and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, all of which were excellent.  but my steak left a little to be desired.  it was flavorfull, but the piece of meat simply had too much gristle.  i appreciate a bit of fat on my steak, but this piece of meat had just a bit too much on and i had to cut around quite a bit of my meal.  based on the other reviews, it sounds like my experience may have been out of the ordinary, but from my experience, there are better places to try in lv.", 
            "as a 'local' in this town, it is one of our favorites, with the reason being that the portion sizes are so large that you will have left overs for at least one meal!  the prices do support this, but once you divide it by 2 or 3 i feel it is worth it.\n\nthe wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  they are excellent at giving you the actual methods of preparation, ingredients, etc. on any item vs. places where they basically repeat what is written on the menu (yes, i can read).\n\nthe <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> is sublime.  the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> is wonderful.  the fish and seafood i have had each time was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  and above all else...be sure to save room for the warm butter cake!\n\ni feel bad for the tourists that usually leave so much on the table.  me....i'm walking out with my doggy bag!",

            "review for restaurant week fall 2012 menu only:\n\ni went to mastros tonight for the first time and i convinced my wife to try restaurant week, too!  we were very pleased with the meal.\n\nwe got a nice bread basket with several types of bread.  i really liked the pretzel rolls with salt.  there were five choices in the basket.\n\ncourse 1:  we each got a salad--my wife's was a caesar and mine was their <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark>.  they were both the same greens but my dressing was made with some wasabi, hence the spicy.  both salads had a good amount of freshly grated cheese on them and they were very tasty.\n\ncourse 2:  i ordered the scottish salmon and andrea got the 8 ounce filet cooked medium.  i had several preparations from which to choose for the salmon and i chose the blackened option.  the salmon was delicious.  the filet was very good, too.  \n\nwith their restaurant week menu, diners can choose two sides.  we each ordered garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  my wife ordered the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and i got the <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>.  the sides were huge.  since we each ordered the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, we got a regular portion which is their standard size for sides.  the corn and spinach were smaller versions.  all three were very good.  i needed salt, but then anything needs salt.  samantha started us out by giving each of us some of the sides so we each could try everything.\n\ncourse 3:  for dessert, andrea got the chocolate layer cake and i got the key lime pie.  along with the desserts, we were brought a large bowl of freshly made whopped cream--lightly sweetened.  the chocolate cake was huge.  my key lime pie was more a normal size.  both were outstanding!!\n\nwe ate in the tree house overlooking the shops at crystals.  service was superb!  our server, samantha, was excellent.  the staff cleared tables promptly, cleaned the table cloth between (not that i'm a slob or anything), our iced teas were refilled often, and the pace of the meal was perfect!  \n\ni am so glad mastros participated in restaurant week.  it gave me a chance to try it and i will be back.  what a fantastic start to rw fall 2012.", 
            "having been to another branch of mastro's in beverly hills, my boyfriend sought to surprise me by making a reservation in this location for my 21st birthday because he was confident that it wouldn't disappoint and he was completely right. just like the one in beverly hills, this place had outstanding service! honestly, it has better service than the one in beverly hills. our server, tanya, was amazing. she kinda resembles chelsea lately but way prettier.. anyways she was very accommodating even though she was busy with other tables. i was impressed by her. since it was my birthday, we got a complimentary dessert of my choice and i chose the warm butter cake. it is so delicious. we got escargot for an appetizer following our main course which was a <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> with a side of <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> along with a sushi tower which consisted of hamachi sashimi and <mark>Clear Lobster Roll</mark>. every single thing we ordered was simply delightful and at times, i wish i can go to vegas just to eat at this specific location of mastro's. because it's vegas, it is a little more crowded but the ambiance still reflects an elegant and classy environment. thank you mastro's ocean club for making my birthday memorable :)", 
            "the las vegas-mastro's ranks among our top dining experiences anywhere in the world.  on this labor day weekend visit, our initial disappointment, of not being seated in the unique & always fascinating \"tree-house\", was quickly extinguished by shauna, our culinary captain extraordinaire, menu \"tour guide\" and libation/wine aficionado.  turns out... our \"terrace\" seating near the piano bar was as enjoyable as it was entertaining, resulting in yet another \"positively outrageous\" fine dining adventure.\n\nshauna introduced us to mastro's participation in \"las vegas restaurant week\", a worthy nationwide charity drive to raise money for & donate meals to 3-square food bank in southern nevada.  she offered a special 4-course dinner deliciously flanked by beefsteak tomato & onion salad, an 8 oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> & garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and key lime pie all for a reasonable price, part of which was ultimately donated for a worthy cause.  \n\nas there were 5 of us on this visit, the aforementioned special meal was joined by collection of our menu favs and shauna's recommendations. she perfectly paired our appetizers & meals with wonderful riesling, cabernet, and sauvignon blanc.\n\nsooo, included in the culinary delight were: the legendary seafood tower (ohhh yes!!), <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (best in class!), <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark> (delightful), <mark>New York Strip</mark> (absolute perfection), <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> (sweet & outa this world), saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> (oh yeah!), <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (buttered and seasoned to perfection), saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms ( a fav of favs), <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> (these aren't yo mama's sprouts, believe it!), 1 lb. <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> (huge), triple chocolate layer cake (nothing but delish), and...(drum roll)... the mastro's signature warm butter cake!!...once again to die for!!!\n\nwithout fail, and to paraphrase the writings of t. scott gross,... mastro's was again a \"positively outrageous\" dining experience where the culinary expectations were always far exceeded.  shauna's unsurpassed service & superior guidance was unexpected, delivered-at-random, fun, entertaining, and so very memorable!  it doesn't get any better!", 
            "we had a lovely dinner.  my friend and i split the scallops and the ny steak and they were delicious.  a few comments:  1) the restaurant is in a high-end mall so it didn't feel very secluded or intimate; 2) we ordered <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> as our sides.  these side portions could have easily fed 4-5 people each.  i wished that the waiter would have told us that how much food this is. too much waste.  we were on vacation - so no doggy-bags possible.", 
            "i think mastro's has good food, but the food itself is not worth the price.  you are really paying extra in exchange for the privilege of eating your dinner inside of a giant, 3-d artist's rendition of a tree house.  it's still pretty good though.  i got the big bone-in fillet, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, and club house salad.  the house salad has shrimps and crab in it.  it's quite good.  the warm butter cake is ok.  i thought the grain was coarse and the flavor was just \"yellow\".  i dunno, it's just not as good as everyone keeps saying.  but i still gave it four stars for the architecture.",

            "so i am a huge fan of mastro's and frequent their costa mesa and newport locations. i gotta say that this was pretty close to the ca locations, minus a few minor details. from the pretzel bread to the seafood tower appetizer, i was pleasantly reminded of home sweet home (oc). the atomic horseradish is the perfect paring with your chilled seafood, and that is the perfect way to kick off you meal at mastro's. i ordered my usual <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and sides of <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, grilled asparagus and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> - all were pretty good. the finale aka warm butter cake, is where they finally dropped the ball. they brought it out and it was cold. now this is a dessert that you absolutely must eat piping hot, and considering i had just ordered a dinner for 9 people and 2 bottle of caymus, was not too thrilled at the anticlimactic ending to my meal. the service was great and i would definitely eat here again. maybe was just a minor miss on the dessert? anyways, mastro's remains my favorite steakhouse and i will definitely give it another shot next time i am in vegas.", 
            "yes yes yes! took some friends and clients for a beautiful dinner here. what can i say? amazing food. highest quality i've had in a very long time. the steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked and all topped off with their truffle butter (highly recommended but an extra $15 add-on, i know. i can buy a lot of butter for $15, but worth it). yum! also ordered a fairly large seafood tower. it was stocked with lobster, large <mark>Snow Crab Claw</mark>, oysters, <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>. can you say, unbelievable! with our steaks, we ordered the following sides. <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, mac and cheese, and the gnocci. all amazing. obviously the price here is fairly hefty but was well worth it. impeccable service with our waiter anticipating our every need. we ordered so much food that they ultimately comped us on a free desert. way to go maestros. will most definitely come again!", 
            "we came here for our mothers day celebration. my wife liked it the last time we came to lv so we made a reservation to come back.  we are big fans of maestros in west la.  we ordered <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> to share for starters.  the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was the star of the whole dinner and the only reason for the 3rd star.  it was really really good and to find real lobster in it was great.  the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was good and the fact that they portioned it out for us was a nice touch. we  two ribeye steaks for mains together with mac and cheese and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>.  we ordered our two steaks med rare and medium.  the steaks came out med and almost well done.  i had to give half of my steak to my wife since it was her day and she forbade me from complaining to the staff so i'm writing this review.  the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was really good and the portions were generous.  the mac and cheese on the other hand was a huge disappointment - completely tasteless and gummy.  service was good and they really did treat us well.", 
            "one of the best meals our group agrees we've had. even the simplest details, from the almost-double-portion martinis to the piping hot pretzel rolls are well-considered and designed to impress and welcome. steak was incredible, portions were generous. we couldn't decide if the \"blackened\" finish or the truffle butter won more accolades, but i doubt you can go wrong. \n\ni had the petit (6oz) filet mignon with a crab cake to create my own little \"surf & turf\". again, portions were above and beyond so it was almost more than i could finish. having lived in boston and maryland i'm extremely well-versed in seafood, especially lobster and <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark>, so i tend not to order these items freely elsewhere. the crab cake was pan-fried but still great. (i tend to prefer broiled.) the steak was better than top steak houses in dc/ny. honestly. find a way to get steak and seafood into your meal!\n\nfor \"family style\" sides we ordered <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> (unnecessary), <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark> (food heaven), <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (must get), and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (i didn't even bother as i had too much more interesting food already). the server actually walks around to distribute the sides as you like, which again was a wonderful touch for our group of 9. \n\nother winners: shrimp sushi roll, all martinis, espresso drinks, tomato/burrata salad. \n\nour server was really fantastic. friendly, efficient, doting, and plenty loud which again, is very important when you have lists of specials to communicate enthusiastically and a long table of 9 semi-rowdy friends.\n\nwe used to actually go off the strip to find hidden top steakhouse gems but now maestro's in crystal center will be the go-to. \n\nif you have only one good/fancy/formal meal for your trip: go here.", 
            "this is top notch dining. located in crystals at aria on the 2nd level. five of us came to celebrate a birthday last night and we requested the \"tree house\". this is a wooden structure which almost floats in the air, very unique for sure. \n\nwe were seated in the center and were lucky enough to get paul as our waiter. paul is everything in a waiter you could ever ask for. knowledgeable, very attentive, funny and yet professional giving us excellent service during our meal. \n\nhe was helpful when selecting wines as well as explaining the menu. i ordered the <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> and the 22 oz <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark>. i love seafood and was planning on the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> but couldnt resist the ribeye. our table split sides of gorgonzola mac & cheese, creamed spincach and gnocci with alaskan king crab. \n\nthe <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> was excellent. served in a dish with 2 sauces and dry ice it comes out smoking. it was about 10 large pieces of crab ($28). the ribeye was also very good ($58), although a tad to fatty for me. it had good marbling like a ribeye should but parts were a bit too fatty. 3 of us ordered our steaks medium rare and they all came out rare. beware they do tend to undercook  a bit, but we all finished them as the meat was so good. \n\nthe gorgonzola mac and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> ($14) were both really good. we were a little disappointed with the gnocci however ($33). i found very little king crab in the dish but the flavor was there. for dessert we ordered 3 of mastro's famous butter cakes which come with vanilla ice cream. \n\npaul was nice enough to personalize one of the plates with a \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate. the butter cakes were awesome (and quite large). they can easily be split  between two or three people. \n\nmastro's provided us an excellent meal with outstanding service. the steaks could have been cooked a little longer but with that being about the only flaw the 5 stars are well deserved.", 
            "dinner in a treehouse! \n\nit was my first time visiting mastro's located in the shops at crystals.  this beautiful and elegant dining can be seen while walking through.  the 'treehouse' as they call it sits directly in the center so it's very hard to miss.  the wooden structure will catch your eye in a heartbeat.  \n\nwe made reservations for our group and were seated early.  i would like to give a tremendous thank you to paul our waiter.  i don't think i've ever been so entertained while receiving the best service anyone could ask for.  he went above and beyond to make our evening memorable. \n\nthe table is brought a bread basket which has 3 options. i will say their pretzel bread called my name.  i asked for more in which paul graciously brought an entire basket of just those.  fantastic! \n\ni started with the wedge salad.  perfect and delicious.  the crumbled bacon had a great flavor combined with the creamy blue cheese.  for my entree i chose the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> accompanied by <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, gorgonzola mac and cheese and <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>.  of course all of the sides are huge and were shared between all of our group.  the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was so light, fresh and baked perfectly.  the gnocchi was a disappointment.  i don't think there were any crab pieces in this. but the other two sides definitely made up for it.  they were so creamy.  anything with gorgonzola will make me happy. simply delicious!\n\nif the appetizer, bread basket or main meal didn't fill you up, they have a great dessert list.  on top of that list is their signature butter cake.  it's topped with vanilla bean ice cream with strawberry drizzled around the cake.  it's calorie free and fat free... in my dreams! it's moist and delectable.  after the huge meal, i would suggest splitting this huge cake.  \n\nmastro's delivered an impeccable meal with first class service.  it was surely a memorable evening!", 
            "i have never been to a fancy steakhouse before, and i have learned that they are incredibly awesome!\n\nwe booked a reservation ahead of time, so getting seats were very convenient and we were seated right away. our server for the evening was craig and he was a very personable man, who was very helpful throughout the entire evening. he had an answer for any question i threw his way and he explained things that they were offering off the menu very well as well. \n\nour appetizer came out first, which were their <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tostadas. they were very delicious. the tostada portion was very crunchy and had the perfect texture. the avocado and tuna that they served on the tostada were so soft and had a buttery texture, which was heaven in my mouth. our entrees then came out with our sides. i ordered the bone in ribeye with an 8oz prawn, while by brother ordered the kansas city strip. both of our steaks were cooked to perfection. i ordered mine medium and my brother ordered medium-well, and it came out exactly as expected. for our sides, we ordered the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> along with <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>. the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were supposedly their most popular side, and i can see why. they had a good amount of lobster in that dish and it added a nice change to plain <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was very creamy and rich. i personally could only handle so much, but they did prepare it very well. since we went there for my birthday, they provided a complimentary slice of cake for me to eat, and it was a 5 layered chocolate cake. their cake is some of the best cake i have ever had. i have no way to describe the taste besides \"clean.\" it stayed together very well, the flavor wasn't too strong, and the texture was perfect. \n\nto say the least, the service and food was some of the best i have ever had all in all. i definitely could not eat here on a regular basis, but for special occasions, this will definitely be on the list.", 
            "worth every penny! everything bite was beyond delicious. best <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> i've ever had. the filet with truffle butter was perfectly cooked and tender. we added <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and asparagus all were very good, especially the lobster mash potatoes. nothing but good things with the warm butter cake. even if you don't have room for dessert, you have to have the warm butter cake!!!", 
            "best food ever. steak is perfectly cooked and lobster mash is to die for. didn't really like the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> but the butter cake yummy!!!!!! if you make a reservation ask to sit in linus section. he is one of the best waiters ever!!!!!", 
            "went with my brother for this birthday. it's rather odd to be eating in this kind of restaurant in a mall, but the faint mall music didn't affect the food. \n\nwe started with the <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark> then moved on to (rare) bone in rib-eye and kansas city stip. my brother went surf and turf and added the prawn, which was basically the largest shrimp i've ever seen. we rounded out with sides of lobster mash potatoes and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>. \n\nmy only complaint was my moscow mule, which didn't appear to have any ginger beer and was essentially vodka and lemon juice. overall, the food was cooked perfectly and the service was attentive without being annoying (this is a fine line). it was a great experience and i'm sure it made my brother's day."

            "was there while in las vegas for business. my hosts were contractors on the project and we maybe got a little extra pampering. there were 7 of us. \n\nfood is incredible. we didn't order appetizers, but a couple of us did have salads. the entrees around the table were steaks, swordfish, and <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>. we shared the stellar <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, along with <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> and broccoli. for desert, they just left us the desert tray. we couldn't finish it! \n\nservice is second to none. everything you would expect.", 
            "if you're short on time and/or simply not a big fan of the written word, let me start this review with all you really need to know about mastro's: butter. cake.  that's it.  5 stars for the best cake i've ever had.\n\nok, now on to the merely trifling details.\ni made a reservation several weeks in advance as my boyfriend and i were headed to vegas on labor day weekend for his birthday.  i requested a table in the \"tree house\" (i called it the birdcage or something equally gauche) and noted the occasion.\n\nwe arrived and were told they were preparing \"one of the best tables\" in the birdcage--that we could sit at the bar for a few minutes or be seated promptly at another table.  obviously we hit the bar which, it bears noting, is visually interesting with a huge inventory of top shelf liquors stacked all the way to the ceiling.\ni had the mastro's martini--belvedere vodka with handstuffed blue cheese olives.  sweet jesus.  hands down, best martini i've ever had.  three days later, i'm still thinking about those olives.\n\ndidn't even finish my drink before the hostess, a sweet, bubbly thing, took us to our table.  situated on the perimeter of the birdcage, it was a great table.  yes, it's a mall, so our view included louis vuitton and a hoard of assholes who had just evidently exited the elvis show but, whatever.  it's vegas.  plus, i liked the change-up from the normal casino venue which meant i got non-smoky air for a full 3 hours.\n\nour meal, start to finish, was fabulous, perhaps only outdone by the impeccably rendered service.  a special shout out goes to our main server, matt, whose plesant demeanor, attentive service and knowledge of the menu (and wine list) were truly something special.\n\nwe started with a custom seafood tower.  wanting to save room for the steak, we went modest with 3 shrimp (huge), an order of <mark>Dungeness Crab Cocktail</mark> (the best cold crab i've ever had) and 1/2 dozen kumamoto oysters.  the dry ice effect and caper berry garnish were nice touches but the star of the tower was the hand grated horseradish.  when was the last time you noticed and raved about horseradish?  yeah, that's what i thought.  i will never buy the jarred stuff again.\n\nmoving on to the main attraction: i went with the 12 oz bone in-filet and boyfriend got the kansas city.  we both preferred mine as it offered a better combination of buttery tenderness and intense meaty flavor.  he would do the ribeye if he had to do it over again but he was by no means dissatisfied with his steak.\nfor sides we selected snap beas, glossed in simple butter, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> ,which mercifully left large kernels of corn intact, and an order of the matchstick fries (sans vinegar).\n\ntwo tiny complaints:\n(1) upon seating, we received the \"reserve wine list\" which the bf deemed very high priced--not a single bottle under $100.  a few things we could buy for $150 at the store were priced at $900 and up.  1000% = excessive mark-up.  nevertheless, he picked a nice bottle of red that he thought was reasonable.  when the menu came, about 10 minutes later, the left hand side had an enormous list of wines of the style and prices ($100-200) you'd expect at a standard steakhouse.  would have been nice to have seen that list when we were ordering.  might have been an isolated timing thing but worth pointing out.\n\n(2) our first order of fries came out and were basically salt sticks.  and i love me some salt.  i could barely eat these.  the manager came by and i made a casual comment about them.  he said he'd have the kitchen do a fresh batch but would leave us the salt bombs until the new batch was ready.  very nice touch, in my opinion.  because of course we kept eating them.  second batch was perfectly seasoned and the manager seemed to recognize that the kitchen can get a little heavy handed with them.\n\nthese two missteps in no way took away from how much we enjoyed our experience at mastro's.\n\nlast but not least (since it already got a plug at the outset of this review), mastro's blew us away with the complimentary butter cake--served on a personalized plate (\"happy birthday rob!\").  i've since seen some recipes for this cake and i'm really sorry i did.  i could hear my arteries clogging as i ate this, but man it was worth it.  one of those items where you take a bite, laugh at the insane delectability, take another bite, and chuckle some more.  for me, there is no better mark of good food than laughter. \n\ni found the prices high, but totally on par for what i expected in vegas.  and, in fact, to the dollar, the amount we spent on nobu the night before (with cocktails but no wine).\nwe'll definitely be coming back here.  and will hopefully be seated in matt's section.\noh, and the table next to us (3 couples) spent most of the evening talking about bra sizes and dirty sanchezes.  can't beat that for entertainment.", 
            "i would rate this more of a 3.5.  for starters, the decor and architecture of this restaurant is absolutely breathtaking.  based in the center of a classy mall, the treehouse area has a unique and interesting view of everything around you.  we went around 9, so no one was really shopping and the mall was pretty bare. i felt like i was in a different world!  for a monday night the restaurant was hardly crowded and we were seated immediately at a table of our choice.  the complimentary bread was interesting, although there were several pieces that were extremely hard to bite into, i enjoyed the soft pretzel-like bread the most.  for drinks we tried the lemon drop and the cantaloupe martini.  both very awesome, and the cool thing is that they come with the martini shaker, so you end up getting two drinks really.  i enjoyed both drinks, the cantaloupe one tasted like sweet cantaloupe but strong enough to get you buzzed.  as for the lemon drop, it was soooo cool - they put some kinda sizzling dry ice or something in it so it looked like a volcano when it came out.  i sat there in awe for like 2 minutes just staring at the smoke come out of my drink! then sipped on it and got buzzed 10 min after hahahhaha.  \n\nas for the entree, we ordered the rib eye medium rare, macaroni and cheese, and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>.  i'm sad to say but i wasn't too impressed with the rib eye.  i felt like it was cooked in fire too high - the bone was completely charred.  even though the inside was medium rare, the outside had bad burnt areas all around it.  and since we shared a plate, they brought out another plate for me, but it was soooo hot that when we put food on it, the oil kept splattering on me!!!  i mean granted it was a nice gesture, but i did not like how bits of oil kept splattering on my nice dress!  so anyhow, despite the slight disappointment in the steak, the macaroni and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> totally made up for it.  the macaroni came out in a sizzling pan where the cheese would not stop ooozing when you tried to take a spoon full of it off....just the way i like it!!! i couldn't stop eating the side items that i probably would have rather eaten those as my meal rather than the steak itself!\n\nanyhowl, i dont know if i'd come back for the steak, but i definitely appreciated the view, side items, and drinks.  our bill came out to be $110 for 2 drinks, 2 side items, and 1 rib eye.  it was what we were expecting for a steakhouse at this caliber so not surprised.  i rounded up on the rating only because between the two of us, we shared the leftover mac and cheese and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> the next day and still were satisfied :)", 
            "we stopped by at mastro's for our valentines day dinner last night.  when we arrived we were sat inside their treehouse.....a fairly unique dining experience.  the treehouse is their main dining area which is shaped like a treehouse that overlooks the center of the crystals' mall.\n\nfor starters, we ordered their stone crabs abd lobser bisque.....both were very average.   the bisque was watery....not very thick and rich.\n\nfor our entrees, we had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark>....both very flavorful and super tasty.  for sides, we had their <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> and lobster truffled gnocci....both were extremely, extremely rich (too much cream and truffled cheese).....but very flavorful.\n\nfor desert, we had their famous butter pound cake with ice cream and chocolate starwberrries......the cake was very average......i can get more flavorful pound cake at safeway...the chocolate strawberries were good, but nothing spectacular.\n\nthe service was average at best.   overall, the food was good, not great. one extra star for the cool treehouse dining experience.", 
            "overall, i really enjoyed my meal but be prepared for a different ambiance! the restaurant is literally in the middle of the mall, with the tables pretty much out in the open. not a huge deal, but definitely not ideal. \n\ni had the <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark> (spicy <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with no croutons), 8 oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark> and cheese cake for dessert. the filet was perfectly prepared, served on a burning hot plate that sizzled and continued to cook the sides of <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, spinach and garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>. our table also shared the <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark> appetizer, which was excellent! highly recommended!",

            "everything here was spectacular from beginning to end. i went here for dinner on a friday evening. the restaurant itself is located inside of crystals in an open area of the shopping center. despite the open area, the atmosphere was still very nice and the live music really added to it.\n\nmy experience:\nstarters\n-the bread was pretty good\n-the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> was delicious and the horseradish was spicy!\n\nmain course & sides\n-i ordered the filet, and having dined at another steakhouse earlier in the week, i must say, the filet here was incredible. this was probably one of the best <mark>Filet</mark> i have ever had!\n-the sides were just as amazing. we had the mac and cheese, <mark>Green Beans with Sliced Almonds</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>. i would recommend all of them as there wasn't one i did not like.\n\ndessert\n-i'm not a huge sweets guy, but i was told that i had to try the butter cake even though we were already stuffed. it definitely lived up to the hype as a must try dessert!\n\noverall, i had a great dining experience here. our waiter was awesome and we never felt rushed. i would highly recommend trying this place next time you are in vegas!", 
            "i will preface this review with the fact that family was in town and this dinner was free!\n\nwe had reservations for saturday night  at 8:30 pm for a group of 7. i am always leery of a restaurant that is in the middle of a mall. i don't care how fancy the mall is, i think mall food every time i dine at one. mastro's my friends is no mall food place.\n\nthe service was top notch, we had a waiter and 2 bussers, while i'm sure they had different tables, they were always there when we needed them. it was like they were our dedicated staff.\n\nthe meal was top notch, starting with the amazing bread basket, continuing through the entrees, the family style sides, and ending up with an amazing dessert (which they comped to the table).\n\nthe bread basket was a good start, it had pretzel bread, olive bread, a parmesan crisp, and few other breads. the sides were amazing, they are served family style in surprisingly large portions. we had <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (some of the best i've ever had), <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, and mushrooms. we also had a few salads to pass around the table, 2 caesars (one regular and one spicy), tomato and onion, and tomato and mozzarella. a seafood tower and <mark>Ocean Club Crab Cakes</mark> were also ordered, i'm not much of a seafood guy but everyone else loved it. \n\nthey entrees were pretty stellar as well, i was splitting the 33oz wagyu tomahawk cut with my uncle, but since he was too full from the salads and sides, i had to man up and eat the whole thing myself (the things i have to do). this was one of the best pieces of cow i've had in my life (and i've had a lot of cow). it was cooked just a touch under medium rare (perfect imo), the marbling in the meat was insane, and it came out on a scorching hot plate. i don't know how they cooked it but it was perfect. \n\ntable mates also got the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, a filet, and a few other meats, i was very impressed with the size of their portions, most places would serve about 4oz of fish, but their <mark>Filet</mark> were about 12oz servings.\n\nafter dinner, they brought out a warm butter cake with vanilla ice cream for the table, it was a great end to the meal, and comping it was a nice touch!\n\ni have no clue what the meal ran, but it was amazing. my only complaint is that their bar area isn't the best, if they're going to make you wait 10-20 mins for your table they need more room in the bar. they did however have a great piano player and singer who played a variety from christmas carols to current hits which only added to the amazing meal.\n\nwill i be back, hopefully, especially if someone else is picking up the tab!", 
            "yummie!  this place was great. there was 9 of us for dinner for a friend's birthday, our table was ready and waiting for us when we arrived, they allowed us to decorate the table, the service was awesome, their menu includes steak & seafood so everyone could order whatever they wanted.  the restaurant was very busy i must say and every table had cocktails on it, both are good signs for me.\n\nthey have tons of steaks to choose from, lamb, vanilla fried lobster, scallops, and tons of fish. my only confusion came from how the fish was actually prepared b/c there wasn't really on the menu explaining how you can get your fish cooked. after asking the waitress, she explained the 5 fish preparations.\n\nhere's what we ate:\n1) sashimi tower -white fish, tuna, <mark>Clear Lobster Roll</mark> all very good [see pix]\n2) heirloom tomatoes and burrata salad-very tasty and tons to share\n3) escargot-my favorite very very good [see pix]\n4) <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>-typically not a fan but i did enjoy this very much\n5) <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>-eh they are good for you\n6) mac n blue cheese-yes for sure\n7) halibut oreganata - almost $50, but was a huge piece of fish, definitely could share this\n8) the fried lobster was another one of my favorites\n9) <mark>Ahi Tuna Tostada</mark> again very good [see pix]\n\ni wanted to try the crab cake but didn't have any room left. we had more leftovers in bags then arms to carry them on.\n\nother notable notes: waiters were exceptional with their service of our table, my glass of veuve was never empty and the waiter was calling me by name the whole time :).\nour bill was over a grand after everything was said and done. so it's on the pricer side.", 
            "review for restaurant week fall 2012 menu only:\n\ni went to mastros tonight for the first time and i convinced my wife to try restaurant week, too!  we were very pleased with the meal.\n\nwe got a nice bread basket with several types of bread.  i really liked the pretzel rolls with salt.  there were five choices in the basket.\n\ncourse 1:  we each got a salad--my wife's was a caesar and mine was their <mark>Spicy Mambo Salad</mark>.  they were both the same greens but my dressing was made with some wasabi, hence the spicy.  both salads had a good amount of freshly grated cheese on them and they were very tasty.\n\ncourse 2:  i ordered the scottish salmon and andrea got the 8 ounce filet cooked medium.  i had several preparations from which to choose for the salmon and i chose the blackened option.  the salmon was delicious.  the filet was very good, too.  \n\nwith their restaurant week menu, diners can choose two sides.  we each ordered garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>.  my wife ordered the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and i got the <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>.  the sides were huge.  since we each ordered the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, we got a regular portion which is their standard size for sides.  the corn and spinach were smaller versions.  all three were very good.  i needed salt, but then anything needs salt.  samantha started us out by giving each of us some of the sides so we each could try everything.\n\ncourse 3:  for dessert, andrea got the chocolate layer cake and i got the key lime pie.  along with the desserts, we were brought a large bowl of freshly made whopped cream--lightly sweetened.  the chocolate cake was huge.  my key lime pie was more a normal size.  both were outstanding!!\n\nwe ate in the tree house overlooking the shops at crystals.  service was superb!  our server, samantha, was excellent.  the staff cleared tables promptly, cleaned the table cloth between (not that i'm a slob or anything), our iced teas were refilled often, and the pace of the meal was perfect!  \n\ni am so glad mastros participated in restaurant week.  it gave me a chance to try it and i will be back.  what a fantastic start to rw fall 2012.", 
            "the las vegas-mastro's ranks among our top dining experiences anywhere in the world.  on this labor day weekend visit, our initial disappointment, of not being seated in the unique & always fascinating \"tree-house\", was quickly extinguished by shauna, our culinary captain extraordinaire, menu \"tour guide\" and libation/wine aficionado.  turns out... our \"terrace\" seating near the piano bar was as enjoyable as it was entertaining, resulting in yet another \"positively outrageous\" fine dining adventure.\n\nshauna introduced us to mastro's participation in \"las vegas restaurant week\", a worthy nationwide charity drive to raise money for & donate meals to 3-square food bank in southern nevada.  she offered a special 4-course dinner deliciously flanked by beefsteak tomato & onion salad, an 8 oz. <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> & garlic <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, and key lime pie all for a reasonable price, part of which was ultimately donated for a worthy cause.  \n\nas there were 5 of us on this visit, the aforementioned special meal was joined by collection of our menu favs and shauna's recommendations. she perfectly paired our appetizers & meals with wonderful riesling, cabernet, and sauvignon blanc.\n\nsooo, included in the culinary delight were: the legendary seafood tower (ohhh yes!!), <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> (best in class!), <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark> (delightful), <mark>New York Strip</mark> (absolute perfection), <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> (sweet & outa this world), saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sauted Sea Scallops</mark></mark> (oh yeah!), <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (buttered and seasoned to perfection), saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms ( a fav of favs), <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> (these aren't yo mama's sprouts, believe it!), 1 lb. <mark>1 lb. <mark>Twice Baked Potato</mark></mark> (huge), triple chocolate layer cake (nothing but delish), and...(drum roll)... the mastro's signature warm butter cake!!...once again to die for!!!\n\nwithout fail, and to paraphrase the writings of t. scott gross,... mastro's was again a \"positively outrageous\" dining experience where the culinary expectations were always far exceeded.  shauna's unsurpassed service & superior guidance was unexpected, delivered-at-random, fun, entertaining, and so very memorable!  it doesn't get any better!", 
            "mastro's is amazing. i had the best steak here (even though this restaurant heavily features seafood). we had an early reservation because we had an 8:30 show to go to. we were seated immediately and i think they gave us white or black napkins, which they placed across our laps for us, based on what color we were wearing. and that was just a hint of the level of service to come. we had a very attentive server, but someone in a suit, his supervisor (?) was also constantly checking on us. my water glass was never empty, a standard i use to base a restaurant's level of service. i had gotten up once to use the restroom and accidentally dropped my napkin. as i was leaning over to pick it up, our server appeared out of nowhere and immediately insisted that he would do it. when i came back a fresh napkin was folded at my seat. when the sides came, someone immediately offered to serve them to us. i was surprised no one offered to cut my steak...lol. the restaurant quickly filled up, but from the time that we were seated until we left, never once did the superb service lapse.\n\nok onto the food: there were a few different types of bread and i think i like most of them. they refilled our bread basket, but i wish they didn't lol because i ate way too much bread. i ordered a berry flavored cocktail and it came in a martini glass, but they also set down a shaker cup by my glass, and to my delight, there was enough to fill my glass a second time! =d we ordered the <mark>Steamed Mussels</mark> appetizer and they were delicious, so fresh, not fishy at all. just delicious. i could have inhaled an entire order myself. everyone ordered the ribeye and it was perfect. so, so good. we were trying to be kinda healthy so we got sauteed mushrooms and spinach and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> as sides. but afterwards i wish we had gotten the mac & cheese and the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>. everything was so delicious and the portions were pretty big. i ate about a third of my ribeye and we didn't even finish all of the sides. luckily our hotel room had a fridge so we could take the leftovers. \n\nit was definitely pricey, but for the amazing service and food, i think it was well worth it. i would definitely go back or at least go to one of the socal locations. mastro's is the standard by which i compare all steakhouses and other fine dining establishments to.", 
            "party of 8 on a tuesday night.\ninteresting set up - there is a part of the restaurant that looks like a large wooden hornet's nest.  not sure what that's all about.  \n\nservice was impeccable from the hostess to the main server to his assistants.  everything was prompt, polite and timed well.  we were not rushed out even though we were one of the last parties to leave. \n\nfood:\ni ordered the gorgonzola mac and cheese $12 and the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> $48.  the mac and cheese was a little disappointing - very little flavor and it was dry,  very dry.  i had read that this was a great side dish so i was sad when it wasn't very palatable.  the portion is huge - consider sharing it if you do.  it easily fed our entire table.  i asked for the <mark>Rack of Lamb</mark> medium rare and it came out closer to medium.  regardless, the flavor was very smooth, not gamey.  the outside was a little too charred, but the rest of it was quite good.  it came with mint jelly, which was very tasty.  we also had a heirloom tomato and burrata salad $12 which was a very generous portion - the tomatoes were sweet and juicy.  the table got the seafood tower (have no idea how much that was but it was worth it).  this was friggin amazing.  honestly.  there were kumamoto oysters, fresh dungeness crab, snow <mark>Chilled <mark>Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark></mark>, humongous shrimp, great big lobster claws.  all fresh and tender meat.  it didn't require sauce.  none of it was briny or sandy.  so delicious and whatever we paid, i don't care.  it was unbelievable. other people in our party got the arctic char \"oreganato\" style, <mark>Bone-In Filet</mark>, seared scallops and halibut.  every dish was served with mushrooms, asparagus, green beans and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> (this had to have crack in it b/c <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> never tasted so good.)  no one had a single complaint and everyone finished what they ordered.  by this time, we're all about to pass out from food coma, but we insisted on the butter cake.  if you come here, no matter what you order, you must save room for this signature dessert.  i can't even describe it but it is amazing.  it comes out warm, w/ freshly made whipped cream and vanilla ice cream.   must.  must.  must have.  \n\noverall, great experience.  cost us a total of $1400 for 7 people.  you do the math.", 
            "i think it is actually called the \"tree house\", but i kept calling it the birds nest. whatever it was, it was cool!! now, keep in mind, this was a business dinner that i was at, so anything goes when it comes to ordering!! \n\nas far as what i had, i started with the <mark>Chopped Salad</mark>. delish! for dinner i got the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> special. this was different than the regular <mark>Petite Filet</mark>, because it came with the most delicious king crab leg meat as well in a yummy butter sauce. i honestly could only eat half of the steak, this was just too much food all around. \n\nfor sides, we got the mushrooms, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>. holy bananas these were all so good.\n\nthen we finished with the butter cake!! which is gigantic, way to big for two people. we all got some of it (there were six of us), but keep in mind we were stuffed at this point! the noise level was reasonable in this restaurant, so it was perfect for a dinner with colleagues.", 
            "i have been here 2 times in the last year  the staff is freely and very attentive. this time we got to sit in the bird house which is really cool.  \n\nthe first time was great had the <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark>*24oz, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> soup & heirloom tomato & burrata, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, grilled asparagus but the best part was the dessert that mastro's signature warm butter cake is by far the best dessert you will every taste.  \n\nso on our second visit we wanted to see if they could repeat it.  again we got the <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark>*24oz - it really is very good and enough for two to share.  we got the blue cheese wedge and the  for the sides this time we stuck to the same <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> but added the <mark>Colossal Onion Rings</mark> )which are fantastic) and the grilled <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>(i have to admit these were not bitter at all.)  then came the end that mastro's signature warm butter cake was even better then i remembered its so gooey it melts in your mouth, you have to have it warm because we have stopped by just got the cake to go and it was server cold s not the same.  \n\ni recommend to anyone weather you live in vegas or visiting try this place you will not be disappointed.", 
            "from start to finish, our experience with mastro's was wonderful. ruben and i brought his cousin, daisy here during one of her vegas trips. since there was a little bit of a wait for a table, we decided to hang out at the bar. the whole space feels large with the open-air setting in the crystals. the beautiful decor and low lighting creates an elegant atmosphere. the bar was pleasant and we enjoyed our beverages, including a couple crafted cocktails. \n\nwe didn't even have the opportunity to finish our drinks by the time our table was ready! we were seated near the edge of the restaurant (near the \"treehouse\"), so we had a view of the shops and open area with half our seating as a booth and the other half, chairs. it was really nice and very comfortable.\n\nwe started with <mark>Fried Calamari</mark>, served with fresh lemon (in a mesh, love it) and aioli. the breading appeared thicker than i normally like, but the squid was fresh and it was tasty. ruben and i shared the filet mignon, medium rare, and mastro's crusted salmon. the three of us shared the side dishes: <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, potatoes au gratin, gorgonzola macaroni & cheese, and steamed broccoli. the steak was prepared perfectly and scrumptiously tender, the salmon was so flavorful, and the sides were all delicious.\n\neverything about our meal was enjoyable. the prices are similar to those of high end steakhouses, but the portions were generous. we were able to take home a lot of food! to round everything out, the service was impeccable. it is one of our favorite steakhouses and favorite recommendations.", 
            "if i could give this place a million stars, i would. this is by far my favorite restaurant of all time. you must try the gorgonzola mac n cheese, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> and of course, the butter cake. i would eat here every day if i could!! it always our go to spot for holidays, birthdays and anniversaries! yummy! a must try!!", 
            "i went to mastro's for a business dinner for the first time earlier this month, and definitely plan on going back again if the opportunity arises.\n\nthe staff, from the hostess to our waiter, were very friendly, and our waiter was very knowledgable on the menu, chef preparation recommendations and specials. he also didn't hover too much, which is appreciated. \n\nour table started with calamari and an order of one of the day's selected oysters. the calamari was incredibly tender, the oysters were excellent too - the delicate cucumber flavor was exactly as described by our waiter.\n\nfor our main course, i had the arctic char oreganata (prepared with seasoned breadcrumbs) and my companions had the special wagyu and <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. for sides, we split the gorgonzola mac & cheese, sauteed asparagus and <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>. \n\ni'm deducted one star for the slightly underseasoned sides and for the ridiculously large portion sizes. my arctic char, while delicious, was enough for three meals (no, seriously, it was a pound of fish), and the sides were also much larger than you would expect at a restaurant in this price range, which can significantly limit the variety of sides you can try if you're dining in a party of 5 or less.", 
            "great food, great service just a little pricey for a date night. i would suggest this as a great place for a customer dinner. plenty of food options that would satisfy anyone's needs. the sides were great too and large enough to share. i recommend the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms and the <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>.", 
            "typical high-end steak place format. the location in city center is unique, in the wooden \"treehouse\".\nhighlights were potatoes gratin, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, and grilled asparagus. \nthe bananas foster cocktail is like a rum desert.\nof course the service is upscale as expected. \ni have been to mastro's locations in orange county and here, both were consistently good.", 
            "my girlfriend had told me about this place and although it had great reviews for a steakhouse. i thought it was just okay. the service was great which was a plus, but i thought the food was just okay. maybe we're just used to the more traditional and old-fashioned steakhouses. there didn't seem to be much of a dress code and the steak (ribeye) was too fatty for our taste. we didn't want anything lean, but this was too fatty. the best side to me was the <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> and the <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> soup was the highlight of my dinner. i will say it was my first time having <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark>. the ambiance was not exciting at all. (not for an *upscale* steakhouse. i don't think i'll come back unless i'm going to try the seafood or the butter cake.", 
            "what's that expression that a lot of us foolhardy guys toss about as soon as we get to vegas? \"go big, or go home\"? it basically gives us a free pass to indulge in things that are extravagant, luxurious and potentially dangerous. and mastro's fits well within this criteria: the place holds meals fit for royalty, the decor is immaculate, and it can be hazardous to your wallet's health if you are not prepared. but for those of us still reading, and certainly for those of us who have had the honor, mastro's is a must-dine destination if you're in town.\n\nlocated pretty centrally in the city center shopping district, it's almost impossible to miss mastro's: the opulent, wood-like \"fishbowl\" perched precariously at an elevation is definitely eye-catching, and i'm pretty sure i inadvertently photobombed countless tourists as they stopped to take pictures of this structure, which is actually a dining room. before you can get to your table, you stop by a tiny hostess desk flanked by two gals who wasted no time getting us seated once we checked in with our reservation. you'll more than likely walk past an offshoot to another, more private dining room, a pretty spectacular bar and then make your way into the main dining room that is expertly laid out: whoever did the layout here did so in such a way that seating is maximized but not once does it feel crowded. and this is even more impressive when you consider the polished staff is zipping about without hesitation or collision.\n\nand let's talk about the staff, right quick: simply put, these are professionals who know their craft inside and out. our waiter, lionel, was the epitome of providing an exceptional customer service experience. we were -that- table that upfront told him we had a show to catch later that evening, and without missing a beat, he assured us he would keep us on schedule and would not let the meal be compromised. his service, along with the refills and bussing provided by other staff members, made for the best, most efficient dining experience i have seen yet in years of visiting vegas. add in a visit from a manager who just stopped by to chat and make sure everything was cool, and you have a place with a team that cannot be topped.\n\nbut all the friendliness and attention to detail means nothing if the food is bogus, and mastro's has this base covered, too. oh, do they ever. my folks started with a bowl of <mark>Boston Clam Chowder</mark> and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, while i went with the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>. all three were perfect pre-show snacks for the main courses, and just typing this sentence out is making me drool with fond remembrance. ahem. \n\nmom went with a <mark>Gulf Red Snapper</mark> that was cooked to perfection and my surf-and-turf combo of a filet and lobster tail (which lionel was gracious enough to de-shell table side like a boss) ranks among the best i've had at any place around the world. but the most surprising part was when dad sheepishly admitted he had somehow never had <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> before... and now that bar is set unfathomably high as his <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> here was his favorite meal of this trip. a side of <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> and <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark> rounded out dinner, and wiped out my stomach. somehow, my folks found room for mastro's signature dessert, a butter cake that made me question how a chef can bake happiness, joy and euphoria into one pastry. it's that good (even though i had two bites and almost went into a coma with the straight gin i was drinking).\n\ni cannot say enough positive things about mastro's. from the staff to the overall \"look\" of the place, and most assuredly the culinary satisfaction each plate offers, it's a place that rewards all those who stop by for a drink or a bite to eat. take those winnings from the casino and invest them here: i promise it's a much better deal than your favorite variation of blackjack.", 
            "so i am a huge fan of mastro's and frequent their costa mesa and newport locations. i gotta say that this was pretty close to the ca locations, minus a few minor details. from the pretzel bread to the seafood tower appetizer, i was pleasantly reminded of home sweet home (oc). the atomic horseradish is the perfect paring with your chilled seafood, and that is the perfect way to kick off you meal at mastro's. i ordered my usual <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> and sides of <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, grilled asparagus and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> - all were pretty good. the finale aka warm butter cake, is where they finally dropped the ball. they brought it out and it was cold. now this is a dessert that you absolutely must eat piping hot, and considering i had just ordered a dinner for 9 people and 2 bottle of caymus, was not too thrilled at the anticlimactic ending to my meal. the service was great and i would definitely eat here again. maybe was just a minor miss on the dessert? anyways, mastro's remains my favorite steakhouse and i will definitely give it another shot next time i am in vegas.", 
            "we were in vegas for a bachelorette party for one of my besties and decided on this place for our fancy dinner night. we had 11 girls and people ordered a variety of things from the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> to the bone-in steaks. this is one of those fancy places where you order just the protein and then sides are extra. here's the breakdown:\n\nbread basket - good. normally, i'm not a fan of loading up on carbs, but we were getting bottle service the night and i was already starving, so i had to put something in the stomach. i was pleasantly surprised at the freshness of the bread! so soft and slightly warmed.\n\n<mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> - giant serving (probably enough for 2!). rich and creamy with actual chunks of lobster!\n\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> - good and buttery. it was a big serving size and i only finished probably half of it.\n\n<mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> - good, but slightly under cooked according to my friend's order.\n\n<mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> - i'm not really a fan of <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and these were okay. small pieces of lobster mixed in.\n\nsea salt & <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark> - pretty good! nice little break between bites of our main courses.\n\n<mark>Creamed Corn</mark> - pretty good! nice side dish without being overpowering.\n\nthe food was pretty good, but for a place of this caliber, i expected a lot more. they either under cooked or over cooked several steak orders, which had me thinking: what kind of steak house is this?!\n\nthe service was top notch at least and our bride-to-be got a special warm butter cake delivered to our table.\n\nwould i return? probably not.", 
            "mastro's literally is the best restaurant in las vegas. \n\nthe restaurant overlooks the main floor of crystal's and is absolutely gorgeous. very spacious with plenty of seating area.\n\ni've been here about 4 times and am never disappointed. in fact, i think i'm even more impressed each and every time i go and fall in love with the restaurant all over again. \n\nservice: impeccable, from the hosts to the servers. i've had a light skinned african american male with dreadlocks and glasses twice (embarrassing i should really remember his name) and he was quite delightful. i've had other servers as well who without a doubt, like the gentleman we had twice, ensured we were taken care of throughout our entire meal. \n\nfood: to die for. the best <mark>Bone-In Ribeye</mark> i've ever had. i've tried quite a few steakhouses in las vegas (ribeyes because i am obsessed) and none compare to mastro's. their appetizers and sides are wonderful too! i've tried their scallops which are soft like butter, <mark><mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> Tartare</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> (a must try), gorgonzola mac and cheese, <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, and the <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> (gotta have some veggies).\n\nwine: they have one of my favorite cabernets here that pairs perfectly with the ribeye, chateau st. jean. highly recommend with your meal if you're enjoying steak, not seafood.\n\ndessert: do the butter cake. comes with a heaping pile of homemade whipped cream. sweet, warm, and delicious!\n\ni love this restaurant. writing this review makes me want to go there this week. a perfect 5!",

            "one of the many indulgences of la vegas. mastro's is a well known stop for those looking to treat themselves. \nfood: we went as a group of 7 girls and all got steak with a variety of shared sides. i split a 16oz filet made medium (almost half the price it would cost to get an 8 oz filet on your own). it was everything i expected from a good steakhouse, well seasoned, tender, and perfectly cooked. its only dressing was a melting slice of butter on the top. the sides were all generally well made. the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> had real chunks of lobster it in, though, between the 7 of us, not everyone got a piece. the brussel sprouts and asparagus were cooked to just the right texture but there was nothing really special about them. the <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> was sweet and luxuriously smooth but needed a little more savory to balance it out. \nservice: the service was excellent. the server was very accommodating and attentive. a few of us ordered steaks to split and they plated them separately for us. we also brought in our own cake since we were celebrating a birthday. they served the caked and repacked the leftover cake for us to go. \nlocations: mastro's unique architecture has made it a near icon among the casinos on the strip. floating in the middle of crystals, it makes up a beautiful view and provides one. the decor is subdued in an elegant way and it generally draws a quieter crowd.    \nwhile mastro's wasn't a life changing dining experience, between the high class menu and eye catching locale, it certainly did not disappoint.", 
            "let's start with the service, absolutely exceptional!! we were greeted and welcomed by several staff members just entering the restaurant and walking to our table. our waiter was awesome and very attentive. now to the food. i ordered a rib eye and asked for it medium well (which has a little pink inside.) it came well done and i didn't have the heart to complain since it was a $59 steak and sending it back would mean they would have to make a whole new one. it was also pretty flavorless. boyfriend ordered lobster tail and in his exact words \"best lobster tail i've ever had.\" i'm glad he felt that way since the rest was just ok. our <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark> were very salty, but the <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> was pretty good. it was $200 for just the two of us.", 
            "best restaurant in the entire world! its a hidden gem because its in a mall and less crowded than restaurants in casinos but dont let the crowd size fool you. ive been there probably 20 times and ive never had a bad anything. ive had everything on the menu because we often go to dinner with about 20 people so we order everything. great wines, really fresh seafood, but the side dishes and desserts is what really sets them apart from others. my fav sides are <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>, <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, gorgonzola mac n cheese and mushrooms. for desserts nothing is better than the butter cake and pecan pie. if youre not a fan of raspberry sauce like myself you can order the butter cake without the raspberry and its heavenly! its romantic enough for a date and trendy enough for dinner before going out with friends- like i said best restaurant in the entire world!"

            "on my third trip to vegas, my main priority was not to get sht-face wasted and it was not to shop until i dropped, but rather it was to eat in a treehouse. and that i did! i was sooo excited to try mastro's (mah-stro's or may-stro's?) after hearing ridiculously good things about this place. i made reservations online, and called ahead to request a seat in the treehouse. \n\nservice is impeccable here! everyone was super nice and friendly. we started with the lemon drop dry ice martini and it was possibly the coolest (pun intended) alcoholic drink i've ever had! the dry ice fizzles over the top and there is a mini tornado in your martini glass!! it tasted great as well! perfect blend of sweet and tart - with, of course, a kick of alcohol!\n\nto eat, i ordered the filet mignon and we split <mark>Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and <mark>Sauted Sugar Snap Peas</mark> as sides. my steak was perfectly cooked, silky and tender. the gnocchi and <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> took it over the top to glutton overload. those dishes are soooo richhhh and decadent and creammmyyy. yum. i definitely think i gained 10 pounds that night. \n\nbad for your waistline, bad for your wallet, but great for your taste buds!", 
            "we came here on a monday evening for a pharmaceutical lecture. we got escorted to the 2nd floor where we had our own private room. i had the grilled salmon and grilled chicken with mash potatoes, spinach, and sweet <mark>Sauted Sugar Snap Peas</mark>, cheesecake with fruit on the side and coffee and of course some some chardonnay to wash it all down. \n\n- great service! can't complain when you have 5 waiters giving you food all at the same time and always refilling my wine glass...hiccup! lol\n- salmon was very flaky! crispy on the outside and soft body texture inside. and i can say that for the chicken as well! it was delicious. rich seasoning!\n- the sides could have been better, but i didn't think it taste like prison food! haha. that's a bit harsh. \n- the cheesecake was superb! so smooth and creamy. i highly recommend a slice!\n- the men's bathroom looks like a women's bathroom! you have your own room. \n- can't speak for a dinner for 2 at this location, but great venue for a formal event.", 
            "5/5 stars\nservice: 5/5 stars\nsides: 4.5/5 stars\ndessert 4/5 stars\n\ni will do an update after our event in january. \n\nwow! carly and brandon were super accommodating and friendly! 5 stars just for their service. i flew into vegas for a day to do some menu tastings for an event in january, and they were super nice.\n\nsides:\ncreamed of corn: 5/5: dangerously creamy and delicious!\nmac and cheese: 4/5: not a fan of mac and cheese personally, but this was delicious\n<mark>Sauted Sugar Snap Peas</mark>: 5/5 so fresh--crunchy!\n<mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>: 5/5: ah, made to perfection--<mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark> is starting to become one of my favorite veggies if done correctly. \n\ndesserts\nbutter cake: 4/5: it was good, but not great. i guess i am more of a chocolate decadent dessert person.\n\nyes, this was food all for one person! thank you for a great time! can't wait to dine here in january! right after this menu tasting, i headed straight to dinner #2!", 
            "i've been fascinated by this \"tree house\" for the longest. this was my first time visiting mastro's and i had long heard of the famous warm butter cake, so i was excited to come for a pharm. rep dinner, get to learn and try a new place. \n\nwe made our selections from a pre-set menu.\n\nmy first course i went with the caeser salad, this was pretty standard except for the bits of anchovie throughout, which is my favorite kind of caeser. \n\nfor my entree i chose the 8oz filet. i asked for it to be prepared medium. what came out was between rare and tartare. since we were in a small private dining room for the lecture, i didn't feel comfortable sending my steak back, it would be disruptive, and i didn't want to interupt the lecturer. i ended up giving it to my friend to take home to her dogs.\n\nthe family style shared sides weren't impressive either. <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> had no flavor, and the <mark>Sauted Sugar Snap Peas</mark> as well. only one i liked was the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>. \n\ndessert we had a choice between chocolate sin cake and cheesecake. i went with the chocolate cake, it came with a side of homemade whipped cream which i thought was better than the cake itself. \n\npretty disappointing meal all together. i would come back for a second try, just not in a hurry to do so. i definitely enjoyed the lecture more than dinner.", 
            "i've been to this location before and as always, they are on point with their customer service. it's always great to see them work together as a unit and are attentive to the guests. the glasses are never empty, offering of seconds on drinks and breads are consistent. \n\nthe waiters are very knowledgeable of their products. they know exactly how the meals are prepared and the taste of each item on their menu. they also offer great advices on how to maximize the flavor and food experience. \n\nthe side dishes are large enough for a party of 4 and the main course itself are large enough to satisfy your hunger.\n\ni have to be honest, the last time i was here, i ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and i was underwhelmed by the preparation. with that said, i wanted to give another fish another try since they are after all, the \"ocean club\". i  ordered their feature of the day, the halibut which comes 3 ways: pan seared, cajun/creole rub, or breaded. with the suggestion from the waiter, i chose to go through the pan seared route. it was a good size fish, served with tartar sauce on the side. the fish was prepared nicely. it was flaky and juicy. however, again i was underwhelmed with the flavor. in my opinion, it was bland and flat. the tartar sauce didn't do anything as far as offering another dimension on flavor. \n\nmy friend ordered the lamb chop and he was not impressed either. it was prepared well, pink in the middle and tender but he said he was expecting more flavors.\n\nthe other friend ordered a tomahawk steak and it was big! he said it was good and flavorful. from the look of it, the meat was prepared well also. perfectly pink in the middle throughout. he said it was good but had better. \n\nmy bestie ordered a wedge salad (of all the great options...she gets a salad!). she said it wasn't impressive. just another wedge. although she did mentioned that she liked their blue cheese crumbles. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was very rich in flavor and had a lot of lobster chunks. i love a good <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark>...but the cream was a bit too rich. i wouldn't have been able to finish one by myself due to its richness, good thing it was split in half.  \n\nthe <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> were full of flavors and is extremely rich in butter and cream. it was served onto our plates by the host. the <mark>Sauted Sugar Snap Peas</mark> were very tasty and had the perfect crunch and bite to it. the fries were just fries. \n\nwe were all too full to order a big dessert, i really wanted to order their butter cake but couldn't bring myself to do it so we ordered the creme brulee. it was served with a big bowl of homemade whipped cream and was a good compliment to the dessert. the brulee was sweet and the cream was not which balanced out the flavors nicely.\n\noverall, it is a great experience but i don't know if i can justify eating the fish here.", 
            "located in the crystals shopping center next to aria. park at crystals valet if you aren't staying at the hotel. they have electric car charging. consistently delicious food every time we come. 5 stars for service, food, everything. try to get a table inside the treehouse. few of the items we ordered:\n\n<mark>Petite Filet</mark>: absolutely melt in your mouth delicious. \nheirloom tomato and burrata cheese: very good but pricey at $20.\nsea salt and <mark>Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries</mark>: addicting!\nalaskan halibut: hubby says was very good.\n<mark>Creamed Corn</mark> side: delish.\nsignature butter cake: so yummy!\n<mark>Sauted Sugar Snap Peas</mark> side: cooked perfect...super crunchy.\ntable bread and butter: even that was awesome!\n\nwould highly recommend and def be back, mastros!", 
            "i've been to the mastros and costa mesa, but this one in vegas probably has better customer service.\n\nthe food quality is the same, and tastes the same. they offer most of the same food items but for some reason vegas is a little cheaper. \n\nfor the appetizer i got the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> and the mastros cobb salad? i suggest ordering the salad as a half size the portion was huge even split between two people. the <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> was soooooo good! i didn't want to share, but i did. i'd definitely pick that over the salad any day. \nwe ordered a bottle of red wine...forgot the name but it was pretty reasonable for $45. \nfor the main course i got the bone in ribeye, <mark>Sauted Sugar Snap Peas</mark>, <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark>, saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms. all were really good! i was super full from drinking and our appitizers we had to make most of it back to our hotel. but the leftovers were still amazing as a late night snack. \ni suggest sitting in the \"tree house\" it seems a little more intimate than in the other section.\nlastly thy brought us out the better cake and oh my gosh! they did not have this option at the costa mesa one. this seriously was so good!"

            "so this is the 4th mastro's i have been to and i can't even count the number of times i have been to a mastro's. yet they never fail to prevail! i took my mother and 2 sisters here on a friday night when we were in vegas. i have never been to this one, but have been to the ocean club in scottsdale, city hall in scottsdale and the one in beverly hills. we got seated in the \"treehouse\" which is the big wooden circle that everyone takes pictures of when they are in crystal. we ordered a nice bottle of wine and my sister and i split the beefsteak tomato & mozz appetizer (i always get this when i am here) it is great because they split the order into two plates. my mother and older sister split the <mark>Ocean Club Salad</mark> and my mother could not stop talking about how great it was! i will admit we are all canadian so we are not used to the amazing portions of food they serve in america! it is great!!! i ordered my usual *massive* <mark>Chopped Salad</mark> with avocados and no meat/dressing on the side - it is my fav salad ever! younger sister ordered the <mark>Petite Filet</mark> 8oz which she loved and actually finished. older sister ordered something different - <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> sashimi 10oz, she was only able to finish half of it (i will add a picture soon b/c it is an unusual plate to order at mastro's) she said it was really tasty just a huge portion. my mother ordered the atlantic salmon filet 12oz, again very big but very good!!! of course we have to order sides! my fav <mark>Spinach <mark>Broccoli <mark>Asparagus - Steamed or Sauted</mark></mark></mark> mushrooms, steamed asparagus, and my sister's favourite gorgonzola mac'n'cheese. overall mastro's the my #1 fav restaurant and this new location in the city center is just as great as any other mastro's :)"

            "i love this place! \n\nmy boyfriend and i came here to celebrate our 6 months semi-anniversary and we certainly had a great time! the only down side is it burnt a hole in our wallet. but it is a special occasion and we both think it is worth it. \n\ni made a reservation on line at open table and i mentioned our occasion. when we were at the hostess stand, we were greeted by our last name which really surprised me. we waited for about 2 min before we got seated in the tree house, just like how i requested in my reservation. our server came right away to take our drink orders and also gave us some recommendations. \n\nwe decided to go with the surf and turf they have which comes with a 3 pound <mark>Broiled Live Maine Lobster</mark> and steak of our choice. one thing about the meal here is that it does not come with any sides. you only get what you order. if you want to have mashed potatos or <mark>Colossal Onion Rings</mark>, you do have to order them seperately which again raises the cost. \n\nthe food came fairly fast after we ordered and the busser divided the meal for us right by the table. the lobster tasted great so did the steak! the server was telling us that they have a live fishtank in the back and all the lobsters they have came in daily directly from maine! you can't get anything fresher than that in vegas! the steak is flavorful and juicy. my boyfriend said it could be more tender. as for the side, we ordered <mark>Scalloped Potatoes</mark> and corossal <mark>Colossal Onion Rings</mark>. we both like the potatoes it was yummy but not too impressed by the <mark>Colossal Onion Rings</mark>, for some reason it tastes a bit soft. \n\nupon we were finishing up our meal, so stuffed at that point, our server actually surprised us with a complimentary desert for our celebration! what a nice gesture! so definitely put in the occasion if you are celebrating anything at mastro's! \n\nthe environment is elegant and classy with live performance. it is expensive but you definitely get what you pay for. we return on our next special occasion.", 
            "i have been here 2 times in the last year  the staff is freely and very attentive. this time we got to sit in the bird house which is really cool.  \n\nthe first time was great had the <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark>*24oz, <mark>Lobster Bisque</mark> soup & heirloom tomato & burrata, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark>, grilled asparagus but the best part was the dessert that mastro's signature warm butter cake is by far the best dessert you will every taste.  \n\nso on our second visit we wanted to see if they could repeat it.  again we got the <mark>Herb Roasted Chicken</mark>*24oz - it really is very good and enough for two to share.  we got the blue cheese wedge and the  for the sides this time we stuck to the same <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Creamed Corn</mark> but added the <mark>Colossal Onion Rings</mark> )which are fantastic) and the grilled <mark>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</mark>(i have to admit these were not bitter at all.)  then came the end that mastro's signature warm butter cake was even better then i remembered its so gooey it melts in your mouth, you have to have it warm because we have stopped by just got the cake to go and it was server cold s not the same.  \n\ni recommend to anyone weather you live in vegas or visiting try this place you will not be disappointed.", 
            "gosh this structure sure is beautiful in the middle of the mall at aria.  i was in las vegas on a double date with my neighbor and his girlfriend for my partner's birthday.  at the tail end of our trip we had reservations for mastro's ocean club.  it was pretty grand, let me tell you.\n\nthe service is simply superior.  you're not going to get a higher class feeling, especially for being inside a mall.\n\nwe had the <mark>Lobster <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark></mark> and <mark>Colossal Onion Rings</mark> for the table (the <mark>Colossal Onion Rings</mark> were amazing), and we each ordered a different drink (personally, i ordered dragon fire, which was tequila with all sorts of sweets and a jalapeno topping).  \n\nour main meals were all impressive in their own ways.  i ordered the lamb, which was simple and delicious.  my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon, which was cooked to his perfection and would've rated this place 5 starts.  my neighbor ordered the ribeye, and was displeased with the outcome.  my neighbor ordered medium rare for his ribeye, and my partner ordered medium-well for his filet mignon (because he will never eat bloody meat), and my neighbor's ribeye was much more well cooked than the filet mignon.  my neighbor's experience was lackluster, but trust me, had my neighbor said something to the server immediately it would've been fixed asap.  my neighbor didn't want to make a big deal, so he just said something at the end of the meal that it was okay, and he ate it, but he wasn't happy with it because of how well it was done.  the server was very apologetic and took the ribeye off our bill.  his girlfriend had the mussels, and she thought they were good but wasn't floored by the textxure.\n\nmastro's was great, but this is definitely one of the restaurants i go to once because i don't want to have another meal while watching ostentatious women picking out what they want at balenciaga across the way with a perfect view.  it was annoying."
