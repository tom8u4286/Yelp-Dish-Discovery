            "first of all, this buffet has been revamped as of early 2013, so don't let the ratings fool you. they've added two new stations: <mark>Fish Market</mark> and latin to bring a total of 11 stations. of course, it's always a wiser choice to eat buffets during lunch on a weekday, and it's even better when your mom has free passes because she likes to gamble. but if i had to pay that day, it would have been $22.99 for a friday lunch buffet. i really didn't think this buffet was that far off from bacchanal at caesar's palace. i paid over $50, albeit dinner, for bacchanal a few months ago, and i left just as satisfied.\n\ntheir asian section is not as good as bacchanal's, but they do have a few dim sum goodies. i was surprised that their chicken & waffles were really good. waffles were moist and the chicken was tender and juicy. another surprise i found were dried mangoes in their cheese section. i've never seen dried mango at a buffet before, and you can bet i snagged a few in my purse for the road. dried mangoes - my weakness. they also had really fresh smoked salmon, which i made a lox bagel with their assortment of cream cheese. \n\ndessert was amazing, although i am biased because i have a sweet tooth. i pretty much love all pastries. on average, i spend close to half my time at the dessert bar, unless it's just terrible. the dessert bar here is comparable to bacchanal's. they had a large assortment of pastries from chocolate and almond croissants, to blueberry crumble muffins. their coconut macaroons were so moist and decadent. the only disappointing thing would be their ice cream. they have a good variety, but it just didn't taste very creamy. it was a bit puffy, like a little too airy or something. overall, i really liked this buffet and would recommend this over bacchanal; it's just a better deal.", 
            "oh man, where to start this sad story? the only thing worth mentioning are the dumplings in the asian station everything else was lack luster. the fried rice tasted more like paella than fried rice and the noodle soup might as well been a carnival game since there was no way to get any noodles in your bowl. \n\nthe carving station offered a brisket that could have only been prepared by a rookie since it had no smoke ring and was as tough as a rubber sole. \n\nstay clear of the latin station everything was over cooked. \n\ndidn't try the <mark>Fish Market</mark> but seeing crawfish on ice told me everything i need to know. \n\ndesserts were good.", 
            "last week i sampled the buffets at both aria and bellagio. i'm sure some will disagree, but after trying both, i'd opt for aria. and i generally hate buffets.\n\nvariety was pretty good at both, but i thought on the whole the food at aria was much better for just about everything. i tried a lot of different flavors, mediterranean, latin, tandoori, italian, asian. everything was really tasty here. their <mark>Fish Market</mark> had some really outstanding whitefish. \n\nthe only thing i came away a bit disappointed with was the asian. i was really looking forward to this, but they came up short here. generally bland dim sum, rice and stir fry. they need to do a little work on this part of the world, but even so, i think i'd go back for lunch.", 
            "the amount of options here is truly diverse\n\nsome of the featured items are;\n\n<mark>Fish Market</mark> - loved the unlimited crab. certainly a favorite with my fam.\nasian - they had a really tasty chicken and broccoli dish i tried.\nitalian -didn't try their made-to-order pasta section but glad they had the option.\npizza - gluten free pizza dough available!\nmediterranean - the hummus in this section was basic  nothing really fancy. \ntandoori -naan was decent\nand a host of other stations i didn't try like latin ,carvery,and a diner section with burgers. \n\ni did like the breakfast items such as the hash browns. i did find a hair in my food so that wasn't appealing. \n\nthey are sort of expensive especially during the holidays. regularly brunch is $29.99 but during the holidays its $34.99 and they don't even offer any holiday-ish items....\nthe aria is a nice hotel and the buffet was clean and loads of options. if it wasn't for the hair in the food then it would be 4 stars. ..", 
            "great service great food!  one of the best buffets in vegas not to busy on a wednesday night! <mark>Fish Market</mark> had great snow crab. the salad is fresh and i loved the kale and cranberry section! all you can drink for 13.00$ great deal! a+", 
            "riesen auswahl,  <mark>Fish Market</mark>,  asiatisch,  italienisch,  mexikanisch etc . f\\u00fcr 38 dollar sich quer \\u00fcber den planeten essen zu sehr guter qualit\\u00e4t.  f\\u00fcr jeden was dabei.  super empfehlenswert f\\u00fcr ein gelungenes brunch in kantinen charme.  jedesmal ein muss f\\u00fcr mich wenn ich in vegas bin.", 
            "always friendly staff and clean environment,however; the food slightly questionable. sadly, i didn't try the <mark>Fish Market</mark> but, i tried everything else. fresh ingredients over at the salad bar. some of the food was lacking but, there were some tasty food within the mix. pace yourself there's definitely a large variety of food.", 
            "dear aria buffet: you ruined father's day for us.\n\ni took my husband here for father's day because he wanted to try this place out - this buffet ruined our holiday, single handed. as an avid buffet adventurer, i have been to 90% of the buffets offered on the strip - and, congratulations, you are by far the worst one yet. before you start defending your so-called gourmet delicacies, i'd like to say that i am not a buffet expert, a chef, or anyone who knows culinary art. however, i have eaten at a lot of buffets, more than i care to count, mainly because i enjoy variety in my food and the endless possibilities, and i'd like to think that i have at least somewhat of an idea of what food is supposed to taste like. but, let me make my case:\n\n1. the food..mediocre, at best. for a very expensive buffet ($50/person), it lacked everything that an expensive buffet had. let me start with the selection - limited, bland, and everything was just all wrong. \nasian - they had vegetable dumplings, vegetable potstickers, vegetable everything (more on veggies later). there were only 2 choices of soup there, fried rice, chow mein, and crab legs. italian - spaghetti, some kind of veggies (again), veggie lasagna, a bowl of banana chips and a bowl of cranberries (wtf?). \ncarving station - meats were cold...they just sat there under a heat lamp, but once it hit your plate, it went cold quick. \ntandoori - i'm sorry, i'm not indian, but i swear the \"tandoori chicken\" looks/tasted exactly like baked chicken. not sure why they even tried to pass that off as anything tandoori. the rest of the curry tasted like melted mustard.\ndeli - didn't even try this station, it just looked like a large collection of lunchables meats and cheese. \n<mark>Fish Market</mark> (seafood station) - the station was full of duplicate foods just too make it look like it was filled. two buckets of crab legs, 2 buckets of crawfish, 2 buckets of mussels, and 1 bucket of oysters. the oysters looked like they were picked from the bottom of the reject buckets from other, better, buffets. the oysters were stale tasting, and they sat in a pile on the ice...the ones on top were warm and the ones on bottom were still frozen. pretty sure they're not supposed to be like that at all - something about food regulations, i'm sure. \ndessert - this is by far the only dessert station on the strip that pales in comparison to the dessert bar at my local 9.99 chinese buffet. the desserts aren't even made there - they came from a box, and all your \"chefs\" did was pull it out of the box and plop it on a plate. and seriously, who serves chocolate chip cookies and boxed pies? at a $50/person buffet? i expected this from the $9.99/person chinese buffet down the street from my house, but not from you, fancy-hotel&buffet-on-the-strip. i was really, really disappointed. \n\n2. did i mention the customer service? the \"chef\" at the seafood station was rude and nasty. i was standing next to a young girl waiting for the prawns. she obviously didn't know english because the chef asked what she wanted and she just pointed at the grill. he proceeded to yell at her at least a half dozen times with things like \"what?\" what do you want?\" \"you want one? two? what do you want???\" it got to the point that the girl hung her head down, shook her head and walked away. it was the worst type of customer service i had ever experienced. and this asshole of a chef just looked at me and asked me what i wanted, \"what you want?\" and i just walked away. it was despicable. the second instance of poor customer service was when i had to ask for a water refill...twice. on a day where the facility was not even half full...there were empty tables around us. why did i have to keep asking for water when we are literally 1 out of only 4 tables for you? seriously.\n\nto be quite frank, the food did not deserve the $110.00 i spent for my husband and i that day. what really made me bad was the poor customer service; i was embarrassed for the hotel more than anything. i work really hard for my money - and i don't mind paying a lot of money for good food (bacchanal's price is even lower than this dump) - but seriously, the food did not justify the price. furthermore, the customer service left a bad taste in my mouth. i have already started telling my friends, family, and co-workers not to waste their money on such a poor excuse of a \"buffet\" - you're better off sticking with your mom & pop chinese buffet down the street - you'll get the same food, but you'll save $40/per person.", 
            "five family members visited from orange county. nine of us including local friends came for our brunch. despite declaring that some 5 of us were senior citizens and four locals, we were pleasantly surprised our bill came to less than $300 including tax and required tip.\n\nit took a while for the servers to prepare a table for nine closer to the food service area. a female at table next to us was throwing up (perhaps, too much drinking) so we asked to move elsewhere. when the rest of our party arrived, we were all seated comfortably, hungry and ready to eat. ruby was our server. she and the rest of crew were kind, polite and attentive. best of all, the food selection was as good as can be from several food stations:\nthe stations within the buffet include:\n\n<mark>Fish Market</mark>: seafood, unlimited crab legs, fish & chips\n\nasian: dim sum, chinese, japanese and thai dishes\n\nitalian: pasta, cured meats, cheeses & mozzarella\n\npizza: new york style, gluten free & stromboli\n\nmediterranean: north africa and middle east selections\n\ntandoori: indian cuisine tandoor oven including naan, tandoori chicken, vegetables\n\nlatin: mexican, south american & spanish dishes\n\ncarving station: grilled, smoked & roasted meats, beef steamship, prime rib, turkey breast\n\ndiner: american comfort food like spiced meatloaf, chicken fried steak, grilled corn on the cobb and giant pancake\n\nsalad: choice of salad selections\n\nsweets: gelato selections, cookies, candies, cakes\n\nadd $12.99 for unlimited mimosas, bloody marys, sangria, cranberry spritzers, rum punch, champagne, premium beer and wine on tap.\n\naltogether a great place for family!"

            "my husband and i came for an early dinner (after work). the buffet looks really nice and seemed clean. so lets go blow by blow:\nprice: kinda expensive ($74 for 2)\nwaitress/server: rude as all hell! now, i suppose i wouldn't have been overly concerned with her jacked up attitude if she was that way with everyone but she absolutely wasn't. the white couple next to us got the pleasant voice and got checked on frequently...we were kind of left there like the red headed step-children. i am a firm believer of tipping ones wait staff (i usually drop 20% b/c i know these people work hard and that's how i show my gratitude) but she all the way killed it as soon as she opened her mouth. she had ample time while we were eating to redeem herself but she threw herself under the bus when she was only nice to one table and not the other. \nfood: literally half of what we ate was really good, the other half horrible. we made a point to try everything to get our $74 worth lol! the cheeses in the <mark>Italian</mark> section were ok, the mozzarella kinda melted and that made it taste weird. the roast beef seemed extra bloody. there was an open faced pork bun that tasted like sea water it was so damn salty. pesto, mexican section, seafood soup, seafood jambalaya, sushi, salad, beef brisket, mashed potatoes, both gravy's, banana in some butter sweet syrup, rice krispie treats, and ice cream were on point. everything else was over seasoned somehow including the king crab. meringue cookies tasted gross along with the coconut macaroons and the flan was somehow bland tasting. \nmanager: the manager stopped by our table and asked how everything was for us, we took that opportunity to let him know we were displeased with our server. he apologized for the experience and told us he would take this feedback and use it as a training tool. he was a very nice guy and i appreciate that he was checking up on folks and checking out the food area. \nhe seemed diligent about his work, i can respect that. sure enough as soon as he leaves, our server gives us the friendly voice and asked how we were doing...yea be nice in our last 5 minutes lady, sounds like a great idea =p \ncleanliness: my spoon was dirty...turn off in my book. the table was a bit sticky as well when we were seated. \noverall: the hotel area and the casino are very beautiful and full of abstract art pieces. as for the buffet, we won't be coming back...or taking people here; just a bit expensive for the quality of the food. i just hope my pregnant ass doesn't get some kind of stomach bacteria from the mozzerella being out in room temp for a long period of time. the little seafood cups should have been on ice as well but they weren't."

            "buffets can be horrifying, but this one kind of categorized itself to limit inundating the senses.  at 23.95, it is probably a bargain because of the seafood appetizers, which are featured first.  \nyou can't be shy here.  there was a mountain of crab legs, but i did my best to pry out my own hill, and get to work with the drawn butter, and jumbo shrimp.  good thing, because this was seriously the best part of the meal.  there was a spinach salad to accompany the crab, which i followed with a good chicken curry and garlic naan.  my carnivorous boyfriend did serious damage with a slab of prime rib, and had creamed spinach as a side dish.  <mark>Pizza</mark>, mexican food, and chinese food were also features, which could be good for kids.\ni did enjoy the miniature <mark>Salad</mark> in shot glasses, tomato and mozerella, and greens.  they were a great variation on the usual.  the tiny deserts were also appreciated, since we could try several, and enjoyed the creme brulee.  cookies rounded off the meal.\nthe ambience needs tuning.  i appreciate mid-century modern, and while it is sophisticated modern minimalism in the shopping, and casino areas of aria, it does take on a done to death cafeteria patina in the buffet.\nall-in-all, worth the money, but not memorable.", 
            "since i spent my last trip in vegas staying at the aria, i figured i might as well check out their buffet for dinner one night.  overall, there is not much to say- it was a good buffet, but for vegas it seemed pretty standard and was nothing special (note: i did go on a monday night and have heard that weekends might be better).\n\nfor the most part, the food i had was good.  i spent most of my time downing roast beef, shrimp, and snow crab legs.  i also tried a variety of pastas, <mark>Pizza</mark> and other dishes.  but again, although all of it was good and tasty, none of it was special enough to say it was really amazing.  \n\non the service side of things, the wait staff was a little slow at first, but as the meal went on it seemed to pick up a bit, so i'm not sure there's really anything to complain about.\n\nin essence, the aria buffet was simply unremarkable.  i don't really have anything bad to say, but i don't really have anything good to say either.  in vegas, i would expect better.", 
            "wth. for being in such a nice hotel, you'd expect the buffet to be just as opulent. but, it's like some random buffet.\nin fact, for the price you pay, i'd rather go to \"those\" kinda buffets for half the price....at least, you're not expecting much.\n\ni went for brunch. and maybe, i'm an idiot but, they should serve brunch. all the brunch i really saw was the breakfast foods, eggs benedict, and mimosas.\n\nthe chinese food was horrible. might as well go to panda express but, the difference is panda's beef broccoli tastes good. the broccoli wasn't fully cooked and the beef was cooked too much....practically fried.\n\nsushi sucked. although what can you really expect from buffet sushi, right. \npizza sucked. i'd rather have those frozen <mark>Pizza</mark> you make at home!\n\neven the desert bar wasn't too crackin'...i mean, you have all the flavors of ice cream/yogurt/whatevs but, chocolate. ughhh, fail. you gotta have chocolate...it's a staple!\n\ni normally take pics of the food for the sake of my yelp...but, this wasn't worth the time.", 
            "my heart longs for king crab legs!!!  make sure to get a full plate of legs, then ask the worker behind the counter (there's usually 1-2 workers behind each station) to steam it.  the crab legs come out fresh and hot!!  i love that they make it really easy to eat so you don't have to work on getting the meat out.\n\nthey have a nice variety of food there, from asian (noodles was bomb), italian (pastas and <mark>Pizza</mark>), to meat (lamb and roast beef?), soups, and a nice selection of desserts.  all for about $30-something per person.\n\ni like the atmosphere.  everything is very open, very clean and comfortable.  its not too noisy like other buffets in vegas.\n\ni was a little sad that i didn't get a chance to eat on friday-saturday, because there's a lobster special on those days.  its a little more, but one day i will try it.", 
            "i was between giving this 3 or 4 starts, and settled on 4, just because i love desserts. that being said, here's the low-down.\n\nfood:\n+excellent variety of foods. you got your <mark>Pizza</mark> (i wanted to try the margherita pizza, but no room!), your indian foods (tandoori chicken and curry and basmati rice and such), your chinese foods(which i think were done quite well! i guiltily enjoyed my chow fun and friend rice, even knowing how cheaply filling they were), little noodle cups(the green tea soba noodles with peanut chicken was my fave), sushi(not an awesome selection, but it's there), sliced and carved meats, king and snow crab legs already sliced in their shell(though they were just average), a selection of cold meats and cheeses, etc...\n+desserts. i have an insatiable sweet tooth, so this really was the cherry on the cake for me. the chocolate-covered puff cereal/marshmallow clusters were simple and delicious, the creme brulee wasn't fancy but i still loved me some runny custard, and the grand marnier creme puff was beautifully decorated and awesomely edible, every part. what else...they had bananas foster, fancy schmancy whoopie pies, blondies, cobblers, cheesecakes...soooo many options!\n+free red wine? i think i heard that right. it was offered to me, but i declined, so i can't say much about that.\n\nservice:\n-not great. sat there for a little while after we were seated, and no one came so we just went to get our food. we were probably halfway through our first plates when we finally got our waters.\n\nother:\n+/- they automatically bring lobster to your table, even if you don't ask for it. good if you like lobster(it's nothing exceptional, though. i found it to be dry, but not terrible), bad if you're already full by that time or not a lobster fan and then you feel sorry letting lobster go to waste.\n- plan to get there a little early if you think you'll be hungry. this is not a walk-up-and-get-your-food buffet. there is a line, and you wait to be seated. they will also seat people who are behind you in line if they have tables for parties of that size.\n- $40 a person. in this case, buffet != cheap eats. i think the variety of food offered made it worth the price, but just be aware of this going in.\n\noverall:\nexpensive but probably justifiably so. service not great. variety was awesome, but quality of food varied. not all great, but there were some gems in there, and if you're a foodie, it's pretty fun to try everything and find some delicious stuff.", 
            "as beautiful as aria is, the buffet lived up to the aesthetics. we ended up eating at the aria buffet for lunch the day we landed in vegas, with anticipation to eat at the bellagio buffet the following day. i was blow away by the selection at aria. on any given day you can find, at least five types of dim-sum, fried rice, lo mein,  general tso chicken, assortment of sushi, piles of snow crab legs (already split for convenience), steamed crawfish, assortment of <mark>Pizza</mark>, indian food, israeli type mezze, a carving station, and finally a selection of comfort food. \n\nwe were pleasantly overwhelmed with all the options, considering it was only lunch. quite a few items are still a bit bland and will need salt, but that is typical with a buffet and hoping to satisfy many palettes. i think the lunch buffet was around $26 (plus tax/tip), which i made up for with just the crab legs i ate. i kept flocking to the chicken shumai dim sum and shrimp dumplings. the curry chicken and tabouleh were also surprisingly good, but these items won't always be available. i completely over looked the soups, but i was informed there was also lobster bisque. \n\nmy only complaint is that the cashier wanted 18% gratuity for our party of 8 to sit together, which perhaps we should have just paid. i thoroughly enjoyed my meal at aria buffet, which had a shorter line and was miles better than bellagio's rendering. eat here, especially if you're hungover.", 
            "i ate here for lunch today.  24 bucks, including my iced teas.  for unlimited beer or wine, it would have cost 12.99.  let's see, the salad items were very good.  great quinoa salad, antipasto items including mozzarella balls, prosciutto.  some sushi rolls also.\nthen i moved onto the seafood items.  the king crab legs obviously frozen, boiled shrimp, and even crawfish.  they did have a nice selection of mussels, seafood stew, and chowders.\nlots of hot items, <mark>Pizza</mark>, carving meats, some ok pasta dishes including butternut ravioli and veggie lasagna.  fair meatballs and broccoli rabe.\nthey had a middle eastern bar, including hummus and baba gannoush.\nthe chinese food was worse than chinese takeout at home.  dumplings looked mushy.\ndesserts were the best items.  bananas foster, gourmet cupcakes, pecan pie, flan.....all high quality. cookies, muffins, pastries as well\nso, if you are in the mood for a great big salad and great desserts, give it a try.  i paid 18 bucks for a mediocre salad at olives yesterday.  this a few bucks more, but much better value.", 
            "battle of the buffets! i came here saturday evening around 6pm and paid for the gourmet dinner ($39.99 plus tax). so, oh so many options...from the split crab legs to the mini <mark>Pizza</mark>...freshly carved brisket to the freshly made pasta selections...let's just say the best thing about the buffet is that no matter how much food you think you have on a plate, there will be someone that will have more.\n\ni mostly gravitated towards to the seafood but some of my other faves were on the dessert section...the mini triple chocolate cake pops and mocha flavored cupcakes were stand outs for me. they also had several varieties of pies and several flavors of ice cream/gelato available.\n\ndrink service was decent too. left the waitress a fiver since she was nice and pleasant."

            "this was probably one of my favorite buffets in vegas. the variety was large and the food was actually pretty yummy. you have a lot of different genres of food, asian, sea food, mediterranean, <mark>Latin</mark>, american and steaks. the dessert area had gelato looking ice cream, a little more ice cream texture. they also had pastries and cheesecakes. \n\nthe kids ate everything and i left satisfied and full. oh i can't forget this part - bottomless beer, mimosas and bloody mary's for $12.99 so so so worth it.", 
            "slow!slow!slow! i am a p<mark>Latin</mark> m-life member and there is a dedicated line for m-life guest. tonight wecwaited almost 15 minutes in this line because the cashier was doing whatever it was that she was doing! the regular line ended up calling me over after she saw how disgruntled i was from waiting in my line. it wasn't even but 2 guest ahead of me and that's the sad part! i guess i expected more because the name aria holds. i've been to this buffet at least 3-4 times and i can honestly say that it's never consistent! it really just depends on the visit. tonight i finally decided to go ahead and give my general consensus of what i think about this particular buffet. it's probably at the bottom of my top buffets and slowly moving off my top list completely!  to go to with the wynn being at the top followed by the cosmopolitains buffet. here's why.. i think that for $39.99 a person the quality of meats and seafood could've been much more better. i know they can do better because i've had better here! the crab legs have two different options.. both cold and hot.. neither one of them were worth my time or up to par for me tonight.. the warm ones barely had any crab meat inside and the cold ones had the worse \"fishy\" taste to them which in result turned me completely off! they market these \"endless\" crab legs all over the place like they are something to write home about..more like write home and tell them how worthless they are is more like it! i headed to the meat carving station and went with the beef ribs and the center island station was preparing sirloin steaks at your request. the ribs were so dry i had to soak them in bbq sauce to save the day. the steak was probably was the best part of my visit. i feel like there could've been more and for $86 and some change for two people i left with a bit of dissatisfaction that's for sure. took forever for refills on drinks! and to leave an even more bitter taste in my mouth i got home to only find out that the cashier over charged me for the buffet an additional $39.99 and although yes she reversed it she could've at least told me there was an error! i had to call the next morning the find out the explanation for this charge. manager explained she didn't see the charge but from what i explained she could only imagine that the cashier already reversed it and because it was the weekend i wouldn't see my money until monday..smh go figure! that's the slick behavior i dont like. watch your credit card statements would be my advice! on the bright side we walked over to see zarkana so if you see seeing the show this is an okay option to dine at last minute before the show..", 
            "i'm no newbie when it comes to vegas buffets - i've traversed caesar's buffet of buffets twice. but for me, aria's is the best! the day after i visited, i went to bacchanal for dinner and spent the whole time wishing it was half as good as aria\n\ni spent an embarrassing amount of time playing and accumu<mark>Latin</mark> reward points on the myvegas game so i redeemed some for a bogo offer on a breakfast or lunch buffet. \n\nmy boyfriend and i arrived around 10:15am on a thursday. there was about a 5 minute wait. we opted for the unlimited beverages - choices included beer, mimosas, bloody mary's, sangria, cranberry spritzer, etc. (much nicer than bacchanal, where i had to stick to one drink!). our waitress was super friendly (best service we had all trip) and most importantly, kept the drinks rolling!\n\nthere were a ton of choices for breakfast - traditional  options like eggs and bacon, assorted waffles , carved meats, congee, burritos, smoked salmon, made to order eggs benedict, omelette station, etc. \n\nwe must've timed it very well as lunch items came out soon after. lots of seafood options, including 2 types of mussels, crawfish, coconut shrimp, peel-and-eat shrimp, and fried fish. the best item, however, was the crab! i actually hate how some buffets split the legs and keep them chilled. here, you could get them whole and warm! they did score some of the harder pieces to crack, like the claw, which was much appreciated.\n\nafter all of that and a scoop of green tea gelato, i was a happy camper, ready to gamble my savings away. i'm really over the hype of vegas buffets, but i'll be sure to hit aria every time i visit!\n\npro tip: if you have a visa signature card and book your stay with aria, you can get free breakfast buffets for 2 every day"

            "just got back from vegas in which we stayed the last night at aria, so thought we would hit their breakfast buffet, thinking it would be on par with belligo and wynn. boy, were we wrong. ok, know it's only their second day in operation, but how can you screw up bacon and eggs? my wife and i were shown our table, and immediately went to get our food. the food area was quite long, but not a great selection. usually i walk and look at the food and figure out the few things that look best so i can fit them onto my plate, but here, it was a struggle to find enough things appealing enough to eat. their eggs benedict looked very weird; the eggs were freakishly white. hard to find just regular breakfast fare. there were two omelet stations with many people waiting at each ( you know a buffet is bad when people opt for the 'ol standby omelet) i got in line behind mr. picky who had to have a special egg white only omelet with veeeery light cheddar cheese and was also behind some punk kid who was eating off his plate in line. idiot. the chef manning the station seemed overwhelmed by the special order so i moved on. a huge slice of ham (not bad), some chinese egg concoction and a slice of pizza later i went back to eat. started eating and no server yet. half way through and still no server. finally when i was almost done, a server asked if i wanted anything to drink. i barely chocked out, \"orange juice\". finally, when i was on my second to last bite, my drink came, all six ounces of it. i asked for two more. \nfor 15 bucks, this should have been much better. i have gotten just a good breakfast at terribles for half the price. also, since this place should be one of the elite, what i found totally tacky was at each of the foods, instead of having a nice plaque with what the food is, it was written on the sneeze windows with grease pencil. totally lame. not sure if we would go back to eat here even if comped. perhaps their lunch and <mark>Dinner</mark> are better.", 
            "the alaskan king crab legs were great this time.  they weren't frozen and salty like the time before.  the prime rib, however, was overcooked.  gotta thank the poker room for comped <mark>Dinner</mark>.", 
            "super inflated price ($45) for a sub par selection.!\n\ntime spent\n1 <mark>Dinner</mark> meal\n\nlayout\nspacious, comfy seating, upscale look.\n\nservice/food\nperhapes the smallest buffet selection i've ever had in my 4 years living in vegas.   there is nothing on the menu that you can't find with a larger selection at other buffets...   and the limit of one small lobster tail per customer to substantiate the inflated price is seriously insulting...   \n\nmy waitress was cheerful and attentive at least.^^\n\npricing\n$45 for a $15 meal...  aria, who's the marketing genius behind your buffet.?   drop the joke portion of lobster and double your buffet selection.    even the \"taste\" of the food items is average.\n\nclosing\nrationalize this...   you're competing against many other buffets and you want to stand out how.??", 
            "great buffet in vegas.  the best thing about this place is they give you king crab legs and they steam them up for you hot so you can eat lots of delicious crab meat....so good.  when i went, they gave you a free lobster and a glass of wine for every two <mark>Dinner</mark> purchased, and we didn't even get around to eating the lobsters!!\n\nthey have a good dessert selection (their apple pies were my favorite) and everything else was just ok.", 
            "i rate 5 of 5 stars to the buffet at the aria resort and casino. i have tried many of the buffets on the las vegas strip and only two meet my standard for 5 star buffets based on selection, food quality and presentation. the buffet offers a wide selection of reasonable foods to eat; i can honestly say that i'd eat every selection they offer. the food quality is high and attractive presentation.\n\nto be totally honest, the best buffet on the strip is at bellagio and the aria is a second placeholder. there are key differences: bellagio is vastly larger with double or triple the selections of aria. the downside is that bellagio buffet is always crowded with long lines (i've waited nearly an hour to get inside) while aria was quick to seat and quick to make your food choices. at bellagio buffet, expect to walk around alot to find what you want, at aria, the buffet is in a simple line; easy to find quick to grab food and chow-down.\n\nbottom line: i prefer aria's the buffet for its quick, easy, high quality meal. i have done several breakfasts and <mark>Dinner</mark> at the buffet.", 
            "the food here was all just okay. nothing tasted horrible but they didn't taste good either. i went on thursday so maybe the good chef works on friday or saturday when they have their gourmet <mark>Dinner</mark>. \n\ni would say the best item here was either the prime rib (for a buffet place, it's good) or else the cocktail shrimp. the sauce was perfect and not a skimpy shrimp and it was decorated very well. my favorite thing here was the desserts. the whooping pie was like a mousse filling with a soft chocolate cake around it.\n\nthe thing that saved our evening here, was our waiter was just awesome.", 
            "this review if for weekday lunch time for breakfast prices during march 2012.  \n\naria buffet is indeed overpriced, but it is good to come here right before 11am during the weekday to eat lunch for breakfast prices cause the breakfast price (~17) is too expensive for just breakfast food and the crabs and sushi comes out at 11am. \n\nthe good:  \nmodern chic design and clean interiors. \nthe sushi (salmon/tuna nigiri) and several rolls are actually decent quality for a buffet.  \nthe crabs are served cold, but you can hand your plate of crabs to a server behind the counter and they will steam it for you. \ngarlic naan bread and curry dishes over jasmine rice is very good.\ncuts of meats - prime rib, pork belly have always been good. \ndesserts - very good even though the selection may be small, i usually end up taking 3-4 cakes)\ncoffee is also quite good. \nthe line is usually shorter than most buffets. \n\nthe bad:\nway too expensive for lunch, <mark>Dinner</mark> and weekend brunch.  \ncashiers have always been quite rude.  \nselection is small and there are no unique entrees.", 
            "since i was staying in the hotel we had a $25 credit to use anywhere in the hotel. why not spend it on an expensive dinner. i came in a group of about 8 people. they ended up splitting us up almost across the buffet since we didn't want to pay an extra 18%. i can see maybe like the next table over or even across the section but whatever, they had their rules. \n\ni must say that the spread was one of the biggest i've seen. they literally had food from all over the world! french, mediterranean, italian, chinese, mexican... they had a salad area with different types of leaves and tons of toppings. a seafood bar with crab legs, ceviche, and oysters. but the best part of any buffet, the desserts! and boy was it pretty! they had this ice cream wheel, yes i know let me explain! think wheel of fortune but with flavors. pick your flavor and the lady scooping will spin the wheel until it comes to your ice cream. they also had mini cupcakes, whoppie pies, cake pops, and the regular stuff like cakes and cookies. \n\ni wouldnt say that the food was out of this world. frankly a lot of it just tasted like mass produced buffet food would. but the variety, cleanliness, and pleasant drink staff makes me want to come back. \n\ntwo adult <mark>Dinner</mark> came out to be about $85. if you want to add bottomless beer its and extra $12.", 
            "my boyfriend and i really liked this place that we ate here two days in a row during brunch. brunch over the weekends cost around $30.\n\non the first day we ate here, we got here just before <mark>Dinner</mark> but only paid for brunch and was able to enjoy some of the dinner foods they brought out.\ni was really craving some meat that day and got the prime rib. i was hugely disappointed to find that it was tough, overcooked and dry. \nmy favorite item was the smoked salmon. \nthe chicken sausage was also great; the frittata that comes in the mini cast iron skillet was okay but a bit salty. the mashed potato was plain. the eel sushi was good. my boyfriend was a huge fan of the crab legs. \ni didn't try any dessert due to a gluten allergy but my boyfriend liked the pistachio gelato.\nwhen dinner came around, we heard that they had lamb leg and i got a piece of that and was disappointed yet again; it too was tough, overcooked and dry.\ni also got some raw oysters which were pretty good. \n\nthe next day, the line was longer when we got there but it still moved relatively fast. i tried their scrambled eggs which were bomb-diggity. i got some more smoked salmon of course, as well as the chicken sausage. they also had some cooked veggies (zucchini, yellow squash and carrots) which were great. i tried one of their proscuitto and it tasted horrible. i think i remember telling my boyfriend it tasted like soap. it was so bad that i spit it out into a napkin. again, no dessert for me but my boyfriend liked the creme brulee. \n\noverall i really liked this buffet. one star docked off because of the disappointing meat and most of the items were okay, not great. but i'd still come back here if i'm ever back in vegas.", 
            "i went for <mark>Dinner</mark>, and it wasnt terrible, but it was nothing to write about. the \"big buffets\" (caesars, cosmopolitan etc) outshine this one, even the mgm is better in my opinion. however, it's not slop and it's vegas and it's a buffet, so three stars seems sufficient. plus, i love aria. so beautiful.", 
            "had a comp for 2 <mark>Dinner</mark> thanks to my vegas on facebook. i had high hopes because its aria...what a major let down. even at no out out of pocket cost other than tip, this place sucked. we got there fairly early for dinner and i was excited for a free yummy meal.....major disappointment. the pizza looked like it had sat out all day and when they finally put out a fresh one, the crust was limp and not cooked through. the brisket was dry and all the food i tried was under seasoned. ate at the bellagio buffet the night before an hour before closing and was worried the food would not be fresh...not the case...the best buffet food i've ever had....skip aria and hit up bellagio instead. you won't regret it.", 
            "spacious and overlooking the pool, should you decide to, aria's buffet is about as lavish as you can go without going overboard. exceptionally well-presented and prepaid, the mix runs from bean burritos to pizza to prime rib and a sushi selection rivaling any good restaurant. \n\nthe desserts are very good and handled by a cut-above of staffers. we spaced and timed our consuming to go back for several plates, shared a few things just to try them and had two hours of careful sampling. the big portions went to carved prime rib and the sushi, but not all at once. tip big; if you're half-smart, the casino will give it back and for our staffers, well-deserved.\n\noh? you didn't look for incentive programs to eat here on a two-for-one or comp? that one's on you. cut the cost to at least half and you've scored bragging rights. \n\nlas vegas fare runs from damn awful to sublime, so how you eat is on you: bad nutrition is plentiful; cheap chow and sloppy consumers are plentiful outside, so why not dress a bit nicer and enjoy the aria's crystal area? vegas top name places offer wonderful <mark>Dinner</mark> ad lunches that run from $16 hamburgers to $35 chicken. forgetpizza anywhere but chicago, that's a given. it's a getaway: get away from eating the same stuff that you went on vacation to escape.\n\nleave the goddamn kids at home; this is vegas and intended for adults, and the strip outside willgladly eat stupid tourists without a second thought. avoid most of the food out there. i recommend the buffet as an overview of cuisine... all well done.", 
            "$50 a person for this?? plus 18% gratuity for parties over 8. we saw our \"server\" twice. we had to chase people down to get our drinks. the food was mediocre at best, i've had better microwave tv <mark>Dinner</mark>.the only thing i enjoyed was the coffee at the end. \n\nif you're looking for a disappointing meal, try mcdonald's instead; at least you're only paying $6 for a bad meal instead of $50."

            "if you are staying at the hotel or in city center, then it's a \"maybe\". we were here for lunch. the shrimp cocktail and king crab legs were alright. the oysters were not fresh. the <mark>Salad</mark> were pretty good. there were some fresh melons, but the fresh fruits were hiding all the way around the corner by the desserts. all the meats were over cooked. the duck was extra salty. the desserts were probably the best. no need to make a special trip.", 
            "please tell me, you are not ready  to serve a full buffet yet !\nawesome architecture. people expect more than a prime rib and turkey roast.... please take a walk over to the wynn, you can use my $34.00 to buy a buffet with several entrees and hundred more combinations.  \ndesert menu is ok, but it doesn't make up for stale tomatoes in the <mark>Salad</mark>, they had a pickled taste !  complained to personnel, didn't even care.   if you are not ready, you should have opened in january.", 
            "i rarely eat dessert but ate at the aria buffet last night and was very impressed. they had something called an espresso shooter which was a combination of coffee mouse, gooey caramel and a little chocolate cookie. was absolutely delicious. the other desserts looked great as well. the food itself was quite good and i found all of the servers at each station to be very friendly. the lamb and the turkey were delicious and very fresh. the <mark>Salad</mark> just ok. the crab legs were excellent and i was surprisingly pleased with the pesto shrimp pizza. $30 per person and i believe it was worth every dollar.", 
            "totally not worth it for $30.  this is probably the saddest buffet i've been to in vegas and it's such a shame because the resort looks so nice! \n\ncame on a sunday night. no line.  restaurant was not full.  hostess sat us as far away from the buffet as possible! geez! we had to walk what felt like a block or two before reaching the food.\n\nyou know you're in for a disappointment when you ask what the buffet is known for and the hostess says \"well we have crab legs\".  errr...ok i hardly think that is something worth highlighting.  the crab legs were just ok.  a little too squishy and hard to get out of the shell.  the selection of the food was minimal.  several cuts of meat, some mediteranean, create your own pasta, <mark>Salad</mark>...really nothing spectacular.  the only dish my husband kept going back for was the spicy potatoes.\n\noverrall was a waste of money and my friends and i left stuffed but not satisfied.  we just ate to get our money's worth.  boo.", 
            "buffets can be horrifying, but this one kind of categorized itself to limit inundating the senses.  at 23.95, it is probably a bargain because of the seafood appetizers, which are featured first.  \nyou can't be shy here.  there was a mountain of crab legs, but i did my best to pry out my own hill, and get to work with the drawn butter, and jumbo shrimp.  good thing, because this was seriously the best part of the meal.  there was a spinach salad to accompany the crab, which i followed with a good chicken curry and garlic naan.  my carnivorous boyfriend did serious damage with a slab of prime rib, and had creamed spinach as a side dish.  <mark>Pizza</mark>, mexican food, and chinese food were also features, which could be good for kids.\ni did enjoy the miniature <mark>Salad</mark> in shot glasses, tomato and mozerella, and greens.  they were a great variation on the usual.  the tiny deserts were also appreciated, since we could try several, and enjoyed the creme brulee.  cookies rounded off the meal.\nthe ambience needs tuning.  i appreciate mid-century modern, and while it is sophisticated modern minimalism in the shopping, and casino areas of aria, it does take on a done to death cafeteria patina in the buffet.\nall-in-all, worth the money, but not memorable.", 
            "my wife and i have stopped eating at buffets because we no longer fill our plates and return 2, 3 or 4 times. so often, the price seems too high for the amount of food we end up eating and we don't like feeling stuffed. \n\nafter visiting the buffet at aria, we realized our approach was mistaken.   we paid our $29.99 per person and took the tour around a very well stocked buffet with foods of all kinds, including <mark>Salad</mark>, meats,  italian, chinese, indian, japanese, a very well stocked dessert bar and more. we carefully selected only small amounts of each food we sampled, which allowed us to try more foods without overeating.  what a wonderful surprise. all the foods were fresh and tasty. the prime rib was simply divine.  and the banana  foster dessert was addictive.  \n\nwe ended up enjoying a wide variety of foods, did not walk out stuffed, and - the best part - ended up paying much less than most of the other restaurants we visited on this trip. \n\nyes, we'll stop here again on our next trip.", 
            "i had a wonderful experience here. i had the brunch which was only 16 dollars! chacuterie and cheese was great, shrimp, breakfast items, <mark>Salad</mark> and dessert! all fantastic ;) plus it tasted great after a night of drinking", 
            "family reunion of 30 on a saturday night - and what a treat! wonderful wait team, wide selection of food, half a lobster and carafes of red or white wine included - all for under $50/per person including 18% gratuity & tax!\n\ni gorged on <mark>Salad</mark> and vegetables. it was tasty, if simple (ok, so they made money on me, but who cares) - great ambiance, service and food for the price.", 
            "so- so\n\n it's our first stay here at aria so the next thing to do would be to try the buffet. dinner price is usual around 40 bucks per person which includes half of a lobster lol. the buffet seemed to have 50% salad items. there's about over 10 kinds of <mark>Salad</mark> and not enough variety for other things. i guess the best way to get your money's worth is loading up with the crabs. the sushi is buffet quality,( not the greatest)  rice was a little hard but i am very much fond of the dessert counter. lots to choose from, but the best one would the banana cream pie. \n\ntip* i guess in any buffets here vegas come a little early and beat the crowd. preferably around 5:30- 7pm. who likes to wait in line when you're starving right?", 
            "what's up with all the 1-3 stars?? i loved this buffet. the setting is fresh clean, gorgeous. the split crab legs were a big draw but the sushi was spot on, fresh, delicious and beautifully displayed. i liked the <mark>Salad</mark> esp the potato and crisp coleslaw. garlic nan with tandoori chicken for lunch, where do you find that? 5-6 flavors of soft cookies, peanut butter blondies and over the top chocolate brownies. gelato or sorbet to cleanse your palate.. i've never found a group of yelpers more off target then in these reviews. they serve lunch till 4pm, that really worked for me. give this place a try, i doubt you'll be disappointed.", 
            "excellent buffet. my family and i went for the lobster/wine buffet on sunday night. got in with minimal waiting. i'm a red wine snob, so tried both red and white and opted for the chardonnay, as the malbec served was weaker in flavor. the lobster came quickly was served hot, tender and moist. the <mark>Salad</mark> were fantastic... watermelon with jicama, tomatoes with figs, marinated mushrooms with garlic & peppers, and a medley of olives, cornichons, garlic & rosemary. nice sushi selection for apps, but basic rolls, nothing unusual. massive amts of crab legs with fresh lemon and drawn butter. the asian green bean and beef entree was seasoned well and veggies crisp and flavorful. the lobster ravioli was delicious and very  gourmet. the tandoori chicken, naan and curry were great! the roasted veggies had pitty-pans (baby squash) which are pretty pricey at the market.the lamb was overcooked for my taste and difficult to get a rare slice. all in all very well done with minimal disappointments. not  a huge selection for dessert, but all we tried was light and tasty. service was ok... seemed understaffed for as pricey as it is! nice fresh and light decor and very clean. not your standard buffet fare, so important to go with an open mind willingness to try! i would definitely go again!", 
            "we were planning on going to wicked spoon again cause some people in our group had not been there, but we were out by aria so we just stopped there.  overall, i was pretty impressed and i wouldn't mind coming back.  however, it was a little bit of a pain getting there because it was such a walk\n\nservice:\nservice was really good, and the staff was very nice.  our whole group was pretty drunk and they were still very nice to us and explained all the stuff for the buffet.  at the table they were fast bringing more drinks and they were fast at taking away plates but were not always there and getting in your way\n\nvalue:\ni think the buffet was pretty good value at $35.  selection was more than bellagio, but the food itself was not quite as good.  about the same amount, maybe a little less selection than wicked spoon but there were different choices.  you get half a lobster per person too, but it wasn't really that big so i didn't think much of it, and i also am not a huge lobster person.  the thing that i think puts the aria up there is that you get unlimited merlot or chardonnay with dinner which is cool.  i am not a huge wine person, but free booze is free booze\n\nfood:\nthere was a large selection, and for the most part there was not anything i didn't like.  sushi was better than wicked spoon, but not as good as bellagio.  they had a cool little greek section which i really liked between the <mark>Salad</mark> lamb and other offerings.  the crab was really good (didn't taste like salt water, it actually tasted pretty good), the lobster was kinda rubbery and not too much flavor, but i always feel that lobster is like that which is why i am not a huge lobster fan as said earlier.  the shrimps by the crab with the shells still on were very good, along with the already prepared shrimp cocktales.  the pizza was decent, along with the fish and chips.  the only thing i don't think i liked was the baby back ribs.  they were just so fatty that it was not enjoyable to eat them.  dessert was a small section, but the choices all tasted pretty good, and they had butterfinger gelato which was absolutely amazing.\n\noverall, i would probably come back, but i wouldn't make it a priority as i love going to different buffets all the time", 
            "admittedly - i don't have much to say about the aria buffet.....even though i had much to *eat* from it.\ni guess that's really not fair.\nbecause it was good.\n\nfor under $30 for dinner, you have access to unlimited crab legs. both snow and king. that alone makes it worth it. i had four plates of it, and could have gone on but 1) exerted control; 2) decided that i was not a pig despite appearances; 3) wanted to have a taste of something else.\nthe meat carving section is impressive and offers prime rib, chicken, turkey, lamb and what not. i was not in a meat-y mood and just gave it a quick look but if you are a serious carnivore - that's your place.\n\nthe <mark>Salad</mark> are phenomenal. really.", 
            "after having experienced the carnival world buffet disaster the night before, we were a tad bit leary of buffets.......but, we had these complimentary passes to any mgm resort buffet, the aria being one of them, so we could not pass up a \"freebie.\"  four of us ate an $80 meal for free.  that's good enough for me.\n\ni was a bit leary also because i had read others' reviews, and i wasn't so sure it was going to be anything decent.  the rio's world buffet was decent enough (for what i wanted), but there was just so much other bs that it was pretty unenjoyable for us.  here, at the aria buffet, we were pleasantly surprised.  i pretty much got cold foods like various kinds of ceviche, sushi, thai <mark>Salad</mark>, cold, poached whitefish, salmon spread.  the ceviches, in particular, were quite tasty, if not spicy, but i really enjoyed them all.  i didn't participate in their halved, ready to eat crab legs.  i had enough the night before.  i also couldn't muster up the desire to eat hot foods, then ultimately stuffing myself......so i didn't.  plus, i had to save room for jean phillipe's pastries.....oh, hell yah !!!  that was a must.  unfortunately, for me, a pastry snob and baker in my own right, they were good, but they were not amazing.  sorry, but they weren't.  i tasted the banana caramel cake, and it was just banana cake.  couldn't taste caramel.  the apple rum raisin pie was overpowered by the rum flavored raisins......wasn't a fan.  the bread pudding was my favorite, that, i definitely liked.  i also tasted their strawberry gelato.......quite delicious and packing a strong strawberry punch.  the chocolate brownie was laced with too many walnuts......a turn-off for me.  the pecan bar was decent, but the cappuccino dollop didn't work with it.  here's the other thing.......downstairs from the buffet is an actual shop of jean phillipe's pastries, and those will dazzle your eyes.  those were amazing to look at, and while i didn't get to try any (too full !!!), i would like to think they were better than was presented upstairs at the buffet.  i'd like to know why all of those items were not offered at the buffet.  that was a bit disappointing to me.  that being said, all too many times we have all discovered the oh so great looking food item looks better than it tastes, so while i know to beware of the \"looks can be deceiving\" reality, i just don't know with the store displays...........those pastries are so impressive.\n\ni would go back to this buffet again......maybe when i'm in a mood to try hot foods, perhaps more room in my stomach.  however, i would probably hold out for the jean phillipe patisserie downstairs......gotta try some of those next time !!!!!  i think this place is 3.5 worthy, but all i can only select 3 on the scale.", 
            "we got a complimentary buffet pass so we decided to use it here since it was right next to vdara. let's just say i wasnt impressed with their selection at all. they seem to offer a nice greasy variety for breakfast and for lunch it was random. we must have walked several rounds around the buffet trying to figure out what we should eat not because we were overwhelmed with the selection but because i couldn't figure what to eat with some of the selections they offered. their mixed <mark>Salad</mark> were extremely soggy and flavorless so there goes my excuse for attempting to eat healthy. i think i would give their dinner buffet a try next time but skipping out on their brunch since the selection was not too impressive during our experience.", 
            "three stars guys?? really? are you guys buffet snobs and know of better ones and not telling me? because honestly, i eat, and i want to know. the m is on my list...any others? seriously, i only eat in vegas, so i need more to do.\n\nbut the aria buffet, compared to the other major casino's buffet along the strip is the best one that i've had - taking into account price and quality (better and cheaper than wynn). it was around $32 per person for dinner on a weeknight.\n\nthere's something nice about the fact that it's not just food piled on top of food, you know? because some buffets just do that. here's a bunch of food and it looks great for feasting with your eyes, but taste wise...eeeeeeeh.\n\naria's is clean and arranged in a way where food looks delicious (and sanitary), but not in the now go stuff yourself sort of way. though, okay, the crab legs are done as such, but did you guys see the chickens? lined up for you! the cocktail shrimp even comes in little glass cups - but only one to a glass (wish it was at least three).\n\nokay, and you know how vegas buffet sushi usually sucks? the rice is hard and cold (why would you even allow yourself to serve that?), the aria one is actually pretty decent. i actually contemplated getting more.\n\nthe <mark>Salad</mark> were creative tasted fresh. the build your own pasta was decent (if you want to try but save space for other buffet-type things, ask for half the usual amount). the seafood ravioli looks pretty average and gross, and i would have skipped it had the lady next to me not ooze about how good it was yesterday and just had to come back. so i tried it, and it actually tasted...fresh? not fresh out of ocean fresh, but it was good.\n\ni tried the indian. they had a nice (i believe) cantonese lady making the indian, so while one of the dishes was great and spicy (and completely unauthentic), the chick peas were watery. also, the garlic na'an, while delicious, did not have the consistency of na'an...more like the chinese/taiwanese green onion pancakes.\n\nand the dessert. *sigh* the best part. what an amazing presentation. i wanted to try all of it. i actually did get about 8 desserts (not exaggerating) for my table of 4, and i personally did major work on all of them. they're fantastic. great flavors, not too sweet, and not overly heavy. i love creme brulee and would always get it at buffets and order it at restaurants. until i found out how to make it. then i just realized it wasn't worth it. but somehow, the dessert masters at aria made it taste incredibly light for a creme brulee. my favorite, though, is the bread pudding. i just thought of it a few minutes ago, leading me to write this review. love it! the apple crumble was not my favorite. but what i appreciated was that you can taste the real honey they used in it (probably from france, because they provided a small jar of honey from france for our tea). you can easily remedy the over powering honey in the crumble with a scoop of gelato =)\n\nservice was a bit slow in the refilling of tea and picking plates up. understandably, we came in about 1.5 hours before the closed, but at the same time...=t",

            "this was located at the aria....i liked this buffet quite a bit. i am comparing this to other buffets i have had. we used to come to vegas for the fabulous buffets , 99 cent shrimp cocktails, and the free drinks on the tables. well at least the drinks are still \"theoretically free\"   haha. now no one comes just for the buffets ,but rather the 5 star chefs restaurants located in the many ritzy hotels!\n  ok every hotel has a buffet, some are really really big and others specialize in a few things like \"seafood\" or lobster .this buffet is not too big and offers a good selection of quality items. i don't need food from all over the world and a sample of every dish, however what i do want is quality dishes for what is put out. i found that the beef , prime rib, and the seafood (crab legs) were very good.  aria even had an omelet bar for breakfast... a real plus!  i did try a little spanish rice and some pasta.... just for a taste and they were good too. i always have a little vegetables, <mark>Salad</mark>, and various greens, and those were all quite exceptional. now don't expect to get some fantastic service besides a few big  drinks, it is well worth the brunch price......champagne doesn't hurt either", 
            "this is the second visit for me at this great buffet.  i came here with family on a saturday evening for dinner.  no wait at all to pay and be seated.  the food selections are great and always fresh.  i decided to try out the made to order pasta.  i had penne with pesto, spinach, and shrimp and it was delicious.  the crab legs were looking a lean but were still tasty.  our meals came with half a lobster tail per person but the lobster just tasted so-so.  they have a wide and diverse selection of foods such as asian, mediterranean, pizza, <mark>Salad</mark>, sushi (which was kinda meh), soups, fresh carved meats, and the crab and shrimp.  the prime rib was also excellent.  the creamy horseraddish was a little powerful but good.  and the desserts, oh how i love the desserts here! they have 5-6 different ice cream flavors to choose from.  the orange sherbet was yummy coupled with vanilla ice cream.  i also tried the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e, red velvet whoopee pie, strawberry cheesecake, bread pudding, and apple cobbler... all were tasty! \n\nthe server was kinda slow and it seemed like our table was covered with our used plates most ofvthe time.  it was pretty busy, so maybe they were short on staff that evening.  my family also really enjoyed themselves and the food here (their first time at aria).  highly recommend for tasty and fresh buffet eats =)", 
            "while the entire buffet scene in vegas have gone downhill over last few years, this one is especially bad.  \n\ni came here to try their sunday \"gourmet\" brunch.  its 32.95+ tax but the it was a huge disappointment!  in short, don't waste your money to come here.\n\nthe line was non existent when i came.  i felt it was not a good sign.  the foods were quite mediocre.  they have alot cutbacks for their brunch.  king crabs are gone, snow crabs instead (like wynn).  fyi, king crab only available on weekend dinner so i have been told. the quality of the crab is....crap.  soggy and soft.  lack of flavors.\n\nrest of the foods were non remarkable.  the presentations weren't good so did the taste of food.   dry steaks, dry <mark>Salad</mark>. horrible asian stations and their italian station didn't look too good either.\n\ntheir desserts are one of their best tasting station to save this review from having 1* only.  i like their cheese cakes and apple pie but rest of them are just ...blah.\n\nsave of your money and go somewhere else.  if you are on comp.  try to venture other a la carte dining options in this hotel or other mgm properties.", 
            "if i could review this place on the desserts alone it would be a hands-down 5-stars buffet, but desserts can only carry you so far.  and don't get me wrong, its not that the rest of the buffet isn't good, its just that the entrees are hit or miss, some great, but some are pretty mediocre and those waste valuable stomach real estate that you'll miss come dessert time.\n\nhere's a few pointers from this buffet expert:\n1. potstickers are great, rest of the asian hot dishes can be skipped.\n2. sushi is good, somehow the smoked salmon next to it isn't.\n3. carving station: the ham and turkey are the big winners, ro.ast beef leaves a lot to be desired\n4. skip the mexican section, surprisingly bland.\n5. no pizza if you are past puberty! except you may take a slice of the green pizza with the egg to satisfy your curiosity.\n6. crab legs are conveniently pre-cut, so its okay to load up on them since you won't be wasting time trying to crack them.\n7. <mark>Salad</mark> are for chicks.\n8. the desserts are served in tiny portions, that can only mean they intend for you to try as many of them as possible!",

(seriously?? that's all you can come up with?)\n\nitalian:  2 pasta dishes, a pasta bar, and 3 types of pizza.  wth?\n\nindian:  naan, paneer, bland and spice-less tandoori chicken, chicken curry.\n\ncarving station:  salmon, beef/pork ribs, lamb, prime rib\n\nchilled seafood:  king crab, jumbo shrimp.  \n\nthe only 2 things that i gave a star for was the desserts and the prime rib.  the food here was very bland, few choices, and way to expensive.  if you're paying close to $40 for a buffet, may i suggest:  wicked spoon or wynn's buffet. \n\ncome to think of it, i'm beginning to feel very upset now...how a buffet can be so bad in a 5 star hotel. argh!", 
            "any buffet that calls itself \"the buffet\" is either very comfortable with what it is (a buffet) or is trying to sound like \"the buffet\" (kind of like the pretentious alums of the ohio state). in the case of \"the buffet\" at aria, it is the more humble laidback version. the light, bright, and open atmosphere of the buffet and simple, yet delicious dishes means the buffet is a good choice when at the hotel, casino, or city center. this isn't really a buffet to go out of your way for in vegas, but is a nice option if you're already there.\n\nit's only $21 for lunch. if you want all-you-can-drink wine, then try the $37 dinner. the good stuff (aka gourmet with lobster) is only served friday and saturday dinner. if you are used to las vegas buffets, then the pile of crab legs, small selection of sushi, meats, pastas, and <mark>Salad</mark> will seem very familiar. nothing really stood out or sucked. i liked the pasta with alfredo sauce for some reason and a simple salad. maybe it was because we were towards the end of our stay. of course, desserts are a highlight of any vegas buffet and the same is true at aria with little cakes, pastries, and ice cream.",

            "i usually don't like going to buffet's anymore cuz i overindulge and end up feeling horrible about myself but this one actually felt pretty good afterwards. the buffet offered selections from hand tossed <mark>Salad</mark>, various types of breads and cheeses, fresh seafood, and different types of meat cooked in every way possible. it's really hard to describe the whole dining experience in detail because of the overwhelming choices at this buffet but one thing i can say is that aria did not spare on the quality of ingredients.\n\nhighlights of the meal:\ndiner- mac and cheese with truffles and the grilled cheese with tomato bisque\nseafood- alaskan king crab legs\npoultry: bbq braised pork \ndessert: lemon bar and the gelato!\n\nquite pricey compared to usual buffets at $45 per person for dinner but the two complementary meals for hotel guests make the bill a bit more reasonable. \n\nalso, if you're planning to come here for dinner i suggest you wait until around 6pm so that the leftovers from the lunch menu are already replaced by freshly cooked ones. my family and i went around 4:30pm so the sushi and seafood looked like they were out for a while. besides that, the food was delicious and the service excellent, so i give the restaurant 4 stars for giving us a great family dining experience.",

            "i have read some of the other reviews that rated this poorly and am a bit shocked. we went for lunch and for $65 including tax and tip for two, this is a great place to eat. to be clear, it is not the best food ever...it is a vegas buffet! there is tremendous variety of meats ( the fried chicken is awesome...crispy and spicy) <mark>Salad</mark>, indian...good nan, crab legs - pre split so you can eat lots and lots, shrimp, etc etc. there is chinese dumplings and rices, some meat and veg and sushi. of course there is lots of dessert - the sugar free strawberry sorbet is excellent. \n\nstaff was friendly and the entire surroundings were very clean. we are not buffet people, but felt that when in vegas....do a buffet. we were not disappointed. great value for the money and very competently and tasty food.", 
            "wonderful selection, and tasty food! traditional breakfast, itialian meats/cheeses, indian, asian, seafood, <mark>Salad</mark>, american and deserts. not as many gourmet options like other places, but still really delicious and i loved the selection! plus, like no waits, and cheaper than some other buffets.", 
            "on a whirlwind tour of buffets in las vegas, i came here this past weekend to try the brunch buffet on saturday.  there was about a fifteen minute wait at about 11 a.m., which i thought was a little surprising.  \n\nafter having gone to bachannal for dinner the night before, i wasn't sure my stomach would be able to handle another buffet, but i often think of brunch the way some people think about desserts - it deserves its own stomach!\n\nthere's a lot of selection here.  for $30 per person (and an additional $12 for bottomless drinks), i'd say it's a decent deal for a vegas buffet.  i skipped over most of the asian food since it looked mostly like reheated frozen stuff and helped myself a lot of the other things.  there's too much to name, but let me hit some of the highlights:  amazing breakfast pizza, yummy pre-made waffles (with different fillings - try the banana), decent corned beef hash, your own made-to-order eggs benedict bar,  a variety of refreshing pre-made <mark>Salad</mark>, an interesting assortment of indian foods (including naan and curried veggies and meats), etc.  they also have a made-to-order eggs and omelette station.  the ham at the carving station was delicious - lean but tender and flavorful - they have prime rib too if that's your fancy.  in other words, there's something for everyone here!\n\nthere were some foods that weren't so great.  i felt like this was much more common in the dessert department.  for example, the donut that i had tasted crusty and dry, and a lot of their cakes tasted like they'd been sitting out for a while.  i probably wouldn't get an omelette again either - they're far too big and i don't like how they don't wrap the ingredients inside but instead intersperse them throughout the egg batter.\n\nservice:  can't compare to the service you get at bachannal.  they seem understaffed here (even though the restaurant wasn't at full capacity), and you have to exert some energy to flag someone down.\n\nbottom line:  a decent option for a brunch buffet in vegas.  i am realizing i forgot to try the gelato so next time...", 
            "went here for did-din with girls. the food was decent. skirt steak was slightly chewy, but shrimp and <mark>Salad</mark> were good. definitely bang for your buck.  i would come back just for deserts:)", 
            "our stay at the aria included credits at the resort restaurants, and after one of the worse flights to vegas i've experienced that left us both famished & nauseated, we decided to head downstairs and try the buffet. btw, i love how that whole the ohio state thing has become a contest to see which player went to the one & only douchebag university. i can't wait for the ivy league players to get into the mix.\n\nanyway, back to food: as with many buffets, you have to know what to select and what to avoid. unfortunately some of the most appealing-on-paper choices are also the worst here: the crab legs, the asian station, and the tandoori oven cooked naan bread should be avoided at all costs. what i personally liked the most were some of least popular options: the grilled vegetables, the quinoa and tabouli <mark>Salad</mark>. the prime rib and steamed clams in a tomato base were also good.\n\nmy wife got the surf & turf which was cold lobster paired with a quality rib eye in a bernaise sauce. however, the majority of things we tried here were just not up to snuff. the service was very friendly & efficient, and we never had to wait long for anything.\n\ndefinitely not worth the money, but the variety of options, pleasant setting and service make it a good option if you are staying here and want to eat asap.", 
            "this is my review for the breakfast buffet only.\n\n* price: $42 for 2 for breakfast.. not cheap but cheaper than jean phillips or any restaurants in this area. 4 star.\n\n* ambiance: clean, simple decor. farmer market feels. 4 star. \n\n* location:  on the promenade level, by the pool area. convenient to stop by here before or after hanging out at the pool. far away from the casino... so you don't have to eat with cigarette smokes. 4 star. \n\n* meals: fresh.  there are plenty of choices from bagels, oatmeals,  <mark>Salad</mark> to dim sum, roasted beef, omelet... there are a sort of pastries but not much of desert for breakfast.  food quality is good but not very exciting nor inventive like wicked spoon or the bellagio 's buffet.  4 star. \n\n* service: friendly waitress. 4 star.\n\nthus, it is averaged to 4 star based on my palms rating! \n \nwe did enjoy the seafood station with cocktail shrimps,  crawfish, crab legs, clams and muscles.  the sushi station is very simple with veggie rolls and spicy tuna rolls. dim sum is good with 3 to 4 items (sumai, bun and congee). there is a mediterranean and indian food sections which are also very simple and generic.\n\nwe did not go here for lunch nor dinner so could not comment on the other meal selections. \n\nwe probably would come back if staying at the aria since it is pretty good deal for the amount and variety of food.", 
            "i came here for dinner and i loved it! \nthey had awesome variety of <mark>Salad</mark> which was amazingly good! i ended up getting 2 plates of <mark>Salad</mark>! haha\nthe seafood section was also quite good. although it didn't have too many varieties but king crab, crawfish, mussels and shrimps were good enough! \ni also loved that they had so many kinds of dumplings! so yummm. \nthe best part of this buffet is the dessert section! \ni have particularly sweet tooth and it was a trip to heaven for me. \ntheir sugar free coconut cake was just melting in my mouth and the milk pudding(?) was just too good! ahhh i want some more now! haha \nthey had whole variety of gelato available but i couldn't eat no more! \nhad the most wonderful meal on my last day in vegas! woo hoo!!", 
            "so disappointed. in vegas last few days, wanted to do one nice buffet (without breaking the bank!). i did a lot of research on multiple sites. i was with 2 companions who are gluten free, so wanted to make sure that they had enough choices. many yelp (and other) reviews mentioned this buffet as one that had a lot of gf options; general consensus was that the food was good. neither was true.  \n\nfirst of all, if you're going within the next couple of weeks, beware - the price is not what's listed on the website, dinner mon-thurs $36.99.  yes, there's an asterisk that says that prices may vary during holiday weeks - maybe it was there last week and i just missed it, but i sure missed it. so it was quite a shock to hear that 3 buffets with the \"unlimited pour\" (alcohol) came to about $215. of course we could have left, but it was after 9:30 at night, we were very hungry, and my elderly relative just could not walk any more (you have to walk through what feels like a mile of aria to get to the buffet).  so okay, it will be our big splurge meal.\n\nwow, what a mistake.  there were a few items that were good, one or two that were okay, and quite a few that were not good at all. nothing outstanding.the service was good, our server was attentive and friendly, but it didn't come close to making up for the food.\n- beef (steamship) and shrimp were good\n- clams (tiny manila clams) were fine, mussels were not so good. crab legs were, well, buffet crab legs.\n- salad bar wasn't huge, but was fine. pre-made <mark>Salad</mark> looked great but were mostly pretty bad.\n- vegetables - tasteless\n- salmon and baked chicken - dry and tasteless\n- leg of lamb - grey and hard, not a great flavor\n- mashed potatoes - how do you mess up mashed potatoes? by putting in way too much salt (and we are a group that likes salt!); they also looked dried out, like they'd been sitting there all night\n- crawfish - horrible. inedible. i spit it out. \n- desserts: meh. nothing particularly great. creme brulee was okay. gelato was okay, but it's not self serve so you can't take tiny amounts of several to see what you like.\n- gluten free options: my mistake perhaps, but when i hear that a place has gluten free options i don't think that means they have rice and salad. of course those are gluten free, duh, but i expected more. there is gluten free pizza, if you ask for it; the pizza guy seemed quite taken aback by the request but made one for us. it was fine. woo hoo. gluten free desserts were gelato (some flavors, others had pretzels or cookies or whatever), creme brulee, and i think a chocolate mousse. that's it. we asked the lady serving gelato if any desserts were gluten free. she was clearly trying to help us but clearly english was not her first, second or any number language. her response was \"spoons on table.\" \n\noh well,  it was a fun trip anyway."
