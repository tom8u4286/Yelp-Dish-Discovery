            "i waiver between 4 and 5 stars on this. i'm at about a 3.5 to 4 for the peppermill restaurant and a solid 5 for the fireside lounge.\n\nlet's start with the fireside lounge. this is one of my favorite places in vegas. i've loved it since i first visited vegas years and years ago. it's one of the first places that springs to mind when i think of \"old vegas\". this little tucked away lounge is both classy and neon. it's both laid-back and fun. i can just picture any classic vegas star sitting on a couch here.\n\nthe fireside lounge is pretty small. when you walk into the peppermill, you'll see a small glass door off to your left labeled \"fireside lounge\". when you walk through it, you'll see lots of blues, pinks, and greens, bits of neon, mirrors, and plenty of fake plants and trees. but it so works, it feels classy - old vegas classy.\n\nto your right is a small, low bar with some video poker. to your left is a large indoor fire pit / flaming pool thing. around the indoor fire pit / flaming pool thing is a huge circle couch. around the rest of the room are smaller couches and some chairs - in an array of different sizes to accommodate just your size group. and the way it is all laid out, it is not too hard to find a private corner for some snuggling.\n\non corners around the room are tvs playing all sorts of music videos. sometimes it 80s hair bands, sometimes it's a live pearl jam show. it's different just about every time i go. and it's never too loud. it's just there in the background, providing ambiance and conversation starters.\n\nthe best part is that the cocktail waitresses wear long, black evening gowns. it just adds to the whole environment and experience. there's a decent cocktail list and bar snack menu. don't expect anything inventive here (though, they have been trying some new martinis). it's all classic and old-fashioned (and that is what is going to taste the best here). think mai tai and <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>.\n\ncombine all that with it being open-24 hours and you've got a must-do. it can be a romantic spot for couples and a chill spot for a group of guys or gals. and i've seen a few celebrities here too. not the type that host at pure, but the type that you might catch performing at the joint.\n\nand i have to add that the staff at the fireside are pretty open and willing to accommodate. my husband decided to surprise me with an elvis impersonator for my birthday, and he set it all up with fireside for this elvis to come in and sing to me. so yeah, fireside is totally a 5 star place.\n\nso on to the peppermill restaurant. sure, there are better 24 hour restaurants in vegas, but almost none with this kind of atmosphere. and the food is well above average. i can't say i've eaten here a lot, but the handful of times i have, i haven't had any complaints. \n\nthe portions are huge - so don't be afraid to share. my favorite menu items are actually the omelettes. they're huge and flavorful (no going stingy on the cheese and fillers here), and they just really hit the spot after a long night of drinking and gaming. 3.5 stars for the food, but add 1/2 a star for the ambiance.\n\nthe peppermill restaurant and fireside lounge are novelty vegas places not to be missed.", 
            "i spent nearly 13 dollars on a teeny tiny wimpy <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>. the drinks in the lounge were over priced and the bartender had an attitude. the decor is from the 70's and unappealing. i dont see what all the hype is about.", 
            "for the all week celebration of a good friends going away, we decided to meet at the fireside lounge for drinks and appetizers at happy hour.  this place is a las vegas icon.  over the years, many celebrities have frequented the location, including elvis.  i'm glad that i've visited this place more than once.  \n\nto be honest, though, the look of the place is drab and not really upscale.  the lounge looks like an 80's porn star man cave.  full of mirrors, blue and purple low dim lighting, a fire pit in the middle of the lounge.  thank goodness it's a historic location of las vegas.  \n\nmy drinks were about $5-$10, including beer and vodka sodas.  for the appetizers, we got a crap load.  i'll just list them and give a little bit of my opinion:\n\n-<mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> for $12.95:  nothing glamorous, cocktail sauce is tangy, lots of shrimp given.\n\n-<mark>Chicken Quesadilla</mark> for $11.50:  served with pico de gallo and sour cream.  your standard quesadilla, again nothing stand out!\n\n-chicken nachos for $16.25:  lots of items.  this was a huge plate but the cheese hardened quickly.  sides included jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, onions and black olives.\n\n-bruschetta for $8.25:  tomatoes, basil, garlic, onions, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese, served on toasted herb focaccia bread.  this was actually flavorful and moist.  one of my favorites!\n\n-<mark>Chicken Fingers</mark> for $10.25:  your standard pub fingers.  kind of dry.\n\n-caprese salad for $8.95:  sliced tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and drizzled with balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil.  the slices were thick and grouped together, it was delicious!\n\ni know i'm missing some of the items but we literally got a few of each of these plates.  our group was pretty big!  at the end <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>, it was your standard pub food.  nothing that really blew me away.  i would go back because of the status of this historic icon.", 
            "today was the first time i have ever been to the peppermill and unfortunately i was very disappointed. especially because my friends talked so highly of this place.\n\nfirst we checked out the fireside lounge and it was happy hour. my friends and i ordered the famous scorpion drink and man it was super strong! for our appetizers we ordered <mark>Crab Cakes</mark>, <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> <mark>Icelandic Fish And Chips</mark> and salsa.  the <mark>Crab Cakes</mark> could have been better. to me there was really no flavor to them. \n\nafter hanging out in the fireside lounge we went over to grab something to eat for dinner. we got <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark>, <mark>New York Steak And Shrimp Scampi</mark> acapulco, and pork loin and eggs. my boyfriend and i were very disappointed with our food. my <mark>New York Steak And Shrimp Scampi</mark> wasn't good at all. so bland.\n\nall in all, i don't think i'll ever come back for the food but definitely for drinks and appetizers.", 
            "talk about blast from the past. neon lights, weird floral arrangements and fake trees. so awesome. such a great place to people watch after a long night out. \n\nwe arrived after midnight and this was actually our first stop out in vegas. we ordered a few drinks and appetizers. i had the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> which was really fresh and good with nice plump chilled shrimp. my husband ordered beer battered cheese sticks. they were crisp and fresh served with a side of marinara sauce.  \n\ni ordered the key lime pie martini, complete with a graham cracker rim. it was creamy, sweet and strong. loved it! my husband had a huge mai tai and i actually laughed at him when it came out because it was a giant girly drink. it was also very strong and good. \n\ni wish we could have ordered some of the breakfast items but i wasn't too hungry. i really loved the atmosphere and the very 80's vibe they have going on in here. such a fun place to dine and have drinks. our waiter jose was very attentive and nice. our cocktail waitress was also very patient as we were taking forever to decided on what to order. we were given plenty of space to enjoy ourselves and just enough service to fulfill our needs."

            "this is a throw-back for sure; but you couldn't ask for a better place just to hang out and chill.\n\ni have enjoyed this place both times i have been now including most recently when i was there solo.\n\nthe bartenders are efficient and friendly as is the wait staff.  the drinks are well made and the food (i had the <mark>Chicken Quesadilla</mark> on my recent visit.) is  really good.\n\nthe fire pit at fireside is pretty cool as are the comfy, curved bench/couch seating (with pillows).  it's a place you can really kick back and enjoy your evening.  you can just kick back relax, chill, and bask in the neon glow that is fireside.\n\nit is certainly a favorite stand-by to drop in every time i come into town now.",

            "been here a few times now. tried the happy hour <mark>Chicken Quesadilla</mark> and it wasn't that impressive. green peppers were located inside the tortilla, along with way too much chicken that wasn't that tasty at all. the salsa also had no flavor. not too bad on drink prices as it was about $5 for a can of guiness and $7 for a mixed drink. since this place is a vegas icon, it is worth stopping in to check out the firepits and some of their \"girly\" drinks are pretty famous as well. entrees are expensive and you can only get appetizers at the bar area. the deserts are not homemade, but the <mark>Carrot Cake</mark> was a decent rendition. worth the trip to see what life was like back in the vegas glory days (aka before the ferris wheels started arriving in town).", 
            "24 hour diner with classic 70's -80's? theme. portions are large and shareable for 2 people.\n\n<mark>Chicken Quesadilla</mark>: 6 pieces that comes with sour cream and salsa sauce. good! taste just like a <mark>Chicken Quesadilla</mark>. no complaints.\n\nhash browns: not as crispy as i wanted it to be. i wouldn't order it as a side next time.\n\ni wouldn't mind coming back here again to try some more dishes. the omelettes look really good.", 
            "not quite sure why this restaurant has so many stars.  it was just okay, nothing special...typical bar food.  i went with the <mark>Chicken Quesadilla</mark> and the hubby went with the <mark>Turkey Burger</mark>.  they were both alright.  i can't really complain, but i can't say i'd go back either.  good place to stop if you're starving and you enjoy the old school vegas vibe.", 
            "they do not accept reservations. we got on the list and somebody mentioned you can wait at the bar if over 18. so we went there (so 70s) sat and watched a game, tried the <mark>Chicken Quesadilla</mark> which was very good and a lot of chicken. best, one can hear the hosts announcements, so you don't miss out when they call your table.\n\nprofessional and good service, everything was smooth, its like a machine. food was good, i asked and was told they use for each omelette 8 - 10 eggs! that's insane!  the nachos can probably feed 5 persons, my <mark>Focaccia <mark>Pesto Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark> was not that big of a portion. was good. i would go back to the place."

            "two cliches apply to the peppermill: everything you've heard is true, and words can't describe it.\n\nthere's no way to fully descibe the decor of the restaurant & lounge. it's kind of a retro-futuristic 50s/80s neon hybrid. the pink is bubblegum hot, the blue is sky electric, the mirrored tiling and faux greenery add to the surreal atmosphere. recently several huge monitors were added to the entry/waiting area, and a widescreen travelogue of tableaus from around the world plays on them. a new one pops up every few minutes. times square, then tokyo, then whitewater rapids. it's like a postmodern vacation.\n\nthe lounge is built around a circular flame pool, but there is also grouped seating available. the bar offers traditional seating. be warned, the cocktails pictured on the cocktail menu are as large as they look. pace yourself!\n\nthe restaurant is mainly diner-style booths for seating, with counter service available if you'd like to get a look at what's going on in the kitchen. here even the menu is huge. i can recommend the old-fashioned belgian waffle, the western fruit plate, the <mark>Hamburger</mark>, and the <mark>Nachos Nachos Nachos</mark>. this is also the kind of restaurant where sometimes just dessert is enough: recently a friend ordered a sundae thinking she would get something simple and ended up with a dish almost as big as her head.\n\nthe prices look a little spendy, but when measured against portion size, they're a geat value for a strip experience like this. go, and be prepared to be tempted to buy a bag of pink & blue sparkly table sugar as a souvenir.", 
            "first time trying the place and it definitely will not be the last. huge portions of food. got a half order of <mark>Nachos Nachos Nachos</mark> and it was enough to feed me and my g/f for a few days. i ordered the gyros and my g/f ordered the philly both were good and better as leftovers. will be coming back to check out breakfast.",

            "quite a disappointing experience.\n\ni went last night with two of my girlfriends after dancing away at the rock in rio festival. one of my friends who is a born and raised las vegan said the peppermill is a vegas staple and we had to go because my other friend and i have never been. by the time we arrived it was around 2:30am. the restaurant was packed and there were at least three parties waiting ahead of us. we were starving so we asked if we could go into the lounge (located in a large room to the left of the main restaurant) and the hostess nodded, so we went and seated ourselves.\n\nthe ambiance is something else!! probably the only positive about this place. neon lights in a dark spacious room, with comfortable booths, a fountain, and surprisingly a lot of greenery. i felt like i was in a different decade.\n\nour female server seemed annoyed and wasn't the friendliest when she greeted us. i don't think she smiled once. we ordered a few beers and appetizers as we could only order from the app menu in the lounge which we didn't mind. we got a round of blue moons and ordered <mark>Crab Cakes</mark>, ground beef nachos, mozzarella sticks, and buffalo <mark>Hot Chicken Wings</mark>.\n\na different server came by and asked if we wanted to start a tab. we closed out since we were mainly hungry and were good on our beers. it didn't take too long for the food to come out (20 min?) and we were excited to chow down. \n\n- <mark>Crab Cakes</mark>; average, nothing special. i think we got 4 of them and they came with a creamy sauce \n- buffalo <mark>Hot Chicken Wings</mark>; lukewarm but the buffalo sauce was delicious! came with carrots and celery per usual\n- nachos; huge portion. had cheese, jalape\\u00f1os, black olives on top. the cheese was cold and dry. they gave us a separate bowl of beans and another of the ground beef. not sure why they wouldn't just top off the nachos with the two. also came with guac, pico, and sour cream. \n-  mozzarella sticks; the most disturbing part of my experience. i bit into the cold mozzarella stick and out came a long strand of lighter hair. i was grossed out but know that these things happen. when i reacted to this hair in my mouth, my other friend laughed and said the one she bit into earlier had a hair in it too but just took it out. hair in two mozzarella sticks out of five...?\n\nwe were having a fun night and didn't really want to take the effort to complain. the mozzarella sticks weren't good so if they offered to bring us a new batch, we would have declined. also, i don't believe a single server came by to our table after we paid for our tab and received our food. also not worth hunting down service.\n\nneedles to say the food and service here is poor in my opinion, however, the ambiance in the lounge is very neat. if i were to ever come back, i would probably go for a drink at the bar in the lounge just to enjoy the neon lights.", 
            "seating was very fast. parking lot was full and we watched four groups enter as we approached the door.  hostess told us to wait 5 to 10 minutes but seated us in 2 minutes.  service was just as fast.\n\nportions are very large.  we had the fish & chips, pancake special, <mark>Hot Chicken Wings</mark> (20 pieces) and tropical fruit waffle.  fish was thick and crispy.  all of us ended-up getting a take-out box.  they also gave us some coffee to go.  \n\nvery nice wait staff and good food!",

            "the peppermill is great for families.\n\nthere aren't many places on the strip my wife and i like to bring the kids, but the peppermill is one place my wife and i like to bring the family for lunch that serves up great diner fare and tremendously big portions of classic vegas ambiance.\n\n(a note here about the fireside lounge. it's awesome, and if you're looking for a weird place for a drink that isn't in a casino, it's really a must-visit. fire pits and scorpion bowls. awesome. but keep in mind, adults only.)\n\nthe peppermill is a restaurant of all booths, and other than high-chairs and the chairs along the counter, there isn't a single free-standing chair in the whole place. vegas is all about making everyone feel special, and as everyone loves a booth, everyone gets one. and like i mentioned, they do provide the standard restaurant high-chairs that pull up to the end of the booth. all the tables are normal table height, so there's no problem accommodating very young eaters.\n\nthe menu is similar to the best of nyc diners. namely, there's almost anything on it, from eggs to fried chicken to steak to pancakes. as for the kids menu, it's small and very basic. there are <mark>Chicken Fingers</mark>, mac and cheese with fruit, grilled cheese, bacon and eggs, french toast and the very awesome pancake face. the prices are very reasonable (all the kids menu items are either $5.95 or $6.95) and if your child is older or more adventurous they can of course order from the complete adult menu. and don't forget, you're in vegas so the peppermill is open 24 hours, 7 days a week including all holidays. \n\nas for the service, here in las vegas we have pretty high standards, and in the seven years i've been going there i've never had anything but an outstanding waitress who has been super friendly to my kids.\n\nthe peppermill is the perfect combination of good food and outstanding vegas kitsch.", 
            "a friend recommended we try this place while in vegas and since it's open 24 hr and was right in front of our hotel we gave it a try. \n\nit was a monday night at 1:30am. the decor looked like prince threw up all over the restaurant. very cheesy n tacky not to mention old. we had 4 diff ppl ask if we wanted drinks. the hostess asked even before we could look at the menu. after we receive our drinks she tells us the credit card machine is broken and to pay w cash. ummm probably shouldve told us that before. but good thing i had cash which i usually don't. \n\nfood: how can u mess up <mark>Chicken Fingers</mark> and a house salad? for the prices they were charging for cafeteria food i expected them to get something right. besides taking forever to get our food. the lettuce in the salad was browning. and the ranch was running like it had been diluted with water. i don't know if u could call it a salad because it was just iceberg lettuce and croutons for 5.95. the <mark>Chicken Fingers</mark> were so hard they felt like biting into a brick. and their bbq sauce tasted like hotsauce and ketchup. \n\ni'm not digging the hooker attire of the staff either. i will most definitely stick to the restaurants at the hotels.",

            "for the all week celebration of a good friends going away, we decided to meet at the fireside lounge for drinks and appetizers at happy hour.  this place is a las vegas icon.  over the years, many celebrities have frequented the location, including elvis.  i'm glad that i've visited this place more than once.  \n\nto be honest, though, the look of the place is drab and not really upscale.  the lounge looks like an 80's porn star man cave.  full of mirrors, blue and purple low dim lighting, a fire pit in the middle of the lounge.  thank goodness it's a historic location of las vegas.  \n\nmy drinks were about $5-$10, including beer and vodka sodas.  for the appetizers, we got a crap load.  i'll just list them and give a little bit of my opinion:\n\n-<mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> for $12.95:  nothing glamorous, cocktail sauce is tangy, lots of shrimp given.\n\n-<mark>Chicken Quesadilla</mark> for $11.50:  served with pico de gallo and sour cream.  your standard quesadilla, again nothing stand out!\n\n-chicken nachos for $16.25:  lots of items.  this was a huge plate but the cheese hardened quickly.  sides included jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, onions and black olives.\n\n-bruschetta for $8.25:  tomatoes, basil, garlic, onions, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese, served on toasted herb focaccia bread.  this was actually flavorful and moist.  one of my favorites!\n\n-<mark>Chicken Fingers</mark> for $10.25:  your standard pub fingers.  kind of dry.\n\n-caprese salad for $8.95:  sliced tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and drizzled with balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil.  the slices were thick and grouped together, it was delicious!\n\ni know i'm missing some of the items but we literally got a few of each of these plates.  our group was pretty big!  at the end <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>, it was your standard pub food.  nothing that really blew me away.  i would go back because of the status of this historic icon.", 
            "was introduced to this place by a friend and we all decided to check it out as a group for brunch. \n\nupon stepping into the entrance, slot machines on the left are one of your first sights, very vegas indeed. the entire environment seemed to emit vegas-style retroness with fake indoor palm trees, colorful sugar, and a disco-like vibe.\n\nsince i knew the portions would be huge, my boyfriend and i decided to share a meal. we decided to order the chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> and eggs (that comes with hash browns). in addition, since it was the morning and it looked like every other table ordered some, my boyfriend decided to order a bloody mary to go along with the chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> and eggs. the cocktail waitress was very nice in explaining it to him since he didn't know how it worked. you actually get to choose the type of vodka you would like in it and they use their own secret list of spices to be included. as for it being brunch time, in vegas, you would have to be drinking every time <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>. \n\nmy cousin decided to order the <mark>Peppermill Sampler</mark> (golden fried shrimp, breaded <mark>Chicken Fingers</mark>, mozzarella sticks, bruschetta and batter dipped onion rings) for all of us to share. and that was the first thing that came out and man, did we have to share. the entire thing was huge. sadly, i was only able to try the mozzarella sticks (which were very warm and gooey inside with cheese after being dipped into marinara sauce--yummy!) and an onion ring (i've had better elsewhere). the rest i left to the others in my group to try. \n\nmy boyfriend's bloody mary came out next. being his first time, it wasn't bad. i tasted it as well and it did taste like v8 with a little bit of vodka with seasoning in it for better flavor. he actually finished the whole thing and was glad his first time was at peppermill. \n\nfinally, our main entree came out, the chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> and eggs (with hashbrowns). it was super crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside and with that gravy on top made it even that much savory. the hashbrowns also had a nice top crunch to it which i love. \n\noverall, we came out very stuffed. luckily, since we shared, we were able to eat all of the chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> and eggs. i wouldn't have been able to if i went into this as a lone person. \n\ngreat first time experience. i can't wait to see what else vegas has left for me.", 
            "love this place. extremely well priced and has a great menu that makes you feel very homey. i'm a kid at heart so it has great <mark>Chicken Fingers</mark> and nice french toast. love their cocktails as well they have a scorpion bowl that you might need a little help to polish off. great place for anyone looking for something simple but good.", 
            "this place is waaaaay over hyped! i found this place on yelp and decided to go on christmas day! we walked in and as expected, there was a long line to be seated. that was ok since it's christmas and there are a lot of big parties waiting to sit. but we finally get seated and the booth was nice and roomy and the decorations looked like something out of pulp fiction when they go to the diner with the cars, very colorful with trees inside the dining room and even colorful sugar on the table. we had 4 (yes i'm not exaggerating) ask for our drink order from the bar! i get it that's a money maker. we order a bloody marry and it arrives 5 min later. it was ok. nothing to write home about. \nour waiter comes over and introduces himself (really laying it on thick for the tip no less) and again i get it! it christmas and he's working so he might as well make money. but then he tells us to look over the menu and that hell be back in a few min! 20 min later after i've asked several of the bus boys to call over our waiter, he shows up and takes our order. i guess he could tell from my facial expression that i was pissed so he kept a smile on his face and took our orders fast. we order the appetizer sampler (fried shrimp, fried <mark>Chicken Fingers</mark>, onion rings, bruschetta, and cheese sticks), <mark>Tangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap</mark> and nachos. the sampler was decent, the wrap too but the nachos were awful! i huge plate full of chips, a little bit of semi melted cheese, raw onions and a lot of black olives emptied from a can right on too!!!! it was just awful (baja fresh and la salsa have way better nachos). \nit came with a side (small in comparison to how much chips was in the plate ) of sour cream and old (brown guacamole) for almost $16!!!!! \nso we ate a little bit of this and that just kind of picking on the plates and finally decided it was time to go! we asked for a few boxes and the check! the waiter comes back and is completely confused as to the drink we ordered. he kept asking us if we ordered a sunrise something and i kept telling him no! that all we ordered was the bloody marry and it was still on the table. he tried to help us pack the nachos and just broke the chips by pushing it down to try to make it fit. on our check we were charged for the sunrise something and i wanted to flag the guy down and tell him but my husband was so over it that we just paid and left!\n\nall in all, go here only if you're hungover, have the munchies or don't care at all what you put into your body! i can't for the life of me figure out all these good reviews. i'm usually very easy going but that was one of the most awful experiences in a restaurant /diner that i've had with both food and service. you're only paying for the decorations/ ambiance! \ndon't waste your time and money here. there was way better local places to try! the 2 stars are for the ambiance and cute colored sugar on the table! that's it!!! good luck!", 
            "what do you get when take a diner, a romantic lounge and circa 70s/80s vegas and mix it all together in a blender? the peppermill of course!\n\nthis is a place that serves as a fond memory from childhood from me. i remember going with my mom or my grandparents to meet up with my aunt when she worked at the stardust (now long gone). many times we would come here for breakfast. the stardust is a childhood memory that i feel was taken from me. but this place still remains.\n\nas an adult, i love the peppermill more than ever. price-wise, it isn't the cheapest. it's pretty much an upscale version of a diner though, so that can be forgiven, especially considering how large the portions are. last time i went, i had <mark>Chicken Fingers</mark> with fries. i received four <mark>Chicken Fingers</mark> and could only finish two of them before i was stuffed. and that was on the appetizer menu, mind you. i fondly remember the breakfast platters from when i was a kid, and while i haven't ordered one in a while, they always look like something to die for. memo: get one of those next time. \n\nanother thing i remember always being curious about as a kid was the lounge. i would stomp my feet, demanding to see it. everyone always talked about how beautiful it was and i was never allowed to check it out. wahh wahh wahh!!! haha. well, i'm legal now, and actually can spend time in there. and yes, it was worth the hype. it's intimate and quite lovely, albeit in the campiest way possible with the fake trees, gold barricades and 70s-style pink tube lighting. alas, even without a date it's worth it to spend an hour or two in there if only for the ambiance. don't worry, no one will look at you funny. \n\nthe peppermill is quite the oddity on the strip, a borderline mystery even. as it's immediate surroundings become increasingly desolate, not only does it continue to stand but every time you go in the place, it's still packed. you're lucky if you're even able to grab a seat at the diner. a strange happening indeed. not that i'm one to complain. \n\nthe final verdict\n\npros:\nvegas classic.\nretro vibe and feel.\nbeautiful lounge.\nhuge portions. \n\ncons:\nnot the cheapest food, but the portions make up for that.\nnot the cheapest drinks, but the ambiance makes up for that.\ncan feel a little bit campy, but it works.\n\nreturn factor: 10/10. i'm always down."

            "i had heard of this place from multiple people and then saw it on an episode of drinking made easy. so when my wife and i were in vegas, we decided to check out the fireside lounge. \n\nit's a dark little bar lit mostly with neon, there is their signature fire pit, a pool of water with fire bubbling out of it. instead of regular tables, they have cozy little couches you sit in either next to the fire (which was a little too warm for our tastes in july) or roomy booths you can sit in. the atmosphere reminded me of a mix between a hollywood portrayal of old school vegas and a strip club... but not in a bad way. we both found it very comfortable and relaxing. \n\nthe service was fantastic! we never went without drinks, the waitress would check on us even if she could see that we were still working on our drinks. she answered questions, was very personable and polite. this was some of the best service we had in vegas.\n\nwe wanted something light for lunch so we ordered the <mark>Crab Cakes</mark>. wow these were good! they where flaky, delicious and the sauce the drizzled on top complimented the crab flavor immensely! i would highly recommend giving them a try!\n\nwe had a couple of their specialty drinks. the blue hawaiian, which was our favorite. it was very good, and very blue! we also had the scorpion, which is best described as a fishbowl filled with alcohol and ice cream, it was good, but it took the two of us almost an hour to finish it and it was very filling. after we were done, we were in a little bit of misery until we could walk it off. \n\none of the neatest novelty things this bar has is the drink guns. they can push one button on the gun and it will automatically pour the drink. it gives consistency to their signature drinks so no matter who makes it; it will always be the same. it's just neat to watch it in action.", 
            "this place is a vegas landmark!!!!  great atmosphere and very clean for a 24 hr diner !!!!   5 stars on cleanliness!!!!  the <mark>Crab Cakes</mark> are a must try,  cuz they were the favorite on our order  !!!!!! we also had a burger and was done pefecrtly !!!  will come again to try breakfast items.", 
            "today was the first time i have ever been to the peppermill and unfortunately i was very disappointed. especially because my friends talked so highly of this place.\n\nfirst we checked out the fireside lounge and it was happy hour. my friends and i ordered the famous scorpion drink and man it was super strong! for our appetizers we ordered <mark>Crab Cakes</mark>, <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> <mark>Icelandic Fish And Chips</mark> and salsa.  the <mark>Crab Cakes</mark> could have been better. to me there was really no flavor to them. \n\nafter hanging out in the fireside lounge we went over to grab something to eat for dinner. we got <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark>, <mark>New York Steak And Shrimp Scampi</mark> acapulco, and pork loin and eggs. my boyfriend and i were very disappointed with our food. my <mark>New York Steak And Shrimp Scampi</mark> wasn't good at all. so bland.\n\nall in all, i don't think i'll ever come back for the food but definitely for drinks and appetizers.", 
            "i've eaten at the peppermill a number of times over the last 5 or 6 years. i usually arrive into vegas on a later, after-work flight from the east coast. by the time i get checked in to my hotel and all cleaned up for the evening, many of the hotel dining options are closed or things are winding down. thankfully, the peppermill is open 24 hours with a full menu. it is a fantastic diner with a great menu, and soo much character. it's clean, the wait staff is friendly and top notch. also, the late-night manager is friendly, always on her toes, and interested in hearing about the customer experience. she does a great job both supporting and orchestrating the service staff. \n\ni have ordered many entrees, both dinner <mark><mark>Half Sandwich With Soup Or Salad</mark> And Bread</mark> selections, some of which include the following:  berry <mark>Mixed Greens Or Fresh Spinach Salad</mark>, <mark>Crab Cakes</mark>, omelettes, chicken and <mark>Chicken & Red Pepper Pasta</mark>, swiss and <mark>Swiss & Mushroom Burger</mark>, <mark>Creamy Chicken Dijon</mark>, pesto <mark>Focaccia <mark>Pesto Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark>, tomato bisque, chicken noodle soup. my favorite is the <mark>Creamy Chicken Dijon</mark> dinner. two generous pieces of pounded chicken served on top of mashed potatoes with a vegetable, often green beans, and of course the <mark>Creamy Chicken Dijon</mark> sauce.  it is a large portion entree, as most of the dishes served are. i'm surprised there are not pictures of this entree in the photos section. the specialty drinks are excellent too. cocktail waitresses in black gowns take your drink order which is prepared by the bartenders in the fireside lounge. i've ordered the blue hawaii a couple of times, and i have a friend that loves the espresso martini.\n\nafter dinner, i usually get a couple of drinks in the fireside lounge. you get certain drinks comp'd if you play the video casino games at the bar. however, i have to warn you, the games seem tighter than many of the machines i've played at different locations in vegas. you may want to consider abstaining from play and just pay outright for your drinks. all in all, the lounge is a comfortable place to get a few drinks with friends after dinner.\n\ni gave this restaurant a very high rating, taking into consideration it is an upscale diner, with its own unique signature ambiance.", 
            "the peppermill is a vegas version of denny's but with large portions and retro d\\u00e9cor. it really does look like it a throwback version of what vegas was in the 70's. the employees wear weird costumes that i don't quite understand. the waitresses dress in blue and white overall/romper get-ups and the bartenders wear ball gowns....it's just unexplainable. but the service itself was sort of slow. it seemed as if there were more employees on the clock than actual customers. \n\nthe do have a guy who comes around and takes photos to capture your dining experience. it's sort of like buca di beppo and you get a complimentary photo with your meal. the photographer did inform us he wasn't with the restaurant and worked off commission so it was kind of awkward not buying the photo....\n\nbut as far as the food, it's mostly breakfast options, the portions are large, and it's relatively inexpensive.  i had the crab cake bene (poached eggs and grilled <mark>Crab Cakes</mark> on toasted english muffins, smothered in hollandaise sauce) and i opted for the hollandaise sauce on the side rightfully so because it was really thick and salty. the <mark>Crab Cakes</mark> were already heavily salted down so it really didn't need to be lathered, smothered or bathed in any salt. \n\nthis place has a decent location, decent price; ok food, large portions, sort of outdated and gimmicky but possess a charm none-the-less. i wouldn't suggest the crab cake bene nor any of their other lunch items but they do serve breakfast all day 24hrs so it seems like a great drunk place to visit. other than that its mehhhh", 
            "this place is vegas tacky yet kitsch cool and the food, drinks and service was very good.\n\ncame here for what was meant to be late breakfast but ended up being early lunch.\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Crab Cakes</mark> to get started and i have to say they were so damn good i could have just ordered more for my main meal.\nhowever i ordered what was the best ruben sandwich i have ever had in my life. \nwas full of flavour and so big i could barely  eat half of it.\nmy boyfriend and his friend both got the pastrami sandwich which were both as big and my girlfriend had a burger.\nthe margarita  bomb we had to wash it down was super good and super strong... no complaints there!\nwaitresses were very friendly and happy to assist.\nwill be back for more next time i'm in vegas!", 
            "quite a disappointing experience.\n\ni went last night with two of my girlfriends after dancing away at the rock in rio festival. one of my friends who is a born and raised las vegan said the peppermill is a vegas staple and we had to go because my other friend and i have never been. by the time we arrived it was around 2:30am. the restaurant was packed and there were at least three parties waiting ahead of us. we were starving so we asked if we could go into the lounge (located in a large room to the left of the main restaurant) and the hostess nodded, so we went and seated ourselves.\n\nthe ambiance is something else!! probably the only positive about this place. neon lights in a dark spacious room, with comfortable booths, a fountain, and surprisingly a lot of greenery. i felt like i was in a different decade.\n\nour female server seemed annoyed and wasn't the friendliest when she greeted us. i don't think she smiled once. we ordered a few beers and appetizers as we could only order from the app menu in the lounge which we didn't mind. we got a round of blue moons and ordered <mark>Crab Cakes</mark>, ground beef nachos, mozzarella sticks, and buffalo <mark>Hot Chicken Wings</mark>.\n\na different server came by and asked if we wanted to start a tab. we closed out since we were mainly hungry and were good on our beers. it didn't take too long for the food to come out (20 min?) and we were excited to chow down. \n\n- <mark>Crab Cakes</mark>; average, nothing special. i think we got 4 of them and they came with a creamy sauce \n- buffalo <mark>Hot Chicken Wings</mark>; lukewarm but the buffalo sauce was delicious! came with carrots and celery per usual\n- nachos; huge portion. had cheese, jalape\\u00f1os, black olives on top. the cheese was cold and dry. they gave us a separate bowl of beans and another of the ground beef. not sure why they wouldn't just top off the nachos with the two. also came with guac, pico, and sour cream. \n-  mozzarella sticks; the most disturbing part of my experience. i bit into the cold mozzarella stick and out came a long strand of lighter hair. i was grossed out but know that these things happen. when i reacted to this hair in my mouth, my other friend laughed and said the one she bit into earlier had a hair in it too but just took it out. hair in two mozzarella sticks out of five...?\n\nwe were having a fun night and didn't really want to take the effort to complain. the mozzarella sticks weren't good so if they offered to bring us a new batch, we would have declined. also, i don't believe a single server came by to our table after we paid for our tab and received our food. also not worth hunting down service.\n\nneedles to say the food and service here is poor in my opinion, however, the ambiance in the lounge is very neat. if i were to ever come back, i would probably go for a drink at the bar in the lounge just to enjoy the neon lights.", 
            "pleasantly surprised with excellent quality diner food. <mark>Crab Cakes</mark> were the surprise and makes this place worth it. ordered a shrimp omelette and was pleased. would def revisit", 
            "this was the first time we tried this old time establishment. the wait was a quick 5 minutes and service was good. i tried the crab cake benedict for breakfast and it was quite delicious! the two generously sized <mark>Crab Cakes</mark> topped the english muffins and were smothered in a nice hollandaise sauce and topped w two perfectly cooked poached eggs. it came with a large side of nicely crisped hashbrowns. the serving was normal-large for a bene but my husband's (delicious) country <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> and my niece's pancake combo were huge!", 
            "love the atmosphere here.... laid back and relaxing.... food was good, a must try is the <mark>Crab Cakes</mark>. drinks were a lil slow coming but worth the wait",

            "just like old vegas. retro diner style vibe and the fire pit lounge is a must see. came here for brunch 10 am on a monday and the wait was minimal. i tried the <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> and it hit the spot. ample portion, but the taste was not compromised. i got it with hash browns and over medium eggs. the hash browns were crispy and the eggs were cooked properly. both were good. now onto the main event. the <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> had an acceptable amount of breading and \"healthy\" portion of beef rounds. seasoning came through with the savory, yet not overly heavy, gravy sauce. i especially liked the hints of mushroom. this is a must try dish! \n\nothers ordered the veggie omelette, pork loin with eggs, and <mark>Crab Cakes</mark>. all said their food was good. they appreciated the value-based portions. looks like most dishes are safe bets here.\n\nservice was relatively prompt and friendly considering it was busy. check this place out, if you want to refresh from all thee foo-foo restaurants on the strip."

            "when you think of real vegas, you think of this place. i dont mean the nice upscale vegas, i mean <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>, neon light, smells like smoke, diner with slot machines vegas. and that's this place.\n\nwe went here because the guy at the wynn said this place had good burgers for cheap, and girls walking around in mini skirts.\n\nhe was 2 for 2.\n\nthe only problem with it was it was just a tad too ghetto for my taste. im not an elitist, hell im not even yelp elite, but still it was just a bit down in the dumps. although i will give it credit, the girls working there were very hot, and the milkshakes were bomb.\n\nwe thought our waitress was really cute and wanted to hit on her a bit, so we thought it would be a good idea if we asked about milkshakes. my first friend was in love with this girl and wanted to talk to her, so when she walked up it went like this.\n\nfriend 1 (who was in love with her): silence\nfriend 2: um so we wanted to ask you about the milkshakes\nme: uh yeah what flavors do you have?\nwaitress: strawberry vanila and chocolate\nfriend 1: silence\nfriend 2: ok so we have a question. we want to split a milkshake, but we dont want to seem, how do we say this, um, uh, homosexual per say. so which would you think is hotter, one milkshake with 3 straws, or 3 separate glasses\nwaitress (laughing): whatever you want babe\nme: well after that we are def. not getting the pink strawberry\n\n\nit was only after that we noticed a ring on her finger (she was still young like 24). my first friend said he called an audible, but either way it was a solid swing and a miss.\n\nso if you want a cheap meal with some hilarious surroundings, hit this place up. classy wise it is def. not up there, but it is a great place none the less.", 
            "this is always my first stop when i get to vegas.  the atmosphere reminds me of pulp fiction.  the food comes in large portions, enough to share, and will leave you filled for <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>.  the price is pretty great considering it's vegas.  this place is swanky and my fave.", 
            "if you ever find yourself in vegas, you must make sure to stop at the landmark that is the peppermill inn restaurant. \ni had heard about the peppermill from my brother in law who insisted multiple times that i make a stop there during my stay in sin city. when i went this last january, i finally made the time to get over there for a 3:00pm breakfast. if i knew what i know now about the peppermill, i'd beat my own ass for not going sooner.\nthe lettering on the outside said a lot when i see \"peppermill\" spelled out in a rainbow of neon lights.  my friend kristina and i skipped in excitement through the doors and entered in jaw-dropping bewilderment. chills ran down our spines as we were slapped in the face with what i can only describe as pure neon splendor. a resounding wow was all we could say until the hostess made us snap out of it and asked how many in out party. i couldn't help but ask her, \"do you get a headache working here?\" she giggled and said,\" when i first started, i thought there was no way i could work here for long, but you get use to it.\" \nas she led us through the forest of silk trees and flowers to our table, we admired her classicly tacky floral uniform and shimmery tights. i've never been more jealous of a working environment. the menu was large and filled with a huge assortment of breakfast, lunch, and dinner items.. always being served.\ni called my brother in law for \"must-haves\" and was told to get the bloody mary, among other specialties. i went ahead and ordered my tower of bloody mary and it was amazing. i'm a sucker for biscuits and gravy, so we ordered that.. along with the fantasia waffle. a belgian waffle covered in <mark>Fresh Fruit</mark>, blueberry syrup and choice of whipped cream or sour cream. we ate until we thought we would explode, but the fun didn't end there.\nrumors of the breathtaking \"fireside lounge\" and it's famous fire pit drew us to it's glory. if i thought the neon goodness was only in the restaurant, i was extremely mistaken. take all the yummy neon lights, then dim the rest of the lights, add some pink couches and cocktail waitresses in gowns and full make-up (no matter the time <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>).. you have yourself the fireside lounge. oh wait! it gets better... the fire pit!! i've never seen anything so amazing. imagine a tiny jacuzzi with fire coming out of it and the vent lined with little tv's showing the hottest sporting event. nothing short of fantastic. we sunk into a spot around the fire and it took superman's will power to get us up and out of there. \ndo yourself a favor. go to the peppermill. if not for the decor, do it for the food. yummy!", 
            "we hit this place first when we get to vegas. \n\nno, i'm serious, we pack light just so we aren't wheeling a trashy tourister through the doors into neon heaven.\n\nif it's evening, we head for the lounge and begin by ordering up a double bloody mary. who am i kidding? if we get there early in <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>, we're doing the same thing. \n\noh, and they do a good breakfast - all day, thank the maker.\n\nmy favorite juxtaposition happens when one of the cocktail hostesses comes out into the diner area, dressed in those fabulous full-length black gowns, to fill a cocktail order. only in vegas...\n\n...and reno, i suppose.", 
            "i don't think people understand, or at least fully comprehend how much i love las vegas. sure it holds a lot of sentimental value for me, but once you get over all the things people hate vegas for, you realize how amazing this postmodern paradise is in all its glory. \n\nthat said, i'm so happy that a place like peppermill exists, but pretty disappointed that it's taken me 27 years to finally discover and go here. \n\nthis place is soooooo cheesy vegas - i know there's a canter's in vegas, but if canter's fully embraced the aesthetic of the city, it would look like this place. the ceiling, walls and columns are adorned with mirrorball tiles, the lampshades are stained glass flamingos, and every plant i the place is made of plastic. even the sugar are rainbow sprinkles! just don't get too excited and then having to deal with an entire handful of the stuff you have no business really holding. \n\nthe menu is pretty comprehensive - you've got steak, sammies and everything a 24/7 diner-like place should have. prices are kind of on the steep side, but the food is tasty. we went there at 11pm after spending an entire day in the sun with thousands of others watching awesome bands and had nothing to consume all day with the exception of a cup of cereal in the morning and a beer here and there throughout <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>. by the time we got there, we were all famished. \n\nthe varied menu made it hard to choose, but i nabbed myself a pastrami sandwich, which was perhaps on my top ten list of best choices i've made in my short life. it may have been the fact that i was super hungry, but i do not exaggerate when i say i was nearly reduced to tears after each bit of my cured meat on sourdough bread i was so happy. i chewed with the biggest smile on my face while a chorus of angels one can hear even past the super loud decor surrounding me. if i was challenged to marry the thing, i would have plowed over my boyfriend and dashed to the nearest chapel where elvis would have married us, and our honeymoon would be spent skipping the \"honeymoon\" part and would have gone directly to praying mantis mode and devoured my mate. it was that good. \n\noh, i sampled other peoples' food as well, and it was all pretty good. \n\nbut back to my sandwich. i don't know...we may have been caught up in the moment, maybe it was just good timing. i don't know if i were to return, things would be the same, but maybe...just maybe, i'll give it a try.", 
            "if you wake up one morning in vegas and wonder to yourself what's vegas like back in <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>, you should definitely take yourself (and bring a friend or two with you just in case you got lost in the time warp) to this las vegas almost landmark.  the decor of the place and the uniform of the staff are cheesier than a deep dish pizza. fake cherry blossom trees aside, the pantyhose on those waitress are seriously reflective!\n\nlike any restaurant, not everything on the menu is good, and not every waiting staff is attentive all the time; i had some hit and miss experiences with this place with both the food and service, hence the 3 stars.\n\ncheck it out nonetheless, it'll bring you back to the good old days =)", 
            "the best service i've had in a long time!! i had breakfast at the peppermill on march 14th, <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> after my friend's wedding. we were a group of about 14 people. i was a waitress in my past life and i remember dreading big parties.\n\nour waitress (wish i remembered her name) was awesome! she was quick, efficient, and offered split checks... she was amazing! the food was good and the service was even better! i will definitely go back to the peppermill the next time i am in vegas!!", 
            "aaaahhh the peppermill, our favorite place for cheap eats in vegas.\n\n    we have been here dozens of times and still look forward to going every time we are in town. i have ordered most everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. and the portions are huge so thats a bonus right there. they have fantastic wings and there not way the hell over priced like at the bellagio cafe. \n    i love the decor as well, the neon is great, and the tree running all over the place is nice also. my only complaint, <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> booths are for tinny people! im not a small guy and i have a hell of a time fitting into any of the booths. this is the country with the fat people remember? i think a remodel is in order here. \n     if you still have not checked out the peppermill i strongly recommend it. the food and the atmosphere are fantastic. the prices are great as well.", 
            "amazing\n\nall their drinks are enormous and you can sit by the fire in <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> at 3 in the afternoon. i want to get married here. and then i want to move in.", 
            "excellent food and price for anything you want at any time <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>. if you want steak at 7:00 am. or pancakes at 7:00 at night, it's worth the trip.", 
            "great menu with lots of variety and backed up with good quality food and service. a great place to stop at any time <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> or night in sin city.", 
            "great great brunch/diner\n\nwhat i had:\n- country <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> + eggs w/biscuit + gravy: uhm... pretty perfect. i loved the crunch of the steak. hashed browns were perfect - hot and fluffy with plenty of crunch! eggs were... you know, eggs. nothing amazing, but nothing to complain about. biscuit was fluffy, flaky and light! amazing smothered with the country gravy\n- bloody mary: they do it right! spicy, flavorful, i had this at the fireside lounge before we got our table and nearly drank the entire thing. its like a freaking meal in a cup!\n\nfor two breakfast entres and two coffees it came out to about $45 (doesnt include the bloody mary) with tip... so, not as cheap as dennys, but i think it was worth every penny.\n\npros:\n- food! well... i cant really speak for anything other than what i ate and drank... but it looks like they do breakfast foods great. the menu looked extensive! i had to limit how much i could look at because if i looked at anything i wouldnt be able to order\n- service: pretty good. jennifer was cheerful and had a great attitude. she wasnt always the most attentive, but i went in at the end of father's day brunch, so everyone looked swamped. but despite being busy, she always remained positive and happy\n- location: right on the strip towards the north end, its a great 24 hour place that serves great food\n\ncons:\n- decor: ... honestly, i went back and forth because i wasnt sure if this was a pro or con for this place. yes its damn cheesy and outdated and wacky. i cant imagine a time when the decor or the servers' outfits would have been fashionable... but, it kind of works with the feel of it. the fireside lounge is pretty cheesy too. it seems straight out of the seventies but... it makes this place memorable! id prefer the blatant outmoded fashion and decor then a place that just tries too hard to look modern and ends up looking commercial (think the wynn decor... yuck!)\n- part of the decor i guess, but this place was freaking dark. maybe just part of the ambiance, but weird to eat your breakfast in such a dark place\n\nanyways, despite the cheesy outdated decor (think dennys + disco + lots <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> purple stuff), would i go back again? yes! why? the food was amazing. i love breakfast places. so instead of spending big bucks at a brunch buffet, why not just get it right at the peppermill?", 
            "aww.....the peppermill.....\n\ni really do love this place! i love the whole cheesy, neon night club atmosphere thing going on, i love the big over portioned drinks as well as food and i love the fact that it brings back so many fond memories <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> in vegas and also memories of other peppermills i have visited over the years.\n\ni came here recently for breakfast on my little vegas getaway and immediately felt a comforting sensation as i entered in through the doors. i was immediate greeted by an exceptionally friendly hostess and seated promptly.\n\ni ordered a sausage, swiss cheese and onion omelet, which came with has browns and a blueberry muffin.\n\nas always, the peppermill way, my omelet was gynormouse and mouthwatering delicious and even the hash browns were quite tasty especially considering the fact that i'm not into hash browns.\n\nthe bar area is fantabulous!!! dark secluded and intimate with a big fiery pit centered in the middle surrounded by an engaging lounge couch area. it  definitely is something worth checking out! you haven't fully experienced vegas to the fullest with out stopping here; really, you just have to make this a destination point!! can't wait tell my next visit!!!", 
            "not fantastic, not horrible.\n\nfirst of all, man! this place gets crowded. if you can, head straight for the counter for immediate seating. otherwise, you may be doomed to a 20-30 minute wait, if not more (depending on what time <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>/night you're trying to get your grub on.)\n\nmenu is nothing spectacular and is pretty standard. the peppermill is really known for atmosphere and portion size. and the portions are pretty big. hell, the cup of coffee was a thing of beauty for a coffee drinker like me.\n\ni opted for the eggs benedict. my waitress uttered \"good choice\" when i ordered, so i expected something fabulous. what i got was .. eggs benedict. hey, poached eggs aren't exactly easy to get perfect, so i give them credit for perfectly cooked eggs <mark>French Dip With Au Jus</mark> the right amount of runny yolk. other than that .. pretty standard. you do get 3 eggs instead of the usual 2, and a large portion of hash brown potatoes. add your own salt and pepper and/or tabasco, because the hollandaise sauce is pretty flavorless.\n\noh, if you sit at the counter, watch your neighbors. the idiot that plopped down on the stool next to me decided he needed cream for his coffee and .. without a word to me .. reached across my plate to take cream out of the supply my waitress left for me. didn't even apologize after he did it and realized that it wasn't \"for everyone\". d.b.", 
            "everything \"old school\" vegas is here. the atmosphere. the food, the lights inside... even what the waitresses wear. their colored sugar is cool. huge portions of food and 24 hour cocktails. cant ask for anything more awesome. definitely a place id go to again, any time <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> or night. !", 
            "the peppermill of vegas is a place i was referred to on my way out from a work friend. \n\nhis quote....\"you can do a lot of #@%$ in vegas, but you have to try peppermill\". i'm thinking this guy is stoned or something... with all the buffets and food in vegas, i'm going to wander down to a little diner? \n\nhell yes!!! \npeppermill looks like no other when you walk in and the food is awesome. the portions are huge as you can see from the pics people have added. it's nicely set up and perfect for a meal at any time or <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> or night... \n\nagain, huge portions... and it's not crappy either... all is good tasting. if you go in really later, you'll see this place is hoping. the waitresses are all very friendly and offer advice to the new vegas traveler. \n\nadd it to your sight-see's of vegas... i'll be back in 2 weeks and will make it my first stop! (this place sits just north of the riviera hotel...)", 
            "met up with some friends here the last time i was in vegas. it was the perfect meeting place prior to a night of drinking and debauchery. \n\nwe had a very large group (20+) and the servers were patient with all of us. ordered the country <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> breakfast. portions were huge. i got a generous helping of hash browns along with egg whites. two huge pieces of country <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> with sausage gravy all over. the sausage gravy actually had a generous amount of sausage pieces in it. drinks here are made strong and do not disappoint. \n\nthe look and feel of the place just screams cheesy. reminds you <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> of old vegas with the neon everywhere. it is nice to see that not everything has changed. \n\nif you are not in the mood for a buffet or a high end restaurant, this is the place to go. me and my friends came here before a night of debauchery but you could also go here to recover as well.", 
            "the hubby and i were looking for a good, filling breakfast before hitting the casinos for <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>, and we found the peppermill. yum! the decor was hilarious in itself. i could almost imagine i was on a movie or 70s tv set! the clientele on this morning was varied and several were obviously \"working girls\" winding down from the previous night. \n\nmy french toast platter and his omlette were both delicious and filling. service was quick, attentive and friendly. we will definitely make this a stop for future vegas trips!", 
            "went over for breakfast as got tired of paying $50 at the casino. excellent job, great pirces, and huge portions. staff very friendly and a nice menu for any time <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>. kind of tacky inside with the pink neon strips, but perfect for what ails you. great late night stop too if you're looking for some food after a long night.", 
            "went to vegas with some friends and someone wanted to check out the fireside. we were all a little buzzed when we arrived, so my memory may be a bit hazy but it definitely seemed like a cool place. feels very much like a throwback to a 70s lounge - but in a way like this place has been around since the 70s... not a corporate 70s themed bar.\n\nthey had good drinks and comfortable couches. they have pretty waitresses who aren't slutting it up like many of the casino girls. i can't imagine starting your night here, or going during <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> - this place seems tailor made for winding up here after a late night of drinking and partying, for a couple of wind-down nightcaps.", 
            "whenever the boyfriend and i can't compromise on one restaurant or just have no idea what to eat but just know that no one wants to cook tonight it's off to peppermill we go.\n\ni've pretty much had most of the salads, soups and a handful of the sandwiches.  my favorite thing off the lunch/dinner menu is the tomato and mozzarella sandwich.  oh my gosh, thick foccacia style bread, buffalo mozzarella, fresh tomatos, drizzled with balsamic and basil served with a side of <mark>Fresh Fruit</mark>.  yum...i just started drooling thinking about it.  the last time we went i got the <mark>Steak And Mushroom Salad</mark> thinking it would be a mixed green salad with mushrooms and a couple slices of steak.  no sirree this was the entire piece of meat teetering on a bed of greens.  granted it wasn't meyer's ranch's finest but still for $13.95, holy cow!\n\nlet me not forgot about the most divine part of peppermill: their breakfast which is served 24 hours.  of course i've had it at normal hours as well as after leaving the club at 4 am but the pinnacle of it all is weekend brunch after some hard partying.  prepare for a 45 minute to an hour wait for a table but so worth it.  their french toast is melt-in-your-mouth, the eggs benedict is the best classic version i've had in vegas and their omelettes are too die for and big enough for 2-3 people to share.  don't forget about their bloody marys which are the size of a vase (rock star tip:  order an extra shot to ease the transition back to <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>).\n\ni was torn between 4 and 5 stars because with so many 5 star dining places in vegas, peppermill is not the most innovative but i just have to give peppermill the benefit of the doubt and go with 5 because honestly it is just so d*** good.", 
            "walking into the peppermill is like walking into an alternative universe. it has the old school vegas feel with the neon lights. the food is diner food with big portions. the boyfriend and i had a burger and a caprese appetizer for lunch and pretty much didn't eat for the rest <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>. i wouldn't come expecting great food but it's a place to stop for drinks and to take in the atmosphere.", 
            "we went here for breakfast on 27-dec 2011 and were greeted by a loooong queue. that's always a good sign - a place has to be good if there are so many people willing to wait for the first meal <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>! fortunately, there were a couple of seats available at the counter, and we asked the hostess if there was a queue for that. nope!! so we just walked straight in and it was the most awesome feeling in the world - jumping a queue of about 30. haha\n\nanyways, on to the food. giant portion sizes. i am a ravenous beast in the morning, and i could only make through half of my marco pollo omelet and the monster portion of hash browns. my husband ordered the french toast, and got 3 (or was it 4?) huge slices with a mound of fruit on top. the food was not uniquely delicious, but it was satisfying. all in all, we left happy and content.\n\nwe will definitely return whenever we visit the sin city next!", 
            "the minute you walk through the front door and see the slot machines and pink neon lights you just know that you are in for a classic vegas experience. the peppermill has been on the north end of the vegas strip for over thirty years. many a casino has come and gone in those years but the peppermill and the adjacent firseide lounge has survived.  it is well known for its neon glow, its cute car hop uniformed waitresses and its huge food portions.\n you don't need to worry about the time <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> because the peppermill is open 24 hours and serves breakfast,lunch and dinner anytime. this makes it a perfect late night stop or the place to cure your morning after hangover. for simone and i, it was the hangover cure, and we arrived mid morning and were immediately seated.  after looking over the waitress, i mean menu, i decided to order <mark>The Reuben</mark> sandwich and french fries. simone decided to go for the breakfast menu and ordered a spinach, feta and tomato omelete with hash browns and a bran muffin. my reuben arrived first and it was massive. in fact, it was a club sandwich with three grilled and buttery homemade slices of rye bread. between the first two slices of bread was a heaping mound of fresh sauerkraut with gooey melted swiss and house made thousand island dressing. the kraut was marinated perfectly with the flavor of whole caraway seeds and was excellent as the bed for the thinly sliced pound or so of grilled pastrami which was piled high on the next layer of rye bread with more melted swiss. this was the holy grail of sandwiches and i amazingly finished the entire thing. the fries were a little to thick cut for my taste but were still fried crisp and were a good side to my sandwich.  simones omelet was almost equal in size to my sandwich . it was packed full of spinach , cheese and tomatoes and even had some surprise hash browns mixed in with it ( hopefully not left over on the grill from <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> before). simone was a light weight and only downed about 1/4 of her monster meal. the hash browns that came with the omelet were grated fresh and were grilled crispy on the outside and tender in the middle, just the way they should be and i gladly helped simone finish them.  the bran muffin also had good flavor and was nice, fresh and moist.\nthe peppermill is a great experience. come hungry, because there is plenty to eat and you will want to finish it all.  a great las vegas landmark, it is not to be missed. 4 out of 5 for the peppermill ****", 
            "the fireside lounge is an old school cheesily decorated place not to be missed!  i'm sure back in <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>, it was pretty amazing, and although dated, it kind of still is!  it's rare to find places like this that didn't feel the pressure to \"update\" their look, and so we younger folks get to enter a kind of time capsule and imagine a friday night out on the town in our platforms & polyester disco dresses!  big round banquettes for groups make it a nice place to stop & hang out without feeling the vegas rush to move on & not miss something fabulous.  flashback decor includes mirrors on all the walls, red upholstery, faux forest-like greenery and a central fireplace/fountain (propane bubbling up thru the water making the flames dance on the surface).  a good experience over all.  fifth star of the rating falls away because, although very pleasant, it seemed like the wait staff wasn't that efficient.", 
            "great food any time <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>!\nlove this spot\n:)", 
            "we love this place and don't know why we don't come here more often when we are in vegas.\n\nthis review is in two parts, the restaurant and the lounge.\n\nthe restaurant\n\nmirrors, fake cherry blossom trees, red and blue neon... what's not to love?\n\nservice here is very good, prompt and friendly.  proportions can be ridiculously large!\n\non the night we went, we had plans for later in the evening and i didn't want to be too full... so i was a little concerned due to the size of their servings.  i ordered the cheeseburgers sliders which came with home made yukon gold potato chips.  the sliders were... sliders, nothing spectacular, but the chips were awesome though i could not finish them.  my wife had the <mark>Pesto Chicken Sandwich</mark> with onion rings, both of which she loved.\n\nwe returned a couple <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> later for breakfast where i had the country <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> and eggs which was good, though again i could not finish it (and i am a big eater) and she has the french toast ambrosia... which was ridiculously large!  it was so big a lady from the next table asked if she could take a picture of it!  \n\ni also noticed the gentleman across from us ordered the fruit plate which was not at all a fruit plate, it was a produce bar stacked on a plate!  i am not kidding, your could easily get your full eight servings of fruits and vegetables in one meal!\n\nthis place is a little pricy, however in most items you get enough to make two (if not more) meals.  proportionally speaking it is very reasonable.\n\nthe lounge\n\nwe freakin' love this lounge!  again chrome and mirrors, red and blue neon, red velvet booths, and a fire spewing, boiling water fire pit!  i have always thought this would be exactly the kind of place where swingers would meet up prior to their assignations!\n\nthe waitresses all wear cocktail dresses which are very nice.  they prohibit you from wearing hats of any kind calling it their \"dress code\" but there are always people in there dressed in shorts and t-shirts so i am not too what the boundaries of this \"code\" are.  \n\nthey have a really cool menu advertising \"retro\" drinks like champagne cocktails, manhattans, and scorpions in big bowls.   i ordered a vodka gimlet (which seems more and more to becoming an endangered species as far as bartenders go) and our friend ordered a beautiful.  both drinks were made correctly with no questions asked.  \n\nagain this place can be pricy.  in fact we spent more here in the same amount of time as we did at treasures, a very high end strip club.\n\nmoney aside, i would find a reason to go to vegas just to hang out at the peppermill fireside lounge.\n\nthe only reason i don't give it 5 stars is the cost.\n\nedit:  my wife's preferred drink this weekend was a pina colada.  she wanted me to point out that the peppermill was the only establishment that served her pc in a hurricane glass as it should be.  it may not seem important but it shows that they pay attention to the details.", 
            "peppermill is popular amongst the vegas clubbing crowd. i have no clue what this place would be like at regular hours <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>, but think denny's or the pantry. the prices reflect that of the vegas markup too, but you come to expect that on the strip. the first thing that you would notice on the menu would be the breakfast emphasis. i've only done breakfast here and it's rather good, even at 4 am.\n\n-=-<mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark>-=- i got this meal with eggs. that's the perfect way to do chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark>. it's definitely top 5 in my list of chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark>. you just can never go wrong with a fried piece of steak. the gravy that they add on top as well is savory, flavorful, and not too overbearing. if you want something breakfast meaty, and don't mind a huge chicken nugget, get this. i was able to get away with only eating half, and saving the rest for later, so fear not hungry men, this will fill you.", 
            "i went there for lunch because it was walking distance from the springhill suites. it was almost noon, but the place was packed with people, some of whom were drinking enormous cocktails. the cocktail waitress was scantily clad, and there was another woman with few clothes on offering to take pictures of couples and groups sitting at their banquettes. \n\nthe service was fine. i had a \"cobb salad,\" which was more like a chef's salad (no egg, no bleu cheese, but both turkey and ham), but which was so large it came in something resembling a porcelain horse trough. i could only finish half of it and i felt bad about the waste of food. total cost for my lunch, including my diet coke, was around $20. while this is more than i like to pay for lunch, i feel like i got my money's worth, between <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>-and-neon decor and the people-watching. if you are going to las vegas, go there once.", 
            "we visit vegas several times a year so we like to find new (to us) & interesting places to try.  in perusing tripadvisor while sitting in the firefly parking lot (our go-to place) we came upon peppermill restaurant & decided to try it based on review of locals.  oh my, what a trip.\n\nwe drove up to this restaurant down toward the older part of the strip around 11:20am on a saturday  morning; there were people waiting outside.  we decided to try it anyway & went inside the where the hostess took our name for a 35 minute wait.  we went to check out the lounge - you must check out the lounge.\n\ntacky might be a good adjective but fun tacky like a walk back into the 70s.  neon lights, mirrors and silk/plastic florals & greenery throughout <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> room illuminated with multiple tvs playing music videos from days past; seating is in semi-circular pit arrangements.  the bar was full with some patrons playing video poker while others just took in the scene.  the focal point of the lounge, however, is the step down fire pit with the flame glowing in the middle of a pool of water.  there was a guest of honor from a bachelorette party interestingly clad with various monetary units & mints hanging from her ensemble hamming it up two couples who wandered in with their 70's garb and took multiple \"what happens in vegas stays...\" photos.  it was a free show!  oh, the drinks were fine - my bloody mary was a bit pricey but it did come in a hurricane glass (remember those?)\n\nwhen our name was called for brunch - we were seated at a window booth (all booth seating).  the floral motif continued and was accompanied by tiffany style lighting.  we saw omelets the size of your head go by - and the line outside continued.  since it was the noon hour by this time we chose to order sliders & pesto <mark>Focaccia <mark>Pesto Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark> from our waitress wearing a carhop type of getup (short skirt).  both food orders were really good and accompanied by a copious pile of fries. \n\npeppermill seems to be a local favorite but many taxis came through too.  the after noon timeframe brought in a younger set of patrons - the line had gotten a bit shorter but it would no doubt get longer as the late night crowd woke from their night of partying.  it's on our list for a return visit.", 
            "wow this place was poppin for a wed night! of course it was valentine;s day! after waiting 20 min finally got seated! the decor is retro cool- it is dark inside even in <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> time - with pink tress and neon lighting. overall it was clean and the service was good.\nthe portions are very large! i ordered the <mark>Swiss & Mushroom Burger</mark> w onion rings (good enough for 2 girls that do not eat much lol ) \na guy came up and took our picture for free! \n\ni went to the other side and checked out the lounge which was super trippy! bonfire water pits and more trees - the waitresses have on cool uniforms setting the scene \n\nif and when in vegas - try it out!", 
            "what can i say? i have never had a bad meal here. i have never experienced bad service here. there is always interesting people to watch. and equally entertaining stories to overhear. since we're locals we visit peppermill a few times a month and we always feel comfy & at home, not surrounded by tourists like at other strip restaurants. everything is good here...the ranch dressing is the very best ever. the corn beef hash & eggs is probably my favorite thing to order and the hot fudge sundae & <mark>Banana Split</mark> never disappoints. this place is perfection and we usually choose it over pretty much anything. the menu can satisfy anyone no matter what you're in the mood for. and the food is better than any plush hotel cafe out there...you just can't get better than peppermill. any time <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> or night it's just...perfect.", 
            "talk about feeling some of that vegas history. i am shocked that it took me this long nearly twenty years later from <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> moved too vegas too eat here. still have found memories of that part of the strip so underdeveloped. all of sudden see small strip mall and all these neon lights. not just lights talk about vibrant colors and ones that flash in and out. i remember the sign out front had even more personality but notice thats gone. =( thankfully the restaurant still stands. it almost landmark of sorts knowing the history of the place combine with some of that vegas style all its own. really who would think place big fire pit right in the middle of the bar/lounge right next too the restaurant. someone walking around asking if you want free pictures with the peppermill as background. the diner style food breakfast, lunch, or dinner at anytime. the bright colors the waitress have on. too all the trees (think fake) inside makes you feel like walked into another world. no disneyland but one of those things see vegas could drum up and pull off. \n\ni ended up getting the maserati omelette. not like motherload of omelettte. it was smothered with lot of goodies. the best part was the meat sauce over the top of it combine with the egg and loaded filling. i barely finish half of it. it came with tasty hash browns. i enjoyed most was the nice crispy brown on the outside but yet moist on the inside. along with your omelette get choice of bread or muffin. i went with the blueberry muffin. nothing too rave about but still was good. again huge muffin. my friend also had omelette. seeing twins just as big. no doubt getting value on the strip here at the peppermill. \n\ni would could come back again! =))", 
            "i went here for the first time in april.  we went to the fireside lounge and i immediately fell in love with the decor and ambiance of the fireside lounge.   then i ordered food, and now, this place is a must visit whenever i go to vegas.  so, when i was trying to find a place to hold my wedding reception, everywhere we thought of wanted a $5,000 minimum.  i had to keep it cheap.  i thought of peppermill, but thought the place is too nice, it'll be just as pricey as the rest, if not pricier.  i was pleasantly surprised that i was wrong!!!!  they had a catering menu that topped all the other menus i had seen so far, they had steak, chicken, pasta, and salmon all on their $28/ plate catering menu.  they asked for no minimum and no pre-ordering.  so i didn't have to spend time asking people ahead of time if they want chicken or steak which was awesome, because planning even the smallest wedding on your own is hard!  i was in touch with a woman named peggy orth the entire time, and she made everything even easier!  she was pleasant to deal with, prompt in returning emails, and made a few excellent suggestions.  this is all leading up to my big day.   so <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> comes.  they had to wait for people to clear out to make room for my 80+ guests.  all of us went to wait in the fireside lounge, and everybody loved the lounge as much as i did.  our tables were all ready in about 10 minutes.  our food was delicious, and it came quick, especially for not having pre-ordered.  the staff made sure my husband and i had our own \"wedding\" table and made us feel like royalty.  peggy did an excellent job, i would loved to have met her, but she wasn't working that day.  and that goes to show what a great manager she must be, because she's obviously very organized a good at what she does to set up a party of 80 people and have it go off without a hitch when she's not even there.\npeppermill is on my official list of all-time favorite places in the world!!!  everyone from the wedding still talks about how awesome a choice the peppermill was!!!",

            "for the all week celebration of a good friends going away, we decided to meet at the fireside lounge for drinks and appetizers at happy hour.  this place is a las vegas icon.  over the years, many celebrities have frequented the location, including elvis.  i'm glad that i've visited this place more than once.  \n\nto be honest, though, the look of the place is drab and not really upscale.  the lounge looks like an 80's porn star man cave.  full of mirrors, blue and purple low dim lighting, a fire pit in the middle of the lounge.  thank goodness it's a historic location of las vegas.  \n\nmy drinks were about $5-$10, including beer and vodka sodas.  for the appetizers, we got a crap load.  i'll just list them and give a little bit of my opinion:\n\n-<mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> for $12.95:  nothing glamorous, cocktail sauce is tangy, lots of shrimp given.\n\n-<mark>Chicken Quesadilla</mark> for $11.50:  served with pico de gallo and sour cream.  your standard quesadilla, again nothing stand out!\n\n-chicken nachos for $16.25:  lots of items.  this was a huge plate but the cheese hardened quickly.  sides included jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, onions and black olives.\n\n-bruschetta for $8.25:  tomatoes, basil, garlic, onions, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese, served on toasted herb focaccia bread.  this was actually flavorful and moist.  one of my favorites!\n\n-<mark>Chicken Fingers</mark> for $10.25:  your standard pub fingers.  kind of dry.\n\n-caprese salad for $8.95:  sliced tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and drizzled with balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil.  the slices were thick and grouped together, it was delicious!\n\ni know i'm missing some of the items but we literally got a few of each of these plates.  our group was pretty big!  at the end <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>, it was your standard pub food.  nothing that really blew me away.  i would go back because of the status of this historic icon.",

            "after being at the peppermill for the first time, i was kicking myself mentally that i hadn't been here sooner.  i enjoyed everything about it, from the large, comfortable booth with royal blue, aqua, and lavender fabric in which we sat; the immediate pouncing on us after we were seated by water carrier, cocktail waitress, and server in quick succession; the snappy, blue and white, mini-skirted uniforms of the servers; the swirling neon blue and pink tubes of light overhead and tube of red light circling around the dining room below; the immense menu; to the wonderfully tasty and generously sized food that diane and i enjoyed on a recent tuesday night.  and, as we entered and left the restaurant, every served dish i saw on other diners' plates looked massive, well crafted, and tasty.\n\ni began our late dinner with a bowl of beef barley soup.  it contained cubed beef, barley, mushroom slices, tomato, celery, and a real tasty, oily beef broth.  the only negative is that the mushrooms appeared to be of the canned variety.  \n\nan excellent <mark>Mixed Greens Or Fresh Spinach Salad</mark> with egg, fresh spinach leaves, bacon, and a catalina dressing that tasted like hot bacon dressing was next, followed by a blta packed with bacon, red tomato, lettuce, an ample smear of mayonnaise, and huge, beautifully green and yellow, cool chunks of perfectly ripe avocado on lightly toasted sourdough bread as i had requested.  numerous french fries were also on the plate, because i had forgotten to order desired potato salad, which was an included alternative, along with a choice of cottage cheese, onion rings, or a fruit cup.  so, just a little belatedly, i ordered and paid for a side of potato salad.  when it arrived in a large teardrop dish, my work in dispatching this large side, along with my jam-packed sandwich, began.  but it was easy to do, for this excellent creamy white, mayonnaise-based dill potato salad with skin-on red potatoes and celery was simply delicious.  the fries were good, but i enjoyed the potato salad more.\n\ndiane, meanwhile, raved about the 3 large and juicy arctic cod fillets and the incredible amount of crisp deep-fried curly fries that covered her platter and constituted an order of <mark>Icelandic Fish And Chips</mark>.  she also very much liked her excellent, rich hot chocolate with whipped cream.  as usual, i finished all of my meal, and diane ate what she could, and had the rest packed for lunch at home.\n\nbut we were by no means done.  i had my eye on another peppermill offering as soon as i read through the gargantuan menu, and diane was game, as well.  so, to cap off a fine dinner, we ordered a colossal hot fudge sundae to share.\n\nand, this was some sundae.  besides a generous supply of french vanilla ice cream in a large and high elongated glass sundae dish, this treat featured mini-chocolate chips, chopped peanuts, a mountain of whipped cream, an obligatory cherry on top, and a load of warm and sweet hot fudge (see pic)--likely four times the amount of hot fudge one will find in the average hot fudge sundae served elsewhere.  i asked our server how many scoops of ice cream were in our sundae, and she replied that normally 3 scoops are included but this was the first one she had ever made, and because she wanted us to be pleased with it, she had put in five scoops!  i highly recommend this dish--but not for just 1 person!  it was so wonderfully good that diane and i finished it all--but just barely! \n\nthis was a great meal with very friendly and mostly great service.  only my specially ordered potato salad was initially forgotten temporarily, and i had to ask once for an iced tea refill.  otherwise our server checked on us several times during our meal to make sure all was well and we were not wanting for anything. \n\nwe peeked inside the fireside lounge before we left, and it looked like a great romantic place to have drinks with a special partner around the fire pit.\n\na couple other pluses about the peppermill are that it is open 24/7, and access to lot parking is easy right off las vegas boulevard just in front of the restaurant.  i expect to become a regular here, and work my way through the vast and enticing menu.  \n\neasily five stars!", 
            "it was off again to peppermill for another great meal!\n\nthis time i enjoyed a <mark>Mixed Greens Or Fresh Spinach Salad</mark> with cut eggs, spinach leaves, substantial bacon, and tangy french-style dressing (although hot bacon dressing would have been more appropriate), followed by two fine gyros with soothing cool cucumber tzaki sauce, tomatoes, and white onions.  the large sandwiches were accompanied by great skin-on red potato salad.  \n\nother guests in my party savored a gourmet <mark>Berry <mark>Gourmet <mark>Chicken Caesar Salad</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Philly Cheese Steak</mark> sandwich, and scrambled eggs, canadian bacon, and crispy hash browns, along with an excellent warm bran muffin that i sampled.  the ambiance here is always upbeat, casual, and comfortable.  and service was very good.  my only gripe is that my salad wasn't removed after i finished it.\n\ni will surely return another day for more fine comfort food!", 
            "this place as been a family staple for over 25 years. as a child i looked forward to coming here on our vacations to lv and now as an adult the i still look forward to coming here! the <mark>Mixed Greens Or Fresh Spinach Salad</mark> is incredible and is definitely shareable. the breakfast menu has your standard items so you can't go wrong if you have kids!", 
            "i've eaten at the peppermill a number of times over the last 5 or 6 years. i usually arrive into vegas on a later, after-work flight from the east coast. by the time i get checked in to my hotel and all cleaned up for the evening, many of the hotel dining options are closed or things are winding down. thankfully, the peppermill is open 24 hours with a full menu. it is a fantastic diner with a great menu, and soo much character. it's clean, the wait staff is friendly and top notch. also, the late-night manager is friendly, always on her toes, and interested in hearing about the customer experience. she does a great job both supporting and orchestrating the service staff. \n\ni have ordered many entrees, both dinner <mark><mark>Half Sandwich With Soup Or Salad</mark> And Bread</mark> selections, some of which include the following:  berry <mark>Mixed Greens Or Fresh Spinach Salad</mark>, <mark>Crab Cakes</mark>, omelettes, chicken and <mark>Chicken & Red Pepper Pasta</mark>, swiss and <mark>Swiss & Mushroom Burger</mark>, <mark>Creamy Chicken Dijon</mark>, pesto <mark>Focaccia <mark>Pesto Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark>, tomato bisque, chicken noodle soup. my favorite is the <mark>Creamy Chicken Dijon</mark> dinner. two generous pieces of pounded chicken served on top of mashed potatoes with a vegetable, often green beans, and of course the <mark>Creamy Chicken Dijon</mark> sauce.  it is a large portion entree, as most of the dishes served are. i'm surprised there are not pictures of this entree in the photos section. the specialty drinks are excellent too. cocktail waitresses in black gowns take your drink order which is prepared by the bartenders in the fireside lounge. i've ordered the blue hawaii a couple of times, and i have a friend that loves the espresso martini.\n\nafter dinner, i usually get a couple of drinks in the fireside lounge. you get certain drinks comp'd if you play the video casino games at the bar. however, i have to warn you, the games seem tighter than many of the machines i've played at different locations in vegas. you may want to consider abstaining from play and just pay outright for your drinks. all in all, the lounge is a comfortable place to get a few drinks with friends after dinner.\n\ni gave this restaurant a very high rating, taking into consideration it is an upscale diner, with its own unique signature ambiance.", 
            "i think this is a place to go late at night / early in the morning hours. we were there for dinner, and nobody really liked what they had. the <mark>Gyro Sandwich</mark> were just ok. the bruschetta wasn't very good. the garlic bread for it wasn't v. garlicky, and it was cold. the <mark>Mixed Greens Or Fresh Spinach Salad</mark> was old spinach leaves, and tasteless bacon bits. we were there for an early dinner. i know we disappointed the cocktail waitress because we didn't order.", 
            "a very cozy place with great vibe. the staff were friendly and the food was great. i usually complain about portions but here i had left-overs! it might sound normal but that's very unusual for me! food was great. entrees came with a side of soup <mark>Mixed Greens Or Fresh Spinach Salad</mark> and the meals came with a plate of garlic bread which we really liked.", 
            "it's surprising to see the 5-star reviews of this place. not that it's bad, but it's not worthy of 5-stars. you come here for the quirkiness and the big plates of diner food. the service can be hit or miss - sometimes they are on their a game, other times you never see your waitress. adding to this is having to wait on a cocktail waitress to order drinks. \n\ngood highlights:\ni appreciate being able to order a <mark>Mixed Greens Or Fresh Spinach Salad</mark> from a diner. their <mark>Southwest Chicken Salad</mark> is huge and tasty. \n\nfront door parking\n\nkid-friendly\n\ndiverse menu - something for everyone\n\nbad highlights:\nhit or miss service\n\nfireside lounge - if you don't smoke or hate being around smoke, then it's impossible to have a cocktail in their lounge. i had to get my drink and go out into the waiting area while we were waiting for friends to meet us for dinner. it was super bad.\n\njust a general observation for vegas newbies:\ni see some reviews saying their $29 steak was really just a $9 steak. fyi - this is what i like to call the vegas tax, and while this is just a diner, you're still in vegas. everything is more expensive here, even diner food. if you want a good steak, you'll usually have to pay $45+ in vegas. if you go to a diner for a steak, it will be a diner steak. you're looking at the price with the mentality of where ever it is you're coming from and setting the bar too high. a $29 ribeye on the strip is a steal.",

            "if you ever find yourself in vegas, you must make sure to stop at the landmark that is the peppermill inn restaurant. \ni had heard about the peppermill from my brother in law who insisted multiple times that i make a stop there during my stay in sin city. when i went this last january, i finally made the time to get over there for a 3:00pm breakfast. if i knew what i know now about the peppermill, i'd beat my own ass for not going sooner.\nthe lettering on the outside said a lot when i see \"peppermill\" spelled out in a rainbow of neon lights.  my friend kristina and i skipped in excitement through the doors and entered in jaw-dropping bewilderment. chills ran down our spines as we were slapped in the face with what i can only describe as pure neon splendor. a resounding wow was all we could say until the hostess made us snap out of it and asked how many in out party. i couldn't help but ask her, \"do you get a headache working here?\" she giggled and said,\" when i first started, i thought there was no way i could work here for long, but you get use to it.\" \nas she led us through the forest of silk trees and flowers to our table, we admired her classicly tacky floral uniform and shimmery tights. i've never been more jealous of a working environment. the menu was large and filled with a huge assortment of breakfast, lunch, and dinner items.. always being served.\ni called my brother in law for \"must-haves\" and was told to get the bloody mary, among other specialties. i went ahead and ordered my tower of bloody mary and it was amazing. i'm a sucker for biscuits and gravy, so we ordered that.. along with the fantasia waffle. a belgian waffle covered in <mark>Fresh Fruit</mark>, blueberry syrup and choice of whipped cream or sour cream. we ate until we thought we would explode, but the fun didn't end there.\nrumors of the breathtaking \"fireside lounge\" and it's famous fire pit drew us to it's glory. if i thought the neon goodness was only in the restaurant, i was extremely mistaken. take all the yummy neon lights, then dim the rest of the lights, add some pink couches and cocktail waitresses in gowns and full make-up (no matter the time <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>).. you have yourself the fireside lounge. oh wait! it gets better... the fire pit!! i've never seen anything so amazing. imagine a tiny jacuzzi with fire coming out of it and the vent lined with little tv's showing the hottest sporting event. nothing short of fantastic. we sunk into a spot around the fire and it took superman's will power to get us up and out of there. \ndo yourself a favor. go to the peppermill. if not for the decor, do it for the food. yummy!", 
            "the steak house at circus circus was closed and we wanted to know of a place we could still get a good steak at 11 p.m. the maitre d' recommended we try peppermill.  the restaurant was crowded but there wasn't a wait to get a table. ordering drinks took forever because the waitress had to get a separate \"cocktail waitress\" to take our alcoholic drink order. one of our friends joked she wouldn't order a steak based on what she saw walking to our table. the price for a steak dinner ranged from $26 to $29. i commented back to her for that price how could the steaks be bad. boy was i wrong. i order a <mark>New York New York</mark> steak and shrimp dinner for $29. the steak was the size you would get for a $9.99 steak and eggs breakfast. to say this was over priced is an understatement. i know size isn't everything but this steak didn't even taste good. the other dinners (chicken nachos and a <mark>Fresh Fruit</mark> platter)  were no better.  if that wasn't bad enough our cocktails were of the premixed straight from the fountain gun dispenser type. needless to say no one finished their food or drinks. what a waste of money. as for the maitre d' i wonder if he gets some sort of kick back for sending people to this place. so much for asking a local where to eat.",

            "7/5/13 breakfast\n\n3.5*  unless you eat at mcdonalds or a food court, there is no cheap meal in vegas anymore, at least not on the strip. prices for breakfast can be steep in the hotel restaurants. peppermill is an economical option because they give you big portion, like food-coma-big-portion. and it's open 24/7.\n\nit's a diner alright, but with tacky decor. think purple neon lights and trees inside. waitresses clad in hawaiian-theme uniforms. this is the big-eater haven, the greasy-spoon diner where you go to soak up the alcohol. that said, i only come here for breakfast.\n\n*fruit plate with banana nut bread ($13.25): this is literally a basket full of <mark>Fresh Fruit</mark>--cantalope wedges, honey dew wedges, pineapples, grapes, strawberries and kiwis. you get a mini loaf of warm banana bread!  skip the marshmellow sauce if its too heavy.\n\n*tostada omelet ($13.50): it certainly tastes better than it looks. it's a big plate of messy omelet with black olives, zesty beef and diced tomatoes. looks like nacho. it comes with hash brown and tortilla chips.\n\n*sausage and three eggs ($11.95): probably the smallest plate in the house and you can substitute canadian bacon or ham. my scrambled eggs were okay-fluffy and the sausages are of the low-grade. very greasy and fatty. instead of toast i requested a blueberry muffin for a taste. it was steamy hot but chewy. not very good.\n\n*extraordinary oatmeal ($9.50): sprinkled with raisins, walnuts, and banana galore. healthy option. \n\nit's so much food that most people pack it up and take it to-go. if you want to challenge yourself, get the french toast collage with four wedges of french toasts, two eggs, two strips of bacon and hash brown. eat yourself to a coma. quantity certainly supersedes quality here. it's not bad but nothing mind-blowing. service is quick and friendly. it's a no-frill place on the strip north of wynn between encore and riviera. crowd range from divey to genteel retired. get here early or be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes after 10.",

            "located near ross. soo true about the decor looking like the 80s threw up in there. bar with fireside pit accompanied by water. the restaurant itself has the whole diner vibe going on. while waiting for 50 mins we drank some mimosas (tasty) :d doesn't disappoint. the french toast collage was good but nothing out of the norm. the swiss and <mark>Swiss & Mushroom Burger</mark> was huge and it was quite juicy. the waitress we had was friendly and prompt. theres a little jar that has colorful sugar crystals on the table. the bacon was so crunchy and it was good quality bacon lol. not that cheap clear bacon. eggs were ordered over well and they got it just right! definitely a must try when visiting vegas!\n\noh and btw they take and give you a complimentary picture :d", 
            "my husband and i renewed our vows at a vegas chapel (by elvis of course) so it seemed only appropriate to go to one of vegas's oldest restaurants.\n\nthis place is cool inside. so old vegas, neon lights, cheescake, large. i loved it! \n\nthe food was decent for this type of place. i wasn't expecting mastro's quality food. my mom and i got the <mark>Southwestern Beef Kabobs</mark>. they were ok. a bit overdone for my tastes. my husband got the swiss and <mark>Swiss & Mushroom Burger</mark>, which i tried, and it was better than what i got. my dad liked his clam chowder.\n\nservice was ok. server messed up the order and had to be reminded to bring out a side dish. maybe she was having an off day.\n\nall in all, it was a fun experience. i'd probably go back to bring a friend who wanted to see old vegas, and wasn't a food snob.", 
            "really disappointed after reading rec in usa today and having locals endorse it. read others' reviews about juicy burgers; ours were dry but still a bit cold in middle.  i had the <mark>Ciabatta Pesto Burger</mark>; everything but the meat was good. my husband's <mark>Swiss & Mushroom Burger</mark> was also dry. our fries and rings were unremarkable, and it wasn't as inexpensive as i expected. cool to see inside.", 
            "i've eaten at the peppermill a number of times over the last 5 or 6 years. i usually arrive into vegas on a later, after-work flight from the east coast. by the time i get checked in to my hotel and all cleaned up for the evening, many of the hotel dining options are closed or things are winding down. thankfully, the peppermill is open 24 hours with a full menu. it is a fantastic diner with a great menu, and soo much character. it's clean, the wait staff is friendly and top notch. also, the late-night manager is friendly, always on her toes, and interested in hearing about the customer experience. she does a great job both supporting and orchestrating the service staff. \n\ni have ordered many entrees, both dinner <mark><mark>Half Sandwich With Soup Or Salad</mark> And Bread</mark> selections, some of which include the following:  berry <mark>Mixed Greens Or Fresh Spinach Salad</mark>, <mark>Crab Cakes</mark>, omelettes, chicken and <mark>Chicken & Red Pepper Pasta</mark>, swiss and <mark>Swiss & Mushroom Burger</mark>, <mark>Creamy Chicken Dijon</mark>, pesto <mark>Focaccia <mark>Pesto Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark>, tomato bisque, chicken noodle soup. my favorite is the <mark>Creamy Chicken Dijon</mark> dinner. two generous pieces of pounded chicken served on top of mashed potatoes with a vegetable, often green beans, and of course the <mark>Creamy Chicken Dijon</mark> sauce.  it is a large portion entree, as most of the dishes served are. i'm surprised there are not pictures of this entree in the photos section. the specialty drinks are excellent too. cocktail waitresses in black gowns take your drink order which is prepared by the bartenders in the fireside lounge. i've ordered the blue hawaii a couple of times, and i have a friend that loves the espresso martini.\n\nafter dinner, i usually get a couple of drinks in the fireside lounge. you get certain drinks comp'd if you play the video casino games at the bar. however, i have to warn you, the games seem tighter than many of the machines i've played at different locations in vegas. you may want to consider abstaining from play and just pay outright for your drinks. all in all, the lounge is a comfortable place to get a few drinks with friends after dinner.\n\ni gave this restaurant a very high rating, taking into consideration it is an upscale diner, with its own unique signature ambiance.", 
            "the cab driver suggested we try this novelty restaurant while visiting. my husband had the club sandwich, i had the <mark>Swiss & Mushroom Burger</mark>. we both had fries as our choice side item. the fries were a little soft, like double dipped almost. the main entrees were good. although the mushrooms tasted like a can. over all it was ok. the club sandwich was better than my burger! the portions sizes are huge!", 
            "came here with a couple of friends late friday night and soon regretted not grabbing tacos instead.\n\nour waitress (jaime?) gave us the most unwelcoming greeting i had ever received from a restaurant and impatiently took down our orders. for the remainder of our meal, she was barely around and we kept having to look around to find her and get the check.\n\nmy boyfriend and i shared the swiss & <mark>Swiss & Mushroom Burger</mark>, and it wasn't bad but it's not at all worth mentioning and doesn't come close to redeeming the restaurant for its poor service.\n\n+1 star because the restaurant is cutely decorated like a 70s diner.", 
            "everything was and is still the best! anytime you want a great meal 24 hours a day or to grab a drink in the fireside lounge, its worth it.\ntonight we went for burgers, and i have never ordered a burger here, but my mushroom/<mark>Swiss & Mushroom Burger</mark> was tasty and super large!\nambience is calm and old style classic vegas.\nif you have never been, i highly recommend!\n5stars"

            "fun place!\n\nwe have lived in las vegas for over 20 years and have heard people rave about the peppermill restaurant and fireside lounge for all 20 years -- but had never gone -- until yesterday. \n\nwe had a friend staying at the wynn and we decided to go out for lunch, and were not in the mood to pay the prices for drinks and food at the wynn restaurants. none of us were able to agree on what kind of food we wanted so decided to go to the peppermill as we always heard they had a huge eclectic menu.  we arrived a 1:20 on a friday afternoon and the place was packed.  we had called in and put our name on the waiting list (no reservation taken for afternoons i was told) but still had about a 20 minute wait. the potpourri of clientele ranges from families, with grandmotherly types  to young fashionably cool model types and everything in between.\n\nthe decor is retro coffee shop on a bit of lsd... lots of neon and cool black light effects... quite an interesting breakfast spot!\n\ni can't believe it took so long for us go there. so easy to get into.. no 6 level park garages and trudging through the casinos to get to a strip eaterie.  parking is easy and the menu is huge, with a lot of old american style standards, and also a few healthier alternatives if you scour the menu well.  the prices are very good and all three of us loved what we ordered. our server (destiny) was cute as can be, and very sweet as well as very efficient.\n\nwe had a nice bottle of wine and shared food and drink with each other and it was a treat. christine had the gourmet shrimp salad... with balsamic dressing...a really huge delicious salad, with fruit and avocado and some good sized shrimp. i had the <mark>Peppermill Pastrami Burger</mark> with curly fries and our friend maya had the eggs benedict.  we ordered a fudge brownie with ice cream for desert that that was huge and we didn't come close to finishing. our total bill $104.\n\non the way out we checked out the fireside lounge which is a pretty sexy flashback to the late 70's early 80's with its hot pink furnishings and low profile seating around the fire pit... probably quite the pickup spot in the early morning hours... if the fire pit wasn't there a stripper pole would be a natural. :-)", 
            "fire side bar was very cool, sorta awkward to lounge around the fire with random people, but it's not like i payed to be a vip, lol...\n \nthe drinks:\n     the scorpion: let me just tell you, \"its huge\" it's literally a 2 gallon fish tank!! it's super yummy though she waitress said it had like 6 shots in it.\n     \n      keylime pie martini: taste just like pie, normal size.\n\nfood:\n       <mark>Peppermill Pastrami Burger</mark>: well done and very tasty i paired it with onion rings. huge servings, so i took most of it home since i ordered and finished my drink before any of the food.\n\n        <mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark>: okay let me just tell you, the noodles are neon orange but omg!!! it's the best neon orange noodles i have ever tried in my life!!! it's got  little spicy kick to it and basically magic in your mouth, again the portions are huge so my husband took most of it back to our room.\n\noverall a great experience and will be back for sure my next time in vegas, the prices are very standard but keep in mind the portions are huge!!! oh and there's a guy who comes around to take your picture for free (tip the guy)",

            "price seems a bit high at first but then you get your meal and you can see why. the portions are pretty big here and the food is good. i ordered the <mark>Peppermill Pastrami Burger</mark>, which was not the best, but was still pretty good. service was ok but it usually pretty busy and you can always spot some interesting people.", 
            "i've been coming here since the first time i ever visited vegas. the vibe is mellow and cool. after a night <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>, drinking, and walking the fire pits are great to relax by. the food hits the spot! we ordered standard breakfast (eggs, bacon, hash browns) and the <mark>Peppermill Pastrami Burger</mark>. they did not disappoint. the service is always great. the owner/manager is so nice. this is a must-do whenever you're in vegas!", 
            "ok so maybe my expectations were too high, everyone kept recommending this place saying how awesome the food was. it was sunday, a few hours before we had to fly home. we usually like to hit someplace unique to vegas, something like hash house a go go or oyster bar before flying home. the cab driver mentioned peppermill and since we have always heard great things decided to try it. nothing was bad, but everything was just ordinary, except maybe the size of the plates. <mark>Peppermill Pastrami Burger</mark> was just ho hum, chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> and eggs - no different from anything else. the interior was cool, waitress was awesome. to me tho it's just an ordinary diner, can't imagine going back for anything really", 
            "everything you want at 4 am. large portions, good side options, cool atmosphere as well. the <mark>Peppermill Pastrami Burger</mark> with curly fries was awesome, great place to eat in vegas!"

            "on the drive back to la from park city, we decide to dine in vegas and amongst total disagreement over where to eat, peppermill comes highly recommended to us by one of the girls who had gone rather recently. after rumors circulated in the car that holly from girls next door dines there often, i assumed it was in the planet hollywood or another reputable hotel. not the case. it is a completely random single-floor standalone restaurant dwarfed on both sides by megacasinos. they did have a private surface parking lot out front though which was convenient. my spirits began to rise again when i saw the interior - a lushly decorated 1980s bonanza of neon lights and big plastic trees...very disorienting, very stimulating, very vegas. we got a nice big booth by the window and were only temporarily bothered by screaming children. the menu is extremely long and not in a good way. not only does everything look atherosclerosis-inducing, it's not the guilty pleasure kind of bad food. also, the alcohol menu is just a jumbled mix of everything - beer alongside cocktails alongside wine, with no explanations. i ordered a salty dog thinking it was a beer label i recognized and was rather disappointed to find that it was a vodka-pineapple. my <mark>Ciabatta Pesto Burger</mark> was weird but pretty good. to top it all off, they wouldn't let us split the bill, so we endured a long confusing argument with the cashier over how to pay. \n\none star for decor, one for the <mark>Ciabatta Pesto Burger</mark>. 'nuff said.",

            "i went for the first time last night.  the place has this great 80's neon feel to it, i liked it.  music was kinda weird as it was some 80's, some newer stuff.\n\nthe server was great, and they also had a cocktail waitress for drinks (kind of odd, but a beer's a beer.)  \n\nwe knew we would have leftovers so we ordered the sampler to add to the \"next day meal.\"  it is a giant plate of fried food.  chicken tenders, cheese sticks, shrimp, and giant onion rings.  if i had a complaint, it would be the onion rings are too big.  also with the mass of grease is a few pieces of bruschetta.  thet were good, but the tomatoes seemed as if they had been marinating too long, kinda squishy.\n\ndinner, i had the <mark>Ciabatta Pesto Burger</mark>.  beef, ciabatta bread, pesto, red onion, tomato, pancetta, fresh mozzarella, and instead of lettuce.... a crapload of basil leaves.  this is now one of the top 5 burgers i have ever had in my life.  srsly, this burger blew me away.  the beef was \"ok,\" nothing that amazing, but the combination of the pesto, basil, pancetta, and fresh mozzarella... you (yes, you) need to try this.\n\nthe appetizers and service were a 4 star.  that burger makes the entire experience 5 stars.  definitely going back.", 
            "good stuff but i am a local so i am a bit bias about my food and places.  i will not be back for food (dinner) it was good but i can get the same for cheaper in a local spot.  i think if you are a tourist it is totally worth it for the cool ambiance the lighting is sparkly  and fun, the restaurant is dimly lit anding to all the glittering lights and trees surrounding you.  big oval booths add to the fun 70's 80's ish feel.  \n\ni had a huge burger <mark>Ciabatta Pesto Burger</mark> flame-broiled burger could taste the flame in the food.  mozzarella cheese, fresh basil instead of lettuce a nice touch, red onions some were hard and not good so i had to pick them off, tomato, prosciutto (prosciutto was old and hard had to pick that off as well) and pesto (lots almost to much pesto) sauce on a ciabatta the bun was awesome.  all burgers come with the choice of french fries, onion rings or potato salad (i had onion rings pretty awesome as far as onion rings go ;)\n\ni do think however i would come back for some late night drinks in the bar area they are really cool looking and the setting, fire pits and appetizers are pretty good i hear!  that is why they are getting 3 stars instead of 2 because the ambiance and bar is i think the highlight of any locals trip!  i wish my food would have all been fresh and i wouldn't of had to pick so much off i would have liked to have added a star to my review.", 
            "a true las vegas classic and it took me about ten trips to sin city to check this one off my list. tucked away in the 'no man's land' north of wynn/encore and south of riviera, this place is easy to miss unless you're up for a bit of a hike from mid-strip or have a car at your disposal. my party started with the appetizer sampler platter which could've nearly stuffed the three of us in and of itself. hand-dipped onion rings, bruschetta and fried mozzarella sticks that were obviously also hand-cut and hand-dipped. all with the requisite dipping accoutrements. so happy. two of us had the giant <mark>Ciabatta Pesto Burger</mark> as an entree and as delicious as the medium-well (ordered medium so i'll order med-rare next time) beef patty on brioche was, i could only eat about half. good thing i had a fridge in my hotel room as this made for a wonderful snack (even when cold) the next evening.\n\nthe atmosphere is as many others say. like a fully-blown vegased out version of an all-american diner. think denny's with a neon problem. just lovely and fits the strip to a tee. service was great the night we were there and beverage refills were quick and without having to ask.\n\nwe stepped into the separate lounge next door to have a look before leaving and were simply awestruck. why did we bother with the restaurant when we could have certainly ordered from a bar menu here and enjoyed giant frou-frou drinks while we waited. so that just whet my appetite for my next sojourn to vegas.\n\nit's a timeless classic in a town that insists on constantly reinventing itself. just go. it probably won't change or close anytime soon, but don't take any chances!", 
            "why do people like to go here? maybe because they like denny's and this is a better version that. the decor here has that 80's, dark, neon lights stuff - looks just like the inside of the limo that we were traveling in the night before. good size portions are served, but the food were just whatever. i had the <mark>Ciabatta Pesto Burger</mark> and my friends all had various burgers <mark><mark>Half Sandwich With Soup Or Salad</mark> And Bread</mark> entrees and nothing stood out in terms of flavoring. not worth the low double digit price tags for each. guess the good thing is that they are open 24. for about the same price, hash house a go go is a way better choice for even ridiculously huger portions and yummier tasting food with more of a distinctiveness.",

            "we came here after our comedy show at the riviera. the buffet we planned to go to was closed. we were greeted warmly and the place looked nice.\n\nmy rating is on the terrible service and food:  the service was terrible!! our waitress inka was not welcoming! she rarely gave us any attention. she did not ask for our drinks, we had to ask her for the drinks we wanted after our meal came. fortunately, a waiter passing by gave us water when we first sat down. the food took a good while. i ordered the salmon while my husband along with his brother and girlfriend ordered <mark>Turkey Burger</mark>. the wait was long. the waitress never came by to reassure us of our meal was coming. my order came with a salad and i didn't get it until our entrees were given. my husband's burger was bland. when we got our check, i was supposed to get bread with my meal. we went to pay, i asked the waiter was i charged extra for it because i never received it. she asked who was my waiter. here comes inka standing next to her. i repeated the question. her response? \"it comes with your meal but i forgot to give it to you.\" there was no sorry or anything. we have never refused to give someone a tip before. she was the first. if you don't like your job, then quit! \n\nthe food is expensive and was not worth it. i will not come back again during my next visit in vegas.", 
            "not quite sure why this restaurant has so many stars.  it was just okay, nothing special...typical bar food.  i went with the <mark>Chicken Quesadilla</mark> and the hubby went with the <mark>Turkey Burger</mark>.  they were both alright.  i can't really complain, but i can't say i'd go back either.  good place to stop if you're starving and you enjoy the old school vegas vibe.", 
            "went to the peppermill at 11 a.m. on a sunday while visiting vegas with the family. there was a 30 minute wait and the place was packed! my husband ordered the <mark>Southwestern Beef Kabobs</mark>, son ordered <mark>Turkey Burger</mark> w/sweet potato fries, sister ordered fettuccine with side of fruit, and i ordered eggs, hash browns and biscuits with gravy. everyone said that the food they ordered was really good and my eggs were cooked perfectly. the service was exceptional! they went above and beyond to accommodate me with a knee scooter (ankle surgery). we visit vegas for an annual race and will definitely go back! great food, service and cool decor!"

            "as for many things in vegas, disappointment comes from over-priced, mediocre food complete with tacky neon lights. \nthe food there was bland and uneventful. i had the <mark>Pesto Chicken Sandwich</mark> that could have been decent if it weren't for the pile of dry mixed greens smashed on the dry bread. there was cheese in there somewhere and little globs of pesto, but paired with a gristley piece of chicken i was far from impressed. and i know what you're thinking- it's diner food, right? well, i've been to my fair share of diners and had some really decent meals. this was not one of them.  i got fries on the side which were, shockingly, also not good. some were cold, some were warm, but all of them mushy. gross. \nmy husband got an omelet with turkey and cheese and hollandaise sauce. he seemed to think it was okay, but not great. the egg was overcooked and made for a hard, chunk of omelet. \nthe best part of this mess... oh wait, there is no best part... the bill was $28 for the two of us and that was without drinks. \ni give this place one star for tacky, over the top, quintessential  vegas d\\u00e9cor and ambiance. also, the waitresses wear these terrible tie-dye colored outfits where you can basically see their asses. except these are not asses you'd want to see.  and then cocktail waitresses come out from the fire side area wearing formal wear to take your drink order. this place is a mess and i recommend it only if you're desperate to go broke for crap food.", 
            "the peppermill is a favorite of both locals & tourists.  the atmosphere and decor is a throwback to the vegas of the 70's-80's.  one of the highlights of the property is the fireside lounge, which features an open fire pit that people can hang around.  the bright purple & blue neon flashes you back to the hey day of vegas.\n\nfood - they offer a wide variety of dishes from breakfast to dinner.  since i started working very close to the peppermill, i will be here often for lunch.  today i decided to give the <mark>Pesto Chicken Sandwich</mark> a try.  it was very tasty and the serving was huge.  a nice sized portion of fries comes with the dish.\n\nservice - most of the time, they are very busy and you'll have to wait a little while for a table.  however, they crank out the orders and you get served in decent time.  it's hit or miss though as sometime you'll wait a while if they're really slammed.\n\ni gave this place 4 stars because i've been a fan of it since i moved here in '93.  i will always return as long as they keep their atmosphere, food, and service the same.  almost gave it 5 stars, but the only thing that held me back was the hit or miss on the service levels.", 
            "imagine partying and being out all night in \"the vegas,\" fueled up on adrenaline, eight shots of gray goose, six red bulls, four lines of nose candy, and maybe two hits off of a gravity bong. in other words, you're freakin' wasted. \n\nyour world is starting to spin and you need some food to keep functioning (and to ensure you don't puke or od). you stumble into a denny's and you are blown away by weird neon colors, friendly service, and good food at great prices featuring out of this world portions. you are so amazed by the experience you feel you as if you are dreaming, high, or both.\n\nwell, the paragraph above pretty much describes my recent experience(s) at the peppermill, except that i was not on a charlie sheen style bender. even stone cold sober and pissing holy water, i was amazed by the food, service, and of course, the neon colored look and feel of the place.\n\nafter a long day of traveling and working, i came here for dinner and had a delicious half pound burger with grilled mushrooms, swiss cheese, crispy bacon, fresh produce featuring onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and a delicious dill pickle that snookie would salivate over. with my entree, i was given the option of a side of fries, curly fries, or onion rings. i opted for the hot and crispy curly fries. and when i say side, i mean a 2,500 calorie mountain.\n\nit was a quality meal and well priced ($16 including tip), considering it was more than enough for two people or maybe even three. but of course, being a nasty pig, i devoured the entire burger and ate as many curly fries as a i could until i felt there was a pimple forming at the end of my nose. \n\ni was so impressed by the meal and the service, i let my impressive server (who was in training at the time and being shadowed by another server), that i would be back the following day. as i wasn't pulling a charlie sheen, the next day i kept my word and returned with my coworker. word is bond, yo.\n\nthis time around, i had a <mark>Focaccia <mark>Pesto Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark> filled with thick slices of avocado, prosciutto, provolone cheese, all served a side of balsamic vinaigrette. the sandwich was delicious. this time around i opted for some tasty onion rings that gave me enough grease on my face to start a fire, a small pimple, and a pair of busted slacks. whatever. i like being fat. no, really. i swear.\n\nin the end, this has become one of my new favorite places to eat in \"the vegas,\" even if the food makes my face look young (greasy and pimply) and body look old (round and fat). good food and good times, even without a charlie sheen recipe for disaster.", 
            "first visit and i loved it. \n\nthe wife and i came in for breakfast on a tuesday morning. the place was full, but they were able to find us a seat. we were greeted quickly by the hostess and asked if we wanted a drink from the bar. i did, so she sent over a cocktail waitress in a cocktail dress. \n\nwe settled in and took in the decor. because they were busy and i had a screwdriver in front of me, we didn't make any note of the time. my wife commented that the place looks like the back of sammy johns' 1973 chevy van. wonderfully kitschy.\n\nour waitress took our order and made great suggestions, because i had trouble deciding what i wanted. they were excellent suggestions. my wife had a pesto <mark>Focaccia <mark>Pesto Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark> on ciabatta bread. i ordered munch's breakfast.\n\nboth dishes were huge and easily could have been split between us. i dove into my plate, hash browns mixed with onions, mushrooms, peppers and linguica, topped with eggs. i enjoyed it so much that i never even asked for a bite of the sandwich. i know she enjoyed it because she kept nibbling on it even after the point of immobility. i fully understood, as i was at the same point picking out slices of linguica from my plate. \n\ni have already recommended the peppermill to friends.",

            "we visit vegas several times a year so we like to find new (to us) & interesting places to try.  in perusing tripadvisor while sitting in the firefly parking lot (our go-to place) we came upon peppermill restaurant & decided to try it based on review of locals.  oh my, what a trip.\n\nwe drove up to this restaurant down toward the older part of the strip around 11:20am on a saturday  morning; there were people waiting outside.  we decided to try it anyway & went inside the where the hostess took our name for a 35 minute wait.  we went to check out the lounge - you must check out the lounge.\n\ntacky might be a good adjective but fun tacky like a walk back into the 70s.  neon lights, mirrors and silk/plastic florals & greenery throughout <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> room illuminated with multiple tvs playing music videos from days past; seating is in semi-circular pit arrangements.  the bar was full with some patrons playing video poker while others just took in the scene.  the focal point of the lounge, however, is the step down fire pit with the flame glowing in the middle of a pool of water.  there was a guest of honor from a bachelorette party interestingly clad with various monetary units & mints hanging from her ensemble hamming it up two couples who wandered in with their 70's garb and took multiple \"what happens in vegas stays...\" photos.  it was a free show!  oh, the drinks were fine - my bloody mary was a bit pricey but it did come in a hurricane glass (remember those?)\n\nwhen our name was called for brunch - we were seated at a window booth (all booth seating).  the floral motif continued and was accompanied by tiffany style lighting.  we saw omelets the size of your head go by - and the line outside continued.  since it was the noon hour by this time we chose to order sliders & pesto <mark>Focaccia <mark>Pesto Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark> from our waitress wearing a carhop type of getup (short skirt).  both food orders were really good and accompanied by a copious pile of fries. \n\npeppermill seems to be a local favorite but many taxis came through too.  the after noon timeframe brought in a younger set of patrons - the line had gotten a bit shorter but it would no doubt get longer as the late night crowd woke from their night of partying.  it's on our list for a return visit.", 
            "the waffle with fruit was the best breakfast i had when i was on vacation in vegas. my boyfriend ordered a <mark>Focaccia <mark>Pesto Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark> with sweet potato fries that were cooked to perfection. might look like a strip club when you walk up to the place, but the food is delicious and well worth it.", 
            "i've eaten at the peppermill a number of times over the last 5 or 6 years. i usually arrive into vegas on a later, after-work flight from the east coast. by the time i get checked in to my hotel and all cleaned up for the evening, many of the hotel dining options are closed or things are winding down. thankfully, the peppermill is open 24 hours with a full menu. it is a fantastic diner with a great menu, and soo much character. it's clean, the wait staff is friendly and top notch. also, the late-night manager is friendly, always on her toes, and interested in hearing about the customer experience. she does a great job both supporting and orchestrating the service staff. \n\ni have ordered many entrees, both dinner <mark><mark>Half Sandwich With Soup Or Salad</mark> And Bread</mark> selections, some of which include the following:  berry <mark>Mixed Greens Or Fresh Spinach Salad</mark>, <mark>Crab Cakes</mark>, omelettes, chicken and <mark>Chicken & Red Pepper Pasta</mark>, swiss and <mark>Swiss & Mushroom Burger</mark>, <mark>Creamy Chicken Dijon</mark>, pesto <mark>Focaccia <mark>Pesto Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark>, tomato bisque, chicken noodle soup. my favorite is the <mark>Creamy Chicken Dijon</mark> dinner. two generous pieces of pounded chicken served on top of mashed potatoes with a vegetable, often green beans, and of course the <mark>Creamy Chicken Dijon</mark> sauce.  it is a large portion entree, as most of the dishes served are. i'm surprised there are not pictures of this entree in the photos section. the specialty drinks are excellent too. cocktail waitresses in black gowns take your drink order which is prepared by the bartenders in the fireside lounge. i've ordered the blue hawaii a couple of times, and i have a friend that loves the espresso martini.\n\nafter dinner, i usually get a couple of drinks in the fireside lounge. you get certain drinks comp'd if you play the video casino games at the bar. however, i have to warn you, the games seem tighter than many of the machines i've played at different locations in vegas. you may want to consider abstaining from play and just pay outright for your drinks. all in all, the lounge is a comfortable place to get a few drinks with friends after dinner.\n\ni gave this restaurant a very high rating, taking into consideration it is an upscale diner, with its own unique signature ambiance.",

            "awesomely neon restaurant with great (albeit a little overpriced) diner-style food and an \"old vegas\" feel.  when meeting out-of-towners for breakfast or lunch on the strip area, i try to take them here for the experience.  standard breakfast fare is consistently good and so are <mark>The Reuben</mark> and french fries.  have a drink in the fireside lounge if you have time, or at least poke your head inside - it's trippy.", 
            "i didn't get a chance to go into the lounge but the restaurant had an eclectic mix of people.  families, couples, party people, tourists....\nwe will definitely go back!  food was very good!\ni had <mark>The Reuben</mark> and my boyfriend had the bacon cheeseburger.  we both enjoyed both, except i think i liked his a little more.  i'll definitely get some kind of breakfast next time or a burger.\nwe also had plans to get a sundae after dinner but the portions were so large we were too full, so maybe next time.", 
            "the minute you walk through the front door and see the slot machines and pink neon lights you just know that you are in for a classic vegas experience. the peppermill has been on the north end of the vegas strip for over thirty years. many a casino has come and gone in those years but the peppermill and the adjacent firseide lounge has survived.  it is well known for its neon glow, its cute car hop uniformed waitresses and its huge food portions.\n you don't need to worry about the time <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> because the peppermill is open 24 hours and serves breakfast,lunch and dinner anytime. this makes it a perfect late night stop or the place to cure your morning after hangover. for simone and i, it was the hangover cure, and we arrived mid morning and were immediately seated.  after looking over the waitress, i mean menu, i decided to order <mark>The Reuben</mark> sandwich and french fries. simone decided to go for the breakfast menu and ordered a spinach, feta and tomato omelete with hash browns and a bran muffin. my reuben arrived first and it was massive. in fact, it was a club sandwich with three grilled and buttery homemade slices of rye bread. between the first two slices of bread was a heaping mound of fresh sauerkraut with gooey melted swiss and house made thousand island dressing. the kraut was marinated perfectly with the flavor of whole caraway seeds and was excellent as the bed for the thinly sliced pound or so of grilled pastrami which was piled high on the next layer of rye bread with more melted swiss. this was the holy grail of sandwiches and i amazingly finished the entire thing. the fries were a little to thick cut for my taste but were still fried crisp and were a good side to my sandwich.  simones omelet was almost equal in size to my sandwich . it was packed full of spinach , cheese and tomatoes and even had some surprise hash browns mixed in with it ( hopefully not left over on the grill from <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> before). simone was a light weight and only downed about 1/4 of her monster meal. the hash browns that came with the omelet were grated fresh and were grilled crispy on the outside and tender in the middle, just the way they should be and i gladly helped simone finish them.  the bran muffin also had good flavor and was nice, fresh and moist.\nthe peppermill is a great experience. come hungry, because there is plenty to eat and you will want to finish it all.  a great las vegas landmark, it is not to be missed. 4 out of 5 for the peppermill ****", 
            "if you are visiting las vegas for the first time you gotta go to the peppermill. once you enter this place the decor just screams vegas with its cool neon lights and coloful lampshades. also, if you want to get drinks before you start your meal you can just hop over to their bar area which has a wicked cool firepit and you chill around the fire with your friends. \n\nfood here is pretty tasty and the portions are huge! (which is great for sharing) i had <mark>The Reuben</mark> sandwich with fries and it was really good. if you want comfort food, this place has a bunch of it. their breakfast menu is served all day so that's another plus and it's open 24 hours (hell yeah!)", 
            "seriously epic!  i love the atmosphere here.  it's neon, but quiet and the other lights are low, so even in the heat <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark>, you feel calmer just being inside the peppermill.  i also love the colored sugar.  call me crazy, but it's fun.  \n\nthe food is great here. i can count the number of blt's i've liked in my life on one hand and the blta (avocado) at the peppermil is one of them.  i get mine on rye, because rye is the best.  fruit cups.  how many of us sigh at the fruit cup option?  they always suck, right?  not here! the peppermill fruit comes in a good sized bowl and includes strawberries, banana blueberries, grapes, and melon.  yum!  love the cottage cheese, love the chicken strips, love <mark>The Reuben</mark>.  \n\nif you don't like any of these things, don't worry, the menu has a lot of options.  i'll bet you find something you like too.",

            "this is a pretty cool themed diner. i'm not sure what the theme is but it seemed very 1970s tropical. my friends and i came here for brunch on a sunday and it was pretty packed. the food was really good and so was the bloody mary, which i guess they're known for.\n\ni got <mark>The Reuben</mark> sandwich and it was definitely one of the better reubens i've had. some of the other things my group ordered included the corned beef hash (probably everyone's favorite), eggs benedict, and some other things that didn't stand out.\n\noverall, it's worth a try if you're looking for a brunch spot on the strip that's not in the hotels.", 
            "service was excellent.  once seated we didn't have to wait long. food is good, we had <mark>The Reuben</mark> sandwich which was the best we'd ever had. good portions, and worth the 30 min wait."

            "on our way out of vegas on monday morning, we decided to check out the peppermill which some friends had told us about. for a monday morning, it was pretty crowded when we arrived at 10:30 am. wait time was about 20 minutes before we were seated at a table. we weren't in a huge rush, so it didn't bother us.\n\nthe first thing i noticed when we walked in was the large amount of neon pink throughout the restaurant. not only that, but there are also lots of fake trees and plants. it totally gives it a kitschy diner feel and reminds me of why i love vegas! the menu is large and you can get anything on it 24 hours a day. feeling hungry for an omelet - check; feeling like a chicken caesar wrap - check; does <mark>New York Steak And Shrimp Scampi</mark> sound good - check; how about ribs - check. if you're craving it, i bet it's on the peppermill menu.\n\nmy husband and i stuck <mark><mark>Half Sandwich With Soup Or Salad</mark> And Bread</mark> since it was mid-morning. i had the eggs and bacon and my husband had a belgian waffle. he liked the waffle well enough and it was quite large. my scrambled eggs were cooked well (not watery at all) and my bacon came out crispy as ordered. i hated the hash browns - not only were they not cooked all the way, but they lacked the crispiness that i prefer. it was basically just a pile of potato on the plate. for a soda, glass of orange juice and 2 breakfast entrees, our bill came to $29 before tip.\n\nwe were a tad disappointed in the food, but i guess if you go late at night after a full night of drinking, it probably is decent.",

            "i've eaten at the peppermill a number of times over the last 5 or 6 years. i usually arrive into vegas on a later, after-work flight from the east coast. by the time i get checked in to my hotel and all cleaned up for the evening, many of the hotel dining options are closed or things are winding down. thankfully, the peppermill is open 24 hours with a full menu. it is a fantastic diner with a great menu, and soo much character. it's clean, the wait staff is friendly and top notch. also, the late-night manager is friendly, always on her toes, and interested in hearing about the customer experience. she does a great job both supporting and orchestrating the service staff. \n\ni have ordered many entrees, both dinner <mark><mark>Half Sandwich With Soup Or Salad</mark> And Bread</mark> selections, some of which include the following:  berry <mark>Mixed Greens Or Fresh Spinach Salad</mark>, <mark>Crab Cakes</mark>, omelettes, chicken and <mark>Chicken & Red Pepper Pasta</mark>, swiss and <mark>Swiss & Mushroom Burger</mark>, <mark>Creamy Chicken Dijon</mark>, pesto <mark>Focaccia <mark>Pesto Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark>, tomato bisque, chicken noodle soup. my favorite is the <mark>Creamy Chicken Dijon</mark> dinner. two generous pieces of pounded chicken served on top of mashed potatoes with a vegetable, often green beans, and of course the <mark>Creamy Chicken Dijon</mark> sauce.  it is a large portion entree, as most of the dishes served are. i'm surprised there are not pictures of this entree in the photos section. the specialty drinks are excellent too. cocktail waitresses in black gowns take your drink order which is prepared by the bartenders in the fireside lounge. i've ordered the blue hawaii a couple of times, and i have a friend that loves the espresso martini.\n\nafter dinner, i usually get a couple of drinks in the fireside lounge. you get certain drinks comp'd if you play the video casino games at the bar. however, i have to warn you, the games seem tighter than many of the machines i've played at different locations in vegas. you may want to consider abstaining from play and just pay outright for your drinks. all in all, the lounge is a comfortable place to get a few drinks with friends after dinner.\n\ni gave this restaurant a very high rating, taking into consideration it is an upscale diner, with its own unique signature ambiance.",

            "loved the atmosphere inside of here. it's more or less a classic diner, but then in the back there is a fire pit built into the table that we sat at which was different and provided for a beautiful ambiance. sitting at the table and sipping our drinks was very relaxing and there were many people here on dates or catching up with a friend. the waitresses wore long black dresses which seemed elegant, classic and i thought was interesting. our waitress was friendly and helpful with the menu. i ordered a chocolate chip martini which was delicious, but i expected it to be a bit more flavorful. my friend ordered a frozen scooby doo martini which she did not really enjoy. we shared the appetizer sampler which was huge. it came <mark><mark>Half Sandwich With Soup Or Salad</mark> And Bread</mark> chicken, fried shrimp, mozzarella sticks, and onion rings. the food was ok, nothing too crazy. best items were the mozzarella sticks and the chicken. after about two pieces of food each, we both began to feel very sick and nauseous so we didn't even finish our food. \n\nrating this place a four because i thought my drink was good and the atmosphere is just unrivaled and different. good place to grab a drink and order a lot of food! open 24 hours which is really awesome!",

            "the peppermill is a tradition for me, i always plan to come here at least one late night every time i'm in town. what i love about this place obviously is the 24 hours of service, very \"vegas\" ambiance (neon everywhere with mirror walls) and very good food and service. service again is awesome, they even have cocktail waitresses that serve alcohol with your dinner. \n\ni would recommend hands down the <mark>Bbq Pork Ribs</mark> dinner , the meat is so tender it falls off the bones and the rack is so big it hangs off the plate. get it with a side of onion rings, chicken chowder soup and a coke and you are set! other notable favorites include the chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark>, <mark>Tangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap</mark> and lasagna.\n\nthe lounge inside the restaurant is also pretty fun especially if you are like me and do not really prefer the loud expensive ass clubs on the strip.", 
            "i freaking love this place!  all the times i would go to vegas and drive by, i would think--i  want to go there because it looked so funny.  \n\nanyways, last february is the first time i went to the peppermill with my then fiance--but now turned hubby.  :)  he said this place is linked to a chain in norcal and tahoe?  anyways...it was pure bliss.  much better than most food at the hotels.  \n\ni had the <mark>Tangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap</mark>.  it was amazing!  my husband had the patty melt and it was delish!  the portions are huge...great leftovers when you wake up all cruda the next morning!  plus they are open 24 hours...so you can go in all drunk, lol!  anyways, this place is awesome and funky.  they have red white and blue sugar granules that you can even buy!\n\nthe lounge is awesome and they have these cocktail servers that roam the restaurant in these funky black dressses and the servers in the restaurant wear funky polyester uniforms...pretty funny.  i loved the fireside lounge too!  so funny!  good crowd!  i love places like these! :)", 
            "of all the places i went in las vegas, the fireside lounge in the peppermill was my favorite.\n\nthe peppermill itself is what everyone says it is. dim lighting, hookery-looking waitresses, flamingo lights, cherry blossom trees, and pretty great food.\n\nwe got sandwiches and cocktails. \n\nmy boyfriend got \"the conquest\". it was awesome. it's a combination of roast beef, cheddar cheese, tomato, saut\\u00e9ed peppers, onions, mushrooms, thousand island dressing and bacon, served on grilled parmesan sourdough bread. yum.\n\ni got the <mark>Tangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap</mark>, which was delicious, but not as fantastic as the conquest. \n\ni was really surprised by the quality of the food. we weren't even drunk yet and it was still pretty excellent.\n\nas for the service, it was good. restaurant was clean. only complaint would be i guess that they don't know how to make most of the cocktails we suggested, and didn't have the ingredients for most of them.\n\nbut i digress.... next we went to the fireside lounge, which i love love loved. it wasn' busy, so we got a nice cozy spot on the couch around the fire. watching old live music performances on the tv above the fire.\n\nas suggested, we got the scorpion bowl. it was huge. huge i say! by the time we left, we were really full between having just eaten, and having drank about a gallon of booze. service was good, it was a chill environment, and you can smoke inside. what more could i ask for? \n\nalso the people we shared the fire with were all super nice, unpretentious and locals. which is a nice break from all the flashy obnoxious girls and guys doing vegas for the first time. \n\nso like i said, i really liked this place, especially the fireside lounge.", 
            "*blink* i don't get it. \ni'm the easiest person to please when it comes to food. even taco bell tastes like gourmet 5 star cuisine when you're drunk and hungry. \n\nmaybe it's because i'm from the south where we have stellar home cookin', but this place was not good. i'm giving it 2 stars because it wasn't terrible, but it definitely was not good. \nmy girl friends and i stumbled into this place at 5 or 6am after my bachelorette party because our cabbie recommended it and it was right next to the riviera where we were staying. \n\nus: can we walk back to riviera in our heels from there?\ncabbie: girl, you can crawl.\n\nnuff said. let's go there.\nwe got a wide variety of stuff- corned beef & hash, biscuits & sausage gravy, <mark>Tangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap</mark>, something else, and something else (sorry, the night was a bit hazy haha). we tried a bite of everyone else's food, and not one of us 5 girls were the least bit impressed. \n\nnext time i'm in vegas, i'll go to the 24 hour indian place inside riviera if i'm hungry in the middle of the night/morning. too bad i didn't find out about it until my last 2 hours there.", 
            "i have been making regular stops to fireside lounge for a while now and i really like it. the lighting and decor would do it for me alone.  booths tucked behind fake plants. fire coming out of water.  it feels kinda like being in a fish tank. a pink fish tank. \n\nthey serve all manner of sweet, strong, and overly garnished cocktails. tall ones, short ones, pink ones, and blue ones. some of the drinks are the size of fish bowls.\npink fish bowls.\n\nthe bartenders are in black and white and the cocktail waitresses are wearing evening wear. drinking these crazy drinks in such an atmosphere can really have a good effect on the old disposition. if you know what i mean.\n\nso i have visited the lounge a bunch and never so much as walked into the restaurant. so the last time i was in town it was time.  \n\nthe ambiance was the same as the lounge only a bit brighter and more restaurant like. which might have something to do with the fact that it is indeed a restaurant.\n\nthe evening gown clad waitress came over and brought us mai tais and what not. the restaurant waitress was dressed interesting also, i think. all were nice.\n\nthe food was quite good and served in over sized portions. pancakes, omelets, burgers and stuff like that. i personally had <mark>Tangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap</mark> due to some reviews i have read. i would not normally order some such thing like that. it was really good. everything everybody got was good. big salads and other bullshit i don't remember. \n\nso two good things in one building. and it's on the strip, albeit the ass end of the strip. and for desert you can go across the street to the riviera. go get it.", 
            "a local recommended peppermill to my family on our recent trip to lv.  we went for brunch and found it was packed.  the neon lights made it look more like a strip club than a diner (i've never been to a strip club, i'm assuming from what i've seen on how i met your mother...) we had about a 10 minute wait before we were seated- all of the staff were very friendly.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Tangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap</mark>.  it was served with a massive amount of fries, but they had a funny taste (not sure what type of oil they use?).  my wrap had more tomatoes and lettuce than chicken, disappointingly..  my relatives ordered the french toast, which was a huge portion, and they really seemed to enjoy it.  overall, an inexpensive place to eat with a variety of choices, but not a \"top\" restaurant by any means.",

            "this place is waaaaay over hyped! i found this place on yelp and decided to go on christmas day! we walked in and as expected, there was a long line to be seated. that was ok since it's christmas and there are a lot of big parties waiting to sit. but we finally get seated and the booth was nice and roomy and the decorations looked like something out of pulp fiction when they go to the diner with the cars, very colorful with trees inside the dining room and even colorful sugar on the table. we had 4 (yes i'm not exaggerating) ask for our drink order from the bar! i get it that's a money maker. we order a bloody marry and it arrives 5 min later. it was ok. nothing to write home about. \nour waiter comes over and introduces himself (really laying it on thick for the tip no less) and again i get it! it christmas and he's working so he might as well make money. but then he tells us to look over the menu and that hell be back in a few min! 20 min later after i've asked several of the bus boys to call over our waiter, he shows up and takes our order. i guess he could tell from my facial expression that i was pissed so he kept a smile on his face and took our orders fast. we order the appetizer sampler (fried shrimp, fried <mark>Chicken Fingers</mark>, onion rings, bruschetta, and cheese sticks), <mark>Tangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap</mark> and nachos. the sampler was decent, the wrap too but the nachos were awful! i huge plate full of chips, a little bit of semi melted cheese, raw onions and a lot of black olives emptied from a can right on too!!!! it was just awful (baja fresh and la salsa have way better nachos). \nit came with a side (small in comparison to how much chips was in the plate ) of sour cream and old (brown guacamole) for almost $16!!!!! \nso we ate a little bit of this and that just kind of picking on the plates and finally decided it was time to go! we asked for a few boxes and the check! the waiter comes back and is completely confused as to the drink we ordered. he kept asking us if we ordered a sunrise something and i kept telling him no! that all we ordered was the bloody marry and it was still on the table. he tried to help us pack the nachos and just broke the chips by pushing it down to try to make it fit. on our check we were charged for the sunrise something and i wanted to flag the guy down and tell him but my husband was so over it that we just paid and left!\n\nall in all, go here only if you're hungover, have the munchies or don't care at all what you put into your body! i can't for the life of me figure out all these good reviews. i'm usually very easy going but that was one of the most awful experiences in a restaurant /diner that i've had with both food and service. you're only paying for the decorations/ ambiance! \ndon't waste your time and money here. there was way better local places to try! the 2 stars are for the ambiance and cute colored sugar on the table! that's it!!! good luck!",

            "usually a 24 hour restaurant, i usually think of denny's. mainly a little less then average place, just to have something to eat and not much to really look at, except the other booth of people around you. but peppermill, proved me wrong about 24 hour restaurants, and looks more then an average place. now this was an ideal 24 hour restaurants, that i wish it could take over denny's. then i would be coming there all the time. \n\nlocated next to riveria, its a very colorful restaurant on the strip. of course i had my doubts about going here, but glad my wife twisted my arm and go. outside, it may look a bit unsure on cause its close to downtown. but despite the fancy looks that you can see on the outside, inside, is a whole different story. the seating is not like no other picnic table booth, its basically a curved booth with nice, colorful seating. you don't have to worry about being smooshed against the wall anymore. each booth is like curved like the letter \"c\", all over the restaurant. it has very nice lighting, and very wonderful arrangements, like your in the rainforest. not like rainforest cafe, but a bit less elaborate then rainforest cafe. \n\nthe staff was wonderful, we were seated right away, we were served drinks, once we were seated. our waitress was very nice as well. they all wore colorful uniforms and made the place interesting. she always made sure that we were okay. \n\nlooking over the menu, the pricing was a bit more then i expected. but once i got my food, i can see why. the food was in big portions. i ordered the <mark>New York New York</mark> steak, and ordered it well done. i was amazed that it came out well done. i mean, no pink what so ever on that meat. usually when i order steak, it doesn't seem well done, but this time around, it was. made me think about next time i come here, i should order medium. i don't mind pink, but i thought like any other place i had a well done steak, it had little pink. but i really did enjoy my <mark>New York New York</mark> steak. it did come with a salad, and it came big. also came with onion rings that were big. mainly everything was big, even my wife's coffee cup was big. as much as i wanted to try to finish it, i couldn't. i came so close though. finish the salad, the steak, but threw in the towel with 3 onion rings left. \n\nif your looking for a place to eat in the middle of the night. peppermill will surely not disappoint. the pricing may be more then usual, but its well worth the price, especially when everything comes at you in big portions. very well recommended 24 hour restaurant.", 
            "omigod, i don't know how we managed to miss this place in the 9 or so years we've been in vegas!  i'd heard about it forever, but finally went after a performance of la cage aux folles at the smith center ran a lot longer than we expected.  it was late, we were very hungry, and i figured they'd be open.\n\ni was unprepared for all the neon.  but i love neon, so this place had my kind of vibe.  it took a long time to slog through the big menu, but as we were looking i was also noticing the size of the portions passing by, so we decided to share an omelet, with hash browns and a toasted bagel.\n\nthe omelet was gargantuan, and when i asked our waitress how many eggs it had, she said \"about 10.\"  that meant four eggs for me, since i always make sure hubby has a bigger portion.  that's usually my quota for six months.  i've never been a big fan of home fries, but these were the bomb;  i just couldn't stop eating them.  my only nit was the bagel, which was barely toasted, but i think even more toasting couldn't have saved it.  you can't pass off this thing with a whole to a <mark>New York New York</mark> and really get away with it.  it looked like a bagel, but didn't quack like one.\n\nwe didn't have drinks, but had a good time looking at the mammoth drink being shared at the table next to us.  next time we will indulge, either in the restaurant, or in the lounge, which i made sure to check out before we left.  spectacular!, and i can't wait to try it.\n\nthis all took place the night before i was to leave for jersey for an extended period.  the next night, friends were arriving from the east coast, and where did hubby take them?  you guessed righ.  and that couple liked it so much that all three of them went back the next night, too.   with all that food, i hope i'll recognize my husband by the time i get back!\n\npeppermill is the closest thing to our beloved east coast greek diners, but in true vegas style, glitzier, bigger, brighter, and over the top.  in a good way.",

            "this is an excellent place for meals in vegas. breakfast all the time but the place is upbeat and alive with great food that comes out fast and is good to eat. the portions are enormous so come hungry. bagels don't expect <mark>New York New York</mark> but the rest is top of the line. love the sour dough myself. ambience is adult but fun.", 
            "have to say, great 24 hour diner. my cohorts went to bed early because of a long day ahead for tomorrow, but i'm a late night person (usually go to bed around 3:30-4am) so i left them in the room & went exploring. we were staying at circus circus, and after walking around for an hour just checking things out i decided to kill a little bit of time playing slots. now, i'm not into gambling but i figured i'm in vegas so i might as well do a little bit of gambling. within 5 minutes of sitting down i won over $20 on a slot machine so i decided i would cash out & use the money for a late night steak dinner. i didn't see anything at circus circus that fit the bill so i went out walking and within a few blocks saw the peppermill. i figured that was the place.\n\nit was pretty much packed so i sat at the counter. after looking the menu over i quickly decided on the <mark>New York New York</mark> strip & eggs. the place was bustling with patrons & countless waitresses buzzing around. i ordered my steak rare, my eggs sunny side up, the hash browns crispy & an english muffin. the waitress was nice, friendly & attentive.\n\neverything came out as ordered. the 'shred' on the hash browns were larger than typical but i found them to make the texture even better than the normal shred. i found nothing wrong with each item in my dinner. the steak was rare, tender & trimmed properly. eggs were spot on sunny side up. hash browns crispy. everything was exactly what i was wanting in a late night dinner. adding a few dollars for a tip to my winnings, i paid & left satisfied."

            "someone else called this place overpriced, but it's waaaaaaayyyy cheaper than most of the hotel steakhouses now.  you can get a steak here for $29.50 max, and that's with <mark>New York Steak And Shrimp Scampi</mark>.  we ended up going here instead of eating at the steakhouse in the paris, where a steak was $40.  of course, you could probably eat at ihop or denny's for cheaper, but we wanted to go someplace that we'd never been to.\n\nwe were blown away by the shiny ceilings, neon, flamingo lamps, and the goofy trees all over.  i would say it's worth it just to see the decor.  \n\nthey have a cocktail waitress that never came to our table, which was really annoying.  we had six people that wanted to drink, so i guess it was their loss.  \n\nthe food came in shockingly vast quantities and most of us left with our plates still half full of food.  we ordered two breakfasts, two steaks, and one pasta dish and everyone enjoyed their meal.  i have no idea if we'll be back unless someone in our party hasn't seen the place, as the food is really just diner food, but it's a good place to experience if you're dying for something that is typical las vegas and worth taking photos of.", 
            "on our way out of vegas on monday morning, we decided to check out the peppermill which some friends had told us about. for a monday morning, it was pretty crowded when we arrived at 10:30 am. wait time was about 20 minutes before we were seated at a table. we weren't in a huge rush, so it didn't bother us.\n\nthe first thing i noticed when we walked in was the large amount of neon pink throughout the restaurant. not only that, but there are also lots of fake trees and plants. it totally gives it a kitschy diner feel and reminds me of why i love vegas! the menu is large and you can get anything on it 24 hours a day. feeling hungry for an omelet - check; feeling like a chicken caesar wrap - check; does <mark>New York Steak And Shrimp Scampi</mark> sound good - check; how about ribs - check. if you're craving it, i bet it's on the peppermill menu.\n\nmy husband and i stuck <mark><mark>Half Sandwich With Soup Or Salad</mark> And Bread</mark> since it was mid-morning. i had the eggs and bacon and my husband had a belgian waffle. he liked the waffle well enough and it was quite large. my scrambled eggs were cooked well (not watery at all) and my bacon came out crispy as ordered. i hated the hash browns - not only were they not cooked all the way, but they lacked the crispiness that i prefer. it was basically just a pile of potato on the plate. for a soda, glass of orange juice and 2 breakfast entrees, our bill came to $29 before tip.\n\nwe were a tad disappointed in the food, but i guess if you go late at night after a full night of drinking, it probably is decent.",

            "peppermill is a fixture on las vegas blvd.  located just south of the old rivera hotel and casino, it's within walking distance of the casino properties on the north end of the strip.  i had heard about it for years and they have a website that makes the place look pretty darned cool.  i finally made it there when a relative came into town, was staying on the strip and wanted to meet us near their hotel. it was the right time to give the peppermill a try.\n\nhonestly, everything was just okay.  certainly nothing was bad or wrong, but nothing was better than average.  i was a little surprised.  we went back again several weeks later, but the experience was the same.\n\nthe waitstaff did just what waitstaffs do:  seated us, took our order, filled our drinks when they were empty (but didn't keep them from going empty), and brought us our check when we appeared to be finished.  they didn't take too long for anything and didn't rush us either.  get in, eat, get out.  average.\n\nthe food was average too.  this was disappointing since i had heard so much about the peppermill before--almost all very positive.  i don't even remember what i had the first time, and i rarely forget what i order at a place the first time i'm there.  the second time i ordered the <mark>Southwestern Beef Kabobs</mark>.  they tasted fine, but were overcooked and dry as a result.  i'm pretty sure they sat under a heating lamp while the other dishes were being prepared since the vegetables were also dry.  again, not bad, but not really great either.  i'd expect this kind of food in a roadside diner, not in a fairly well-known restaurant and arguably a feature on the las vegas strip.\n\nthe atmosphere is unique but nothing special.  it's certainly a cool change from sitting in another generic restaurant, but it seems they may have once been a special place but have now forgotten they're on the strip in the middle of a city known for an amazing assortment of all kinds of amazing restaurants and a huge variety of food.  the website make the place look very cool.  better on the web than in person.  once again, not bad but not great either.  just average, and i'm not sure average can survive on the strip these days.\n\nparking is super easy:  park right there in front of the restaurant.\n\ni sincerely hope the peppermill doesn't go the way of the old sahara and the riviera.  they could be something great.  (they should be something great.)  if you're on that part of las vegas blvd and need a decent place to eat, it'll certainly suffice.  but with all the choices within just a few miles, i'd honestly go elsewhere.  there are too many other great restaurants to chose from.  even though the peppermill is okay, because they don't seem to care about where they are or what they could be, i can't give it more than two stars."

            "after being at the peppermill for the first time, i was kicking myself mentally that i hadn't been here sooner.  i enjoyed everything about it, from the large, comfortable booth with royal blue, aqua, and lavender fabric in which we sat; the immediate pouncing on us after we were seated by water carrier, cocktail waitress, and server in quick succession; the snappy, blue and white, mini-skirted uniforms of the servers; the swirling neon blue and pink tubes of light overhead and tube of red light circling around the dining room below; the immense menu; to the wonderfully tasty and generously sized food that diane and i enjoyed on a recent tuesday night.  and, as we entered and left the restaurant, every served dish i saw on other diners' plates looked massive, well crafted, and tasty.\n\ni began our late dinner with a bowl of beef barley soup.  it contained cubed beef, barley, mushroom slices, tomato, celery, and a real tasty, oily beef broth.  the only negative is that the mushrooms appeared to be of the canned variety.  \n\nan excellent <mark>Mixed Greens Or Fresh Spinach Salad</mark> with egg, fresh spinach leaves, bacon, and a catalina dressing that tasted like hot bacon dressing was next, followed by a blta packed with bacon, red tomato, lettuce, an ample smear of mayonnaise, and huge, beautifully green and yellow, cool chunks of perfectly ripe avocado on lightly toasted sourdough bread as i had requested.  numerous french fries were also on the plate, because i had forgotten to order desired potato salad, which was an included alternative, along with a choice of cottage cheese, onion rings, or a fruit cup.  so, just a little belatedly, i ordered and paid for a side of potato salad.  when it arrived in a large teardrop dish, my work in dispatching this large side, along with my jam-packed sandwich, began.  but it was easy to do, for this excellent creamy white, mayonnaise-based dill potato salad with skin-on red potatoes and celery was simply delicious.  the fries were good, but i enjoyed the potato salad more.\n\ndiane, meanwhile, raved about the 3 large and juicy arctic cod fillets and the incredible amount of crisp deep-fried curly fries that covered her platter and constituted an order of <mark>Icelandic Fish And Chips</mark>.  she also very much liked her excellent, rich hot chocolate with whipped cream.  as usual, i finished all of my meal, and diane ate what she could, and had the rest packed for lunch at home.\n\nbut we were by no means done.  i had my eye on another peppermill offering as soon as i read through the gargantuan menu, and diane was game, as well.  so, to cap off a fine dinner, we ordered a colossal hot fudge sundae to share.\n\nand, this was some sundae.  besides a generous supply of french vanilla ice cream in a large and high elongated glass sundae dish, this treat featured mini-chocolate chips, chopped peanuts, a mountain of whipped cream, an obligatory cherry on top, and a load of warm and sweet hot fudge (see pic)--likely four times the amount of hot fudge one will find in the average hot fudge sundae served elsewhere.  i asked our server how many scoops of ice cream were in our sundae, and she replied that normally 3 scoops are included but this was the first one she had ever made, and because she wanted us to be pleased with it, she had put in five scoops!  i highly recommend this dish--but not for just 1 person!  it was so wonderfully good that diane and i finished it all--but just barely! \n\nthis was a great meal with very friendly and mostly great service.  only my specially ordered potato salad was initially forgotten temporarily, and i had to ask once for an iced tea refill.  otherwise our server checked on us several times during our meal to make sure all was well and we were not wanting for anything. \n\nwe peeked inside the fireside lounge before we left, and it looked like a great romantic place to have drinks with a special partner around the fire pit.\n\na couple other pluses about the peppermill are that it is open 24/7, and access to lot parking is easy right off las vegas boulevard just in front of the restaurant.  i expect to become a regular here, and work my way through the vast and enticing menu.  \n\neasily five stars!", 
            "i went to the peppermill for my 21st bday, and got my first drink there.\n\ni purposefully went looking for somewhere to go for my 21st, and i loved all the photos of the outside and inside of the peppermill. when i got there, i was not disappointed by its looks. sure, some may think its too \"vegas-y\" or tacky but i really enjoyed the uniqueness.\n\nas for the food, the portions are large but finish-able, i had a pancake breakfast for dinner and my boyfriend had the <mark>Icelandic Fish And Chips</mark> (curly fries) and we were both happy. i tried a mai tai and it was pretty big and delicious, though i can't compare it to other mai tai's as it was my first drink.\n\nthe staff were very helpful, and we even got a free souvenir photo! \n\nif you're going to vegas, i'd definitely stop by at least once (or twice). also, large parking lot!", 
            "i took my baby boy here for his 27th birthday dinner since we had such a great experience on our last visit. he loves this restaurant and it is a real treat since it really is one of a kind.\n\nthis restaurant has a fun atmosphere, great service, great food and always leaves you full and happy every time!\n\nwe ordered <mark>Icelandic Fish And Chips</mark> and <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> which came with choice of bread <mark>Steak And Mushroom Salad</mark> or soup. the both of these dishes were fantastic and he had to take half of his meal home as there must have been 2 pounds of curly fries with his <mark>Icelandic Fish And Chips</mark> lol.\n\ni snuck away and informed the staff that we were celebrating a birthday so i picked out a dessert to present him with!\n\ni chose <mark>The Elegant Brownie</mark>, a yummy chocolate fudge brownie served steaming hot with a mound of creamy french vanilla ice cream, smothered in warm chocolate fudge sauce and layered with whipped cream and sprinkles.  this dessert was ridiculous good, that homemade brownie and combination of fudge and ice cream was insane orgasmic good! \n\nthey came to the table with his dessert lit up with a candle and sang happy birthday and it was so much fun!\n\nour experience is always stellar here and every time they always manage to top the last visit.", 
            "today was the first time i have ever been to the peppermill and unfortunately i was very disappointed. especially because my friends talked so highly of this place.\n\nfirst we checked out the fireside lounge and it was happy hour. my friends and i ordered the famous scorpion drink and man it was super strong! for our appetizers we ordered <mark>Crab Cakes</mark>, <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> <mark>Icelandic Fish And Chips</mark> and salsa.  the <mark>Crab Cakes</mark> could have been better. to me there was really no flavor to them. \n\nafter hanging out in the fireside lounge we went over to grab something to eat for dinner. we got <mark>Fettuccine Alfredo</mark>, <mark>New York Steak And Shrimp Scampi</mark> acapulco, and pork loin and eggs. my boyfriend and i were very disappointed with our food. my <mark>New York Steak And Shrimp Scampi</mark> wasn't good at all. so bland.\n\nall in all, i don't think i'll ever come back for the food but definitely for drinks and appetizers.", 
            "a great tool to have handy if you tend to run a 24 hr schedule while in vegas, this place is a magnet for locals as well as tourists and convention goers.  that being said, if you want to get a group in there at a specific time, be sure to get a reservation in advance.  there's plenty of counter \"diner style\" seating if you're on your own or a couple, though, so walking in might work.  i've eaten here so many i times  over the years i've lost count :)\n\ngreat to be able to get breakfast all day!  nothing like getti g up at 5 pm after a long night on the craps tables and being able to get your pancakes and eggs.\n\nlarge.... nay, gigantic, portions on many items.  nachoes are at least 4 people, fruit plate is easily big enough for 3-4, etc.  hefty burgers, big bowls of soup and generous portions of fish on the <mark>Icelandic Fish And Chips</mark> (watch this dish, if the grease is a little old in the fryer it might not be the best).  definately a handy spot even if it is on the far end of the strip.", 
            "the ladies who welcomed us in were very sweet but our waitress and the rest of the employees working seemed absolutely miserable. the decor was very strip club-esque. i asked multiple times for a waitress so j could order a drink but no one ever came to take our order. i got the french toast which came before the rest of the food and it was good. my boyfriend got the <mark>Icelandic Fish And Chips</mark> but his fries were so hard we couldn't eat them. we never got a refill on our water and our waitress stopped by our table once before we had to call her over to get the check. we will not be eating here again."

            "you know those places you always imagine in your head, swanky, slightly tacky, and reeking of all that is the spirit of vegas....but you can never find. well, the peppermill is the stuff vegas dreams are made of. this is vegas. \n\nthe decor is bright and dramatic with a blatant disregard for subtly, and yet is perfectly muted so that even the worst hang-over would be welcomed by it's glowing neon. \n\nwe had breakfast. the omelets were huge and fluffy with plenty of toppings. the oatmeal was well prepared with a nice helping of raisins and banana. \n\nmy chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark>, which is my go-to dining out breakfast, was absolutely spot on. one of the best i've ever had. \n\nall in all, i would highly recommend skipping the buffets and going to the peppermill instead.", 
            "a week in vegas, my husband and i went there for two lunches. first, it's because it's easier to find tables. and, it was close to the convention center. of course, the food was good too!\n\ni had the club sandwiches for the first time. there was a lot of bacon and ham. the bread was toasted. it was great. and, it came with a lot of fries! \n\nthe second time, my husband and i shared 22oz strawberry milk shake. it was huge and great!!! my husband and i loved it! \n\nalso, i ordered chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark>. that was my first chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark>. it was covered with gravy. it was crunchy and flavorful. the steak was so big that i didn't even touch the eggs. haha... \n\ni like this place. it is a nice little dinner. the decor was very cute. it is a bit off the strip, but it's close enough. i think that it is a great breakfast place with a good price in vegas. give it a try!", 
            "who doesn't like a throwback to the mirrored ceiling/neon lit days of old vegas??  this place is awesome!  from the huge breakfast portions, to the breakfast bloody marys, to the waitresses (i swear ours was a stripper at nite!).  the best part of this place, the fireside lounge!  straight out of an '70s porn set/ night club scene!  i love it!!!\n\nthe food was pretty good, country <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> & eggs, how can you go wrong?  and how would you know if it was wrong because its smothered in yummy gravy!  the corned beef hash was pretty good, nice and salty.  the one flop of the meal was someone's peppermill omelet.  otherwise, the steak and eggs were good, as were the pancakes.  another goodie was the bloody mary that was brought out by the drink hostess in a long black evening dress @ 10am.  fun!\n\nall in all a fun experience!", 
            "great great brunch/diner\n\nwhat i had:\n- country <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> + eggs w/biscuit + gravy: uhm... pretty perfect. i loved the crunch of the steak. hashed browns were perfect - hot and fluffy with plenty of crunch! eggs were... you know, eggs. nothing amazing, but nothing to complain about. biscuit was fluffy, flaky and light! amazing smothered with the country gravy\n- bloody mary: they do it right! spicy, flavorful, i had this at the fireside lounge before we got our table and nearly drank the entire thing. its like a freaking meal in a cup!\n\nfor two breakfast entres and two coffees it came out to about $45 (doesnt include the bloody mary) with tip... so, not as cheap as dennys, but i think it was worth every penny.\n\npros:\n- food! well... i cant really speak for anything other than what i ate and drank... but it looks like they do breakfast foods great. the menu looked extensive! i had to limit how much i could look at because if i looked at anything i wouldnt be able to order\n- service: pretty good. jennifer was cheerful and had a great attitude. she wasnt always the most attentive, but i went in at the end of father's day brunch, so everyone looked swamped. but despite being busy, she always remained positive and happy\n- location: right on the strip towards the north end, its a great 24 hour place that serves great food\n\ncons:\n- decor: ... honestly, i went back and forth because i wasnt sure if this was a pro or con for this place. yes its damn cheesy and outdated and wacky. i cant imagine a time when the decor or the servers' outfits would have been fashionable... but, it kind of works with the feel of it. the fireside lounge is pretty cheesy too. it seems straight out of the seventies but... it makes this place memorable! id prefer the blatant outmoded fashion and decor then a place that just tries too hard to look modern and ends up looking commercial (think the wynn decor... yuck!)\n- part of the decor i guess, but this place was freaking dark. maybe just part of the ambiance, but weird to eat your breakfast in such a dark place\n\nanyways, despite the cheesy outdated decor (think dennys + disco + lots <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> purple stuff), would i go back again? yes! why? the food was amazing. i love breakfast places. so instead of spending big bucks at a brunch buffet, why not just get it right at the peppermill?", 
            "came here for breakfast on our way out of town after a friend recommended.  \n\ni think i expected too much - it was just ok.  \n\nportions were large, but my bloody mary was awful.  i got eggs benedict (was pretty good), husband got chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> & eggs, which he didn't come close to finishing - said it was not that great.\n\natmosphere was super cool, service was ok and food was ok.  i'll give it another try next time we're in vegas, and will definitely check out the fireside lounge.", 
            "i'm on a chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> hunt. heard the peppermill was good.  when we sat down, we knew the portions would be big because the coffee mugs were pint size.  meaning they hold 16 ounces of coffee.  okay, here we go.  i got the cfs.  sis got the belgium waffle.  the cfs wasn't as big as the ones in the photo, but this one was thick. really thick.  i think my steak was double thick, so it was still huge.  flavor was good and crunchy.  it's a deep fried variety with a sausage gravy on top.  hash browns were a bit soggy.  they are not spending enough time on the grill.  they are turning too much hash in a short period of time. the belgium waffle was perfect.  absolutely perfect.  the definitely whip the egg whites because this waffle is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.", 
            "passed by this place many times but never bothered to stop by.. until, we did a \"nearby\" search on my yelp app... mann, have i been missin' out for the last few years!! \n\nfirst off, the atmosphere/decor is definitely out of the ordinary and most likely inspired from a nightclub/strip club.. disco ball glass, cherry blossom trees and neon lights.. interesting and totally vegas!\n\nwhat will make me come back again and again:\n\n<mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark>: this was the best chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> i've ever had! crispy, crispy chicken breading, good thickness, tender and so flavorful!! the gravy was great and just made it even better! it came with some of the best hash browns i've ever had!! yes, this plate was a double whammy!! the hash had the typical string/shredded potatoes but wider cuts and an amplified potato flavor!! the eggs, i tried their scrambled eggs and they were tastier than average and fluffier than normal. plus, i opted with a side of white toast. the toast was ordinary but it came with a delicious strawberry jam. to top it off, this entree could easily feed two starving people!!! \n\nfrench toast: another generous dish that came with 6 fat 1/2slices of texas toast that were frenched up correctly! nice soft butter and maple syrup (not too thick) just brought it home! traditional and executed right! \n\nmarinated pork chops: came with 2 bone-in cuts, grilled with the nice evident checker marks and lightly seasoned with herbs and spices. not bad but nothing compared to the southern/chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark>. this also came with a small slices of apples and sauce. the side of hash browns.. you know how i feel about those! this time, i went with egg whites and a bagel with cream cheese for the included choice of sides. egg whites were great (similar to the scrambled eggs) and the bagel was massive and satisfying (no, einstein bagel but it did the job).\n\ndined here twice now, within a week and this place isn't around the block.. hint, hint.. service both times were flawless.. veteran servers: know what to say, how to say it and when to say it.. fast service, follow-ups.. i like the feel and atmosphere, much different the norm. prices are alright, they pile on the food and quality is there. i'm hooked on their <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> and eggs!!! and  hash browns!",

            "peppermill, ah peppermill. not quite sure what kind of a theme they were going for here, but it definitely screams tacky. \n\nthe menu is reminiscent of much pricier denny's or norm's, but the sizes are at least considerably larger.  \n\nservice is just alright, nothing to write home about. in fact i think the waitress forgot my friend's eggs. eggs, how do you forgot eggs when it's the most common denominator in each menu item. \n\ni ordered chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> and eggs, and split that with my buddy who got ribs. yep ribs. so many it isn't just a glorified denny's after all. \n\noh and who needs alcohol when you can get a tall cup full of hot cocoa with a heaping shitton of whipped cream. hmmmmmm whipped cream on top of more whipped cream.\n\nthe chicken <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> was decent, eggs and taters were done well. the ribs were disappointing. meat wasn't tender at all and it was swimming in bbq sauce. probably to mask that concrete-textured meat. and it came with fried rice. like chinese style fried rice. what the heck was going on with that?\n\ni was told the eggs benedict were good. i can't comment cause i'm generally not a fan, and therefore didn't bother to try it.  i also didn't get to check out the highly acclaimed club part of the diner. lol. firepits and loveseats.  maybe i'd give it a higher rating if i had checked that area out.\n\nbottomline, not bad for late eats, but a bit heavy on the wallet.",

            "what a perfect place to finish off a vegas trip! i came here back in january with some friends. it was packed, the wait time was long, but you can chill in the lounge until a table is ready for you. the ambiance is so weird, but fun at the same time. i can't begin to describe the funky waitress outfits they have. \n\nafter spending the weekend on the strip glaring at all the overpriced food and beverage spots, i had the best affordable cup of coffee everrrr. the average price for meals was about $10-15. i got the pesto <mark>Focaccia <mark>Pesto Chicken Sandwich</mark></mark> with fruit and it was soooo good. i tried my friend's country <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark>--it was amazing. portions are huge and you really get what you pay for! \n\ngreat for tourists...open 24 hours, plenty of parking, take debit/credit, slots in waiting area, souvenir group photos, and an experience to remember! i will be back for sure!", 
            "we love this place and don't know why we don't come here more often when we are in vegas.\n\nthis review is in two parts, the restaurant and the lounge.\n\nthe restaurant\n\nmirrors, fake cherry blossom trees, red and blue neon... what's not to love?\n\nservice here is very good, prompt and friendly.  proportions can be ridiculously large!\n\non the night we went, we had plans for later in the evening and i didn't want to be too full... so i was a little concerned due to the size of their servings.  i ordered the cheeseburgers sliders which came with home made yukon gold potato chips.  the sliders were... sliders, nothing spectacular, but the chips were awesome though i could not finish them.  my wife had the <mark>Pesto Chicken Sandwich</mark> with onion rings, both of which she loved.\n\nwe returned a couple <mark>Hearty Soups Of The Day</mark> later for breakfast where i had the country <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> and eggs which was good, though again i could not finish it (and i am a big eater) and she has the french toast ambrosia... which was ridiculously large!  it was so big a lady from the next table asked if she could take a picture of it!  \n\ni also noticed the gentleman across from us ordered the fruit plate which was not at all a fruit plate, it was a produce bar stacked on a plate!  i am not kidding, your could easily get your full eight servings of fruits and vegetables in one meal!\n\nthis place is a little pricy, however in most items you get enough to make two (if not more) meals.  proportionally speaking it is very reasonable.\n\nthe lounge\n\nwe freakin' love this lounge!  again chrome and mirrors, red and blue neon, red velvet booths, and a fire spewing, boiling water fire pit!  i have always thought this would be exactly the kind of place where swingers would meet up prior to their assignations!\n\nthe waitresses all wear cocktail dresses which are very nice.  they prohibit you from wearing hats of any kind calling it their \"dress code\" but there are always people in there dressed in shorts and t-shirts so i am not too what the boundaries of this \"code\" are.  \n\nthey have a really cool menu advertising \"retro\" drinks like champagne cocktails, manhattans, and scorpions in big bowls.   i ordered a vodka gimlet (which seems more and more to becoming an endangered species as far as bartenders go) and our friend ordered a beautiful.  both drinks were made correctly with no questions asked.  \n\nagain this place can be pricy.  in fact we spent more here in the same amount of time as we did at treasures, a very high end strip club.\n\nmoney aside, i would find a reason to go to vegas just to hang out at the peppermill fireside lounge.\n\nthe only reason i don't give it 5 stars is the cost.\n\nedit:  my wife's preferred drink this weekend was a pina colada.  she wanted me to point out that the peppermill was the only establishment that served her pc in a hurricane glass as it should be.  it may not seem important but it shows that they pay attention to the details.",

            "um, yuck. first, let me say that i don't like diner food, i detest \"breakfast\" foods (pancakes, waffles, maple syrup, sausages, etc.: omg vom) and \"traditional\" \"american\" food barely qualifies as food imo. (pizza, burgers and chow mein: now that's american! meatloaf and steak & eggs: ick!) so to say that this is not the place for me is an understatement. it is, however, open 24/7 and near-ish my hotel.\n\nfirst trip: i ordered fettucine alfredo with shrimp. the portion size was not as big as a lot of places, but that's ok because it was gross. the sauce was gummy and didn't taste fresh, the few shrimp were large, but a little tough, and the noodles were not what you'd call al dente. the garlic bread with \"cheese\" on it was revolting.\nmy mum ordered the chicken & <mark>Chicken & Red Pepper Pasta</mark>. hers was better than mine, though her penne was also overcooked. the sauce was pretty good, the red pepper strips were, i swear, mezetta brand right out of the jar (but i like those), and they were right on the money when they described it as chicken stuffed with herbs and cream cheese; it tasted just like philadelphia cooking creme italian cheese & herb flavour.\nsecond trip: i ordered <mark>New York New York</mark> <mark>New York Steak And Shrimp Scampi</mark>. i ordered it cooked medium, it was definitely well done. the shrimp were, too. my mother ordered some icky breakfast foods, so i didn't taste them, but she said they were ok.\ni think if you like breakfast foods (served all day) and diner food, you'll like this place, but i will avoid it. the waitresses were cute and helpful, though. and the decor is amusing.",

            "let's see - a fun and friendly atmosphere, large portions of delicious food, tasty drinks served by a bona fide cocktail waitress, and all at reasonable prices. what's not to like?!\n\nok, maybe the vegas locale, on the north end of the strip and away from the more posh atmosphere of tao and a million wolfgang puck spinoffs, isn't for everyone. but then again, peppermill is right across the street from circus circus and right next to the riviera, and away from the worst of the strip traffic.\n\nmy girlfriend and i went to peppermill on the recommendation of a friend, someone who lives here in las vegas, always a good sign. once you enter the place, you're immediately struck by a cunning mix of modern and retro, neon lighting in a darkened room, and waitresses in bright colours and miniskirts. \n\nwe were seated quickly and immediately introduced to our waitress, who was friendly and helpful, and soon followed by the cocktail waitress, dressed to the nines in a flowing black dress but still very comfortable. she helped us choose drinks and returned with them fast, checking on us several times throughout the meal.\n\nmy girlfriend got a grasshopper and i tried a blue hawaiian, big and fruity and bright blue - it also packed a good kick. no watering down here, i guess!\n\nfor our meals, she tried the pork chops and eggs, which came with a generous portion of hash browns and a muffin, while i tried the <mark>Peppermill Pastrami Burger</mark> with (i was delighted to find) curly fries. we finished off with an \"<mark>The Elegant Brownie</mark>,\" a positively massive dessert of warm brownie, hot fudge, and vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream and a cherry. everything was delicious and cooked to perfection - a little bit of pink in the middle of my medium burger, eggs <mark>French Dip With Au Jus</mark> slightly runny yolks, crispy fries and hashbrowns, and a delightfully messy dessert that was plenty for two to share.\n\nand the whole meal, drinks and dessert included, came in at just about $50 all told. not bad at all for a wonderful experience and a whole lot of great food.\n\nif you're in vegas, you owe it to yourself...it may be a little off the main drag, but the peppermill is well worth the trip. as for us, we'll be back!", 
            "great value for your buck. the dinner salad is the size of an entr\\u00e9e and the steaks super juicy. and save room for desert, we had <mark>The Elegant Brownie</mark> a la mode and talk about super chocolate and fudge. finger licking good.", 
            "24/7 diner with lots of neon. food is good for being 24/7. nothing amazing, but the <mark>Chicken Caesar Salad</mark> is great! huge portions, strongly recommend to share. the desserts are a must have! leave room to try <mark>The Elegant Brownie</mark> or <mark>Strawberry Shortcake</mark> - a real vegas experience.", 
            "when you've got the late night munchies and can't figure out where else to go... the peppermill is open 24 hours. \n\nthe location is a bit tricky and although it's right by wynn, you'll need a taxi. \n\nit's a fun atmosphere with an old vegas feel.\n\ni like that when looking at the menu, i'm reminded a bit of home with the typical diner menu choices as opposed to all of the fancy restaurant menus on the strip.\n\nwe had a sampler appetizer of some sort that came with fried shrimp, onion rings and mozzerella sticks. everything was pretty good.\n\nfor my entree, i ordered the ruben, which was huge and overflowing with fries. just as everyone says, the portions are large. the ruben was good. the <mark>Philly Cheese Steak</mark> was also really good.\n\nalso had <mark>The Elegant Brownie</mark> sundae which was yum and the coffee was great. \n\nreally sweet and attentive waitress. \n\ni had an overall good experience with this place. good food, good portions, good prices and good service. i don't know if i'd really go out of the way to go to this place though. the food is just average. if it was in my hometown, it'd be nothing special.", 
            "i took my baby boy here for his 27th birthday dinner since we had such a great experience on our last visit. he loves this restaurant and it is a real treat since it really is one of a kind.\n\nthis restaurant has a fun atmosphere, great service, great food and always leaves you full and happy every time!\n\nwe ordered <mark>Icelandic Fish And Chips</mark> and <mark>Southern Fried Steak</mark> which came with choice of bread <mark>Steak And Mushroom Salad</mark> or soup. the both of these dishes were fantastic and he had to take half of his meal home as there must have been 2 pounds of curly fries with his <mark>Icelandic Fish And Chips</mark> lol.\n\ni snuck away and informed the staff that we were celebrating a birthday so i picked out a dessert to present him with!\n\ni chose <mark>The Elegant Brownie</mark>, a yummy chocolate fudge brownie served steaming hot with a mound of creamy french vanilla ice cream, smothered in warm chocolate fudge sauce and layered with whipped cream and sprinkles.  this dessert was ridiculous good, that homemade brownie and combination of fudge and ice cream was insane orgasmic good! \n\nthey came to the table with his dessert lit up with a candle and sang happy birthday and it was so much fun!\n\nour experience is always stellar here and every time they always manage to top the last visit."

            "i have always had a great experience here and being that it's open 24 hours a day and it's kid friendly, makes it really convenient for us. the decor is fun and electric (literally electric)! it's great late night comfort food, especially when you've been drinking and partying all night...er.. when you don't have the kids, of course!\nokay so my review is for may 2010 when we visited here. it was our first night in las vegas and a first time bringing a child and...me being 7 months pregnant (so no partying for me this time! i was craving steak and was very skeptical about ordering it at a place like this. i ordered the <mark>New York New York</mark> ! <mark>New York New York</mark> ! 27.95 (yes, the price is quite high) ***peppermill description: 12oz. hand-cut and trimmed, flame-broiled to perfection and served with saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms.*** let me tell you that for someone that actually does not consider herself a red meat lover and eats it only on rare occassions (even though all my reviews seem to be centered on steak houses and burger joints lol!), this was excellant excellant excellant! the kitchen staff really know their steaks! i thought there was a bone in it and kept eating around it...it was all cut with no bone! and being pregnant i had to order it more cooked than i would usually so i believe i got it medium-well...still amazing! flavorful and tender! so 5 stars there!\non another night (with our little one), we went just for dessert and ordered the <mark>Strawberry Shortcake</mark> 6.95\n***peppermill description: moist slices of pound cake, a generous helping of strawberries and creamy french vanilla ice cream, all topped with real whipping cream.*** what a treat! fantastic! loved it! we were all so tired and our little boy started getting cranky and fighting over bites and finally it ended up toppeling all over the table! haha, it was a fun night. we love the peppermill! ***don't forget to wave to the kitchen staff on your way out. they really appreciate that. :)\nfireside lounge: when my man and i go to las vegas as adults, we love the fireside lounge in all it's glowing ambiance! the drinks are fun, the hostesses are beautiful and elegant and they are always nice about taking our picture by the molten fire pit, hehe. the only thing i am sad about are the tv's they put in. they are  really distracting. if anyone knows the owners there, please tell them to take them out!",

            "had a fun time at peppermill. servers were friendly,  decor was wonderfully cheesy,  the food was as better than expected. well, dinner was better than expected. dessert was disappointing. we shared a <mark>Strawberry Shortcake</mark> and it was underwhelming. they used  strawberry syrup like from mcdonald's and a flavor less cake. i think it's because there are do many great places to get dessert in this town,  i'm surprised when something on the strip disappoints. i would go back, the lounge and entr\\u00e9es are throwback classics. and we really enjoyed the server.  just know there are better sweets all over this town.", 
            "best place to go for late night grub, serving size is huge and if you have a sweet tooth i would recommend the <mark>Mud Pie</mark>.  its super chocolatey goodness with a large amount of ice cream.  the <mark>Strawberry Shortcake</mark> and brownie desserts come in a huge glass cup with ice cream which are also great . it's a diabetic coma waiting to happen .", 
            "i went to peppermill because my friend and i wanted to go out to eat when it was late, and not much was still open. we also didn't want to spend a lot. i suggested we give this place a try because i drive past it quite a bit and i haven't ever heard anything bad about it. when we arrived, we were seated right away, and our server greeted up quickly. both of us ordered a burger and fries. the burger was a good size and it was yummy. i also ordered the <mark>Strawberry Shortcake</mark> which turned out to be really big, so i shared it with my friend. i would like to go back and try more of their food."

            "pro: anna in the fireside lounge, the fire pit in the fireside lounge, cool rose decor in the fireside lounge, did i mention anna? \n\ncon: slightly over price food in the peppermill restaurant, crazy lights in the peppermill, so so food. \n\nwent to the peppermill due to overwhelming good personal recommendations and of course hazel's review. not to mention the rose bowl was going and we needed a place with big screen to the watch the game. \n\nso, peppermill it is and thank you god for that place. \n\nthe hostess told us that the lounge only have starters, so we planned on drinking and watching for a bit with a sampler, then head back to the restaurant for food during half time. \n\nwe walked into a rose vine covered lounge with the bar on the right and watery fire pits on the left, flat screen and semi circle couches are all over the place. the lounge server was anna, a dark hair romanian beauty that looks like a cross of rachel mcadams and lauren graham but hotter, younger, with longer legs. yes, i know i shouldn't be reviewing this place based on her, but it is that golden sunset at your malibu mansion that sets your place apart to other locations. \n\nthe food and drinks were a flowing, everything worked out with pretty good service. then we left at half time for food, which just was a bit overpriced but it is very good. service was prompt and silviya's suggestion on the omelet are a great one. milk shake and <mark>Carrot Cake</mark> were pretty right on the spot. \n\noverall, if you are in vegas, go see anna in the lounge for business meeting or to chill with friends. food, you can save more money going to somewhere else, but probably not as good.", 
            "items selected:\ncoffee\nambrosia french toast, no melon, with whip\n<mark>Carrot Cake</mark>\n\nrarely one to stay out late and certainly not the sort to do so while drinking heavily only to find myself craving greasy food at 3:00am i'd be lying if i suggested the iconic peppermill had ever interested me as more than a sort of las vegas curiosity and yet with a 12-mile run and a few donuts from ronald's already under my belt it was with a 'what the hell' smile that i entered the neon-lit space with mirrored ceilings just as the cops arrived to deal with an unruly inebriated couple who were refusing to pay their tab.  featured in everything from csi to showgirls and featuring a 24/7 menu of everything from breakfasts and burgers onward to acclaimed nachos and desserts plus a setting quite unlike any other with drunken creatures of the night in all sorts of disarray it was clear on entering the space that it was i who was the novelty and requesting a table for one while using proper manners i was seated quickly, greeted immediately thereafter, and provided with superlative service throughout my 55 minute and 5 cup of coffee (plus one for the road) stay.  certainly not 'gourmet' or 'artisan' but wholly satisfying for both 'dinner' and 'show' my order would consist of only two items and electing for the <mark>Carrot Cake</mark> as an appetizer while my main course was prepared i was happy to find a modest slice of high quality placed before me, the dense body not overly sweetened but instead nutty and aromatic with a thin layer of cream cheese icing adding a tangy sweetness without overwhelming - a balance i neither expected nor received with the decadent pile of custard-laden egg bread that followed complete with <mark>Fresh Fruit</mark>, whipped cream, and warm syrup...exactly the sort of thing i imagine i'd crave after a night of drinking...or after an early morning run...or when i was 8 years old...or 25 years later.", 
            "been here a few times now. tried the happy hour <mark>Chicken Quesadilla</mark> and it wasn't that impressive. green peppers were located inside the tortilla, along with way too much chicken that wasn't that tasty at all. the salsa also had no flavor. not too bad on drink prices as it was about $5 for a can of guiness and $7 for a mixed drink. since this place is a vegas icon, it is worth stopping in to check out the firepits and some of their \"girly\" drinks are pretty famous as well. entrees are expensive and you can only get appetizers at the bar area. the deserts are not homemade, but the <mark>Carrot Cake</mark> was a decent rendition. worth the trip to see what life was like back in the vegas glory days (aka before the ferris wheels started arriving in town).", 
            "place is awesome...been there a few times....big portions, really good food...incredible atmosphere...it's a vegas institution for a reason.   i got the poached eggs over <mark>Crab Cakes</mark>, amazing hash browns and a side of bacon, a bloody mary...oh yeah and a slice of <mark>Carrot Cake</mark>... last night at like 3am......ridiculous good."
