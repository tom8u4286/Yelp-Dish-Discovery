            "i went here for lunch on the opening week at cosmopolitan.  it's on the same floor as some other restaurants but seems to get more business than the others; we had a 20 minute wait.  once we were seated, we noticed that there were a lot of empty tables in the restaurant; i'm guessing that they're a little understaffed.\n\ni had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> cheeseburger, which comes with sirloin beef, bacon, sliced goat cheese, arugula, tomato confit, and a garlic aioli.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was quite good.  the ingredients tasted fresh and the meat was cooked perfectly.  unlike a lot of gourmet cheeseburgers i've had, the grill taste isn't overly aggressive here.  the bacon definitely made an impact and the arugula, while mostly dominated by the other ingredients, added a nice crunch to cut the grease.\n\ni upgraded my fries order to the duck fat fries.  it was my first time trying duck fat fries, but i wasn't impressed.  i was hoping to taste some duck in there!  they were definitely crunchier than the standard fry, but the steak fries here are very tasty as well and i would recommend those instead.  i also had the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> spiked milkshake, which was delicious.  very creamy and chocolatey, but for a spiked milkshake it was perhaps too smooth.\n\nin conclusion: this is one of the better gourmet cheeseburgers i've had in las vegas so far.  stick with the steak fries unless you're curious about the duck fat or really like your fries crunchy.", 
            "if your friends love burgers, like mine do, this is the perfect place to take them for any special event. a group of us came here for a birthday. we called ahead of time to make a reservation because it was a mid size group and around the holiday season. when we got there, the place was busy, but you could get away without making a reservation.\n\nthe decor is warm, well lit, with splashes of colorful art. \n\nthe server was friendly, attentive when we needed her, and kept her distance while we were celebrating. orders were taken promptly, waters were refilled regularly, and food was brought out in a timely manner.\n\nthe star of this place is the food. the ambiance is nice, but you forget about all that when the food appears. the alcohol milkshakes are amazing. they will definitely satisfy the child and adult within you. we tried four different kind that day. the framboise float was not well balanced. although we love the raspberry cider, it overpowered the vanilla ice cream. on the other hand, the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark>, orange dreamscicle, and the brown cow were delicious. they had enough alcohol to get you feeling good without the constant reminder.\n\nstarting out with the artichoke \"guac\" was unimpressive. in fact, looking back, i cannot remember it as vividly as i do with everything else we ordered.\n\nnow <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are spectacular. if you like it rich, decadent, and everything not good for you then this is the place for you. my group had our burgers family style to share. we got two <mark>Gold Standard</mark>; aged beef, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, goat cheese, greens and aioli. they were delicious. the meat was moist, the saltiness of the cheese and bacon balanced well with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. next was the <mark>Captain Hook</mark>; a salmon filet, greens, pickled shallots, and a caper mayo. the fish was charred and crispy on the outside while moist on the inside and the shallots gave it a nice zing. now this is were we started to go over board and into the heart attack warning zone. the longhorn burger is amazing because it not only has a patty, but stacks on beef brisket, coleslaw. dill pickles, and then slathers it in whiskey bbq sauce. this monster was disgustingly delicious, had my friend panting half way. nothing beats the duck, duck, goose if you are talking about self indulgence. the duck confit and froie gras stuffed patty is ridiculous. when you bite into <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> patty, you are first greeted by mouth watering beef, followed by the creaminess of the duck liver. the blend of all this with the plum sauce is amazing. if you are not a duck or liver fan, avoid this burger because it is ever present throughout. top it all off with a few orders of duck fat fries and you might as well check into the hospital next.", 
            "try the milkshakes. seriously, if you don't try at least one of their milkshakes, you are doing yourself a disservice as a human being. i tried the hen house burger, with bacon and a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> on it and it was very tasty, that's for sure. i loved the thin-cut <mark>French Fries</mark> and could easily have eaten two servings (probably did anyway). so, then i tried the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> milkshake. holy crap. then i tried another milkshake at the table, the cereal bowl, with cap n' crunch and fruity pebbles, which wasn't as good as the smores one, but i'm sure i could have downed about 4 of them in a sitting. did i mention that the milkshakes have booze in them? ahhhh, yeah.....\nanyway, i tried 2 of the specialty bloody mary martinis; the spicy one was served with a poached shrimp that was as big as paul bunyon's thumb, i swear. but the kicker drink was the savory bloody mary martini, with beef brisket infused vodka and a skewer that had 3 large chunks of perfectly cooked filet mignon- so yum. who thinks this stuff up? brisket-infused vodka? how the hell would a person even make that? \ntry this place out, you won't regret it.", 
            "burgers, shakes, and more burgers....\n\nfirst being a popcorn lover, you can only imagine my excitement when the waitress dropped off some complimentary cheddar popcorn to start our meal! \n\nbasically this place is the biz for its gourmet burgers and alcoholic shakes.  i went here twice in one day, that's how much i liked <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and shakes.  there's other stuff like truffle lobster mac n cheese and interesting snacks like pizza \"twinkies\", <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>, fried green tomatoes and kalbi beef with kimchee quesadillas.  they also have sliders as well.  i'll def. be back to try these.\n\ni had the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> shake and a taste of my friend's <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake....both sooooo gooooood!  \n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>- juicy meat and i surprisingly liked the combination.  \nkorean \"bull\"gogi- juicy meat, i liked the flavor of this.  if you like bulgogi, you'll love this.\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark>- so i thought this was kinda dry, plus i\"m not really into goat cheese so i didn't like it as much.  but my bro loved it.\nburgers were pretty decent in size, i was stuffed after one and the guys were satisfied after theirs.  burgers also come with a choice of shoestring fries or steak cut fries, both were deelish. \nthey also have a pretty decent stocked bar and a selection of beer that my fiance enjoyed.\n\nthese gourmet burgers are pricey, 13-17.5 bucks.  shakes are around 11 bucks.  but it's vegas and the food was great, so in that case i didn't mind!  i recommend checking this place out if you're in the mood for some tasty burgers and shakes...", 
            "food:  \n\nthey start you off with some flavored popcorn as a free appetizer.\n\n<mark>Campfire Smores</mark> shake (virgin):  a little on the sweet side, but what did i expect ordering smores? i wish they included more than one toasted marshmallow.\n\ncrispy pork belly bun:  the pork belly was a bit too dry. it didn't taste very authentic, so this was probably my least favorite dish.\n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> hamburger:  after looking through yelp reviews, most people recommended <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> hamburger, so we ordered it and it was by far the best hamburger. very juicy and the flavors are just right.\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger:  not the best hamburger i've ever had, but it was satisfactory. tomato confit, aged goat cheese, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, garlic chive aoili, arugula...you would think it was the best hamburger ever created, but it was just okay. \n\n\napple pie a la mode:  so interesting! they come in these dumpling shapes and you squeeze the frosting out of toothpaste looking containers! comes with vanilla and ginger. you should order it!", 
            "in my quest to try the best burgers on the west coast, i came here with friends recently to give it a try while on vacation. the decor was really cute (i never comment on stuff like this, so the fact that it caught my eye means a lot). burgers were pretty good, nothing off the charts amazing, but i'd go with <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger (<mark>Gold Standard</mark> was probably second best). sides were somewhat overdone, but not terrible either. the savoir of this place was the milkshakes. dear god so good. 4 of us split the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> and the raspberry lemo<mark>Truffle Lobster 'Mac N Cheese'</mark>, both were amazing. you knew there was alcohol in there, but the shakes weren't overpowered by the alcohol (or by <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> stuff to cover up <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>) i'd definitely recommend this place, if for nothing else the milkshakes", 
            "holsteins was on my list during my last trip to vegas and we didn't end up going, so this was at the top of my list this time around. we had a party of 8 during friday night at around 10 p.m., and ended up splitting into two tables of 4 because it was packed. the two musts here are their burgers and shakes. the bf and i split <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger, which was really good. i also had a bite of <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> which was great as well (think burger with an asian twist). their patty is really juicy and most importantly, cooked to a perfect medium rare. since we were sharing <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, we decided to get the truffled mac n cheese with lobster, which was piping hot and delicious. i wasn't sure about the lone potato chip on the side though.\n\nwe ordered a couple of milkshakes: brown cow float, oreo, <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>, and <mark>Campfire Smores</mark>. my favorite was the oreo. the brown cow had chocolate pop rocks which made it very unique. it's pricey at ~$11 but they do give you a cup and a half, which makes it feel like a little better deal. \n\nholsteins ranks right under father's office in la in my book.", 
            "i have eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed the food.  however, i come here mostly for the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> shake ( alcohol infused).  i really don't taste too much alcohol in any of their shakes, but they are quite delicious.  \n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger is very good as well as the hen house.", 
            "holsteins is a fun place to feed your face. everything about it is whimsical and brash -- the food, the decor, the service -- but in a good way.\n\ni had the korean bull-golgi burger, which is made with soy marinated beef and is topped with kimchee slaw, chili mayo, and a kalbi glaze. it's a mix of sweet, salty, and spicy, but what brings it all together is the runny <mark>Fried Egg</mark>. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is a knockout -- like a taekwondo kick to your tastebuds!\n\nnot one to skip the opportunity to get liquored up, i also had the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> shake. i couldn't really taste the vodka (a good thing perhaps) but the shake was really delicious. it made me feel like a kid again ... an alcoholic kid.", 
            "my girlfriend and i were hanging out in city center before a show and decided to swing in for an appetizer and a drink.\n\nstaff was courteous and after a bit of a wait (it was a saturday night) we were seated. the atmosphere is very unique, i liked the theme, the decor, and the artwork, however morbid it may be (one picture is of an animated cow who has cut his own heart out, and admiring how delicious it looks). but overall a fun experience.\n\nwe ordered the holstein beef sliders and some <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, as well as their <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> shake. the sliders were great, the beef in particular was awesome, i'd love to go back for one of their 8oz. full size burgers. the fries were my favorite, i've had several from all around, and i think these were the best <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> i've had yet. the shake was also very very good, and i recommend that if you're trying the full experience, to order a shake with your meal. it tasted exactly as described, with graham cracker bits mixed throughout.\n\ngreat food, good service, and a fun atmosphere with lots of people, music playing; an overall great time.", 
            "this is the 3rd time i've been to holstein's and i have to say it's one of my favorite places on the strip! ;) \n\nthe first two times i had a great experience, and so i will tell you about my 3rd. \n\nmy two friends and i got there about 2pm on saturday and the place was pretty jumping. almost every time we have come it's been jumping so expect a 10-15 minute wait to get seated. we left our name with the cute hostess and  they took our phone number. instead <mark>Best Of Las Vegas (7.2%) NV, USA</mark> those little beeper things, they just text someone's phone in the group when your table is ready. i love technology. \n\nwe waited in the chandelier lounge and had a fire-breathing dragon cocktail while we waited. it was a little pricey, but fun none the less. \n\nwe got seated, and boom-got the complimentary salt & vinegar popcorn to start off and some chilled waters as soon as we sat down. \n\nafter perusing the menu, which seems to get new items every few months, i chose the portabello mushroom burger and the cereal shake (made with 3 scoops vanilla ice cream,1 oz. vanilla vodka,  1/2 cup cap'n crunch cereal (dry),milk, as needed to get desired consistency,whipped cream (for garnish) and a shot of whipped cream vodka i think?) which tasted delicious! the shakes come in standard shake glass and make room for the extra they bring out in the silver shaker-bonus! my friends ordered the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> ($28 -ouch!) and the tiramisu shake-and my other friend ordered the gold medallion burger i think it was? \n\nif your on a budget, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and shakes are just big enough meal\nto split between two people or a couple, in addition to the free salt & vinegar popcorn.\n\nshakes came our first, which are almost a meal in themselves. the last two times i ordered the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> and almondy joy (cause i love chocolate) but decided to try the cereal shake because i love cap'n crunch. i have to say i like the tiramisu over my cereal shake which was super sweet. \n\nwe ordered the lobster mac & cheese which is always good (wish they gave us a larger serving!) and we gobbled that dish down in no time between the 3 of us. \n\nburgers showed up shortly after without a beat. i also ordered a <mark>Fried Egg</mark>  on mine. my meat was moist, the portobello succulent, the avocado delish, and the <mark>Fried Egg</mark> cooked just enough not to run all over the place. this burger is way too big to eat without spilling everywhere so i cut it in half to make it easier. the fries here are not my favorite, but come with meal, the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were pretty good though.\n\nthough my burger was good, i tasted my friends <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> and the aged-kobe beef topped with goose liver (which is why it was expensive) and i have to say her burger was better than mine. don't know if i could justify the extra $12 for it. my other friend who is a big foodie, said his medallion burger was one of the best burgers he's had in a restaurant, and he's a very picky foodie. \n\nall in all another great experience,  i like the hustle and bustle of the place, and all the good looking people in cosmopolitan is never a let down. thought he place is not cheap if your looking for an inexpensive place to eat, it's a fun experience overall and great to get a slight buzz from from a shake!\n\n*note* i went hope and napped after my amazing meal. \n\nhope this helps!\n\ncheers!\n\n~mikeb",

            "it's almost hard to believe that holstein's is run by the same people responsible for lbs at the red rock. i guess if i had to make an analogy, this place is like michael jackson (in terms of talent, not behavior or affinity for boys) whereas lbs is latoya (or maybe even janet) and the lbs patty wagon is tito.\n\nwhat that means, is this place rocks. the menu is more diverse and creative than it's sibling establishments with it's spiked milkshakes, apps, burgers, alternative dishes for non-burger folks, and an extensive beer list.\n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> ($16.50) is an amazing burger made out of a sizable kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake (yeah, i had to look up furikake to know what it was... i'm not ashamed to admit it), crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. the ingredients gave it a rich, sweet, unique flavor and the crispy yam bits a crunchy texture. if i have any complaint about this burger it's the height of it. the thick patty and huge slices of avocado make it difficult to get the whole thing in your mouth (didn't macauley culkin say the same thing to mj?).\n\nmy wife got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> ($17.50) - dry aged beef sirloin with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli. she loved it and only let me have one bite. if you want a more traditional burger, go for this. but, i still thought <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> was better.\n\neach burger came with an order of fries. so she got the regular fries and i got he steak cut fries. both were very good -- crispy exterior, light and soft interior.\n\nour son got the kid's chicken fingers and fries. that's always a winner with him. it came with 3 big tenders and some carrots and celery.\n\neven after those big burgers we still had room for dessert. our choice... lollipops. the chocolate brownie and strawberry were excellent. the lemon meringue and <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> were largely forgettable and uninspired and the blondie was bland and didn't come close to reminding me of a blondie brownie.\n\ndespite the lackluster dessert, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were so good i can overlook that misstep. we didn't have any issues with the service, especially the kitchen, which sent out the food surprisingly fast. i'm not sure if i'd say this is my favorite burger place, but it's definitely one of the top and one that shouldn't be missed.", 
            "this restaurant, located in the cosmopolitan, is just ok. our waiter seemed a little inexperienced and not familiar with the menu. my mom has several food allergies to gluten and dairy and asked several questions about items on the menu and the waiter had to keep going in the back to ask the chef. i am, in a way, glad he asked the chef rather than giving out wrong information....but you should be familiar with your menu if you're going to work at a restaurant in a high-end hotel. \n\ni had the farm house salad which was pretty good. it had mixed greens, kale, asparagus, green beans, edamame, cauliflower, and heirloom tomatoes. it is supposed to come in a honey yogurt dressing but i got the balsamic dressing instead. i also added avocado to this and scratched the tomatoes. it was pretty tasty, all of the flavors seemed to work together. i just wasn't \"wowed\" by this salad. \n\nwe also ordered some <mark>French Fries</mark> for the table which were soggy and undercooked. i like <mark>French Fries</mark> to be crispy and crunchy. these were soggy and lifeless. the ketchup they serve is really good though and it seems like they make it in house. \n\nthey also have various alcoholic milkshake type beverages on their menu, which sounded amazing. one of them was a <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> drink with <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> vodka. there was also an almond joy and oreo drink. maybe i'll try one next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "my boyfriend and i were looking for a good burger place and read the\nreviews and we were really curious to try the bam-boozled drinks and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> looked delicious!  so we decided to try.  our waiter was so nice and very helpful in our food and drink choices. we were very happy and impressed with our experience there! we had the <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> shake and s'mores campfire shake. we loved them! our burgers were amazing and so yummy! we will be definitely be coming back again!", 
            "came here for an afternoon snack friday and returned early today for lunch.\n\nhighly recommend the red velvet shake!!! satisfies that dessert craving where you can't decide if you want a <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> or ice cream.  ordered this shake both times as well the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>.\n\nthe dish that surprised me the most was the crispy pork belly bun with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. the veggies combined with the crispy pork belly with a lil bite of the cilantro at the end of that bite is the perfect feeling of 'oh so fresh and good!' but you don't fill the fullness that you get where you feel like you just ate the titanic! would definitely order this again!\n\nand finally the complimentary  popcorn is soooooooooo delicious to snack on.", 
            "wow, where do i begin?!?! this place is amazing!!! this was the best hamburger i have ever had! i ordered <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger, added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to it and some yummy cheeses. we had an appetizer of <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> and <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark>, both delicious. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> selection is out of this world!! everyone loved their hamburgers!!!. lots of customization options for the perfect burger. if you order a burger, you have to get one of their shakes. these shakes are phenomenal. they are served both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, and are the perfect match to a great burger. i had the <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> shake, with an extra shot, its vegas after-all and i loved it! atmosphere was very fun and cool. service was excellent. will definitely be going back next time i'm in town.",

            "holsteins will entice you to eat like it's your cheat day... here i had the best. burger. of. my. life.

            "this place is solid, i'm a huge fan of their burgers and shakes.\n\nnowadays it's hard to find a place in vegas that is good without needing to drop $100 per person on a meal. \n\nenter holsteins!\n\nthis place is real good. i got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger (kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo & tempura avocado)\n\nthis was super good! i loved the tempura avocado, such a unique awesome thing to put on a burger!\n\ni also got the <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> shake (zing red velvet vodka, <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark>, cream cheese mousse, mini whoopee pie ) which was sooooo good too!\n\nhighly recommend, at the top floor of the cosmo", 
            "it's both a blessing and a curse that that vegas is so far away, otherwise i'd be visiting holsteins on a far more frequent basis.\n\nin contrast to the sharp trendiness of the cosmopolitan hotel itself is holsteins, a lighthearted, family-friendly (relatively speaking of course!) burger-n-fries type of place that offers many interpretations of the word \"indulgence.\" \n\nour wait to be seated took about a minute or two at most, but this was during a monday lunchtime visit - so i wouldn't be surprised to know that this place becomes quite packed over the weekends.\n\naccording to the restaurant's website, holsteins no longer offers its crispy calamari appetizer - what a bummer!. the calamari itself has a wonderfully crunchy texture and the grilled lemon wedges provided on the side provided a tangy flavor as well as a subtle hint of charred smokiness. the tabasco-honey dipping sauce was also fantastic, creating a welcome balance between sweetness and a slightly spicy kick. i hope that this dish somehow finds it way back on to the menu soon, as it was one of the best iterations of calamari that i've had in recent memory!\n\nfor our burger selection, we shared a \"fun-ghi\" burger, which was packed to the brim with many of my favorite things. indeed, there were mushrooms aplenty (check), caramelized onions (check), gruyere (check), and even a truffle mayo that gave <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> an earthy aroma and that signature truffle flavor. the patty itself was juicy and flavorful; it was also cooked to a perfect medium-rare.\n\nwe also split an order of truffle lobster mac-n-cheese (might as well go all in if you're indulging like this!), which had nice contrasts of creaminess and crisp crunch (thanks to the breaded topping, of course). in contrast to some macaroni & cheese dishes found at other establishments, this version wasn't overly rich or oily. its stronger, more pronounced cheese flavor complemented <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> quite well. \n\nin sharing this appetizer, a burger, and a side, my girlfriend and i were pretty much stuffed. the portion sizes were bigger than what we're accustomed to getting for the price (cough, umami, cough). this being said, expect somewhat of a price markup...it is sin city after all.\n\nwe didn't get a chance to try any of the famed holstein's \"adult\" shakes (in large part because we had already gotten drunk earlier that morning), but some of the combinations listed on the menu looked pretty interesting. in particular, the \"<mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> shake\" really jumps off of the page!\n\nwhile the whole \"high-end burger\" scene seems to be flourishing into quite the business these days, places like holsteins prove that there are ways to excel at both image and execution. i'll certainly be back.", 
            "so we went here after the ufc 182 since we were staying at the cosmo.  first of all the place is way too loud!  it's like eating at a club.  we could barely hear each other talk nor think.  but at 11pm there weren't too many options.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> we got, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was stellar!  we added a piece of <mark>Foie Gras</mark> which elevated <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  it was one of the best i ever had.\n\nthe 3 alcoholic shakes we got were by far the best shakes we ever had.  the <mark>Pecan Turtle Cheesecake</mark> was the best.  it had caramel vodka and small pieces of cheesecake in it.  it was like eating a boozed dessert.\n\nthe <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> was solid too.  it had a mini whoopie pie and vodka in it too.  it tasted like taking small bites of red velvet cupcakes.   \n\nthe coffee & doughnuts one was good too.\n\nthis is a nice place to get good burgers and shakes but you better bring some earplugs.", 
            "reminiscing about my childhood memories is like the anticipation of a first kiss; it's (usually) messy, exciting, and puts a smile on a face. that is how holsteins shakes made me feel, and their grown up version added a tinge of a twist to remind me that i am not 5 anymore, and i am okay with that.\n\nholsteins is known for their milkshakes so i was curious to know if they met up to that prominent expectation. we sat at the bar and were greeted instantly; it was nice that the bartender gave us his full attention even though we were only looking for a taste of a milkshake. i'm not an ice cream or milkshake devotee, but i was taken away by the intriguing menu of unusual paired milkshakes, such as the frozen grasshopper (peppermint, chocolate, cr\\u00e8me de menthe, pinnacle chocolate vodka), cereal bowl (3 olives loopy vodka, fruit loops, cap'n crunch), <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> shake (zing red velvet vodka, <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark>, cream cheese mousse, mini whoopee pie), and even an all year around pumpkin pie (pumpkin pie filling, graham crumble, pinnacle pumpkin pie vodka, pepitas brittle) shake! although i was hesitant at first at the idea of an alcohol infused milkshake, they prepare virgin ones as well. i stay far away from hard liquor unless the social gathering is right, and this night was one of them. the bartender assured me that i would hardly taste the alcohol anyway, is this a good sign? \n\nc e r e a l  b o w l  [ $ 13 ]\nwe decided on the cereal bowl; 3 olives loopy vodka, fruit loops, cap'n crunch in a vanilla ice cream base, yum! this milky concoction masked the alcohol so well that i didn't taste anything but the abundance of one of my childhood favourite cereals, cap'n crunch! so light yet sweet with a just-right cereal texture, this treat was more than the best milkshake i've ever tasted.\n\ni certainly see myself visiting holsteins again, perhaps to try the <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> shake or the moscow moo; it's difficult to say no when these milkshakes are completely inspired by cake ingredients to childhood inspired creations x", 
            "holsteins is awesome for a quick bite. if you are staying at marquee east tower, it is literally outside the elevators! they have great burgers of all varieties. i saw that they even had a <mark>Foie Gras</mark> burger! i had the <mark>California Turkey</mark> burger and it was great, pretty straight forward. next time i try this place, i think i will step a little outside my comfort zone and to really experience this place. \n\nthey have an extensive milkshake menu if you like milk shakes, i love milkshakes. oddly enough, they are all adult milkshakes infused with alcohol because why not?! its vegas! i chose the <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> vodka milk shake and i could hardly taste the vodka. it came garnished with a red velvet macaroon cookie. a+",

(eyes rolling up a storm) there is a long waiting list, but because you just made a reservation i will put your name at the top of the list. but just to let you know, it might take 20 minutes or more to get you a table.\" i honestly have never encountered a more snotty, hostile, and unaccommodating hostess anywhere. it would serve holsteins well to hire hostesses with temperaments more appropriate for the position.\n\nhere is what we ordered:\n\nbam-boozled \"shakes\" all $11.00\n\n<mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>\nfrozen grasshopper\ncereal bowl\nblack cow\n\nthey were all fine...nothing special and not very boozey. fyi, the black cow is a float not a shake, despite the fact it is not marked as such.\n\nburgers:\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> $17.50 - \nlonghorn $16.00\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> $16.50\n\nall <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were cooked perfectly and they were tasty, but the toppings were very skimpy. i have indeed \"experienced better.\" they are served with fries...two of us chose shoestring fries and one upgraded to <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. sadly, both types of fries were mediocre at best. additionally we ordered the fried green tomatoes which were also mediocre.\n\nour server was fine, but not fantastic. the music was so loud we could barely hear the waitress or carry on a conversation. overall our experience was a less than stellar one. the experience with the snotty hostess put a taint on the evening and there was nothing that happened during the rest of our dinner that made up for it. there are way too many other restaurants in las vegas with bigger, better burgers and better service. i will not be returning, unless it is to punch the snotty hostess in the face (i kid! i kid!)",

(ll cool mack if you're nasty) for a belated birthday dinner (i told you i was a busy girl). it wasn't very crowded and we were seated right away. on our way back to our table i spotted the server we had last time...the lovely noelle. noelle is what every server should aspire to be. she is knowledgeable, genuinely caring about your experience (my monkeys loved her) and an all around cool person. if you are smart you will trust her recommendations (she's batting for 1000 after 2 visits). we had the most amazing food:\n-new belgium hoptober beer\n-lobster truffle mac n' cheese (a must...you will be licking the plate clean)\n-mini sliders with beef tenderloin, fois gras, arugula, truffle mayo and a <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark> demi glaze (they are small but bursting with flavor)\n-the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger (what they are famous for...i can see why)\n-the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> adult milkshake (so tasty, not super boosy...even gave some to the monkeys. they loved it)\n-maple glazed donuts with vanilla cream filling and bacon bits on top (holy cow i died and went to heaven).\n\nnow the downside....this place isn't a fast food restaurant. good food is worth the wait and you will wait a bit here. i appreciated the wait time in between courses so i could digest and really enjoy all my food. if you are in a hurry don't come here...you will be bummed. also...its kinda pricey but well worth it in my mind. you are looking at around $60 per person depending on what you drink. if you can't afford it...don't eat here...simple as that. \n\ni will be back soon and hopefully miss noelle will be our girl again.",

            "located on the 2nd floor of the cosmopolitan, i brought a friend from out of town to check out this joint known for high end burgers and boozy milkshakes.  the restaurant space has a good mix of seats at the bar, low tables with comfy couches, and standard booths/chairs.  music is pumping and artwork on the walls definitely add a cool vibe, but it's not overwhelming where one can't enjoy good conversation amongst close friends.\n\nas for the menu, there is quite the impressive beverage selection including a wide array of international/domestic beers, wines, cocktails, and unique sodas.  my friend and i were definitely in the mood to pair some burgers with their signature shakes and i got the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> (with reese's, banana, malt, and frangelico) whereas my friend ordered the creamsicle float (whipped cream smirnoff,  orange sherbet, ibc cream soda, and orange bubble sugar).  my biggest fear was that the alcohol component would actually distract one's enjoyment of the milkshake, but unexpectedly the problem ended up being the complete opposite in that neither of us tasted nor felt any effects of any trace of alcohol in our shakes (i.e. neither one of us had our trademark asian flush go into effect).  perhaps the holstein's staff has figured out some magic ratio/technique to eliminate both the taste and effect of alcohol in their shakes, but a little of both would serve to go a long way especially if one is paying double digit dollars.\n\nas for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, we opted to split the crowd favorite <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> consists of dry aged sirloin with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli, but my taste buds felt like they were in charlie brown's classroom in that all the ingredients were rendered a slur of incomprehensibility by the overpowering goat cheese.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, on the other hand, did a much better job showcasing its melange of ingredients consisting of pepper-crusted beef, housemade creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>,  and swiss cheese.  taste buds were dancing their way upstairs to marquee on this one.  for every burger, one has the choice of shoestring fries or the thick steak fries (which resemble seasoned potato wedges) so one will not go wrong depending on personal preference.  \n\noverall, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>  do not come cheap (ranging from $14-28) nor do the milkshakes ($11) but to paraphrase vincent vega from pulp fiction,  \"that's a pretty f*cking good milkshake/burger. i don't know if it's worth (insert some double digit number) dollars but it's pretty f*cking good.\"", 
            "stayed in vegas for four days and dined here three times. \n\nservice was wonderful and on point two out of the three times. on the other visit the server wasn't attentive and didn't check on us until we were finished. \n\nthe food was excellent during the three visits. on the first visit i had the turkey burger it came with sprouts, tomato, onion, lettuce topped with pepper jack cheese. i stole a few of the hub's wedge cut fries and they were great with a good seasoning and not greasy. on the second visit i tried the house salad topped with salmon. it came with avocado, tomato and mixed greens with balsamic dressing. the salmon was cooked perfectly and the portion was just the right size. on the last visit i tried the vegan burger. it was a house made patty with veggies and had a crispy breaded outside. it came with lettuce, onion, tomato and avocado. it was one of the best vegan burgers i have had. i don't know how they do it but the patty was juicy and was tasty. \n\nthe <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> adult shake is out of this world! a combo of banana, peanut butter cups, ice cream and liquor. it is a bit pricy for $11. bucks but they do fill a shake glass and give the metal cup with the extra shake. if you get a shake don't order a lot of food since this shake is almost a meal by itself or make sure to share. \n\nprice is average for a restaurant in vegas $14-$18.00. food is delish, ingredients are fresh, portions are large and for the most part service is good. \n\ni hope they open a location in the bay area . on my next trip to vegas i will be sure to make a fourth visit.", 
            "okay so once again i'm going to disagree with my fellow yelp reviewers and say that i was not wowed by my meal at holsteins shakes and buns, and i think there are better burger places in vegas. holsteins is located at the cosmopolitan hotel and casino directly across the entrance to the marquee pool and day club. because of the location you will need to have a reservation or be prepared to wait with the diva's and meat sticks that frequent the place.  we did have a reservation and were seated on time. the decor at holsteins is eighties cool. cartoon artwork dots the walls, boom boxes are painted in bright colors and a huge pink cow welcomes you in the bar area. after looking over the menu, my wife simone ordered the meatball parm sliders and i ordered the nom-<mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> topped with melted cheese, potato chips and house made thousand island dressing. the food came out fairly quickly, and on the side i had some tasty crunchy potato stick thin <mark>French Fries</mark>. my burger however was overcooked ( ordered medium and got well done). an overcooked burger made with fresh ground meat ends up tasting like sawdust, and this was the case. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> could have been saved by the dressing, but there was very little of the dressing on it. the chips on top were the best part of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. medium thin hand cut and fried perfectly, they stayed crispy on the sandwich and gave a nice contrast to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, but overall this burger sounded better then it tasted. simone's sliders were the exact opposite of my burger. the meatballs had great garlicky flavor, they were moist, tender and tasted fresh. they were topped with a mixture of sweet marinara and basil pesto and lots of melted creamy mozzarella. i so wanted to steal them from her and i had total meat envy.  we finished off the meal with a reese pb adult shake spiked with frangelico called the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>.  any monkey that could get drunk off this would have to be a lightweight because i could taste no alcohol in it whatsoever. it was still good, once again just not as good as advertised.  so in the end i would have given holsteins a 2 star rating for my food however simone's sliders choice saved the day...so overall holsteins gets a three stars from me.", 
            "the best burgers anywhere!!  my son told us about it, and my brother went and told us about it so we had to try it.  \n\ni had the mojito and it was so refreshing!!  my husband ordered the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake and he really enjoyed it.  \n\nwe were to share our orders since we wanted to try the various burgers.  i ordered the ahi tuna sliders and my husband ordered the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> with the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and truffle mayo.  well, when our burgers were delivered i only had 3 small bites of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>....i was in heaven.  my tuna sliders were okay, because the buns were a little hard and dry.  i was in heaven when i bit into <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> though!!  the <mark>French Fries</mark> were fantastic as well.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was expensive, but well worth it.\n\nwe sat on the couches in the lounge for lunch, because we didn't want to wait 15 minutes for a table.  it was like having lunch in our living room.\n\nwe will be back!!", 
            "this place looked interesting when i was walking through the cosmopolitan on my way to another restaurant, so we went back a few days later. \n\nwe were not starving, so we opted to share a burger, appetizer and milkshake.  if you're really hungry, you'll be able to finish a burger and shake with no problem. \nthey brought out a snack of salt and vinegar popcorn to everyone's table and this stuff is awesome. you'll be asking for another bucket of it.\n\nwe had the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> milkshake and it was everything you want an alcoholic milkshake to be.  i would imagine that all the different flavors would be as well.  \n\nwe ordered the buffalo chicken wing dip as an appetizer.  i've made this stuff at home and loved it, but wasn't thrilled with their take on it.  it was more like a creamy ranch hot sauce mixture, and you couldn't really find the chicken.  it tasted ok, but it isn't something i'd order again. \n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was one of the best i've had.  it was <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and we ordered it medium and it was cooked to perfection.  the flavors popped out all over the place.  if this review were based on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> alone, i would have given it 5 stars.  unfortunately, while tasty, the skinny fries were cold.  \n\nif you're on your way to the wicked spoon, save $20 and stop here instead.", 
            "i heard good things about holsteins and was really looking forward to trying it but i honestly didn't think it was that great. my personal opinion is that burger bar in mandalay bay is better..\n\ni had <mark>The Classic</mark> burger with gruyere cheese. meat was okay (not great) but the real culprit was the bun. way too thick (both in size and texture). maybe it's because i didn't get a million toppings on my burger that there was too much bread but i'm generally pretty simple with my burger order.\n\nfries were pretty good (ordered the shoestring).\n\nhighlight of the meal was the milkshake. ordered the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> (sans alcohol) and it was really delicious. we were wavering on whether to do this but i think this is a must order if you are here.", 
            "im a sucker for anything that comes with a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> on top of it.  if you are too, try the hen house burger which is basically a baco<mark>Truffle Lobster 'Mac N Cheese'</mark> with...you guessed it, a <mark>Fried Egg</mark>! so good! each burger come with a choice of either matchstick fries or steak fries.\n\nnow, for what i really took away from this meal.\n\nplease please please order the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> milkshake.  it is a reeses, banana, malt and it is extraordinary.  it comes with liquor in it, hence the name of the shake itself but i got the virgin version and im sure its equally as good.  i guess mine was more like the sober monkey milkshake\n\nanyways, get it!", 
            "ok no joke, this probably the best burger spot on the strip.\n\nlocated inside the cosmo, holstein serves some some burgers unlike anywhere else. to start off, the place looks awesome, i sure they spent alot of money here (as they did on everything in the cosmo) and it shows. there is plenty of street art, anime style graphics, along that old-world leather feel in the dining area. its definitely falls into the stylish chic category. plus that giant cow by the entrance looks cool! \n\nnow for the food, its awesome. everyone tries out the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and for good reason - cheddar, arugula, garlic chive aoili all make for a awesome burger. my personal fave:  is <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> - juicy, perfectly cooked kobe beef burger with crispy yam, teriyaki glaze and spicy mayo, and tempura avocado!.\n\nthe shakes are delicious (they do have alcohol in em) with the best one being <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>. all of the bamboozled shakes have alcohol but you can get virgin as well. try one out, they are delicious!\n\nbut be warned ahead of time, its not cheap, nor quiet. for a burger, fries and shake you are easily going come out spending $30+. come in on a monday or weekend and the place be packed and loud from everyone trying to get inside of marquee.", 
            "after passing by the restaurant in the cosmopolitan hotel on many trips i finally decided to eat there. i couldn't have been more pleased with my experience. the don't take reservations on weekends but we arrived at 8pm with a group of 5 and were seated immediately. the atmosphere and decor was fun, the restaurant was clean, and the waitress was very friendly. \n\ni ordered the carbonara chicken burger with grilled chicken breast, bacon, mushrooms, sweet pea aioli, <mark>Fried Egg</mark>, and provol<mark>One <mark>Two Dollar Cheese</mark></mark>. this was the juiciest and most flavorful chicken burger that i have ever eaten. they have countless beer choices and my friend ordered the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake and it was also delicious. i highly recommend this restaurant!", 
            "what's not to like about great burgers and even better shakes (especially when you can get them with alcohol in them). holsteins is located in the cosmopolitan hotel and just like the hotel has quite the vibe to it. there is open seating in the bar area but if you get there early enough you can get a seat in the dining area. \n\ntypically when i have friends in town, we seem to end up at holsteins (either because they want to try it or they are staying at the cosmopolitan hotel). either way, it's a great way to enjoy some pretty good burgers (but be prepared to spend a bit of money as the prices are definitely not that inexpensive).\n\nthere is definitely a large selection of alcoholic beverages that you can choose from, but i definitely recommend the adult shakes that they have. between my friends and i we tried the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>, oreo, and cereal bowl (tastes just like captain crunch). for burgers, we've tried quite a few of the different burgers - <mark>The Classic</mark>, the longhorn (with beef brisket as well), <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (asian flavors with teriyaki sauce), <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> (with assorted mushrooms), the el machete (with an anaheim chili - sounds spicy, but it really is not, it's good, but it could use some more spice), and of course, the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> (kobe beef patty with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>). the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> is what a lot of people like to try (especially those from california that can't get their <mark>Foie Gras</mark> anymore. you can also add a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to your burger (which i recommend) - just to make it even more tasty with another layer of flavor.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> also come with either shoestring or steak cut fries. i have ordered a side salad (to try and be a little healthier - although not by much since we were indulging in a burger), and was disappointed that they charged $2 extra dollars for <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> of a side salad over the fries (and it wasn't even a large salad). i guess next time i'll just indulge in the fries.\n\noverall, a great place to hang out with your friends, get some good burgers and have a lot of drinks. i'd definitely recommend enjoying the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> at least once.", 
            "holstein's was our first stop of las vegas. we were staying at the cosmo and i was so hungry. myself and my four friends thought this place sounded good. it was. partly because i was starved and partly because it was good. we did have to wait about 20 minutes to be seated, but it was no big deal. the chandelier is right across the way and they call you when you're table is ready. so, we went and had a drink at the chandelier. the place is pretty big and there is plenty of tables and booths. they have a bar you can sit at and tv's which was good for all of the guys watching march madness. also, the menu is pretty extensive if you like burgers. we absolutely had to try one of the spiked shakes. i got the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>. soooooo good. i drank it before my burger even made it out. it was delicious! i ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> burger and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. i literally ate it all. i am not a huge burger person. to me a burger is a burger. but this was pretty good and the fries were delicious. yes! loved it.", 
            "thanks to holsteins yummy bam-boozeled shakes (with the help of many cocktails beforehand), i can hardly remember a thing about my dinner here.\n\nafter polishing off many rounds of happy hour cocktails at comme ca, a group of eight of us found ourselves at holsteins (located inside the gorgeous cosmo hotel) for dinner on a friday evening. \n\nthe first thing i need to tell y'all is that all eight of us were fairly intoxicated before entering holsteins. and after all eight of us ordered a bam-bozzeled shake with extra shots of alcohol to start our meals, the rest of the evening became quite a blur. such a blur, in fact, that even though every single person ordered a different burger from their large menu (we also ordered appetizers), and even though i took a bite of everything ordered, i can't really recall everything i tried and if i even enjoyed it. i'm just glad i took pictures, otherwise i would have been totally guessing on some of the food we ordered. this is just a few of the items i tried that fun night at holsteins; \n\n<mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake- reese's, banana, malt, & frangelico liquor\ncereal bowl shake- cap'n crunch & absolut vanilla vodka\n<mark>Campfire Smores</mark>- smirnoff marshmallow vodka, chocolate, marshmallow & graham crumble\npork belly buns\nsalt & vinegar popcorn (complimentary)\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger (i ordered this)- kobe beef burger, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo & tempura avocado\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger- dry aged beef sirloin burger w/ <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli\nthe longhorn burger- beef patty topped w/ texas smoked beef brisket, whiskey bbq sauce, creamy cole slaw & dill pickles\n\ni do remember that we all thoroughly enjoyed our adult shakes. they were sweet and thick but the bartenders were more than generous with the alcohol because every shake was just as strong or even stronger than the cocktails we had before entering holsteins. \n\ni can honestly say i slightly do remember my burger being damn tasty. i loved the teri glaze on the patty and the tempura avocado was a nice touch. this burger reminded me of something i'd get at umami in la. as for the rest of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and the apps go, i'm assuming i and everyone else enjoyed them because every plate was licked clean. \n\nfrom what i remember the service was great and the atmosphere in the restaurant was fun and upbeat. the prices here are really reasonable.  \n\ni will definitely try holsteins again. next time i'll just make sure to be sober before eating here so i can fully remember my experience. till that day comes i'll give holsteins a solid 4 stars.",

            "alcoholic milkshakes? i mean, whaaaaaat? when i first heard about it i thought it was absurd to mix milk and alcohol but after trying it... it was actually pretty good! i did not end up getting a buzz or anything but hayy youre in sin city so why not treat yourself?\n\ni ordered the hen house burger with steak cut fries and the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake. i was more than satisfied and it was more than enough food. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are big so be prepared to open wide! they are also extremely large so *clap clap* if you finish it all. the shake was delicious too! im happy the waitress suggested the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> to me or else i would have fallen back on a classic oreo shake.... which i wouldnt have minded either :)", 
            "my husband is kicking himself for not coming here the last time we were in vegas! the adult bamboozled milkshakes were a total hit! he went for the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>! the oreo shake was also delish! \nthe golden standard burger has won best burger in vegas and for good reason! half pound, big enough to share with a friend. the fries were yummy as well. \nthe place is bigger than it looked to be from the outside and service was really good. \nbe sure to check out the special after dinner treat: it's smoking cool!", 
            "how can you not love this place? it's right next to marquee, there's burgers, and of course... alcoholic milk shakes! the menu is fit to your personal liking. it's difficult to give recommendations. while my bf got the standard burger, i ordered a chicken burger. the chicken was super juicy and flavorful. we ordered the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>, which is a peanut butter cups, banana, malt and alcohol (forgot which kind) milkshake. service was on point and ambience was fun... had a dj that night.", 
            "this was my go to burger spot before gr burgr opened up. holsteins is certainly not cheap, and you can definitely make some catastrophic decisions given their large menu- so here is some guidance on what you should get\n\nbam boozled shakes- not a huge fan of booze-cream but some of these are pretty spectacular\n\nbirthday cake- yea it pretty much tastes like a birthday cake \n\ncereal bowl- captain crunch ftw\n\nblack cow- even comes with pop rocks on top\n\n\nnot great\n<mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>- sounds great in theory, but in practice is pretty awful\n\ncreme brule- custard and booze do not mix \n\nred velvet- bleh\n\n\nbig buns\n\nmeat ball burger- some purists would probably not like this but it is delicious- it has a tasty focacia bun and pesto on it\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark>- bacon, goat cheese, garlic aoli- this is definitely not for the faint of heart- but those man enough to stare death from heart disease in the face will be rewarded with sensuous delights. \n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>- tempura avocado. thats fried avacado. if you aren't already ordering this burger as we speak i don't know what else to say to you.\n\n\nwhat to avoid\nnom nom- this is pretty meh. kobe beef should be so good it stands on its own (you are paying enough for that anyway)- but here it is covered in potato chips and 1000 island dressing- a dissapointment\n\n<mark>California Turkey</mark>- if you are trying to eat healthy this probably isn't the place for you but even the veggie burger is better than this", 
            "let's go, let's go, let's go!\nsuper fun, relaxed atmosphere- great place to stop by for a late lunch after an afternoon at the pools. even better if you fit in a morning workout, because the food is even more glorious without the food-coma-associated-guilt. \n\nservice: attentive and very helpful\n\nspiked shakes: amazing. can personally recommend birthday cake, cereal bowl, and <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>. what's even more amazing is how good the vegan cinnamon pecan shake was. \nyou really can't go wrong with any of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> (and as far as the sides go, i'm usually a sweet potato fry fan, but their <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> came out on top!). our group also may have ordered a second round of the crispy pork belly buns to take home.\ni can't wait to go back and try a few more of the \"nosh\" items (small plates/apps)- <mark>Ahi Poke Tostadas</mark> or <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark>, anyone?", 
            "burger lovers rejoice! holsteins combines american flavors with a twist of creativity. i tried the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake which was delicious but extremely thick. if you plan to have a full meal you may want to share the shake, there is only so much room in one's stomach. \n\nan added bonus was the movie style popcorn for free. i ordered el machete burger which i definitely recommend. i wish i could have had more of the side <mark>French Fries</mark> because they tasted like salty goodness. \n\ni also couldn't help but love the cute cartoon pigs dressed as cows!", 
            "i was skeptical in trying holsteins because of the mixed reviews, but after eating at gordon ramsay's burgr so much, i wanted a different burger place. originally we came here around midnight fri to try the place, but were told they stopped serving their regular menu at 11pm. they offered a late night menu instead which were basically just appetizers (no burgers/shakes). no biggie, we came back the next day after a fabulous time at marquee's dayclub...spoiler alert: we also came back the next day before we left on the drive back home because it was sooo good!!\n\nthe decor is so cute here w/ the anime pig wall posters and the theme totally matched w/ the cosmopolitan. our server made great recommendations for us & started us off w/ the complimentary small bucket of lightly salt/sweet popcorn. my bf killed that thing, talk about drunk munchies\n\nbamboozled shakes:\n<mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> - i added toasted coconut marshmallow to it and this was one damn good shake! the description/ingredients seemed so minimal, yet the shake tasted so amazing. it was like a cookies n cream reese's <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark>. this was my fav out of all the other shakes. \n\ntiramisu - they had me at mascarpone ice cream. i love mascarpone, but you could barely taste it in this shake. this tasted like a chocolate shake, not much espresso/coffee flavor. \n\nbanana creme pie - my bf go this 'cause he loves bananas and i would say this was my 2nd fav shake. it tastes exactly like a banana cream pie, but in shake form w/ chocolate. i liked that they topped it w/ white chocolate covered bananas.\n\nthe shakes are big enough to share, but trust me you won't want to. i like that you get a full glass shake and the extras are in the metal mixing cup so you can eat it w/ a spoon (yum!) i also like that their shakes all were thick & creamy!\n\napps:\nsurf 'n turf quesadilla - delish my favorite app! this ain't no taco bell quesadilla. it was crunchy and not oily at all. the lobster, steak and manchego cheese inside all just melted in your mouth and is bursting w/ flavor. must order!!\n\nsoft shell crab bruschetta - for a burger place, their presentation of these apps were tapas style and as nice as any fancy steakhouse. the softshell crab was on top of a thick cut brioche bread, the aioli and tomato salad made the app refreshing\n\ncrispy calamari - big enough portion to share, i couldn't stop dunking these rings in the sweet chili sauce. i like that they don't overbread the calamari rings\n\nmaine lobster roll - pricey for this, but there were generous amount of lobster. \n\ncrispy pork belly bun - tasted better than the ones at ramsay's burgr. the steamed buns weren't dry & sauce was spot on\n\nburgers:\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> w/ <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>(normally comes w/ fries, but paid $2 to upgrade) - the best burger ever!! most asian fusion burgers get overpowered by the sauce, but not here. it didn't taste like an ordinary overly sweet typical terriyaki burger. everything was perfect about this burger, that first bite was so orgasmic. this is what a burger should taste like! the whole brioche bun was toasted to perfection. i am not sure how they did it, but the top part of the bun and inside had a nice toast crisp to it. the tempura avocado was nice, added a different texture. you could taste each item in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and they all blended well together. the kobe beef patty was cooked medium, yet it was juicy and had a nice pink to it. <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were the best we've had as well & worth the upgrade! they were thick, fried, fresh, and crispy, no soggy oiliness at all. make sure to ask for buttermilk ranch to dip the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> in!! it tastes so divine\n\nfun-ghi on wheat bun w/ salad ($2 extra) - healthy combo huh? my 2nd fav burger, but my bf preferred this over <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> because he prefers the truffle flavor. again, patty was cooked perfect along w/ toasted wheat bun. i actually prefer the regular bun's flavor although the wheat bun was toasted the same way as the regular brioche bun. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> wasn't smothered in mayo thank god! the gruyere helped accentuate the truffle portabella & caramelized onions. salad was a generous portion of mixed greens & the dressing was tangy yet sweet & light (sort of like a coleslaw dressing w/ lemon). the only negative is that we added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, but there was no runny yolk...the egg was fully cooked :(\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> w/ <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>- everyone kept talkin about this burger, but we thought it paled in comparison to <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were bomb!\n\ni would have to say that holstein's outranks ramsay's burgr. we were so pleased w/ our meal that we sent compliments to the chef. we were lucky that both days we ate here, the executive chef was working. the food comes out fast and you will leave happily stuffed. don't forget to give them your identity player's card for points!\n\nnote: try and get a girl server. the first day we had a girl and she was totally on top of it. the 2nd day, we had a guy and he seemed easily overwhelmed", 
            "holsteins shakes are like a spiked milkshake ! they have really great creations and they were so good ! i recommend the frozen grasshopper or the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>. these are delicious !!! \n\nfrom there, we went on and had a few apps on the menu. the lobster mac and cheese, lobster rolls, sliders, and the bruschetta. everything was amazing except for the crab bruschetta. took a small bite and passed the plate. the only think i would say about this is that the bartender didn't take it off our bill. we did state that it was not good and shouldn't be recommended to people but it's an $18 app so i guess upselling is where this came in. i'm going to continue on how great everything else was though. the lobster mac and cheese and lobster rolls were dynamite ! the size of actual lobster in these small plates were terrific and so so good ! the mini sliders were great too ! the staff and bartender we had was really nice ! \n\nhighly recommend this place ! at least if you're passing by, just go for the shakes !", 
            "i've stayed at the cosmo several times and i always stop by here, it can get pretty crowded around peak times, but anything worth doing in vegas is the same. \n\nthe food:\nthe last time i was here i had the philly eggroll and the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>. the philly eggroll was actually really tasty and flavorful and i would definitely get it again. the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> (burger with chips and cheese inside) was on the salty side for me.\n\nthe highlight:\nthe highlight of this place every single time is the milkshakes. whether you get them alcoholic or non-alcoholic, they are absolutely delicious. i tried the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>, the banana cream pie, and <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>, and they are all soooooo good. i only wish they were only 24/7 so i can grab one after leaving the club. thumbs up!", 
            "late night shake craving brought me in. it was a weeknight and was fortunate i found lounge seating to enjoy some dessert after dinner. \n\ni was pretty full and didn't try the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> but went for a strawberry shake at around $9.00 - probably due to the great people watching included. the service was a bit on the slower side but my friendly waitress said they only had one gal making shakes and she gets overwhelmed when it backs up - lol.  you wouldn't know it by the taste of this shake, thick and rich tasting and i like the fact that they gave me  the metal  container which was another half shake! so filling but one of the best shakes ever i've encountered\n\ni'm looking forward to returning and checking out the lamb burger!", 
            "first of all, i want to start off by saying that the cosmopolitan is starting to irritate me. everything that is the cosmopolitan is now obnoxious and boring. the types of people the property attracts is just garbage -- <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> of the barrel. don't get me wrong. the building and architecture and design of it all is fantastic. lcd screens everywhere, hip little touches here and there make this property great. i just can't stand how un-classically vegas it is. they try so hard to be different, that in the end of it all, they lose themselves. the addition of holsteins shakes and buns to the property is just the cherry on top. i heard ravenous reviews about holsteins and i was excited to try this place. things like, \"the best burgers in vegas,\" and \"i love love love hoslteins\" were some of many glowing reviews. here is my 2 cents.\n\nthe lobster mac and cheese was good, but not great. surprisingly, the dish had a lot of lobster in it. unfortunately, the lobster taste was lacking and the texture was not there as well. lobster usually has a familiarly soft yet firm feeling when you bite it. theirs was rubbery and lacked flavor. the truffle panko crust on top was nice, but the lack of lobster taste really disappointed me. my favorite part of this dish was the one chip on the side. it consisted of this lobster salad that was full of flavor.\n\nupon request, which i thought was complimentary, was popcorn. though it wasn't your ordinary popcorn, this one was flavored in some weird mixture. i read that it was truffle popcorn. excited for some truffle infused popcorn, theirs was definitely not so. it was a mixture of a vinegary, buttery flavor that coated the popcorn. this was a weird mix and though not appetizing, i found myself reaching for the popcorn. i ate it, forgot how it tasted like, and then tried it again. the sting from the popcorn seasoning alone was enough for me not to eat it again. i guess my curiosity superseded my palate.\n\nquite possibly my favorite food, and naturally, the food i am most knit picking about, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is a classic. from the bun to the type of meat, and the almost infinite sauces and toppings you can put on, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is a great vessel to work with. with such an iconic item, at a restaurant that supposedly specializes in this stuff, you can't mess it up.\n\nand now, <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger -- it had kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. their take on a japanese burger sounds good on paper. the fried avocado alone would make me happy. it was fried and crispy, and velvety smooth at the same time. i just didn't have enough of it. that probably was the only thing good about this burger. everything else was a mistake. first of all, what is wrong with this is the kobe. i hate when restaurants advertise as serving kobe when we all know most of that is just an american breed, if not, from australia. second of all, when you cook a \"kobe\" beef burger, it has to be rare. nothing else will do. what i got was all grey inside. the crust was overly marinated and glazed and turned the meat super dry, and the inside wasn't any different. that is one way to kill an almost perfect burger. the teriyaki glaze was much too overwhelming and the crispy yam didn't help with the cloyingly sweet flavors. did i order the wrong burger? maybe, but that still doesn't make up for the overcooked patty.\n\nif anything, the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake may have been the only thing that was considerably good. it had malted banana gelato and peanut butter crunch. the adult version has frangelico, a hazelnut liqueur from italy. i opted out and went with just a regular. \"you are in vegas. live a little!\", you say? in hind sight, maybe i should have made this shake alcoholic. it would have made me feel better about <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>-par meal i just had. still though, the shake was sweet and the use of gelato made the shave quite delicate and smooth.\n\npretentious, and yet casual, the restaurant has no identity. i just can't associate this restaurant with good food. the same food could be served at a restaurant that looks like, maybe johnny rockets, with a lower price, and i still wouldn't think twice about it. i mean, they have red and yellow squeeze bottles for ketchup and mustard. come on! the food really needs an upgrade. how awesome would it be if finally, the las vegas strip had a go-to burger spot that was hip, and of course, delicious? i think that is a home run and a much needed thing on the strip. i guess i just have to wait a couple years for that to happen. for now at the cosmo, i guess secret pizza will have to do.", 
            "this place is terrible. the only redeeming thing on the menu are the shakes. we ordered the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> which was nice but too watery for my taste. i prefer a thick shake.\n\n <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were overdone and the meat did not taste like quality meat. we asked for medium but they were beyond medium- dry and tough. the fries were also overdone. i ordered the funghi burger. wouldn't recommended it. their \"best seller\" the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> wasn't great either. neither of us ate even half of our burgers and neither did most of the people at the table next to ours. \n\nthey bring you a spicy zesty mini bucket of popcorn which tasted better than any of the other things we ordered. \n\nthe service was friendly and helpful but the food just isn't good. it boggles my mind that this place has a 4-star average rating. it just doesn't make any sense.\n\nmaybe it was just an off night for the food but i wouldn't go back.", 
            "my favorite shake (the cereal bowl) is gone! it's okay, though...i drowned my sorrows in a <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> (reese's, banana, malt, frangelico) and felt much better.\n\nholstein's has some pretty amazing ranch dressing, so ask for a side to go with your fries.\n\ntheir veggie patty is also delicious--it's especially good when you sub it in <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark>.",

            "this was one of my family's favorite restaurants while in vegas; we loved it so much, we came here twice (once for dinner, once for dessert). both times, we had fantastic service, with really nice and attentive servers. \n\nwe liked how, instead of bread, they put a bucket of pizza flavored popcorn on the table. big hit with the family!\n\nthe menu is awesome! hubby had the longhorn burger and loved it. he also ordered some obscure belgian beer and said it was the best beer he's ever had. the kids shared a burger (i forget which one). the loved it. note: we asked the server to cut <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> in half but she said the health code prevented her from doing so, we'd have to do that ourselves. interesting. \n\ni had the holstein beef sliders. delicious. \n\nmaybe i'm used to higher prices, being from seattle, but we felt the prices here reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food. totally reasonable. \n\nwe returned a few days later for shakes. omg, the family went crazy for the shakes. you can order their \"bam-boozled\" shakes without the alcohol. one kid had the coffee and donuts shakes; it came with a donut hole in it and chocolate espresso beans. she was up all night but in an blissful state. hubby had the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>, and it was agreed upon, this was the best damn shake anyone had ever had. each shake was enormous - definitely enough for 2-3 people to share. \n\namazing place!",

            "my friend and i first came here in august before seeing the strokes at the chealsea and we loved our meal so much we decided to come back this week before going to see imagine dragons at the joint over at the hard rock. during our first visit i ordered the turkey sliders and an oreo shake so of course it was delicious, can't go wrong with a classic meal. however during this visit, i was highly disappointed in the price we paid for our meal. for this round i ordered the turkey burger because i hadn't eaten at all that day and more for the fact i wanted to try something different, i also ordered the <mark>Pecan Turtle Cheesecake</mark> shake off the menu to try something new. when the shake came, sure it tasted delicious for the first minute but then i realized it wasn't a shake, just a bunch of milk as the taste of pecan and cheesecake disappeared by each sip and more and more milk & whip cream came to taste even after dumping it in the silver cup of seconds. i had wished i got the oreo shake but it was too late. while waiting for our burgers i decided to start munching on the complimentary seasoned popcorn which was so delicious that when they messed up and put the goat chedder cheese on my burger instead of the regular cheedar cheese, i filled myself up with popcorn, that \"milkshake\" and water so by the time my fresh better tasting burger came out, i was full and didn't even want it anymore. maybe this review will get 4 or 5 starts on my third visit however right now i can only give 1 star to the waitress who provided excellent customer service and 1 star to the free popcorn. at least i know next time just to stick with the same old turkey sliders and oreo shake....hopefully they still taste good.", 
            "i was really excited to try holsteins because the menu looked great, there are a lot of highly rated reviews, and the restaurant has a fun vibe inside. while the other yelp reviews give the place 4 stars, my experience didn't live up to this expectation. this was mostly due to the lousy service that we received. our service wasn't terrible and our server was nice, but we had to ask for the complimentary popcorn to be brought to our table and ask on multiple occasions for our water to be refilled. in general, our waiter wasn't rude, but didn't seem to care about our experience here. \n\nthe menu is very unique though and the food that we tried was good. i wasn't in the mood for drinking, but the adult shake menu looks amazing. i was eyeing the <mark>Pecan Turtle Cheesecake</mark> shake, because who doesn't want to just drink a cheesecake with booze in it? my boyfriend and i were just in the mood for burgers so we ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, which had kobe beef with yam, teriyaki sauce, and tempura avocado and the longhorn burger with brisket, bbq sauce, and cole slaw. i was actually slightly disappointed with <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, but the longhorn one was delicious. we got regular fries and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and these were good, but not amazing. we had good burgers here, but unfortunately the high expectations that i had were not met. i'd give this place another try and i'd definitely come back for one of those shakes!", 
            "so we went here after the ufc 182 since we were staying at the cosmo.  first of all the place is way too loud!  it's like eating at a club.  we could barely hear each other talk nor think.  but at 11pm there weren't too many options.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> we got, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was stellar!  we added a piece of <mark>Foie Gras</mark> which elevated <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  it was one of the best i ever had.\n\nthe 3 alcoholic shakes we got were by far the best shakes we ever had.  the <mark>Pecan Turtle Cheesecake</mark> was the best.  it had caramel vodka and small pieces of cheesecake in it.  it was like eating a boozed dessert.\n\nthe <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> was solid too.  it had a mini whoopie pie and vodka in it too.  it tasted like taking small bites of red velvet cupcakes.   \n\nthe coffee & doughnuts one was good too.\n\nthis is a nice place to get good burgers and shakes but you better bring some earplugs.", 
            "to start off, i am not at all a fan of burgers mainly because it's hard to find one that tastes good. holsteins is the end-all-be-all of burger restaurants. first, their service is top notch. our server (dean?) was knowledgeable & personable. he provided great recommendations for burgers. their milkshakes are just as delicious. i had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger and <mark>Pecan Turtle Cheesecake</mark> milkshake. if you have a big appetite, you'll be able to consume both but the milkshake is more than big enough to share with another person. i'm definitely adding this place to my list of restaurant-musts whenever i'm in vegas.", 
            "holsteins really does not need my review but i need to talk about my affinity for holsteins. my family and i got there at around 11:45 am. not exactly lunch time yet so it was pretty spacious and not packed. holsteins has complimentary popcorn but our server was a bit tardy compared to other servers & their tables. so at first, we saw popcorn on nearly every other table and were wondering what's so special about the popcorn that got so many people to order it as their appetizer? then we realized it's complimentary when our server brought it out pretty late. not a huge complaint but just saying.\n\ni got <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and i was pretty satisfied. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are said to be 6 oz, which i find is just right. there are some people on this yelp page who say the size isn't that great and it was not big. but i mean what more do you want? it's 6 oz. i mean yeah sure 8 oz burger is bigger but for a burger, 6 oz was just right. after consuming a 6 oz burger, you don't feel disgustingly full. it's not too much beef and not too much unhealthy food. 6 oz is just right. any more is just not necessary. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were good. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is pepper-crusted and comes with a tomato confit. excellent burger. i loved it but i wouldn't recommend it. let me clarify. i do not regret getting it. i do not think it was a bad burger. but it wouldn't be one i would recommend to others. i didn't personally feel it was indicative of holsteins' caliber. so although i enjoyed it and it tasted great, i just wouldn't get it again. \n\nmy sister got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger and i thought the tempura avocado and the teriyaki glaze was fantastic. they really made the entire thing a masterpiece. the tempura avocado was unique and just burst on your taste buds. teriyaki glaze gave it a nice taste. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> we ordered were all juicy, not dry. we had high praise for holsteins. \n\nholsteins has a lot more on its menu than burgr. i love gordon ramsay but his menu pales in comparison to here. also, my god, the shake was fantastic. we got the <mark>Pecan Turtle Cheesecake</mark> or whatever it was. it was absolutely magnificent. not overly sweet. it just really was an explosion of several layers of flavor that fit together really well. i definitely recommend this shake. just absolutely tasty and i want another shake from holsteins. we looked around and a myriad of other tables ordered shakes too. they're a very great aspect of the restaurant. so, get a shake along with a burger! \n\nservice was okay. not too impressive. not friendly enough. the place is pricy. i don't deny that but hey it's vegas. did you expect to get cheap burgers? tbh, i'm pretty content with paying the price for my <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> though. it's a bit pricy but they deliver on flavor. \n\ni'll definitely be back, holsteins!", 
            "amazing shakes!\n\nlocated on the second floor of the cosmopolitan, holsteins seems to be the place to eat here.  a friend and i stopped in before a show.  on the weekends they do not take reservations.  good thing it wasn't too busy so we only had to wait about 5 minutes before being seated.  while waiting in their lounge area, it was very very loud.  almost too hard to carry on a conversation with someone sitting right next to me.  i was keeping my fingers a crossed for a quieter dining area.  \n\nmore quiet? not so much.  still a little loud but we powered through.  service wasn't too shabby.  we were checked on frequently during our meal with drinks always refilled. \n\ni tried their <mark>California Turkey</mark> burger with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> had a good flavor with avocado, cucumber slaw, spouts and a russian dressing.  pretty tasty.  the fries were also good but a little too much salt.  \n\namazing shakes... indeed.  i had the <mark>Pecan Turtle Cheesecake</mark> shake.  yum.  cheesecake, pecans, dark chocolate pieces, caramel sauce and stoli salted caramel vodka.  i fell in love.  so good.  \n\nfood was ok for me but i'd definitely come back for a shake any time!",

            "it all started with the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> which pretty much should be my tribal name from now on. hands down the best milkshake i have ever tasted in my life!!! it's malted banana gelato, peanut butter crisps, frangelico and priced at $11. whoever decided to start making alcoholic milkshakes should get a medal. genius. it is the perfect marriage of flavor without being to overpowered by <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>. \n\non to the grub. \nstarters: \nphilly cheez steak spring rolls with udder sauce $11 \nthey were alright, but could have used more seasoning. the meat was tender and the rolls were crisp. i did not enjoy the utter sauce which bares similarities to ketchup, but with more vinegar. \n\nfor the beef and fake beef selections we had: \n<mark>The Classic</mark> with two dollar cheddar (ridiculous) $15 \nurth burger with one dollar swiss $14 \nnew delhi chicken $14 \nall served with shoestring fries and that gross utter sauce. i ordered ranch, of course, and they turned out to be the winner of best potato in a supporting role to compliment the monkey shake. as far as <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> go my burger was ordered medium and came to me very well done. i ate one third of it. the bun was buttery and toasted to perfection and that two dollar cheddar was worth it. the veggie burger was probably my favorite of the three with a strong mushroom taste. pretty good. the chicken burger could have been executed better. the chicken lacked taste and the only saving grace was the apricot-date chutney on top. \n\noverall i will absolutely be back because the cosmopolitan is a good time and that shake has my heart and waistline captive. the menu has tons of creative options that intrigue me such as bull's balls, crispy pork belly bun and duck confit street tacos. i will get the tribe together and give it another go at it!", 
            "as a cow collector, the huge pink cow caught my attention, but aside from that, every other restaurant had a huge wait due to ces so we came here for dinner. \n\nfood: \nwe ordered a bunch of tapas to share and also to try different dishes. we ordered:\n\n<mark>French Fries</mark> cooked in duck fat: the fries tasted good, but the texture \nthrew me off. it wasn't crispy as i expect them to be. not sure if it's the way it's cooked or not, but i'll try it out again next time.\n\ncrispy pork belly bun: who doesn't love pork belly? very good!\n\ntenderloin roissini: very moist and was mixed with fois gras which made it even better!!\n\nmain lobster roll: wish we ordered more, it was delicious!\n\ntoscana with italian sausage: it was okay, but nothing special\n\nour waiter suggested the artichoke dip which she claimed to be the best. i beg to differ. it was nothing special. the pita chips that came with it looked like it was from <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> of the bag. \n\noverall, the food was great, service was okay, but the ambiance was too loud for my taste. i left a little deaf.", 
            "02/16/11 dinner: \n\nwithout planning in advance we ended up here. didn't have a burger! instead, had drinks, \"appetizers\" (turned out to be plates bigger than appetizers) and desserts. <mark>The Classic</mark> martini was terrific, i got the gin variety (does no one drink gin in this town?), containing a gin of which i had never heard (\"nolet silver\"?) which was floral and smooth, garnished with pickled shallot. (expecting shallot bulbs on a stick, instead it was shaved in <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> of the glass!) another had a\"bloody mary\", which came \"up\", containing pepper/cilantro infused vodka, which was greatly liked, especially the gigantic shrimp that came with it! food was \"<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>\" (fried dill spears, fried olives, caper berries, prosciutto, salami w/ herb-caper mayo), \"street tacos\" (crispy shells filled w/ shreds of duck confit, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, trufle crema & cranberry relish), \"truffle lobster mac n cheese\" (maine lobster, black truffle & mac in a tallegio-marscapone sauce), and \"bull's balls\" (2 risotto rice balls stuffed with veal, topped with \"tomato fondue\" and a slice of lardo). a very rich, decadent collection of dishes, i thought all were very well done, especially the mac (wow!). the \"bulls' balls\" weren't as good as i had hoped, mostly rice with very little filling, and the lardo kinda lost amongst the strength of the \"tomato foudue\", which was genius. (an angel-hair pasta with that fondue would be crazy good.) the \"street tacos\" were really good but really rich. my fave thing on the \"<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>\" were the fried olives (only 2, we had to fight over those!). ended with a \"stout float\" (guinness, ice cream, oatmeal crumble), very good. after food we had a really wacky concoction: \"johnny apple seed\", consisting of knob creek, honey and apple cider. first of all, the very nice server said it was the first time that it had been ordered since it was added to the menu (!) and second, they had no idea what \"hard cider\" was! we had to explain, there are alcoholic apple ciders out there, was this one of those?, but the answer never came. no matter, it was a nose and throat clearer! ahem! but a great idea, imho. sipping it took about 15 minutes, and well worth it! so overall, i'd say go. now i need to go back for a burger, perhaps that \"duck duck goose\", stuffed with duck confit, duck cracklings & <mark>Foie Gras</mark>! yikes!", 
            "amazing burger...  got to love the new trend in high end burger joints.  would i spend $18 on a burger everyday? no, but when i did i sure enjoyed it.  i had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and it was fantastic.  the only thing i did not like was the steak fries.  i tried my wifes shoestring and friends <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and they were both great.  the steak fries reminded me of something from jack in <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>.  service and atmosphere was great.  the cosmopolitian hotel/casino is awesome.", 
            "my first trip to vegas was a total culinary disaster. so this time, i did some research. i'll admit, what drew me to holstein's wasn't really the food...it was <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> shakes. <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>? yes, please. and that's what i ordered, which turned out to be delicious beyond my comprehension. whoever thought to mix banana gelato and frangelico deserves to be worshipped.\n\nthe food was equally as outstanding. when i ordered my <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger \"medium rare to rare,\" my server warned, \"the rare is cold and red, while the medium rare is warm and red. would you prefer it warm or cold?\" and so i ordered it medium rare. and out it came, warm and red and juicy kobe beef. i was shocked that for once i didn't have to overcompensate in my ordering just to get a decent amount of pink in my burger. the toppings were perfect (you can't not love tempura avocado, really), and even the teriyaki glaze, which i was skeptical of, wasn't overpowering. the shoestring fries that accompanied it were great, especially with a side of truffle mayo.\n\non top of everything, our server was excellent and very attentive, which in my experience hasn't been the norm in vegas restaurants. holstein's reassured me that there, in fact, is good food to be found on the strip, and i will certainly be returning here on my next trip.\n\nupdate: i finally got back here and had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger this time. a little overcooked, and not as bold in flavor as <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. also, the fries were thicker and not as crisp--why the change?! i'm not as in love with holsteins as i used to be, but it's still one of my favorite affordable spots on the strip. i'll be back a third time for sure!", 
            "i'll get the bad news out of the way: the hostesses were shockingly rude and their ineptitude staggering. had i not had my heart set on a burger, i would have turned on my heal and gone next door (who had a friendly greeting just viewing the menu).  i overheard the table next to me going on about the ridiculousness of these horrid hostesses after being sat by one.  these girls had a \"what are you doing here?\" attitude. i imagine one of them answering the phone: \"holsteins, you're welcome.\"  perhaps smiling 101 could be a start?\n\nthat being said:  server (kyle) recommended <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger and it was the best burger i've had ever.  tempura avocado, nori furikaki, crispy sweet potatoes...give me one right this second.  service was cool, friendly, and professional.  nicely done.\n\natmosphere was fun and lively, but the stupid bass from the dj was literally vibrating <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> i was sitting in.  let's go for quality over quantity here, holsteins. \n\nbamboozled shakes are inventively crafted, by suggestion had the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>...yum.\n\n1 star for door, 5 for service and food.", 
            "stopped by here for dinner after finding it impossible to get into mandalay bay to go to fleur.  is calle 13 really that popular?\n\njohn curtas claimed that holsteins pork belly buns were almost as good as momofuku's in nyc (http://www.eatinglv.com/2010/12/holsteins-has-got-it-goin-on/) so we had to try them out.  a lemon meringue shake and a korean burger rounded out the order.  my husband and i were starving from driving around mandalay bay and luxor for an hour trying to find parking and getting stuck in traffic.   our very nice server quickly took our order.\n\nthe food came out very, very fast.  which was great but also a little disconcerting.  they can cook that fast?  lbs, holsteins sister restaurant at red rock casino, takes forever!  and we weren't the only ones.  our neighbors all got their food within 5 minutes of ordering.  crazy.\n\nthe pork buns are not \"almost as good\" as momofuku's.  not even close.  maybe because holsteins can see john curtas coming a mile a way in his all-white suit, he got a better version.  but these were just ok.\n\nthe korean burger had a good flavor to it but there was too much liquid involved and <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> bun was pretty soggy.\n\nthe lemon meringue shake stole the show.  it's sounds weird but salted caramel in a lemon shake with grand marnier - brilliant!\n\nwe figured our modest order and half-starved state would leave us enough room to try the infamous china poblano next door. we were wrong.  the fat content of the food combined with the shake made us full very quickly. \n\ni like the service and the concept and the shakes.  i am definitely a fan.", 
            "we came here on our last day - we both had hangovers and needed something greasy and a nice fat burger was definitely the remedy to our hangovers. \ni ordered the hen house burger with <mark>Fried Egg</mark>, bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion and ketchup and a side of shoestring fries ($14) and <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> got the longhorn burger topped with smoked beef brisket, whiskey bbq sauce, cole slaw and dill pickle and a side order of steak cut fries ($16). both burgers were huge! i really liked my burger, i wasn't too sure about the <mark>Fried Egg</mark> on a burger but that shit was amazing! the yolk cracked and the bun soaked it all up and it was delicious :) and the you can't go wrong with bacon - it was the perfect breakfast/lunch/hangover burger ever! <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> wasn't fond of his though - he said that brisket that came on top was really fatty and the brisket was the reason he ordered <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. he helped me eat my burger which was fine because i could only eat a third of it anyways. i couldn't get enough of my fries either, those shoestring fries were amazingly addicting. \nservice was alright - i was too out of it to really care about the service though, i just wanted my food which did come out fast so i had no complaints.", 
            "after reading many yelpers raving about this place, the girlfriend and i decided to give it a shot.  the pink cow didn't hurt too (how can you turn away a pink cow?!? she says)\n\nlocation:  located in the new cosmopolitan hotel right outside of marquee nightclub, this joint is in a prime spot to see and be seen in.  definite positive points in my book.\n\natmosphere:  the top 40s music really gets your heart pumping and is very fitting for a cosmo hotel food establishment.  i honestly didn't take much notice to the artwork and aesthetic elements of the restaurant.  very pop modern feel without being too noisy or overbearing.  there is a bar and lounge area at the front if your in the mood for a more casual mingling time with knee high tables and lcd tvs behind the bar.  beyond that is the regular dining portion of the restaurant.\n\nfood:  \n-<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>\n-\"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger\"\n-<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\n-shoestring fries\n\n<mark>Fried Pickles</mark> baby!  money. ok honestly this was the first time i had <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> in my life, and well i am a die hard pickle lover (so really any sort of pickles would be great), these were pretty bomb.  they give you a little tin with some breaded <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> in them, fried olives, and caper berries!  what is a caper berry? yes first time i have come across one myself (like ash finding a new pokemon i guess? kinda puzzling, yet exciting).  but yah, it was pretty darn good.  i was kinda sad that there were only a few of them (about 5-6 wedges of pickles, 2 olives, 2 caper berries), but they were good, while they lasted. :(  also there was a small assortment of deli meats (salami, ham, prosciutto) which seemed like an odd pairing with the fried items, but they were a a nice tasty tid bit before our meal came.  we both having similar tastes, the gf and i ordered \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" burger.  to be honest, the server who brought our burgers out said this was the best burger in his opinion on the menu.  (i'll be the judge of that myself sir, lol).  well this burger was seriously a masterpiece in of itself.  kobe beef patty with a teri glaze, brought me back to punahou carnival days (if your from hawaii and know what im talking about), and on top of that you get the little shredded yam crispies adding color and a little bit of sweetness to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, nori furikake inside, with a generous piece of fried avocado, again giving another element of texture and creaminess to your bite.  then for the finale, the spicy mayo spread on the bun (like the kine you get with spicy tuna sushi), is like a ninja just hiding there as you gaze at all the other elements of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, waiting to make its presence known.  this my friend gives you that zing of heat (without being overpowering) that really brings all these flavors together, and for me this spicy mayo was the winnaz.  quite honestly one (if not the) best burger i've had the honor to come across in my life.  you also get your choice of bun (white or wheat).  both of which are quite tasty, as i got the white and the gf got the wheat, really can't go wrong with either.  they come with your choice of fries: shoestring or steak-cut.  i didn't want to copy the gf as i wanted the shoestring, so i convinced her to ask to upgrade to <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  they come in little mock fry-baskets which is a thumbs up for presentation.  for the taste of each of the fries, both were very good, would definitely recommend either in a heartbeat.  also they give you a nice amount of fries which is always great!\n\nprice:  ok so this is always <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> side of a vegas story, but honestly people it is vegas and yes $16-17 bucks for a designer burger is on the steep side for most people, but it is in my honest opinion worth it.\n\nverdict:  holsteins presents itself as a hip, modern burger/diner type joint in the heart of the new cosmopolitan hotel.  it's decor and atmosphere really mesh well with the feel of the hotel itself and the food it presents.  you really get what you pay for in my opinion, a great designer burger, one that you quite honestly could not find anywhere else.  in comparison, for $16-17 i would take it over blt's wagyu beef burger & max brenner's kobe burger any day for the same price range.  it's definitely a place to check out if you're in the moooood for some good burgers!\n\n(they are known for their shakes too, but we didnt get to try them as the idea of a shake first thing in the morning after a long night clubbing didn't quite fit the agenda, if you know what i mean)", 
            "believe the hype...this place is real. we ate here on a saturday night and the food and atmosphere is awsome.  quick tip: make reservations or you'll be waiting for a while and do not ask for \"duck-fat fries\" because they don't serve it anymore\n\nthis place is situated inside the comopolitan at city center, it sits right across from the chandelier room (?) and from tao. the atmosphere is very modern, hip, trendy.  the server we had was awsome. she was very attentive to a larger group (we had 12 peeps) and patient with us.\n\non to the food: i had the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> appetizer,  \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" burger with shoestring fries and \"midas touch\" beer. the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> were good, they bread and deep fried a regular size pickle that is sliced lengh-wise with <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> ass dipping sauce (forgot what it was called). burger = i had mine done medium, and it came out perfectly with t-l-o (tomato-lettuce-onions) you really can't describe in words how good this gourmet hamburger was other than to say, its on my list of top 3 hamburgers i've eaten. i really wanted to limit what other ingredients that made up the hamburger itself.  i wanted to taste the kobe beef, and yes, please believe, all thats been said about kobe beef.  the house made bread, i think, was the perfect ingredient to the hamburger, it was fresh, not too \"doughy\". the shoestring fries was \"eehh\" only thing that saved the fries was the dipping sauce i had leftover from the appetizer. it was more of an afterthought.\n\nbeer = i could have gotten another one of these, its made by dogfish and it was really good. it really complimented my meal. \n\nnext time i'm in sin city, i will make it a point to make another stop here",

            "so close but so far is all i can say of this new restaurant.  i went with a friend on opening night and everything was perfect; the meat was cooked to order, the toppings were flavorful and well proportioned, the bun was great, and i walked out of there claiming that it might have unseated burger bar as one of my favorites (more on burger bar in a future article).  the bacon, cheese, and garlic aioli all had great flavor, and didn't compete with each other.  i went back a second time a week later with the always negative writer of our sister site, <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> burger blog, and the meat was very overcooked.  again the toppings and bun were excellent, but the overcooked meat greatly took away from our experience and flavor.  we both agreed that if the meat was cooked medium-rare as ordered, it would have earned several more points.  being a restaurant that has a burger and shake theme, this is something that really should be right every time.\n\nbut as you know, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> isn't the only factor taken into consideration.  the fries need work.  the first time i ate there our waiter explained that we needed to get the shoestring fries because they were a clone of mcdonalds' fries, and they were.  they were really good, and maybe lacked some of the greasiness that coincide with the big chain's version.  the second time they seemed to be a bit different, and almost seemed to stray towards the lackluster fries of burger king after the great change.  the duck fat fries also seemed a bit better the first time than the second.  another great item were the 'loaded' shakes; mostly classic flavors and mixes with a good amount of alcohol in each one.  while they are a bit expensive, the few that i've tried have all been quite tasty.\n\ni managed to squeeze a third visit here in the midst of my busy schedule, and this time there were more problems.  first of all, we had a horrible wait for food; people sat after us, ate and left before any of our food arrived to our table.  the restaurant was severely understaffed for some convention that was in town that week.  while i understand that rushes do occur, some careful planning and a bit of coordination with the hotel management to see what kind of occupancies you'll have from week to week would be a good idea.  on top of our wait, i got steak fries instead of shoestring, which isn't a deal breaker, but when i'm supposed to be finding anything wrong with my meal this makes it easy.  like my first visit, the meat was cooked perfectly so this gives me hope that they might be back to their original form, even with a packed house. my asian themed burger had great flavor overall, and a little bit of a bite which was welcome.  it came topped with an over-easy egg that was cooked perfectly, and a glaze that had good flavor.\n\nall things considered, this restaurant has already brought me in for three separate visits so there is some merit to that.  but the inconsistencies from meal to meal, combined with the not-so-great service prevent me from bumping this burger to the next level.  it's definitely worth a first time visit, if not just to experience the cosmopolitan property and take in extreme vegas opulence.", 
            "i was in town for a convention so i just grabbed a seat at the bar. it was pretty busy, but the bartenders were all pretty friendly. \n\ni started with the fried green tomato salad. i think it was my favorite part of the meal. it was 3 slices of tomato fried with some mixed greens. it was pretty tasty, though it was $14 for a smallish starter. \n\nthe hen house burger was good, but a bit messy. i am never a fan of a burger that is so juicy that it soaks through <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> bun and makes <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> fall apart. then it all goes to pieces and you end up being that guy eating a burger with a fork and knife. never good. \n\nanyway, the hen house was tasty. they seem to skimp on the fries though. they were tasty, but the cup of fries you get seems a little small. \n\nas for drinks, they have quite a few wines and craft beers available, which was nice. \n\ntwo glasses of wine ($20), a salad and burger was $55.",

            "we found holstein's by accident, wandering around the cosmopolitan after deciding to skip a dinner at the henry. good decision. \n\ni went with the hen house burger (<mark>Fried Egg</mark> and bacon) with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, wife went vanilla and got <mark>The Classic</mark> with shoestring fries. burgers were great, accurately cooked - although so juicy that <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> bun quickly becomes soggy. i was happy to see shiner bock on the draft list so i skipped the bamboozed shake, wife had a chocolate malt. she claims the malt was one of the best she has ever had, shiner is always perfect.\n\nfairly full off of the cheddar popcorn, burgers and fries, we decided to not do dessert - except for the nitro meringues. order the nitro meringues. a waiter brings them from the kitchen in a bowl of liquid nitrogen and serves them to you one at a time. i was having so much fun blowing smoke that i can't remember the taste.\n\noh yeah, they had baseball on tv, +1.", 
            "found holsteins on yelp--and gave it a go for lunch!  i love burgers--and this place was pretty good. \n\nthe cosmopolitan hotel is an upscale establishment located in the new city center development.  we were staying at the belllagio, and the cosmpolitan was right next door.\n\nthe restaurant is located on the second floor.  it was a bit loud and chaotic when we got there--which is probably to be expected on a busy friday in vegas.\n\ni started with the cereal bowl--an incredible vanilla milkshake with vanilla vodka and captain crunch mixed in--awesome--though not super potent from an alcohol standpoint.\n\ni had the hen house burger--which is a burger with bacon and <mark>Fried Egg</mark> on top, and i added american cheese.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was fantastic, cooked to order, and served with seasoned steak fries which were a bit dull compared with the rest of the food (you can order shoestring fries instead).  as said in another review--the juiciness of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> definitely soaked <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> bun making it a bit unappetizing.\n\nfrom a service standpoint we were seated immediately, and then there was some confusion as one server took our drink order--which took about 10 minutes to fill, and another server then took over.   after that the server was quite attentive despite being very busy.\n\nthough not a cheap restaurant--holsteins was reasonably priced for this part of the strip.  the ambience was fun and bright, and i would definitely return for the shake!",

            "like my uncle dick, this isn't a bad place, just a little bit odd.  it has some good and some not so good (but no restraining orders, okay uncle dick?)\n\nservice was a little disjointed.  a manager type guy came by and said our waiter would be right with us.  then he came by again and asked if he could get our drink order.  i thought that was great, but then it seemed to take awhile to get our drinks.  \n\nbeer selection was very good and reasonably priced.  b/f got the sliders, which he liked.  i had the kobe and potato chip burger which was very good.  also had the shoestring fries, which i liked but would probably choose the steak-cut next time.\n\nwe only had to wait a little while for a table but the bar area is weird because you can't stand by the bar because the people in <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> in the bar area (which are really low) then yell at you for blocking the tv.  so that's odd.  also, the servers wear clothing with suggestive slogans such as \"nice buns\" or \"i eat meat\" on them, so if you find that kind of provocative attire offensive, you might want to head across the street to the harley davidson cafe, just sayin'.", 
            "my friend told me this place was yummy. \n\nit was not yummy!\n\nsunday before checkout and we decided to eat here. it was filled with testosterone filled men watching football and yelling at the tv. not my idea of dining out. \n\nlobster mac & cheese was not good. i could've made it better. the macaronis were tiny little noodles. chef boyardee style noodles. not enough lobster and def not enough cheese.\n\n<mark>Fried Pickles</mark> were exactly what it was. not a fan.\n\ncalamari was actually tasty. not the traditional with sauce on the side. it was on <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> of the plate and calamari on top with slices of jalape\\u00f1os!\n\nthe <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger was ok. supposedly the best burger in vegas but not to my standard. i asked for medium and it came out well done. it was too charred. only tasted the burnt meat. the idea of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was awesome with aged goat cheese and arugula but that's it. just the idea was great. \n\ni wouldn't dine here. it's not worth the money and experience.\n\nthe shorts on the girls were cute. it said \"soft buns\" or \"perfect buns\" on the butt but trust me, their buns with neither.", 
            "being the beer (and hamburger) lovers that my friends and i are, we decided to pay a visit to the often praised holsteins shakes and buns.  i have to say that i was a little disappointed in the food.  thankfully, some good craft beer made up for this.  \n\nwe started with a bucket of popcorn, which seems to be a gastropub sort of trend these days in vegas.  popcorn is popcorn, and by that measure i guess it was good.  i ordered the bulgolgi burger ($16.50).  i expected an interesting flavored ala bachi burger.  what i got was a mediocre burger, unfortunately. although i ordered it medium rare, it came medium well.  the patty was dry, and the buns seemed a little hard as well.  i ordered the steak fries, which were drenched in saltiness.  i was thankful for this though because i tasted a skinny fry, and it was crunchy and over fried.  \n\nwhile holstein's burgers were a let down for the price, the beer selection for me was redeeming. while not the best beer offering in vegas (or the strip for that matter), they did have lagunitas ipa and firestone walker pale ale on draft.  <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> selection was pretty decent.  \n\nall in all there are a couple of better burger/beer places on the strip.  i can't say that i will be back to holsteins.", 
            "i came here specifically for the urth burger with no intention to even glance at the milkshake section of the menu. but somehow my eyes were caught by the words \"guava float.\"\n\ndamn, that sounds good. skyy citrus vodka, house-made guava soda, coconut sorbet, pink bubble sugar, completely dairy-free! i just had to order it. damn... http://su.pr/1otbxj\n\nsipping on this fruity paradise made the atmosphere a little more tolerable. you see, i had flown into vegas early that morning, spent most of the afternoon walking all around the strip and all i wanted was a quiet relaxing dinner. little did i know that the marquee nightclub was right next door and holsteins tries to draw in that saturday night crowd with a dj playing loud booming music and having the waitresses wear short, tight, red dresses. but somehow, the guava float ($11) made all of that tolerable. i couldn't taste <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> but i was feeling that buzz :)\n\nthe urth burger ($13) was rockin! house-made vegan patty, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sprouts & avocado. yummmmmm!!! the skinny fries that it came with were also dangerously addictive. http://su.pr/2kkpvm\n\nthe artwork in here, which i think is created by a local artist, is kickass! one of my favorites: http://su.pr/6tjk9n\n\nas good as everything was, it was also extremely filling. thank goodness for leftovers that save me money while in vegas! and yes, next day urth burger with skinny fries are still good!\n\ngreat food, great service, fun atmosphere. who would've thought that a vegan can not only survive but be amazed by a burger & milkshake restaurant! viva las vegas :)", 
            "a slightly more upscale version of your normal burger/shake joint with a vibrant and lively atmosphere!  the menu options are unique and every burger description screams order me....we ended up going with the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> (voted best burger in vegas according to the bartender) and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>.  while the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was really not my favorite (misled by the bartender...), mostly because the aged goat cheddar cheese overwhelmed all the other flavors, <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> was <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> diggity!  i chose to add a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to the kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo & tempura avocado goodness that made up this burger....perfect mixture of flavors and textures.  the fries were just typical, nothing special really with the shoe string or <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.   i'm a big fan of really just this <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger...i don't know if i would frequent this place all the time since <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are a little pricey.   definitely comparable to the bachi burger concept....but i think i may prefer bachi over this place....especially given the price point and the options for fries are better at bachi.", 
            "i've been looking forward to trying holstein's since reading an article on their unique and exceptional desserts. i finally got there last night, and boy was i excited. i'd read positive reviews and food suggestions earlier in the day so i knew exactly what i wanted. to my surprise, it was dinnertime on friday and we got seated right away. there were several open tables, but the hostess seated us at one of the smallest tables in the restaurant...and the top of it wobbled when we moved our arms. my husband ordered a $6 <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> and i got the $11 cereal bowl shake. my husband's glass was dirty and he asked to exchange it with a clean one...no apology, but at least the 2nd glass was clean. my shake was good, but i couldn't taste the flavored vodka at all. i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger medium-well and my husband got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> medium-rare, both with steakfries. when <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> arrived, they looked delicious, but not nearly as \"pretty\" as in the photos in the gallery on their website. i tried a crispy fry first and burned the roof of my mouth...those little metal pails must really hold in the heat!? both of our burgers were tasty, but came overcooked. and my beef patty was a lot thinner than i anticipated. i think <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are called \"big buns\" because the bun's bigger than <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fixin's! the waitress brought our bill without asking if we wanted dessert...the main reason why i wanted to try the place! i told her we wanted to order the candy store, and she said, \"oh, since you ordered the shake, i just figured you wouldn't want dessert too. most people don't get both.\" it might've been all the cool piggy artwork surrounding me, but that was a bit offensive and made me feel like a lil' piggy! the dessert was the best part of the meal...especially the shooters on <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>. it was fun eating cotton candy in a restaurant! it was adorable! but i wouldn't say their handmade candies are worth $15. i probably won't return to holstein's after dropping $81 at the mediocre burger joint with fun desserts. atmosphere was fun and artwork was amazing!

            "my wife and i went here for a late dinner while on our anniversary vacation in vegas. after a 25 minute wait, we were finally seated. it was crowded and loud with people and the music. the walls had humurous cartoon murals of a pig in a cow suit doing hilarious things...much funnier than the chik-fil-a cows!\nthe food was very good and delicious! my wife ordered the blueberry pie shake without <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> in it (we're pregnant) and it was just as good as eating the pie itself! apparently all the shakes can be made with out alcohol, which makes it a bit more helpful if you have kids in tow, although the crowd seemed to be mostly young partiers at that time of night.\n\nshe ordered the chicago dogs which came in 3 mini hot dogs, they were flavorful and the bun was really tender. i took the server's advice and tried the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger (which was one of the number one rated burgers on the lv strip so i was told). it was very good and juicy full of flavor and on a good bun. the shoestring fries came out a bit cold. everything was pricey as expected for a restaurant in the cosmopolitan but the quality was all there along with the service. overall, minus the loud noise and the wait time, it was worth the good tasting food!", 
            "every time i try to come here, the wait is always ridiculous.  i never remember to make reservations either cause, well, it's a burger place!  finally, this past weekend around 2pm, after a somewhat \"short\" wait of 40 minutes, i got to try holsteins.\n\nit actually took the 4 of us awhile to look through the menu, and in the end, i went with the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, which is a burger with dry aged beef sirloin burger, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli.  i ordered it medium rare and came with a nice pink middle.  what really caught my attention about the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was the dry aged beef, since dry aging beef condenses the beef flavor, and wow that burger was juicy.  out of all 4 burgers, mine was the only one that had juices dripping down my fingers, even versus the kobe beef burgers!\n\nthe toppings were all great, especially the aged goat cheddar.  you can tell it's a little different than your normal cheddar.  the garlic-chive aioli has a mellow garlic taste.  besides hoping the bacon was a little bit crispier, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> is really a burger that's up there in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> world.  it's just a very tasty burger and i can see why it is so popular!\n\ni also tried a bit of <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, as well as the korean bull-gogi.  <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> is more of an asian fusion burger, with teriyaki glaze and a tempura avocado that sits on top of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  it also has a kobe beef patty, so the whole burger had this velvety smooth texture thanks to the fatty patty and the smooth creamy avocado!  i would like a bit more teriyaki sauce though.\n\nas for the korean bull-gogi burger, the patty is marinated to give it extra flavor.  the best part is definitely the <mark>Fried Egg</mark> that sits on top.  who can resist the egg yolk just running all over the kimchi slaw and the beef patty??\n\nout of all the fries, i liked the steak cut fries the most.  crunchy exterior with a creamy potato center.  <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were great as well.  the shoestring fries were a little stale to me.\n\nnow, with shakes as part of its name, we knew we had to try a few of their shakes and ended up getting the black cow float and the frozen grasshopper.  black cow float is a fun and somewhat nostalgic shake since it is more like a coke flat with the ice cream rather than a true shake.  it even comes with pop rocks!  the frozen grasshopper is a must for any mint chocolate fans.  smooth creamy minty frozen goodness.  for both shakes, we could taste the alcohol but it was pretty well masked!\n\nthey also have a bunch of beers on draft.  <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> triple karmeliet is a good one!\n\nprice-wise, it is pricey.  our burgers were around $18, with shakes at $11.  the price should reflect great service but i found the service a bit lacking.  our waitress only came to check on us twice and it took awhile to get her attention for the check as well.\n\nafter our meal, i can see why so many people like <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> at holsteins.  can't wait till the next time to try our other burgers!", 
            "came here to eat lunch during my last day in vegas with a friend. we were looking for a place inside the cosmo to eat (besides wicked spoon, which we went to more than once already) and ended up here. i was really disappointed by the food here.\n\ni ordered the <mark>California Turkey</mark> w/ shoestring fries, along with a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> on top. i've had turkey burgers at other places before that were tasty, but this place didn't get it right at all. the meat was dry and there was no flavor to it. what made it even worse was that they stuck the big toothpick right into the <mark>Fried Egg</mark>. the yolk broke and started running before my dish even got to me. it got to the point where i had to use a knife and fork to eat, because <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> of the patty got so soggy that i couldn't even pick up my burger.\n\nservice was okay. the waitress took our orders and brought out the food pretty fast, and checked on us occasionally. when we asked to split the check by a certain amount, the waitress said she could only split it 50/50.\n\ni would be very reluctant to come back and try this place again. i can get better tasting burgers for under $15 (about the average price here). they can't even serve a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> properly.",

            "holsteins was bustling with activity when i went on a recent sunday afternoon.  the restaurant was brightly lit and loud.  there was a game on the televisions in the bar, and as a result, the bar was packed.  after waiting ten minutes for a table, we were seated at a comfortable table.  our server was attentive and friendly.  she acknowledged us promptly and took our drink orders.  she provided several suggestions, and when i asked about the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>, she informed me that it was done as a charity promotion but was so popular, they kept it on the menu.  \n\nafter serving us drinks, she provided us with a small bucket of popcorn.  cute. and tasty.  i am sort of a popcorn kind of guy.  you probably didn't know that about me, and probably didn't want to know that about me. there are more things i can share, but i won't.  the popcorn was fresh and warm.  it also had a distinct flavor that was hard to place.  i thought it could have been a pickle flavor seasoning.  hey, i am at a burger place, right?  it was salt and vinegar.  tasty.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came out quickly, and cooked to specification.  i asked for a little bit of pink, and that is what i got.  i had the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>.  it was tasty.  it could have been better.  the menu billed it as kobe beef.  at $16.50 for an 8 ounce burger, i can assure you this is not authentic kobe beef.  the first kobe beef in the last two years in vegas is at city center.  they are charging $35 an ounce.  so, maybe they are billing the wagyu as kobe beef.  or maybe it is the kobe style beef.  who knows.  i just know it wasn't what was billed.  \n\nwe skipped <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> because we were trying to eat on the cheap.  a diet coke, an iced tea, and two sandwiches came out to $42.  a little pricey in my opinion.  but, considering where i am, i don't mind paying for it.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, as i mentioned was cooked perfectly.  the bun was firm, but a little on the plain and boring side.  the fries, i got the shoe string, my companion got the thick fries, were hot, salted and well seasoned.  i preferred the shoe string fries over the thick fries.  so did my friend.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was topped with white cheddar, potato chips and thousand island.  there was barely any sauce.  the chips covered the perfectly melted cheese.  i was surprised that there was no additional garnish present.  no pickle, tomato, onion or lettuce on the plate.  not even a sprig of parsley.  at these prices, surely they could toss something in.  applebee's even garnishes their plates with a sprig of inedible, icky kale.\n\ni didn't get a chance to sample the liquor malts, but rest assured, next time i go, i won't be driving, so i will definitely take a taste.", 
            "i had dinner here with 2 bodybuilders. ;)\n\nwe took our friend seth out to dinner during the 2012 olympia expo weekend here in vegas and boy did we pick the right spot to wow our friend with a gourmet burger. apparently where he's from, you have to drive miles and miles to get a decent \"gourmet\" meal.\n\nthe wait wasn't so bad either on a busy saturday night during the dinner rush hour. we put our names down on the wait list and gave them one of our cell phone numbers.the wait was only 15-20 minutes and we were seated inside the dining area instead of the bar (which is good cuz apparently by 9:30pm, there's a dj booth set up in the bar area and we prefer to have good convos during dinner and not have to yell or scream at each other).\n\nsince i had a burger in vegas the previous 2 nights i opted to order something else off the menu while <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> both ordered themselves some burgers. i got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> & turf quesadilla. we also ordered <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> to start and they sure were bomb diggity. very crispy with huge ass oninos and i could bite through each one easily. which is a major bonus for me since i have a horrible underbite. when my quesadilla came out, i dove right in and noticed how amazingly soft and flavorful the tortilla was. the quesadilla comes with broiled steak and maine lobster stuffed with manchego cheese and the avocado cream on top was seriously like the best creamy jizz shot you've ever tasted. ;)\n\nfor dessert we got the candy store which came with 5 cute little cake-pop like delectables. they're a bit pricey, but you're in vegas and since we don't drink i didn't mind gettin a nice sugar high for a hefty price.\n\nwe also got the homemade blueberry pop tart with red velvet popcorn and sweet corn ice cream that sat on top of the most decadent lemon tart reduction. omg! amazeballs!\n\ni definitely wanna come back here and have a burger next time and maybe even one of their crazy milkshakes if i decide to start drinking alcohol again.", 
            "i friggin' loved holsteins so much. i had an amazing burger and an even more amazing milkshake. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> i got was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> -- kobe beef, teriyaki glaze,  nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado (i think this is what reeled me in). how amazing does that sound? the shoestring fries it came with were delicious, too. i think my favorite part about my holsteins experience was the (boozy) milkshake i got. i got <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> (go figure) -- stoli salted karamel vodka, reese's, pretzels, sprinkles, and chocolate-caramel popcorn. guys, when i say this is the best milkshake i've ever had, i mean it. i have dreams about it. ok, not really, but i hope i'm making myself clear about how amazing it was. i don't think i could go to vegas and not come to holsteins for another milkshake and burger. also, my friends and i started with the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark>, which was just as amazing as everything else. not only was the food absolutely delicious, the service was so speedy and our server was really nice. cool upscale diner-like atmosphere as well. we came here for a more low key dinner (dined in our bathing suits), but this place would be good for (a big) lunch, too. just amazing all around. this place is a must when you're in vegas.",

            "i must first state that i was a solid 3 on this; however, what happened once we left really soured my mood along with my stomach. \n\ni must also be clear that this was my first - and subsequently, only - meal of the day. \n\nfirst, the food: my trusty companion and i each had a burger. i had the flagship \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" and she had the \"el machete\". \n\nthe <mark>Gold Standard</mark> is made with dry aged beef, which is a good choice, and topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar and arugula. this should be delicious, and i assume if seasoned properly it is. unfortunately, there was too much salt seasoning - and believe me... i love salt - which left the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> feeling merely standard. \n\nmy tardis companion had the \"el machete\" which is a spicy aoli and pepper based burger. this was actually delicious from the two bites i had. if there was any seasoning issue with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself it was covered by the delicious peppers and aoli!\n\nalong with that we had regular fries and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. the fresh cut fries were tasty, albeit again heavily bathed in salt. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were on the soggy side but fresh and not overly salted. \n\nwe also had milkshakes. hers being some fruit compote fourth of july special concoction and mine being chocolate strawberry. mine was very sweet but it was strawberry with chocolate sauce, so of course that was unsurprising. (i had asked for chocolate ice cream but i wasn't about to whine about the small oversight.)\n\nas we left, i thought \"unspectacular... but worth a second look\".  the food wasn't bad but it wasn't great. i figured that i might try it again when next in town. \n\nnot long after my companion and i started feeling sour in our stomachs. come dinner time, still sour... i have slightly upchucked and swallowed it back down on two occasions. even as i write this, the meal from lunch feels like it is remaining in the upper regions of my stomach and the gassy bloating remains.\n\nwe tried later to force a small meal elsewhere for consistency as it was getting late but we couldn't even touch our food. it literally went into <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> the same way it came to the table. \n\ni really didn't intend on writing a negative review... and many of the reviews are positive. i would like to think this is an isolated incident in which i suspect the culprit to be the milkshakes. \n\ni really wanted to like this place. the menu is creative.  the decor is attractive. there are a dozen reasons to be drawn to this place.  unfortunately, i went from \"looking forward to eating there\" to \"pondering a second chance\" to \"likely not looking forward to a future visit\"... \n\nif not for the promise and potential of my initial thoughts, compared to the way i feel right now, it would have resulted in one star. so in fairness, i decided to average the two opinions. \n\nall in all a very disappointing visit. thank god for pepto.", 
            "burger for <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>!  how about gourmet burgers?  even better.  holstein is located near the east tower elevators in cosmo.  right across marquee nightclub.  \n\nmany yelpers recommended the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>,\"  and with that name, i went for it.  after sinking my teeth into the dry aged sirloin burger, a sudden disappointment hit me.  i might've gotten a little too much goat cheese in the first bite, so went for a second bite.  no!  it can't be.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> did not meet my standard for a burger.  oversalted and didn't go well with the goat cheese.  yes, i like goat cheese too.  \n\nit's okay though!! there's crispy pork burns on the table.  my first pork bun was at ippudo in nyc.  i understood the hype within seconds and ordered a second.  the pork buns from holsteins didn't let me relive that moment.  there was too much hoisin sauce, which made it overly salty.  oh, the pork was also dry.  \n\nour waiter was actually pretty nice.  however, the service was slow.  the restaurant was full and i saw him constantly filling orders, so i could sympathize.  i usually destroy my burgers and leave nothing but i just couldn't finish my burger and pork buns.  salt was used very liberally.",

            "first of all, i want to start off by saying that the cosmopolitan is starting to irritate me. everything that is the cosmopolitan is now obnoxious and boring. the types of people the property attracts is just garbage -- <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> of the barrel. don't get me wrong. the building and architecture and design of it all is fantastic. lcd screens everywhere, hip little touches here and there make this property great. i just can't stand how un-classically vegas it is. they try so hard to be different, that in the end of it all, they lose themselves. the addition of holsteins shakes and buns to the property is just the cherry on top. i heard ravenous reviews about holsteins and i was excited to try this place. things like, \"the best burgers in vegas,\" and \"i love love love hoslteins\" were some of many glowing reviews. here is my 2 cents.\n\nthe lobster mac and cheese was good, but not great. surprisingly, the dish had a lot of lobster in it. unfortunately, the lobster taste was lacking and the texture was not there as well. lobster usually has a familiarly soft yet firm feeling when you bite it. theirs was rubbery and lacked flavor. the truffle panko crust on top was nice, but the lack of lobster taste really disappointed me. my favorite part of this dish was the one chip on the side. it consisted of this lobster salad that was full of flavor.\n\nupon request, which i thought was complimentary, was popcorn. though it wasn't your ordinary popcorn, this one was flavored in some weird mixture. i read that it was truffle popcorn. excited for some truffle infused popcorn, theirs was definitely not so. it was a mixture of a vinegary, buttery flavor that coated the popcorn. this was a weird mix and though not appetizing, i found myself reaching for the popcorn. i ate it, forgot how it tasted like, and then tried it again. the sting from the popcorn seasoning alone was enough for me not to eat it again. i guess my curiosity superseded my palate.\n\nquite possibly my favorite food, and naturally, the food i am most knit picking about, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is a classic. from the bun to the type of meat, and the almost infinite sauces and toppings you can put on, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is a great vessel to work with. with such an iconic item, at a restaurant that supposedly specializes in this stuff, you can't mess it up.\n\nand now, <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger -- it had kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. their take on a japanese burger sounds good on paper. the fried avocado alone would make me happy. it was fried and crispy, and velvety smooth at the same time. i just didn't have enough of it. that probably was the only thing good about this burger. everything else was a mistake. first of all, what is wrong with this is the kobe. i hate when restaurants advertise as serving kobe when we all know most of that is just an american breed, if not, from australia. second of all, when you cook a \"kobe\" beef burger, it has to be rare. nothing else will do. what i got was all grey inside. the crust was overly marinated and glazed and turned the meat super dry, and the inside wasn't any different. that is one way to kill an almost perfect burger. the teriyaki glaze was much too overwhelming and the crispy yam didn't help with the cloyingly sweet flavors. did i order the wrong burger? maybe, but that still doesn't make up for the overcooked patty.\n\nif anything, the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake may have been the only thing that was considerably good. it had malted banana gelato and peanut butter crunch. the adult version has frangelico, a hazelnut liqueur from italy. i opted out and went with just a regular. \"you are in vegas. live a little!\", you say? in hind sight, maybe i should have made this shake alcoholic. it would have made me feel better about <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>-par meal i just had. still though, the shake was sweet and the use of gelato made the shave quite delicate and smooth.\n\npretentious, and yet casual, the restaurant has no identity. i just can't associate this restaurant with good food. the same food could be served at a restaurant that looks like, maybe johnny rockets, with a lower price, and i still wouldn't think twice about it. i mean, they have red and yellow squeeze bottles for ketchup and mustard. come on! the food really needs an upgrade. how awesome would it be if finally, the las vegas strip had a go-to burger spot that was hip, and of course, delicious? i think that is a home run and a much needed thing on the strip. i guess i just have to wait a couple years for that to happen. for now at the cosmo, i guess secret pizza will have to do.", 
            "very loud atmosphere, across from marquee. burgers are hit or miss, depending on personal preference and type of burger ordered. hubs loved his <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>, which had a good chunk of <mark>Foie Gras</mark>. i found my <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> a bit salty. the tomato confit, sauteed mushrooms, and marmalade onions were tasty additions to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself, though. \n\nburgers are large, and <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> bun is a bit too thick for my liking, although it stands up well to the toppings and creamy sauces. fries were similarly salty. no option to sub a salad for the bun, which is rather disappointing. you can, however, pay more to sub a salad for the fries. for a heavy meal and a satisfying piece of cow, this won't disappoint.",

            "great burgers.\ni had the,\n\n<mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>\nkobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, truffle mayo.\n\nwas fantastic.\ntry <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> shakes.\nalso very tasty.\n\na must if in the mood for a great gourmet burger.\n\nwould for sure eat here again.", 
            "let me start of by saying this is probably one of the best burgers i've tasted so far! \nlocated at the cosmopolitan hotel it was very easy for my boyfriend and i to walk downstairs to this place. the atmosphere was fun and lively. it had a bit of a kidish environment with all the painting of cartoonish cows on the wall (personally i think it was so cute and adorable). friendly staffed. my boyfriend ordered the funghi burger and i had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. i'm not a huge fan of truffle oil so i stuck with my <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> which was a version of a teriyaki burger of some sort. both were good. in the beginning of our meal they brought us some cheddar popcorn it was really good complimentary of course. last but not least we had to order one of their famous milkshakes boozed it up vegas style duh! \nwe had <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>. haha it was pretty fatty. \ncan't wait to go back next time!", 
            "i love <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> here! coming from all the amazing burger joints in la, i would say holstein's has my second favorite burgers ever. it beats umami burger for sure, is on par with bachi burger, but father's office still wins. nothing could beat father's office.\n\nanyway, holstein's is fabulous in it's own respect. the restaurant is casual and comfy; decorated with cute little cows. prices are on the more expensive side at ~$15-20 per burger with a side of fries but it is located in cosmopolitan so i think it's pretty fair for vegas prices. service is only mediocre to me since the waiters check in too slow at times so that's why i'm giving it 4 stars.\n\ni've tried the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burgers.  whenever i have these, oh man i am in burger heaven. <mark>Gold Standard</mark> has bacon, aioli, arugula, and aged goat cheddar cheese on top of a sirloin burger. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> has a teriyaki glaze with kobe beef and tempura avocado!! the avocado seriously is amazinggg. i definitely recommend these two burgers. \n\nnot only are <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> but the alcoholic milkshakes are too!  you can also ask them to be non-alcoholic if you really want that. they have a variety of flavors that they rotate around. you really can't go wrong with any of them. i've had the frozen grasshopper, banana creme pie, and red velvet before and they were all yummy.  \n\noverall a fun restaurant with delicious burgers and milkshakes perfect for your vegas gluttony!", 
            "my friend  and i were craving burgers and staying at the cosmopolitan- the rating on yelp seemed good and the menu was just my style. however the food ( wish i took pics) was rather disgusting. well at least mine was. i ordered the turkey burger, comes with sprouts and avocado. but it came with a smear of guacamole that was absorbed into <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> and top of the bun bun like butter would be; caramelized onions that were mon existent and more like translucent relish and sprouts that were mushed and all cooked into the gross concoction. just the thought of it makes me sick because <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> dry,  salty, grainy( like knuckle pieces)of a thick turkey patty kept me up all night burping it up. even into the next day did i taste the awful burger. i was super duper sick. sweating nauseous x10 and just wanted to die kinda sick.\ndo not order the turkey burger.\nunfortunately we had gross food. this is bound to happen at a lot of places ; but it literally made me sick. i have used yelp for years but never gave my two cents. \nsince i lost two days in vegas due to this restaurant ....i had to share:(", 
            "wooooooooow this place is so good. probably the best gourmet burger i've ever had! got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> bc it just sounded amazing and man, it was so good. \n\ni also had the campfire milkshake and holy shit, i love alcoholic milkshakes. it sounds so wrong but tastes so good. it's a must guys. gotta do the milkshakes. and they give you a lot so you're bound to take it to go and bring all <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> to the yard.", 
            "was it the best burger i have ever had?  nope, but it was darn good! i loved the location, the upscale setting, the hostess and the wait staff. all of this together provided an awesome dining experience. i definitely wanted to give a shout out to the wait staff. being on a business trip we had a budget to stick with so we had three separate checks with both credit and cash transactions. when we told the waiter we were met with \"no problem\". i definitely appreciated that!\nfood- <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> patty you could tell was very fresh. i think i heard a \"moo\" from the kitchen! excellent meat to bun ratio. probably 6+ ounces or better. they really have a nice variety of topping to please everyone. the fries were very good as well. i really liked that all the shakes listed on the menu you could order with or without <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>. we opted without to capture the true flavor and they did not disappoint. \noverall i thought for the location and the setting the price point was spot on. i think i paid right around $20 bucks for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fries. my brother added the shake so it came to around $27. if i were staying at the cosmo i would more than likely return again, but with so many burger choices around vegas most likely i will move on to sample other spots as well. highly recommended and worth the trip to check them out!", 
            "oh, holsteins. \n\nlet's see, where do i start? the popcorn. it came out first. it was surprisingly spicy! i love me some spice, but it was kind of an odd flavor. i won't hold this against holsteins since it was a free appetizer. \n\nthe bamboozled milkshakes. these bad boys are 5-star all the way. creamy, huge, delicious. really interesting flavors along with <mark>The Classic</mark>. you could just barely taste <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>- it was perfect. i could taste it, so i knew it was in there, but it didn't ruin or impact the overall flavor. so, so good. \n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> didn't live up to the hype. they were really good, but i expected a life-changing burger, and this just didn't deliver. for the price and the hype i was disappointed. \n\ni'd return in a heartbeat, but i'd just grab a shake and go.", 
            "really nice place. great for families and and friends. they are known for their shakes and i had the chance of trying two of them. the coffee and donuts one was good but the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> is <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>!!!!!!!! it is like a banana milkshake with reeses cups. it is so good, that i ended up getting it again togo on my last day. i literally went out of my way and walked from the mgm to holsteins just to get this lol.\n\ni got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (their burger) which is really good. very flavorful, rich, filling, and their fries are good too. i'd say a solid 8/10 for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and a 9-10/10 for the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>", 
            "i would give this restaurant 5 stars for their shakes. we had the vegan coconut raspberry as well as <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> and they were amazing. really fantastic. unfortunately, we wold give the hot food 2-3 stars. we had their \"best selling\" burger and although it wasn't bad, it wasn't good either. and when you pay $18 for a burger, that's unacceptable. we ordered fries with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and they were soggy. we also ordered the ahi poke appetizer and it was, at best, mediocre. i would definitely recommend this restaurant for shakes but tell friends and family to eat their meals elsewhere. we had heard wonderful things about holsteins and as out of town guests looking for a new vegas favorite food spot, we were excited to try it. definitely a disappointing experience overall.", 
            "holstein's is a little overpriced for what it is, but the food, ambiance and service create a positive experience despite the pain to the wallet.  they give you spiced popcorn instead of bread with the meal; i got refills both times i went since it was so tasty! \n\ni highly recommend the shakes.  i had the nutella crunch shake and it was amazing. super thick and chocolaty, and the crunchy bits made it even more memorable.  you can add extra shots of alcohol too ;)  although the shakes are pricey, they give you a large glass for the shake, plus the extras.  the first time i got the shake the extras were almost enough to refill the entire glass again!  although <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are good, it's the shakes that made me want to go out of my way to go back to holstein's.   \n\nthanks to my fellow yelpers, i decided to try the lobster mac & cheese.  it's a small portion, but since it is so rich i would not have wanted any more.  it's worth trying if you're a fan of lobster, mac & cheese, and truffle.  however, it wasn't amazing so you're not missing out if you give it a pass.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are good as well.  again, i thought they were overpriced but it was very enjoyable.  the black pepper crusted burger was very peppery and <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> flavors were unique.  i think the choice of burgers comes down to a personal preference. \n\nholstein's is located inside the cosmopolitan, and has a bar, lounge seated area, and normal restaurant tables.  it has a casual vibe.", 
            "i've said it before and i'll say it again--it's hard for me not to love a burger place.  throw it in a trendy location such as the cosmopolitan and ba-bam, i'm all in.  holstein's was the perfect way to end a long day of drinking by the pool. the fries were stand-outs and my hamburger was completely yummy.  piggy/hungover me asked for extra non-clean/processed american cheese and extra crispy bacon on my burger...that could have been <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> talking, but nonetheless, it was delicious!  the oreo shake could have been a tad more chocolatey for my taste, but rest assured, every last drop was consumed without sacrifice.  the service was great, the vibe was great, the people watching was top notch and all around, i'm a huge fan.", 
            "when we arrived at the cosmopolitan for shannon's birthday weekend, we were starving for food, so we went to holstein's for a late lunch. i'm not a big burger person and only really have them on rare occasions ... this being one of them. the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger was amazeballs. highly recommended. \n\nmy two young sons don't like burgers by title. since holstein's has sliders, we conspired with our server to call them 'crabby patties' (the signature burger from sponge bob) and suddenly <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> loved them. it was comical. i wish i had a video camera. \n\ni was seriously craving a milkshake (it was a cheat-weekend), but <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> were becoming ... annoying. if it wasn't nap time for them, i'm sure that this paragraph would be raving about their shakes. next time.\n\nthere are cows everywhere. mooooo!", 
            "great burgers, great fries, great shakes. <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> strawberry lemonade cocktail i had tasted strong but was a little light for my taste.\n\nthere are no reservations and its first come first serve so if you want fast service, come on a night that isn't busy like a weeknight. also my sister waited forever for her change. (we stayed 20 minutes after we had all received and paid, and she still hasn't gotten hers when we left.)\n\nyou have to expect that from a popular restaurant on the strip though.", 
            "we could not resist indulging here twice during our stay at the cosmopolitan. the tuna sliders were tasty. the beer offerings are interesting and you can even get your beer or wine in a to-go cup! \n\nthe second time we went just for <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> milkshakes which are the ultimate splurge in sin city! they offer so many concoctions and the alcohol is not overwhelming. but be forewarned, one milkshake will fill you for days and pack on the pounds if you don't hit the gym before and after! \n\ndefinitely worth it if you manage your activity (hit the gym hard) and caloric intake and get your buzz on before enjoying the milkshake!", 
            "holy cow!!! this place freaking rocks! <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger was one of the most delicious things that i have ever put in my mouth. the tempura avocado, the teriyaki glaze, the yam crunchy bits, the spicy mayo all combine to make a flavor delight in my mouth. the had bites of the nom nom and <mark>Gold Standard</mark> too. both were quite good but not quite as amazing. the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were crispy and <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> shakes were to die for. the coffee and doughnuts was oh so amazing! the caramel cheesecake was also delicious. this was one of my top meals in vegas. no one should even consider the other big name burger joints. this place blew them away.", 
            "steak and kimchi quesadillas were <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>. cubano tacos were ok. <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were super tasty. fun atmosphere, ok service. oh, if you can get the black beans that come with the cubano tacos, do it. they were better than the tacos by far. ill take a bowl of those masterpieces.", 
            "finally tried this place. been wanting to try their burgers and shakes for awhile. one opened up nearby in ca too. \n\nthey start you off with some popcorn. they're crazy addicting. i almost spoiled my appetite cause of them. \n\ni got their jalape\\u00f1o margarita? i forgot the name, but it was really good. the slight spicy flavor went well with the margarita. <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> got their coffee &donut adult milkshake. i super liked it. wasn't crazy sweet and perfect amount of booze. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger and lobster mac&cheese. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was delicious. beef was nice and moist and their bacon inside was slightly glazed i think. the mac&cheese was also yummy. they give you a good chunks of lobster and it's super creamy. we ended up eating the rest back at the hotel later that night. used jalape\\u00f1o kettle chips as scoops because we didn't have forks. the combo is amazing. \n\nhopefully, i'll try the longhorn or <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> next time."

            "with the caveat that i didn't have a burger the two times i was here (but tried a number of apps and shakes), this place is typical for an eatery at a big vegas hotel - adequate, never a bad meal, but you will never be blown away in any fashion (my humble person opinion - every meal in vegas at a high end hotel is basically just a facsimile of the better version you can get at the restaurant's socal or ny location).\n\ni came here twice on a recent bachelor party.  once for milkshakes, and once for apps before our flight home.  the (boozy) milkshakes were very good.  i had the \"<mark>The Fat Boy</mark>\" (uv candy bar vodka, reese's, pretzels, sprinkles, chocolate-caramel popcorn).  a friend had the vegan maple pecan shake (almond milk 'ice cream', jack daniel's, spiced pecans, maple caramel sauce).  both were delicious, although if you are really in the mood for something sweet and creamy, the <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark> probably won't hit the spot (the sort of \"earthy\" taste of the maple and almonds doesn't give you the same satisfaction as real ice cream).  <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> was barely detectable, however (i would've liked at least just a little taste, to know i was drinking something alcoholic).\n\nthe next day we came back for <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, chicken fingers, <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark>, and surf and turf quesadillas.  i had a bloody mary, which was good, but after three days of drinking, the shrimp on top was not appetizing.  the apps were all meh - not bad, but not great.  i was expecting something more from the \"southern fried\" chicken fingers, but they basically tasted like something i could get from roy rogers.  dip was good, but again, didn't really taste fresh made or have that \"pop\" i was expecting when i read the menu description.\n\nwe sat in the front every time we came here, so i can't comment on the rear seating area, but i will say this - there is incredibly loud music with a heavy bass beat that is just not palatable.  \n\nall told, try the shakes.  maybe try <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> (can't comment directly, but i wouldn't be optimistic based on the other food).  apps are basically tgi friday's quality.", 
            "(review is for milkshakes only) came here because i've heard a lot about the milkshakes, after looking at the menus in the bar/lounge area we noticed the shakes weren't listed on there, we had to grab the hostess (who was facing the dining room and talking to the other servers) and ask if we can see a full menu.  after agreeing we wanted to try some shakes we asked the hostess if we had to order in the dining room or if we could go to lounge area, she said we can sit at the bar, order to go or order at the bar.  we sat in the lounge area and noticed we had to go back to the hostess stand to get a full menu.  the hostess was still facing the restaraunt talking to the servers so i just went to her stand and grabbed the menu myself.  by this point i was a little irritated but still wanted a milkshake.  we ordered <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> and the vegan maple pecan, it took a while for 2 shakes but after trying it, it was worth the wait.  a few minutes later a runner came out and brought the leftover vegan maple shake, we were confused since we had our entire order, when we looked in what we thought was the <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark>, it was actually a vanilla shake.  so pretty much they delivered the extra/leftover vanilla shake to a vegan...who drank it not realizing it was non vegan\n=(\ni understand there's a chance of getting non-vegan items at a restaraunt that's not completely vegan but the entire experience was not worth it.  good shakes though.", 
            "i was skeptical in trying holsteins because of the mixed reviews, but after eating at gordon ramsay's burgr so much, i wanted a different burger place. originally we came here around midnight fri to try the place, but were told they stopped serving their regular menu at 11pm. they offered a late night menu instead which were basically just appetizers (no burgers/shakes). no biggie, we came back the next day after a fabulous time at marquee's dayclub...spoiler alert: we also came back the next day before we left on the drive back home because it was sooo good!!\n\nthe decor is so cute here w/ the anime pig wall posters and the theme totally matched w/ the cosmopolitan. our server made great recommendations for us & started us off w/ the complimentary small bucket of lightly salt/sweet popcorn. my bf killed that thing, talk about drunk munchies\n\nbamboozled shakes:\n<mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> - i added toasted coconut marshmallow to it and this was one damn good shake! the description/ingredients seemed so minimal, yet the shake tasted so amazing. it was like a cookies n cream reese's <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark>. this was my fav out of all the other shakes. \n\ntiramisu - they had me at mascarpone ice cream. i love mascarpone, but you could barely taste it in this shake. this tasted like a chocolate shake, not much espresso/coffee flavor. \n\nbanana creme pie - my bf go this 'cause he loves bananas and i would say this was my 2nd fav shake. it tastes exactly like a banana cream pie, but in shake form w/ chocolate. i liked that they topped it w/ white chocolate covered bananas.\n\nthe shakes are big enough to share, but trust me you won't want to. i like that you get a full glass shake and the extras are in the metal mixing cup so you can eat it w/ a spoon (yum!) i also like that their shakes all were thick & creamy!\n\napps:\nsurf 'n turf quesadilla - delish my favorite app! this ain't no taco bell quesadilla. it was crunchy and not oily at all. the lobster, steak and manchego cheese inside all just melted in your mouth and is bursting w/ flavor. must order!!\n\nsoft shell crab bruschetta - for a burger place, their presentation of these apps were tapas style and as nice as any fancy steakhouse. the softshell crab was on top of a thick cut brioche bread, the aioli and tomato salad made the app refreshing\n\ncrispy calamari - big enough portion to share, i couldn't stop dunking these rings in the sweet chili sauce. i like that they don't overbread the calamari rings\n\nmaine lobster roll - pricey for this, but there were generous amount of lobster. \n\ncrispy pork belly bun - tasted better than the ones at ramsay's burgr. the steamed buns weren't dry & sauce was spot on\n\nburgers:\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> w/ <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>(normally comes w/ fries, but paid $2 to upgrade) - the best burger ever!! most asian fusion burgers get overpowered by the sauce, but not here. it didn't taste like an ordinary overly sweet typical terriyaki burger. everything was perfect about this burger, that first bite was so orgasmic. this is what a burger should taste like! the whole brioche bun was toasted to perfection. i am not sure how they did it, but the top part of the bun and inside had a nice toast crisp to it. the tempura avocado was nice, added a different texture. you could taste each item in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and they all blended well together. the kobe beef patty was cooked medium, yet it was juicy and had a nice pink to it. <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were the best we've had as well & worth the upgrade! they were thick, fried, fresh, and crispy, no soggy oiliness at all. make sure to ask for buttermilk ranch to dip the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> in!! it tastes so divine\n\nfun-ghi on wheat bun w/ salad ($2 extra) - healthy combo huh? my 2nd fav burger, but my bf preferred this over <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> because he prefers the truffle flavor. again, patty was cooked perfect along w/ toasted wheat bun. i actually prefer the regular bun's flavor although the wheat bun was toasted the same way as the regular brioche bun. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> wasn't smothered in mayo thank god! the gruyere helped accentuate the truffle portabella & caramelized onions. salad was a generous portion of mixed greens & the dressing was tangy yet sweet & light (sort of like a coleslaw dressing w/ lemon). the only negative is that we added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, but there was no runny yolk...the egg was fully cooked :(\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> w/ <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>- everyone kept talkin about this burger, but we thought it paled in comparison to <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were bomb!\n\ni would have to say that holstein's outranks ramsay's burgr. we were so pleased w/ our meal that we sent compliments to the chef. we were lucky that both days we ate here, the executive chef was working. the food comes out fast and you will leave happily stuffed. don't forget to give them your identity player's card for points!\n\nnote: try and get a girl server. the first day we had a girl and she was totally on top of it. the 2nd day, we had a guy and he seemed easily overwhelmed", 
            "came here for or first night's dinner on a bachelorette party weekend. we showed up with 8 girls, and the first person we talked to told us it was a 45 minute wait. then someone else in our party talked to the hostess, and she told us 10 minutes. real time wait came to about 20 minutes. which is pretty good, considering we were a large party with no reservation.\n\n<mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> - big portion was easy to share, was crispy and came with a tasty dipping sauce\n<mark>Ahi Poke Tostadas</mark> - very small portion, and the ahi tuna tasted old and fishy, came with a nice avocado-like dipping sauce\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark> - was fresh, flavorful and delicious\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger - requested this medium-well, but it was served medium. was still really good, came with tasty teriyaki-type sauce, and tempura avocado!\nfries - came out warm, soggy and sad\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger - requested this medium-rare, and it came out medium. added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> for another dollar, was good and had a lot of cheese\nbeef sliders - three sliders that had very little cheese and a lot of bun. they would not let us add <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to these because of size\n<mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark> - this was really good if you like coconut\nbrown cow float - <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with pop rocks! surprisingly good\n\nthe food here was ok to good. nicely decorated with modern cartoon type art. we were sat cramped into a circle table, and we could not scoot our chairs in because the chairs kept hitting each other. there were two large booths that  could seat 8-10, but they chose to seat 3 or 4 people in them instead of us. considering the prices here, the service we received left a lot to be desired. the server took a long time to bring us water, and never checked on us after <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came out, and we ran out of water and drinks. appetizers and salad also took a long time to come out.\n\ni would not come here again. it was ok, but not awe-inspiring.", 
            "great vegan options and they offer gluten free buns. the <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark> is also amazing. thank god vegas is finally catching on with healthy options.\n\ncomfortable lounge seating is nice.", 
            "they have the most delicious vegan burger i've ever had in my life. and their <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark> is amazing! the first time i came here, i brought a non-vegetarian who was absolutely floored by how delicious the vegan burger was, and actually said it was the best burger he'd ever had. the <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark> is just awesome- it's topped with vegan marshmallow and fluffy vegan whipped cream that is divine.\nthe second time i came here, which was recent, i brought a friend who's a huge skeptic of all things vegan, and even he admitted that the shake was actually wonderful, and better than the other (non-vegan) shakes he's had there in the past. however, they actually ran out of all their vegan burgers at that time, so we couldn't eat there. i suggest calling ahead to make sure they've got it in stock!", 
            "totally a fan of this place.  wanted something light so i ordered the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> (chicken breast, ranch, hot sauce, tortilla chips, & bleu cheese) which was delicious.  the best part though was the <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark> i ordered.  for the record, i have never ordered anything with vegan in the title, but this shake sounded so tasty i had to order it.  the shake contained the following:\n\ncoconut sorbet, raspberries, skyy raspberry vodka, 3 olives coconut vodka, toasted coconut marshmallow, soy whipped topping\n\nabsolutely delicious!  i almost ordered a second one =)\n\nthe place overall was nice and casual and the prices were more reasonable compared to the other places at the cosmo.  the service was good too!  would love to go back when i visit vegas again =)", 
            "they have a <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark>! a nice fun place for down to earth normal food and drink. note that the ice cream is vanilla, and has eggs. the flavors are from syrups added, not from other ice cream flavors."

            "hit holstein's for lunch today.  sat at the bar.  since i had to go back to work - no drinkie - had some <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> called rat bastard ( $5 ) - ok \n\norder kettle chips ( $6 ) \n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger ( $17 - add $2 more for <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> ) \n\ncool looking place, in the mall area of the cosmo - place was hopping today.\n\nguy next to me seated 3-4 minutes after me - he gets his malt and sliders before i get my chips and/or burger....in fact, i never get my chips - the bartender didn't  hear me .....okaaay.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> - asked for it medium - it was juicy but no hint of pink at all ...none ... since <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was juicy i can live with it.  my guess a quarter pounder, but not sure - overall, i liked it - the goat cheddar complimented the meat, lil micro greens were a nice touch and  bacon was all good  but $17 .... not sure about the pricing.  \n\n<mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were also decent but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nwill i try again ?  yeaaah - i want to try some of the sausages they apparently make in house.\n\na pet peeve - they make mention of everything made in house yet what do they bring me when i get the plate of food - bottled catsup and mustard ( i believe heinz and french's ) - geez guys, can't you make it yourself ?  or at least put the stuff in a fancy container ?   at least they didn't pull a kgb and when i ask for mayo they throw me a few \"to go\" tear open mayo containers .\n\npics will be posted later today", 
            "korean burger over <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> if your feeling adventurous.  my non adventurous friend preferred <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>.  i preferred the korean burger.  which one are you???\n\ngot the truffle lobster mac n cheese and it was sooooooo good!!!  too bad the portion was small.  everyone agreed that it was yum.\n\nmy friend also got the <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with pop rocks... it was good too.", 
            "gonna start with desert.\n\nthe adult shakes are incredible espicaly the <mark>Virgil's Orange Cream</mark> (which really taste like a creamsicle) and the brown cow (a <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with pop rocks and rum).  \n\nthe food is typical of  a good gastro pub; new american fusion.  you are rewarded for being adventurous.  \n\nthe \"street tacos\" are made from duck confit, <mark>Foie Gras</mark> cranberry relish.  they are incredible.  other appetizer standouts include the kalbi and kimchee quesadilla, the bull's balls (no they are not rocky mountain oysters), and the lobster corn dogs. the crispy pork belly bun is worth special mention.  served with hoisin sauce and pea sprouts, its high end dim sum.\n\nmeat in a tube is well represented.  try the greek touri.  different but very flavorful.\n\nfinally, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  although i'm still partial to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> bar, holsteins offerings are very creative and good eats.  cooked perfectly to order.  the \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" (teriyaki glazed kobe burger with spicy mayo and tempura avocado) is a winner.\n\nservice is fast and efficient.\n\none final note, the beer selection is excellent and very reasonably priced for the strip.", 
            "it's hard to resist a restaurant that offers spiked shakes and gourmet burgers.  my friend june had been to holsteins on an earlier vegas trip and come back raving that it was the one restaurant she'd hit that she wanted to revisit.  i can't tell you how many times i stared drooling at the menu before we went for dinner.\n\nholsteins is in the new and beautiful cosmopolitan hotel, and it's right across from marquee.  we went and got stamped for the marquee before we checked in for dinner, and we ended up missing our reservation (held for fifteen minutes).  the staff was nice about it, though, and it turned out that seating, even for a party of seven, was not a problem.  holsteins is a swanky place, with comfortable booths and a giant pink cow on display.  we had a waiter named chaz, and he was friendly and on his game.\n\nthe drinks were everything i wanted and more.  the spiked milkshakes were absolutely delicious.  the frozen grasshopper came with peppermint meringue, chocolate crunchies, creme de menthe, and van gogh dutch chocolate vodka.  i can't imagine it was terribly boozy, but it was a fabulous milkshake, with full mint chocolate flavor and the perfect thickness.  the little meringue was delightful, and the crunchy chocolate bits added texture to every sip.  the brown cow was also fantastic, an adult <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float made with <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, vanilla ice cream, pop rocks, and charbay tahitian vanilla rum.  it had all the kid-pleasing taste of a great <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, and i can't overstate the fun of pop rocks.  i also tried the bloody mary, without ice cream, but with smirnoff infused with pepper and cilantro, combined with bloody mary mix and garnished with a toothpick bearing an olive and a cocktail shrimp.  i love a good bloody mary, and this was a good one.  it had a heavy spicy flavor but a thin clean texture, and i appreciate food in my drink when appropriate.\n\nour table split three appetizers, and that felt like the right amount.  the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> were easily my favorite, breaded and deep-fried dill spears, olives, and caper berries, served with small sides of prosciutto and salami and an herb-caper mayo for dipping.  these were magical.  the breading was flavorful, crispy, and light, and the pickles oozed their pickly flavor.  i would also recommend the bucket of <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark>, which came with a bleu cheese dip.  nothing fancy, but delicious.  i was disappointed, though, by the truffle lobster mac' n cheese.  the creamy tallegio-mascarpone sauce was more creamy than it was cheesy, making the appetizer more like a macaroni salad.  the maine lobster was barely there, and the black truffle didn't come through.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were very good, though i suspect that the strength may lie in the toppings.  <mark>The Classic</mark> - with just lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, ketchup, and pickles - was the most boring of the bunch, and that doesn't hold true with a remarkable patty.  the patties were definitely tasty, though, with plenty of juice, and they held up well to some fun accompaniments.  my favorite was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>.  with a kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado, it was definitely a loaded gimmick of a fusion burger - but damn if i didn't gobble it down.  the teriyaki was sweet but not cloying, and the salt of the speckles of dried seaweed was great.  the crispy yam gave a welcome crunch, and that strip of avocado tempura was creamy and beautiful.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was also good, a dry-aged beef sirloin burger topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli.  it was less of a stand-out, though, and the tomato confit did not bring on the umami parade i'd hoped for.  if you like lamb burgers, the big fat greek is a good choice.  with greek spiced lamb, feta cream, lettuce, tomato, tzatziki sauce, and red onion and olive relish, it's a little like a greek menu threw up on a burger.  the result, though, is hearty and pretty well done.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> all come with a side of fries, and you have a choice of shoestring, sweet potato, and steak cut.  i prefer my thin fries, and the shoestring and sweet potato were both superb.  holsteins knows its way around a potato - even the steak cut fries were well seasoned and not at all mushy.\n\nwhen we left for marquee we were all stuffed to the brim.  the meal was not cheap - burgers started at $13 and shakes were $11 - but it was a satisfying feast that hardly qualified as a splurge in vegas.  i've had better burgers, but i was impressed by <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, and i doubt i've had better milkshakes.  if you're in vegas hankering for a fattening meal, check holsteins out.", 
            "holsteins is a little pricey for what you get, but the shakes and burgers are really good.  i ate here with my family for a birthday celebration, and was impressed with the food that we got.  the menu is setup interestingly and can be a little confusing at first.  we got some pretty good flavored popcorn as a little appetizer.\n\nthe kids menu is simple and decent as my son had two mini burgers with fries.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were good and the fries are well prepared.  i would like a softer bun on the mini burgers though.  fried green tomatoes are ok and not worth the price in my opinion (worst thing we ordered).  my wife had the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" burger with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> as no duck fat fries were offered.  the aged beef was really good and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> had great flavor overall (4 stars).  i actually like the buns they use for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> as they are somewhat soft and taste good.  she also had the \"power shake\" which was amazing as it was a good mix between shake and drinking yogurt (5 stars).  i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger with <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> and a brown cow (<mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with pop rocks).  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was great but overcooked as i wanted medium and got medium well (4.5 stars).  <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were a disappointment as i expected better (3 stars).  if you want a good dipping sauce ask for the spicy mayo used in <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger and add a little ketchup to it for a good sauce for your fries and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>.  the brown cow was really good as they use a good <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> and ice cream for it (4 stars).  you get a lot of shake which is nice and the pop rocks are kind of fun addition to the drink.  \n\nholsteins has decent service great shakes and some great hamburgers.  if the price and some of the items were better i would give this place five stars, but with some ok items and a somewhat hefty price i give them four stars.  great food and worth eating here once while in vegas if not more often depending on what you like to eat.  i want to try some of the other burgers and shakes though.", 
            "let me start by saying that i am not a \"cool\" person, so when i approached holsteins for dinner i thought i would feel out of place.  it turned out to be a very enjoyable, memorable experience.\n\nthe restaurant is on the second floor of the chic cosmopolitan hotel which is packed with the young and hp on a saturday night.  the restaurant was crowded when we arrived, and the hostess was not accepting names for a table.  however, we were told we could wait in the bar area and visit her again in a half hour to inquire about a table.\n\ni'm not sure if this is typical, but it seems like a smart business decision on their part -- to get the guests into the bar to buy drinks first.  it worked for my party.\n\nwe actually ordered two appetizers from the bar: fried green tomatoes and lobster macaroni & cheese.  both were excellent, but the macaroni and cheese is other worldly good.\n\nholstein's \"adult\" shakes all sounded incredibly delicious -- about ten to fifteen listed options including everything from cap'n crunch to chocolate covered pop rocks.  i settled on their \"brown cow\" which has <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, vanilla ice cream, pop rocks and rum.  it was wonderful.\n\nafter about 45 minutes in the bar, we finally got a table in the restaurant.  i got the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" burger which -- though not fancy -- was delicious.  the three people in my party each ordered different burgers and different fries (shoestring, steak and sweet potato).  we shared and loved it all.\n\nwith dinner, i had the red sangria which was wonderful.  i tried my friend's white sangria which was light and refreshing.\n\ni would definitely recommend holsteins and would return the next time in las vegas.\n\nfinal word to the wise: the bar is loud.  the music is cranked so incredibly high that i am shocked hotels across the street couldn't hear it.  conversation in the bar is strained at best.  once in the restaurant, the music is less assaultive, but the wood-clad restaurant is also naturally loud.  this is a fun restaurant -- but not one to relax and converse in.", 
            "the colorful graffiti art is a little in-your-face & is so trendy, it'll be out of style by the time i post this review, but it fits just right into the cosmopolitan. \n\nglamourous-sounding burgers, shakes with a shot of alkie (because last night's bender was not enough) & fashionable items like pork belly & lobster rolls...it's so been there, done that. the menu is so unapologetically predictable but i can't say i'm disappointed. \n\nour meal before flying home consisted of:\n-- 'bam-boozled shake' brown cow ($11): whipped cream vodka, <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, vanilla ice cream & pop rocks. reason for 4-star rating.\n-- black & white shake ($8): comes with an extra tumbler. yummy! \n-- fried chicken fingers & waffles ($11): horrid! i've had better at denny's. everyone's got their version of this comfort-food fave, but please do it right. \n-- 'tiny buns' maine lobster roll ($16.50 for 2): the chive aioli overpowered the dish. loved the cute, tiny hot dog buns. \n-- 'tiny buns' pork belly bun ($9 for 2): i wanted to try, but after bf showed me the sheer amount of fat, i couldn't do it. yes, animal fat scares me. (sidenote: bf prefers chairman bao.) \n\nfour stars because i love the idea of 'tiny buns,' & because i want to try every single alcoholic shake on the menu. like i said, predictably trendy, but it's got me interested.", 
            "my yelp friend vi y. recommended the watermelon bubblegum icee - and i'm glad i listened!  it felt like that time when i needed to look over my shoulder before my dad or mom caught me spiking my drink!  it was such a fun drink with a great grown-up vodka twist - so sweet and refreshing, and definitely made me a happy girl.  their other bamboozled shakes are just as intriguing and fun - how could you not want to try a grown up <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float like a brown cow (<mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, vanilla ice cream, pop rocks and meyer's rum)?\n\nas for the food we love to nosh on the small plates here.  there is a maply-sweetness to the batter in the southern fried chicken fingers-n-waffles and comes with a small and cute waffle.  the buttermilk sauce definitely doesn't come from a bottle. some might think this is a small serving but i think it's just right as i get to indulge on something like this without the 2000 calories a full order would have, and still have room to try other menu notables like:\n\nlobster/truffled mac and cheese\ncrispy pork belly buns\nshoe string fries\n<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\nkorean \"bull\"gogi burger  (soy marinated burger with <mark>Fried Egg</mark>, kimchee slaw)\n\nthe huzbeau and i have come here with just the two of us and another time with a party of four, and wait was minimal with no reservations.  but its always advisable to call if you plan on coming here during busy times like before a show (like a lot of people do)!\n\nservice was attentive and its a great, casual atmosphere.  the graffiti artwork on the walls is amazing and very classy-urbanesque.  a great stop to make if you're in town - located right behind the beautiful chandelier bar in the cosmopolitan.", 
            "loved it! \n\ni looooved their inventive, playful milkshakes! though i was tempted by the more adventurous concoctions... i'm a simple girl at heart and ended up ordering their version of a <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float. it was taaaasty and the pop rocks sprinkled on top were a fun reminder of the simpler times. and, most importantly, i confirmed that if you drink soda and have pop rocks your stomach will not explode.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are a-okay. premium, restaurant burgers that are good and some pretty interesting combos. but, in the end, they were just okay. i actually went with the veggie patty. it was pretty tasty. made in the kitchen, not some boca burger slapped on a bun. but, still... it was just alright. \n\noh. and... truffle lobster mac & cheese. yum. we actually asked them to leave the plate with the leftover sauce and... um... used our fries to soak up the bechemal and truffle. so good.\n\n5 star milkshakes\n4.5 star mac & cheese\n4 star service and atmosphere\n3 star burgers\n= solid 4 overall!", 
            "i'm actually disappointed in this place.  perhaps i had too high of expectations but the lobster rolls, ice cream floats, they all sounded real good.  i ordered the brown cow which is basically <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with pop rocks and vodka.  didn't taste any alcohol nor did i taste any pop rocks.  not good.  ordered the lobster roll.  it was okay as were the sliders which were overcooked.  the foie burger was decent but a bit heavy according to the gf.  will i come back again?  maybe give the milkshakes a try but other than that probably eat elsewhere.", 
            "i've been looking forward to trying holstein's since reading an article on their unique and exceptional desserts. i finally got there last night, and boy was i excited. i'd read positive reviews and food suggestions earlier in the day so i knew exactly what i wanted. to my surprise, it was dinnertime on friday and we got seated right away. there were several open tables, but the hostess seated us at one of the smallest tables in the restaurant...and the top of it wobbled when we moved our arms. my husband ordered a $6 <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> and i got the $11 cereal bowl shake. my husband's glass was dirty and he asked to exchange it with a clean one...no apology, but at least the 2nd glass was clean. my shake was good, but i couldn't taste the flavored vodka at all. i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger medium-well and my husband got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> medium-rare, both with steakfries. when <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> arrived, they looked delicious, but not nearly as \"pretty\" as in the photos in the gallery on their website. i tried a crispy fry first and burned the roof of my mouth...those little metal pails must really hold in the heat!? both of our burgers were tasty, but came overcooked. and my beef patty was a lot thinner than i anticipated. i think <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are called \"big buns\" because the bun's bigger than <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fixin's! the waitress brought our bill without asking if we wanted dessert...the main reason why i wanted to try the place! i told her we wanted to order the candy store, and she said, \"oh, since you ordered the shake, i just figured you wouldn't want dessert too. most people don't get both.\" it might've been all the cool piggy artwork surrounding me, but that was a bit offensive and made me feel like a lil' piggy! the dessert was the best part of the meal...especially the shooters on <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>. it was fun eating cotton candy in a restaurant! it was adorable! but i wouldn't say their handmade candies are worth $15. i probably won't return to holstein's after dropping $81 at the mediocre burger joint with fun desserts. atmosphere was fun and artwork was amazing! (wanted to end on a positive note.)", 
            "first visit (early may) i wasn't quite impressed.\n\nyes the d\\u00e9cor is funky fresh. artsy and trendy and the service was decent (the servers were not 100% in tune to what they were serving). but the overall visit was not what i hoped.\n\nthe breakdown: i was invited by the light group to dine in before the club. so, there were tables of beautiful women dressed to impress but not ready to chow down wearing their club attire (me included). deep fried everything, and not the best samples of their burgers. (the menu was pre determined, served as a 4 course meal). it was a pleasure to be hosted by them and i would have not discovered them otherwise.\n\nbut ....\n\nsecond \"chance\" visit (late may) i was in heaven ... even if for a moment.\n\nthe breakdown: it was recovery sunday (from saturday night gallivanting). we all know the best hangover cure it some heavy greasy food ... so i gave it a second try. it was much more casual, with no worries of feeling full after.\n\nthere was a 40 min wait (that tells you its quite popular). but there was room at the bar which also had full service. the way they place the barstools leaves plenty of elbow room to really get down, without throwing 'bows.\n\ni had: the golden standard (because i just couldn't talk myself into paying $28 for one burger \"<mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>\" though i was tempted). and it was delicious. didn't even need to add a thing. no ketchup, salt, nada. it was made to perfection (medium) i chose a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> which were decent, but a little soggy at the end.\nwhile i waited, i washed down a brown cow float, which was basically a turnt up <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with \"pop rocks\" and it brought me back to being a kid with the rocks popping in my mouth. loved it!!\ni tried their bucket of <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark>, and i liked how they didn't drench it with sauce. i enjoyed licking my fingers to that before and during my burger meal. \n\ni guess there is a time and place for everything ... and figuring out the right moment makes a huge difference.\n\nholsteins \"before\" the club no\nholsteins the day \"after\" definitely", 
            "once again there was no wait to get seated at the bar since i was dining alone (one of the perks of traveling alone). one of my friends had recommended i give holsteins a try because of their boozy adult shakes and floats. yum, who can resist! \n\ni gave the brown cow a try - an adult version of a <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with whipped cream vodka in it, yummy! for dinner i started to ask the bartender which of 3 different burgers was the best and the first i mentioned was \"the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" and before i could continue he said \"the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>\"! i said \"really? better than the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> (with kobe beef) and he said \"yes!\". well that made my decision pretty easy, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> it is. \n\nwow, what a delicious burger! i loved the combination of tomato confit, and the goat cheddar cheese, and of course bacon makes everything better! i substituted regular fries for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, which were so crispy and delicious i could have eaten them all night!", 
            "came in only to try a shake ($11.00). we got the brown cow float, which is essentially an alcoholic <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float... oh man, it was creamy, frothy, and best of all the pop rocks tossed on top played on the tongue so nicely. i think i giggled every time i got a mouthful, but i'm silly like that.\n\nart on the walls is by juan muniz, and i was impressed. street art style, looked like it was commissioned for the restaurant specifically. very cool!\n\notherwise this place is a fairly typical bar-- i want to say sports bar, but there wasn't that theme, it just had that feel. the hostess was very friendly and did her best to answer all the questions our friend grilled her with about the restaurant. nice place for a drink, maybe next time i'll try the food.", 
            "3 stars for the great service.\n\nfood was pretty mediocre. we got the sliders and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (?) burger and fries. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were overcooked (we ordered medium and they came out well done) and the fries were soggy. \n\nthe only thing that we really enjoyed was the black cow shake which tasted like a <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float except with coke and cherry pop rocks. brings you back to those good ol childhood days for sure!", 
            "if you are in the mood for a burger, this is the place. they serve not only traditional beef burgers, but a foodie approach to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> concept with unique mixings. pork belly, salmon, pulled pork, etc... don't get me wrong, its a burger place, just not your usual burger place.\n\ni basically stole my daughter's oreo milkshake and it was perfect. my wife enjoyed my son's <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float as well. \n\ni judge places by the following: can't wait to go back (5 star), would go back without question (4 star), would give a second chance if there were no other options (3 star), wouldn't go back (2 star), would rather starve (1 star). this is a 4 star place.", 
            "great burger. \n\nwent on memorial day and surprisingly it was crowded but not overwhelmingly. we were able to grab two seats at the bar.  i wanted to split a boozy milkshake but he was in the mood for a cocktail. i got the brown cow float. it was lighter and he still had to help me with it! it was so good. i love a good <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float. i could taste <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>.\n\nwe both ordered burgers. he added an egg to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. i got the funghi. both cooked perfectly. they were delicious. generous portions. the fries were ok but <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was so big. truffle flavor was there and the gruyere was perfectly melted. it was a more refined mushroom and swiss burger. in a good way. the fries were just ok. a place like this should have perfectly executed fries there is no reason for anything less. however props to including them in the price of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.\n\nwe got good service from the bartenders but the shakes and burgers were slow coming. bf said the cocktail he has was well executed. \n\nwe will be back and next time i will ask them to make sure my fries are crispy.", 
            "came here for or first night's dinner on a bachelorette party weekend. we showed up with 8 girls, and the first person we talked to told us it was a 45 minute wait. then someone else in our party talked to the hostess, and she told us 10 minutes. real time wait came to about 20 minutes. which is pretty good, considering we were a large party with no reservation.\n\n<mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> - big portion was easy to share, was crispy and came with a tasty dipping sauce\n<mark>Ahi Poke Tostadas</mark> - very small portion, and the ahi tuna tasted old and fishy, came with a nice avocado-like dipping sauce\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark> - was fresh, flavorful and delicious\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger - requested this medium-well, but it was served medium. was still really good, came with tasty teriyaki-type sauce, and tempura avocado!\nfries - came out warm, soggy and sad\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger - requested this medium-rare, and it came out medium. added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> for another dollar, was good and had a lot of cheese\nbeef sliders - three sliders that had very little cheese and a lot of bun. they would not let us add <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to these because of size\n<mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark> - this was really good if you like coconut\nbrown cow float - <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with pop rocks! surprisingly good\n\nthe food here was ok to good. nicely decorated with modern cartoon type art. we were sat cramped into a circle table, and we could not scoot our chairs in because the chairs kept hitting each other. there were two large booths that  could seat 8-10, but they chose to seat 3 or 4 people in them instead of us. considering the prices here, the service we received left a lot to be desired. the server took a long time to bring us water, and never checked on us after <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came out, and we ran out of water and drinks. appetizers and salad also took a long time to come out.\n\ni would not come here again. it was ok, but not awe-inspiring.", 
            "i've been wanting to try this place forever, because <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and shakes look incredible.  however, i go there and what do i get?!  the soft shell crab bruschetta and a maui coconut porter beer.  however, i do not regret my choices.  both were absolutely incredible!  my dad had sliders, fries, and the <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float and he said it was great.  and my sister had the urth sliders (vegan patties) with the s'mores milkshake.  and she loved hers.  and the service might have been the absolute best i've ever had anywhere!  our server's name was robin, and she was spectacular!  very friendly, very good at her job.  i definitely will be going back there soon for a buger and fries and i will be asking for robin again!  great place!",

            "i've been here a few times and feel like this place deserves a 4 because they continue to have good food and good service. we enjoyed our medium-well  burgers but next time we'll probably go with medium being that the patty could've been juicer.  but still, not bad. we split two burgers between the two of us since we both had mentioned we wanted to try them. <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger was absolutely delicious! you can taste the truffle in every bite. truffle and gruyere cheese in the same burger? perfection! the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> is their most popular burger and i can see why. they took the all-classic cheeseburger and deconstructed it. first, the cheese isn't just your typical cheddar, it's an aged goat cheddar. second, instead of adding a thick slice of tomato, that usually creates a mess and ends up sliding out anyway, they added a tomato confit! lettuce was replaced with arugula which gave <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> a lot of flavor. bacon, bacon, bacon! and for the best part instead of plain mayo this burger had a garlic chive aioli. ah-maze-ing! this changed the whole dynamic of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>! honestly, i don't even remember what the buns were like because i was too busy enjoying all the unique flavors inside. the only downside to our meal was that i was so excited to have the \"unndon\" cake for dessert that i skipped on the raved about shakes. i came to find that it was a seasonal item that is no longer on the menu. seriously?! until they bring that back i am not returning. take a look at the pictures others posted of it and tell me that does not look amazing? if you don't think so, then there's something definitely wrong with you. sorry. we ended up getting the dulce de leche cheesecake because #1 i love anything ddl and #2 it said it had frosted flakes cereal in/on. normally, i wouldn't even eat cheesecake unless it's the godiva or s'mores ones from the cheesecake factory but the description made this one hard to skip. it had the perfect consistency, too! the densely moist cracker crust underneath tasted like a combination of crushed <mark>Reed's Ginger Brew</mark> man and snicker doodle cookies. salivating much? for the perfect bite you have to start at the top, taking a bit of the whipped cream, ff cereal, cheesecake and then sweep it all up with the trail of oozing caramel sitting next to it. yummmmm-meee!! now remember, their desserts are seasonal so hurry in!"

            "my colleagues wanted milkshakes after dinner so got a table.  i would say it was a mixed bag at the restaurant.  the staff was very friendly and accommodating but it was very loud in the restaurant so it was hard to hear.  my colleagues all enjoyed their milkshakes. some with alcohol and some without out. i had a <mark>Death Valley Black Cherry</mark> soda that was really tasty.  we also had some fries and <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>.  i prefer pickle chips as the spears were a bit hard to eat.  you really had to cut each bite instead of just biting the pickle spear.   the fries were tasty too.  i want to try their burgers another time.", 
            "the hosts in the front were snobby, but our waiter was awesome. the decor were trendy, very colorful, with funny and uniquely cute cow paintings. \n\novercooked burgers for $18-35! no thank you. when you ask for a medium burger, you definitely don't mean an overcooked chard patty or dried patties! it is a burger joint, so you would think they would learn how to cook the beef patty by now right? wrong!\n\nwe tried <mark>The Classic</mark>, the typical cheese burger with beef patty, tomato, lettuce, and ketchup; and the caliente, hamburger with jalapenos, avocado, jack cheese, and some cilantro mayo. <mark>The Classic</mark> was so bitter because of the chard on the patty. we did not finish that burger. the caliente's patty was slightly better, but patty was still really overcooked. it was not spicy, even though, it was called hot in spanish. i was not pleased. we order the black and white milkshake and the <mark>Death Valley Black Cherry</mark> soda, which were okay.\n\nbill was around $60 without tip...not worth it. go to a fast food burger joint and you'll get better burgers."

            "let's start out with the service. i can be very judgmental with a restaurant on how you are greeted. when we approached the restaurant, the hostess' were smiling and friendly. we had a party of 10 and put down our name. the hostess told us it would be a 30-45 minute wait so we decided to wait and help ourselves to chinaplobano right next door just to eat something to carry us over so we don't get grumpy because of low blood sugar levels. i put in my order and literally 5 minutes later, our table was ready. i was like \"wth...i thought you said it's gonna be a 30-45 min wait, so now i'm stuck with dim sum and what i'm going to order off the menu.\" the waitress was very friendly but kinda slow at times. she never came back to offer anyone another drink/shake or refill my water.\n\nas far as food goes...i agree with mike h...<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are waaaaaaay expensive for how small they are, but then again...what do you expect...it's a restaurant in los vegas. i had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and wasn't very impressed. the menu consisted of some random burgers....i feel that if you wanna burger...\"the more basic the better\" the \"tiny bites\" are literally tiny bites. some of them cost almost as much as a regular size burger....if you want more bang for your buck....get a regular size. as far as the \"adult milkshakes,\" i don't drink usually but damn....the <mark>Virgil's Orange Cream</mark>....was absolutely amazing!!!!!!! if anything that was the only thing that i would go back for. \n\ni'd give the service a 2 and the food a 3. like i said...i'd only go back for an \"adult milkshake.\"", 
            "my friend and i decided to eat here and have a light supper before coming back later for a real dinner. \n\nwe had the guacamole hummus with spiced pita chips, which was good but not fantastic.  the crispy pork buns was good but a little too much hoison sauce. i also had the <mark>Virgil's Orange Cream</mark> milkshake without the alcohol. that was very tasty. the fries were very salty but cooked well. \n\nthe waitress was nice and helpful. i love the huge pink cow. we ended up not coming back here for dinner but next time, i'll try <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.", 
            "gonna start with desert.\n\nthe adult shakes are incredible espicaly the <mark>Virgil's Orange Cream</mark> (which really taste like a creamsicle) and the brown cow (a <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with pop rocks and rum).  \n\nthe food is typical of  a good gastro pub; new american fusion.  you are rewarded for being adventurous.  \n\nthe \"street tacos\" are made from duck confit, <mark>Foie Gras</mark> cranberry relish.  they are incredible.  other appetizer standouts include the kalbi and kimchee quesadilla, the bull's balls (no they are not rocky mountain oysters), and the lobster corn dogs. the crispy pork belly bun is worth special mention.  served with hoisin sauce and pea sprouts, its high end dim sum.\n\nmeat in a tube is well represented.  try the greek touri.  different but very flavorful.\n\nfinally, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  although i'm still partial to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> bar, holsteins offerings are very creative and good eats.  cooked perfectly to order.  the \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" (teriyaki glazed kobe burger with spicy mayo and tempura avocado) is a winner.\n\nservice is fast and efficient.\n\none final note, the beer selection is excellent and very reasonably priced for the strip."

            "my family and i had lunch at holsteins and started off with <mark>Ahi Poke Tostadas</mark> with jalapeno onion escabeche, tomatillo relish and avocado ailoi. the appetizer was a light and tasty combo - we always enjoy ahi and chips. hubby and i both had their signature burger the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> - dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli with a side of fries and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. we ordered our burgers on the med-well side, but were more well, but still good. next time we'll order them medium instead, so they are more juicy.  i've never had goat cheese on my burger and it added a yummy creamy flavor.  my daughter and hubby had their milkshakes - one chocolate and the other strawberry - both without alchohol. their milkshakes come with alchohol, so you can order without.  the milkshakes were thick, creamy and full of yummy flavor. next time i'll order one of their bam-boozled shakes like the creme brulee or campfire s'mores.", 
            "this was our first stop during our vegas weekend and we grabbed a few things to share. their menu is perfect for that since they have nosh (apps) and tiny buns (sliders) on the menu in addition to full size dishes.\n\nthey start you off with a little bucket of popcorn and seems the flavor changes - the first time we had the cajun...yum.  we had the holsteins sliders which showed that this place makes some legit burgers, even in mini-size. the <mark>Ahi Poke Tostadas</mark> were tasty little bites of goodness - i could've eaten 2 orders had we not been trying to save ourselves for dinner! we also shared the crispy pork belly buns...i came back for more of these soft, bao-like \"tacos\". the pork belly has a gorgeous crisp on the outside with a tender inside and is a perfect fit for the soft, fluffy bun. on the second visit, i ordered more of these along with their truffle lobster mac n cheese. it was creamy with big chunks of lobster. the chip and lobster garnish was so good, it could be it's own dish. maybe it's the lobster salad from the lobster rolls? and, since it was late morning, i tried the spicy bloody mary which is made with a jalape\\u00f1o cilantro infused vodka. bold flavor with a lingering heat. the hubby got a strawberry shake that he thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nwe were sat quickly both visits. the second visit was sunday morning during football so we opted to skip the $40 hourly charge for their bar tables...but there was a table in the back that had 2 tvs just no sound. \n\nservice was good both visits. food came out quick and hot. \n\nif they could put a holsteins into a reno or tahoe casino, i would be a very happy carnivore! i've been to some incredible burger places lately and this is one i will definitely make a point to visit next time i am in lv!", 
            "my boyfriend and i were looking for a quick bite to eat that would also prove to be tasty and holstein's is definitely all that. \"holstein\" cow pop art adorns the wall and adds to the energy of not only the restaurant but the cosmopolitan as a whole. it truly is my favorite hotel/casino on the strip! \n\n   i was told to try the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> but couldn't really see myself eating it, so i opted for the \"philly\" <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> and <mark>Ahi Poke Tostadas</mark>. the <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark>, although non-traditional, are my new favorite! if i am ever craving a philly cheesesteak i would choose these over a messy sandwich any day! the <mark>Ahi Poke Tostadas</mark> were good, nothing out of this world. the tostada was nice and crispy and the avocado aioli was perfectly portioned for each serving. i am used to fresh-off-the-boat florida seafood so i guess i should give vegas a little slack in that department considering you can't catch tuna in the middle of the desert.\n\n   since i wasn't incredibly hungry i ordered the dulce de leche swirl cheesecake to go. i ended up having this for breakfast the next morning so i most definitely enjoyed the corn flakes garnish. as an added touch, they put the caramel sauce and corn flakes in little side containers so my cheesecake would be fresh and not soggy.  \n\n   i wish i had a bigger appetite so that i could have tried one of their alcoholic milkshakes. i will definitely be back to test one out!", 
            "came here late afternoon during the second weekend of march madness for some light snacks between lunch and dinner. the service & food were better than average. the setting is sporty casual with some amusing artwork featuring cartoon cows and pickles. i plan to come back for an actual meal or order to-go next time i stay at the cosmo. \n\ncomplimentary popcorn in a bucket really hit the spot! this popcorn had a salty and tangy seasoning similar to corn nuts, ranch flavor. \n\n<mark>Ahi Poke Tostadas</mark> starter consisted of perfect bite sized portions of poke over 6 round corn tortilla chips. reminded me of tuna tartare. would recommend this for anyone that is looking for a light healthier option. \n\n<mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were breaded and crispy like popeyes crispy chicken. they were quite large and a decent portion but nothing to die for. we preferred regular ranch dip to the accompanying chipotle ranch. \n\nthe natural cut fries in a bucket were perfect to share.",

            "it's hard to find a place to eat in vegas that holds the middle ground between pretentious and expensive, and fast food. holsteins fits that niche perfectly! it's a laid-back atmosphere with an upscale twist on american food. i was thrilled to find items like <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark> on the menu, but they also had duck fat fries and other similar items. pricing was good, and service was excellent. we'll return here any time we come to vegas!", 
            "it's hard to resist a restaurant that offers spiked shakes and gourmet burgers.  my friend june had been to holsteins on an earlier vegas trip and come back raving that it was the one restaurant she'd hit that she wanted to revisit.  i can't tell you how many times i stared drooling at the menu before we went for dinner.\n\nholsteins is in the new and beautiful cosmopolitan hotel, and it's right across from marquee.  we went and got stamped for the marquee before we checked in for dinner, and we ended up missing our reservation (held for fifteen minutes).  the staff was nice about it, though, and it turned out that seating, even for a party of seven, was not a problem.  holsteins is a swanky place, with comfortable booths and a giant pink cow on display.  we had a waiter named chaz, and he was friendly and on his game.\n\nthe drinks were everything i wanted and more.  the spiked milkshakes were absolutely delicious.  the frozen grasshopper came with peppermint meringue, chocolate crunchies, creme de menthe, and van gogh dutch chocolate vodka.  i can't imagine it was terribly boozy, but it was a fabulous milkshake, with full mint chocolate flavor and the perfect thickness.  the little meringue was delightful, and the crunchy chocolate bits added texture to every sip.  the brown cow was also fantastic, an adult <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float made with <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, vanilla ice cream, pop rocks, and charbay tahitian vanilla rum.  it had all the kid-pleasing taste of a great <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, and i can't overstate the fun of pop rocks.  i also tried the bloody mary, without ice cream, but with smirnoff infused with pepper and cilantro, combined with bloody mary mix and garnished with a toothpick bearing an olive and a cocktail shrimp.  i love a good bloody mary, and this was a good one.  it had a heavy spicy flavor but a thin clean texture, and i appreciate food in my drink when appropriate.\n\nour table split three appetizers, and that felt like the right amount.  the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> were easily my favorite, breaded and deep-fried dill spears, olives, and caper berries, served with small sides of prosciutto and salami and an herb-caper mayo for dipping.  these were magical.  the breading was flavorful, crispy, and light, and the pickles oozed their pickly flavor.  i would also recommend the bucket of <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark>, which came with a bleu cheese dip.  nothing fancy, but delicious.  i was disappointed, though, by the truffle lobster mac' n cheese.  the creamy tallegio-mascarpone sauce was more creamy than it was cheesy, making the appetizer more like a macaroni salad.  the maine lobster was barely there, and the black truffle didn't come through.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were very good, though i suspect that the strength may lie in the toppings.  <mark>The Classic</mark> - with just lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, ketchup, and pickles - was the most boring of the bunch, and that doesn't hold true with a remarkable patty.  the patties were definitely tasty, though, with plenty of juice, and they held up well to some fun accompaniments.  my favorite was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>.  with a kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado, it was definitely a loaded gimmick of a fusion burger - but damn if i didn't gobble it down.  the teriyaki was sweet but not cloying, and the salt of the speckles of dried seaweed was great.  the crispy yam gave a welcome crunch, and that strip of avocado tempura was creamy and beautiful.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was also good, a dry-aged beef sirloin burger topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli.  it was less of a stand-out, though, and the tomato confit did not bring on the umami parade i'd hoped for.  if you like lamb burgers, the big fat greek is a good choice.  with greek spiced lamb, feta cream, lettuce, tomato, tzatziki sauce, and red onion and olive relish, it's a little like a greek menu threw up on a burger.  the result, though, is hearty and pretty well done.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> all come with a side of fries, and you have a choice of shoestring, sweet potato, and steak cut.  i prefer my thin fries, and the shoestring and sweet potato were both superb.  holsteins knows its way around a potato - even the steak cut fries were well seasoned and not at all mushy.\n\nwhen we left for marquee we were all stuffed to the brim.  the meal was not cheap - burgers started at $13 and shakes were $11 - but it was a satisfying feast that hardly qualified as a splurge in vegas.  i've had better burgers, but i was impressed by <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, and i doubt i've had better milkshakes.  if you're in vegas hankering for a fattening meal, check holsteins out.", 
            "i had 2 1/2 meals here (the \"1/2\" was a quick appetizer i grabbed) while staying at the cosmopolitan this past weekend, and it's definitely a solid spot. \n\ni came here twice for lunch and both meals were yummy! first time i had some sort of \"korean quesadilla.\" honestly, this was probably my least favorite thing i had here. it wasn't bad, but there was a couple different types of sauce on it, and i thought they kind of overpowered things. i was the only one who didn't get a burger during this meal, but i nibbled on some fries of those who did (sweet potato and steak fries) & they were yummy! \n\nfor the second lunch i had to try a spiked shake & it was delicious! i had the one that was supposed to taste like \"cereal\" and it did! i don't know if this is true or not, but i was informed by our waitress that this is one of only two places in the us (maybe the world?) that serves this shake. i also bad some delicious <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark> (just the right amount of sauce w/the right amount of kick) & some polish sausage sliders (the red peppers were a nice touch).  everything was great! \n\nfor my \"half\" meal i had the \"hummus guacamole.\" this isn't what i was expecting (it was chunkier than i thought), but still tasted good. it came w/a lot of pita chips. \n\nthe service here was excellent on each occasion. holsteins is located on the 2nd floor of the cosmopolitan (while most of the other restaurants are located on the 3rd floor) and is a little more casual, and therefore it bit cheaper than other restaurants. \n\neven though this is pretty standard in vegas another nice thing about this restaurant is you can get to-go cups for alcohol. one night while wondering around the hotel i just popped in at the bar and got a \"dragon\" cocktail in a to-go cup. this drink is one of the many at holsteins that is made w/vitamin water. it's yummy...and um...healthy?", 
            "the lobster mac and cheese is to die for, the <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark> & the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> are amazing...and that's just the appetizer menu... my favorite burgers are the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> along with their steak cut fries...omg. the shakes.... really... by far \"the campfire s'mores\"...best atmosphere and customer service in vegas...there's no way i'd go to to the cosmopolitan and not check out this place.....", 
            "first visit (early may) i wasn't quite impressed.\n\nyes the d\\u00e9cor is funky fresh. artsy and trendy and the service was decent (the servers were not 100% in tune to what they were serving). but the overall visit was not what i hoped.\n\nthe breakdown: i was invited by the light group to dine in before the club. so, there were tables of beautiful women dressed to impress but not ready to chow down wearing their club attire (me included). deep fried everything, and not the best samples of their burgers. (the menu was pre determined, served as a 4 course meal). it was a pleasure to be hosted by them and i would have not discovered them otherwise.\n\nbut ....\n\nsecond \"chance\" visit (late may) i was in heaven ... even if for a moment.\n\nthe breakdown: it was recovery sunday (from saturday night gallivanting). we all know the best hangover cure it some heavy greasy food ... so i gave it a second try. it was much more casual, with no worries of feeling full after.\n\nthere was a 40 min wait (that tells you its quite popular). but there was room at the bar which also had full service. the way they place the barstools leaves plenty of elbow room to really get down, without throwing 'bows.\n\ni had: the golden standard (because i just couldn't talk myself into paying $28 for one burger \"<mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>\" though i was tempted). and it was delicious. didn't even need to add a thing. no ketchup, salt, nada. it was made to perfection (medium) i chose a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> which were decent, but a little soggy at the end.\nwhile i waited, i washed down a brown cow float, which was basically a turnt up <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with \"pop rocks\" and it brought me back to being a kid with the rocks popping in my mouth. loved it!!\ni tried their bucket of <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark>, and i liked how they didn't drench it with sauce. i enjoyed licking my fingers to that before and during my burger meal. \n\ni guess there is a time and place for everything ... and figuring out the right moment makes a huge difference.\n\nholsteins \"before\" the club no\nholsteins the day \"after\" definitely", 
            "omg super disappointed like no other.\n\nfyi: came here at night and they card you to get in. super loud music. if you come at night they only serve the late night menu which is a total bummer.\n\nordered:\n\n*we order shoe string fries. i have had them before many many times in my life time. yelpers even posted pictures of shoe string fries that they have ordered from here. however apparently the fries that came out looked like regular sized fries. when i asked the server stated yes they are shoe string fries. i must be born yesterday! for reals that was strike number one! \n\n*we ordered a holsteins beef $12. the menu said tiny bun. which makes us think its a small burger. comes to find out that what they meant by that is sliders. when asked. the waitress stated: it was all they had. seriously. thanks for the heads up! honestly, good service= please brief your customers on what they are ordering. especially when you have asked them if it was their first time and their answer was yes. lacked in flavor. nothing that made me go yum or ooooooo. mcdonald's have better burgers.\n\n*bucket of <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark> $13. one of the worst wings i've had as well. tyson frozen <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark> are even better than this. this item was not even finished. if you order this ask for a side of buffalo sauce to dip it in. \n\nobservation: \n\nsaw staff standing around talking by the register thing. made me think of resturant stakeout. i wished he would've been recording the staff because that's totally unprofessional.\n\nthoughts:\n*love the unique decor. its really cool. \n*service was just poor. i even left a comment on their comment card.\n*never coming back! \n*overly priced items.\n*presentation wise was decent. \n\ntips:\n*credit card and cash accepted.\n*tons of seating area. they just might not have enough staff so they'll make you wait awhile.\n*there's a bar area.\n*located in the cosmopolitan hotel.", 
            "we sat at the bar to grab a quick lunch bite. our bartender was very friendly and had great suggestions. lobster mac n cheese is awesome. the bucket of <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark> were a hit or miss, some pieces were dry and others perfectly cooked. not sure how that gets done if it goes into the fryer all at the same time, but oh well it did. didn't get a chance to try their shakes, but they have a pretty decent selection of beers and wine. \n\nthere was one red wine in particular, with a funky/artsy label from italy, that i can't remember the name of, but it was very palatable. if i'm in vegas again i'll be sure to make a pit stop to try some other stuff.", 
            "i wish i would have been feeling better when we had dinner here, but i was under the weather so wasn't super hungry or in a drinking mooooood.   i had a <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> and it was really good.  my husband ordered the <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark> from the app menu and he loved them - said they had a good spice to them.  that was kind of the extent of what we ate and from that, i can definitely recommend the food.\n\nwe arrived around 6 on a sunday night and were seated promptly.  our server was attentive and kept my water full and the food came out very quickly.  when we ordered, there was a lot of up-selling and recommendations - but since we ordered so little, i guess that is to be expected.\n\nbut, overall, in our short, limited food experience, i had a good time and would return and/or recommend holsteins to others.  in fact, i would definitely like to return to try some of those boozy shakes!", 
            "i had the most deee-licious burger here the other day.  i split a fun-ghi burger with my friend and shared <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark>.  we knew <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> would be awesome just from it's aroma, but man, when i took my first bite, i was in burger heaven.  from the menu description, <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger contains: beef patty, truffle marinated portabella mushroom, carmelized onion, gruyere, mayonnaise, & frisee.  we also added avocado to ours and ordered the patty to be cooked medium rare.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was juicy and had an abundance of flavors from all the ingredients.  the <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark> were very good too.  the fries were standard.  i so want to come back and try the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> and a shake!  the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> has kobe beef and <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, which we can't have anymore in ca.\n\n\nas seen on tv:\n\nunique eats\naired on 07/22/2012\nepisode: las vegas\nover the top desserts.", 
            "as far as burger places go, this place is like the upscale casino who want a gourmet of burger place.  located in the cosmopolitan hotel, it's a good place to get burgers, fries, shakes or that stick to your gut feeling food.  we ordered <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark> ( nice), green salad ( basic, but good), <mark>California Turkey</mark> burger ( turkey patty, well flavored, avocado, sprouts, lettuce, onions, i said hold the secret sauce). my husband got <mark>The Classic</mark> which basically is a big burger, he said it was good. our daughters got the sliders and fries, they said they were very good, and shakes ( vanilla for the little, chocolate for the older ) and they said they were thick, sweet and delightful. \nstaff was friendly, fast with service and attentive. decor is like urban graffiti farm, clean and well maintained. for a \"burger place\" it's definitely more on the pricey side,the bill was around $120, but like i said, it's like \"let's all us a gourmet burger place\" in the cosmo, so you're going to pay more.",

            "how long does it take?\n\non a weekend trip to las vegas, we decided to stop by to get our fill of some burgers. we arrived around 1pm on a sunday afternoon and were told that a table of 3 would have a waiting period of approximately 30 minutes. they would take down our phone number, we would leave and actually get called back within 10 minutes. this is starting out to be a good experience, but.....\n\nour orders were taken fairly quickly and we were eager to begin our meal. after about 45 minutes of waiting, we started to get restless. not only were we starving, but we had not heard from our waitress. we flagged her down and inquired about our order. when she returned, she said she wasn't sure why it was taking so long, so she offered us some cheese popcorn. \n\nwe inhaled the 1st round of popcorn and a 2nd round was offered since our food was still being prepared. our hunger for food continued to mount and with still no food in sight, our waitress offered to give us some steak fries. again, another 2 rounds of fries came out and after an hour of waiting for our food, we finally received our order. \n\n<mark>Ahi Sliders</mark>, korean \"bull\" gogi and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> were ordered. the <mark>Ahi Sliders</mark> were served between 2 buns that appeared to have been chilled. i don't know about most, but cold bread to me is not edible. both the korean \"bull\" gogi and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burgers were overly charred on the outside to the point that they had this burnt taste to them (both were ordered to be cooked medium). this was quite disappointing and most of the meal was not even finished. \n\nafter our meal, the waitress comes over and asks why we didn't finish the <mark>Ahi Sliders</mark> because she notices that most people don't. i am thinking really?!? we told her the buns were a bit cold and it didn't go well with the ahi. she went on and asked how did we enjoy <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and we told her about the burnt taste. she said that's what holstein's prides itself in cooking their burgers and that some customers like the charred taste on their burgers. i don't know where these customers reside from, but they should understand that burnt/charred food is unhealthy. i do give her credit as she did whatever she could to keep our spirits up throughout the meal and tried to keep our dining experience a positive one, but....\n\nwhen we were settling the bill, we wanted to use our groupon to be applied to the bill. this was a headache as the fries from earlier that were supposed to have been comped by our waitress were included on the bill. trying to apply the groupon just confused the manager/waitress even more. overall, the dining experience did not live up to our expectations. i'd rather roll over to burger bar next time.", 
            "i expect to pay higher fare for dining on the strip but i expect a good payout with delicious flavors and a satisfied tummy... and holsteins fell short for me. for a place that boasts their buns and shakes, i expect them to be amazing! and sadly those were the two things i liked least about the place\n\ni ordered the <mark>Ahi Sliders</mark> and the flavors of the slider were great. really fresh and my favorite part was the slaw on the inside. but what killed these sliders for me were the buns! the buns were cold, tough, and chewy. i was expecting some soft succulent warm buns to sink my teeth into, but these tasted like day old bread.\n\nnow onto the shakes: i ordered the black cow shake which was an \"udder\" fail. it was supposed to be a play on a vanilla coke float and what i got was a flat soda with some vanilla ice cream. the soda was so flat it just tasted like i was drinking coke flavored syrup. yuck. maybe you'll have some luck with some of the other shakes\n\nall in all, it might have been an off day for holstein's but i'm not willing to empty out my wallet again to give them a second chance.",

            "finally writing a review after coming here for the 3rd time, defintiely my favorite \"gourmet burger\" place in vegas \n\nlocated on the second floor of cosmopolitan. wait time usually isn't that bad, but you can make a reservation if you go on a busy weekend just in case. \n\nthey start you off with popcorn thats seasoned with something\n\nimma just say those alcoholic shakes get me feelin some type of way nuff said, or i was just tired from edc week \n\nthe first 2 times i was here i got the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>, <mark>Foie Gras</mark> anything i can't really resist. the only bad thing about this burger is it's like double the price of all their other burgers\n\nthe third time i came here i got the\n\ncrispy pork belly bun and that shit sooo good, unless you don't like fat, cus i bit into a fatty ass piece and just about died \n\ni also got the <mark>Ahi Sliders</mark>, they're hella good too, nothing abnormal about them they're exactly what they sound like. even tho ahi mini tostadas would be more appropriate since they come on fried wonton wrappers\n\ni probably should be talking shit about this restaurant and saying to go to burgr or some other sub par gourmet burger place so i can keep this location to myself, but i guess sharing is caring",

            "holstein's is one of my consistent favorites here in vegas, always coming up with fun new burger offerings. this time i went for <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. i wasn't sure about its teriyaki glaze as i always fear sweet goopiness, but it was a really light glaze, and the crispy yam, avocado, and spicy mayo gelled together perfectly over the kobe beef. it was my first time there with a group, so i got to see all kinds of good burgers served that night - <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark>, <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, and urth burger were all well-reviewed. <mark>Ahi Sliders</mark> were tiny, but we were warned. \n\nwashed it down with a gritty like i love oatmeal stout. i have yet to try a booze milkshake, but i also have yet to take a photo in the giant stiletto. the day will come."

            "when it comes to burgers, this place is tops.  i have been going here for two years, and always have the best experiences.  their appitizers are great too, love the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> and the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark>.  the desserts are also outstanding.  i really like the spiked shakes too, but be careful, they do pack a punch sometimes.  although the music is a little loud at night sometimes, it's a really fun, hip place to enjoy a beer and burger in vegas.", 
            "when i had to make my way across the \"skywalk\" to work on the other side of the street, i always took a \"short cut\" through the cosmo upstairs.  after our dinner at china poblano, i learned to pay more attention to what else was up there, which was the reason why i zeroed in on holstein's.  and hey - any restaurant serving burgers that even utilizes the cow's freakin' name, had better be ready to 'bring it', as far as i'm concerned.  so when bear and i selected it for our burger fix, we were prepared for - at the very least - a 'transformative experience.'\n\nso was it that kind of deal? nope, not really.  but you could do so much worse.\n\nfirst of all - as promised - i have to give a shout-out to our server, amanda.  just that right, attractive combination of smiles, sass and 'savoir faire'' (note to managers: get this woman a raise, stat!) i've always loved that in the better restaurants in town, the staff always have an 'inside/out' knowledge of the menu and the daily specials, and in this particular area, amanda did not disappoint. (which is why holstein's gets an extra star.)  with so many different styles of burger to choose from, it could have been an all-day task to select just one, but with her help, i chose the nom-<mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> ($16.50), while bear went \"classic\" and got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> ($17.50). \n\npricey? well, duh! what does anybody expect when they're using kobe and dry- aged sirloin to craft the frickin' burgers? (and don't forget - this is a 'strip' joint we're talking about here, people!) and while we waited - but not for long - we got to check out the unique decor that included anime-style artwork of the holstein's \"mascot\".  cute...especially considering that he's on the menu as well as the wall!\n\nfor our 'intro', we had the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> ($12.00) a cluckin'-good twist on chili con queso served with warm tortilla chips, and bear's 'de rigeur' item to try, the cuban street tacos ($13.00) a delicious menage-a-trois of roast pork, ham and swiss lovingly drizzled with pickle and spicy mustard aioli. the bite i had of one of them made me wonder if i should've gotten a separate appetizer as well....\n\nand then came the burgs.  bear liked his standard just fine, and i added some 'meat candy' (aka bacon!) to my nom-nom for about two bucks more. i didn't know if i expected a burger with barbecue potato chips and 1000 island dressing to actually work, but damn if didn't, and in quite a tasty way, too. (but then again...name one thing that doesn't taste better with bacon on it.)  it was quite the stunning companion to my frozen grasshopper shake ($11.00).  and the fries served with were just the way i like them: crispy, spicy shoestrings, with none of the greasiness you get from other burger joints.\n\nso, sure, holstein's is giving up burgers, but not at jack-in-the-box prices, so it's always best to keep that in mind.  and as repeat visits go, i think we can file this one under \"special occasions\" mostly.  and we will always ask to be seated in amanda's section...", 
            "holsteins really wasn't as good as i was hoping for......this could have been for a number of reasons. should i not have ordered a turkey burger? probably not because it was meh. every other table was provided popcorn as an appetizer....after waiting for like 20 minutes i asked our waiter if we could get some. why do i have to ask? just bring me my damn popcorn i'm starving! the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> was really good (or was it good bc i was starving??) and my husband said his burger was pretty decent. the atmosphere was cool and it was in my hotel which is why it gets 3 stars. i might come here again....if i come back to vegas and stay at the cosmo i probably will (just out of convenience sake) but i def wouldnt seek this place out.", 
            "traveling to vegas quite often has allowed me to experience several great establishments for drink and food.  on this occasion i stepped into holsteins hearing about its reputation after spending time at public house in the palazzo.  i must say, i was well impressed.  first off, the beer selection is well organized with several verities that anyone, aficionados to the everyday beer fan can enjoy.  lets not even get into what happens with the shakes!!! the menu has a fun selection of \"bar bites\", sliders and burgers.  i enjoyed a combo of truffles lobster mac and cheese, <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> sauce and a chunky monkey milk shake with a gulden draak ale as a finisher!  obviously i'm off my diet but the 5 years of recovery will be well worth it!  i must say the service was phenomenal!  lara, the epitome of what a skilled server should be, was attentive, on task, quickly responsive and though busy never missed a moment to check in, smile and make sure my meal was enjoyable!  never waited more than a couple of minutes between the order and its tabling (drinks) and the food was promptly delivered about 5-10 minutes from time of ordering.  this even while the restaurant was packed and i observed every table top full!  well done!  \n\nin summary, i'm sure just from my limited experience the rest of the menu is going to be delicious.  i will return en force with a large group of friends to do our best to eat everything the kitchen can throw at us and drink every last drop of specialty beers the bar has to offer!  a must visit from now on when i'm in vegas!", 
            "i friggin' loved holsteins so much. i had an amazing burger and an even more amazing milkshake. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> i got was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> -- kobe beef, teriyaki glaze,  nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado (i think this is what reeled me in). how amazing does that sound? the shoestring fries it came with were delicious, too. i think my favorite part about my holsteins experience was the (boozy) milkshake i got. i got <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> (go figure) -- stoli salted karamel vodka, reese's, pretzels, sprinkles, and chocolate-caramel popcorn. guys, when i say this is the best milkshake i've ever had, i mean it. i have dreams about it. ok, not really, but i hope i'm making myself clear about how amazing it was. i don't think i could go to vegas and not come to holsteins for another milkshake and burger. also, my friends and i started with the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark>, which was just as amazing as everything else. not only was the food absolutely delicious, the service was so speedy and our server was really nice. cool upscale diner-like atmosphere as well. we came here for a more low key dinner (dined in our bathing suits), but this place would be good for (a big) lunch, too. just amazing all around. this place is a must when you're in vegas.", 
            "i know this place is known for their burgers, but my sister and i didn't want to have a burger so i decided to we should try some appetizers. we ordered <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> with chips and the lobster and steak quesadilla. one word to describe the quesadilla bomb!!!! the buffalo and <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> was great too. i'm definitely coming back to try <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and definitely ordering the lobster and steak quesadilla.", 
            "was very disappointed with this place. we ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger and the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>. i don't know if the kitchen was just super lazy that day or out of it already at 6pm, or what, but they forgot the bacon on the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, and they forgot the thousand island dressing on the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>. they also literally just put a few dots of cheddar cheese in the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>. the only thing i enjoyed was the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark>.", 
            "with the caveat that i didn't have a burger the two times i was here (but tried a number of apps and shakes), this place is typical for an eatery at a big vegas hotel - adequate, never a bad meal, but you will never be blown away in any fashion (my humble person opinion - every meal in vegas at a high end hotel is basically just a facsimile of the better version you can get at the restaurant's socal or ny location).\n\ni came here twice on a recent bachelor party.  once for milkshakes, and once for apps before our flight home.  the (boozy) milkshakes were very good.  i had the \"<mark>The Fat Boy</mark>\" (uv candy bar vodka, reese's, pretzels, sprinkles, chocolate-caramel popcorn).  a friend had the vegan maple pecan shake (almond milk 'ice cream', jack daniel's, spiced pecans, maple caramel sauce).  both were delicious, although if you are really in the mood for something sweet and creamy, the <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark> probably won't hit the spot (the sort of \"earthy\" taste of the maple and almonds doesn't give you the same satisfaction as real ice cream).  <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> was barely detectable, however (i would've liked at least just a little taste, to know i was drinking something alcoholic).\n\nthe next day we came back for <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, chicken fingers, <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark>, and surf and turf quesadillas.  i had a bloody mary, which was good, but after three days of drinking, the shrimp on top was not appetizing.  the apps were all meh - not bad, but not great.  i was expecting something more from the \"southern fried\" chicken fingers, but they basically tasted like something i could get from roy rogers.  dip was good, but again, didn't really taste fresh made or have that \"pop\" i was expecting when i read the menu description.\n\nwe sat in the front every time we came here, so i can't comment on the rear seating area, but i will say this - there is incredibly loud music with a heavy bass beat that is just not palatable.  \n\nall told, try the shakes.  maybe try <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> (can't comment directly, but i wouldn't be optimistic based on the other food).  apps are basically tgi friday's quality.",

            "this review is based on mostly presentation. i have tried several burger places but this is a new burger place, which i have yet to try. there was an option for a 3 course meal which included an appetizer between <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> with salsa chips or salad. also they have a <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> and this stood out to me because there are potato chips in it. the potato chip was not soggy either first bite you were able to hear a big crunch (; presentation of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was well thought out all the flavors blended well together. fries were cut medium not too thin or too thick and definitely was freshly made. \n\nif i had to choose i would still pick gorden ramseys burger place (;", 
            "so we decided to check this place out after a long day of meetings. i must say they have some great lobster mac and cheese and <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark>. i wasn't impressed with their burgers and the hot wings were over cooked. our waitress did a very nice with our large group of 15. i didn't care for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.",

            "if you find yourself wandering on the 3rd floor trying to determine if you dressed appropriately swing back down to this joint. the price is decent and the food will surprise you (hopefully for the better). i had the brisket burger while visiting in vegas and it made me forget about in and out for at least a few hours. honestly this place gets pretty creative with their burgers which i commend them for and the fries are awesome. i didn't get a shake because the beer selection was so good. i did get a pretty decent grumbly stomach after eating here but in all fairness i had been eating all sorts of junk including <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> and the swedish fish candy from ny,ny hotel. i would visit again next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "02/16/11 dinner: \n\nwithout planning in advance we ended up here. didn't have a burger! instead, had drinks, \"appetizers\" (turned out to be plates bigger than appetizers) and desserts. <mark>The Classic</mark> martini was terrific, i got the gin variety (does no one drink gin in this town?), containing a gin of which i had never heard (\"nolet silver\"?) which was floral and smooth, garnished with pickled shallot. (expecting shallot bulbs on a stick, instead it was shaved in <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> of the glass!) another had a\"bloody mary\", which came \"up\", containing pepper/cilantro infused vodka, which was greatly liked, especially the gigantic shrimp that came with it! food was \"<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>\" (fried dill spears, fried olives, caper berries, prosciutto, salami w/ herb-caper mayo), \"street tacos\" (crispy shells filled w/ shreds of duck confit, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, trufle crema & cranberry relish), \"truffle lobster mac n cheese\" (maine lobster, black truffle & mac in a tallegio-marscapone sauce), and \"bull's balls\" (2 risotto rice balls stuffed with veal, topped with \"tomato fondue\" and a slice of lardo). a very rich, decadent collection of dishes, i thought all were very well done, especially the mac (wow!). the \"bulls' balls\" weren't as good as i had hoped, mostly rice with very little filling, and the lardo kinda lost amongst the strength of the \"tomato foudue\", which was genius. (an angel-hair pasta with that fondue would be crazy good.) the \"street tacos\" were really good but really rich. my fave thing on the \"<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>\" were the fried olives (only 2, we had to fight over those!). ended with a \"stout float\" (guinness, ice cream, oatmeal crumble), very good. after food we had a really wacky concoction: \"johnny apple seed\", consisting of knob creek, honey and apple cider. first of all, the very nice server said it was the first time that it had been ordered since it was added to the menu (!) and second, they had no idea what \"hard cider\" was! we had to explain, there are alcoholic apple ciders out there, was this one of those?, but the answer never came. no matter, it was a nose and throat clearer! ahem! but a great idea, imho. sipping it took about 15 minutes, and well worth it! so overall, i'd say go. now i need to go back for a burger, perhaps that \"duck duck goose\", stuffed with duck confit, duck cracklings & <mark>Foie Gras</mark>! yikes!", 
            "i had high hopes for holsteins. i love a good burger, and shakes with booze...yes please!! \n\ni was there with a party of 12, and we were early for our 6pm reservation, but we were told we couldn't be seated until our entire party was there. not a problem, that's not unusual. by the time the majority of our party was there, they seated us. we were all ridiculously hungry, so were excited with the quick appearance of our servers. because of the size of our party, they split our table in half. they attempted to split the bill as well, but we asked it to be kept on one. we quickly ordered some appetizers and waited in anticipation. \n\nlobster corn dogs: good, but not great \n<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>: extremely tasty! \nlobster mac n cheese: i only had a small bite of this, but could have easily eaten a whole plateful! \nphilly steak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> (i think): ehhh \n\nso far so good...i was pleased with the appetizers, and ready for my burger! i kept it simple and ordered a classic cheeseburger, and it was great. i can't complain. i had it with steak fries which were also good. the overall consensus of the group was that the food was good. \n\nso why the 2 stars? while the food was good, maybe even great, the service was terrible. wait, i have to clarify, half of the table's service was terrible. while pete's side of the table got their food right away and with no problems, nicole's side of the table had several problems... \n\n1. <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> girl ordered a classic burger with cheddar cheese, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, bacon, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark> and no tomatoes. what she got was a cheeseburger with tomatoes, no onions, bacon or mushrooms. while i acknowledge this was not nicole's fault, because she read back the order correctly, so someone messed up in the kitchen...what upset me was that by the time she got the right order, the rest of us were almost done eating! and throughout the whole time nicole never came back to give us any kind of updates. \n\n2. someone else ordered a burger (i honestly can't remember which one) with brie and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>. when she got her burger and opened it up, the brie was mostly rind and barely any cheese, so she asked it to be sent back and just asked for cheddar instead. this also took a ridiculous amount of time. \n\n3. someone ordered a beer that never came \n\nduring this time another one of our party decided to say something to the manager, steve. as soon as we said something to him, he brought <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> out. he was very helpful and apologetic, but he messed up too. the second burger was supposed to have <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> and it didn't, we noticed this immediately so the one who ordered it let steve now, he immediately said \"oh no, there are <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> on there, i saw them put them on\" then in what seemed like a scene out of a movie or a cooking competition, she slowly lifted the bun to expose raw onions on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. obviously steve was left a little red in the face. to his credit, he did comp us those two meals, but the ordeal left the majority of us disappointed and upset. <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> girl couldn't even finish half of her burger because she had been so hungry she was left feeling sick and unable to eat. \n\nthe duck fat fries were disappointing, but the shoestring and steak fries were yummy, and i also enjoyed the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. \n\noh and the server (who's name i didn't catch) who was pouring drinks, then \"tying his shoes\" while we talked to the manager...you're not slick dude.  we know you were listening, probably hoping it wasn't you we were complaining about.\n\nwhat is most disappointing, is that the food is good enough for a return visit, but the service alone makes me not want to set foot in the place ever again.", 
            "i've been trying to find an awesome burger spot in vegas for quite a while now and the reviews made this place seem pretty decent. \n\nthe restaurant is nice with simple decor and a cool bar. the happy hour seems awesome with the 1$ beers and 1$ shots.\n\nthe service was great and so was the food. the reason this is getting 4 stars is because they appetizers and fries are not that tasty. we ordered the lobster mac n cheese which was just okay, the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> which were decent, and the duck fat tacos which were horrible and small. there are a variety of fries you can order with your dinner. i got the duck fat fries, which i thought might taste a little gamy or greasy, instead they were gross and overcooked. \n\nnow, the best part about this restaurant. i got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger ( i think that's the name of it) and it was delicious! this is by far the best burger i've had in las vegas. i ordered the kobe burger rare and on top of it came, fried yams, cheese, wasabi dressing, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado.  it was to die for! everyone needs to try it. \n\nthe prices are also really great. for the four of us to eat it cost about 130$.\n\nwe will be going back soon",

            "after reading many yelpers raving about this place, the girlfriend and i decided to give it a shot.  the pink cow didn't hurt too (how can you turn away a pink cow?!? she says)\n\nlocation:  located in the new cosmopolitan hotel right outside of marquee nightclub, this joint is in a prime spot to see and be seen in.  definite positive points in my book.\n\natmosphere:  the top 40s music really gets your heart pumping and is very fitting for a cosmo hotel food establishment.  i honestly didn't take much notice to the artwork and aesthetic elements of the restaurant.  very pop modern feel without being too noisy or overbearing.  there is a bar and lounge area at the front if your in the mood for a more casual mingling time with knee high tables and lcd tvs behind the bar.  beyond that is the regular dining portion of the restaurant.\n\nfood:  \n-<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>\n-\"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger\"\n-<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\n-shoestring fries\n\n<mark>Fried Pickles</mark> baby!  money. ok honestly this was the first time i had <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> in my life, and well i am a die hard pickle lover (so really any sort of pickles would be great), these were pretty bomb.  they give you a little tin with some breaded <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> in them, fried olives, and caper berries!  what is a caper berry? yes first time i have come across one myself (like ash finding a new pokemon i guess? kinda puzzling, yet exciting).  but yah, it was pretty darn good.  i was kinda sad that there were only a few of them (about 5-6 wedges of pickles, 2 olives, 2 caper berries), but they were good, while they lasted. :(  also there was a small assortment of deli meats (salami, ham, prosciutto) which seemed like an odd pairing with the fried items, but they were a a nice tasty tid bit before our meal came.  we both having similar tastes, the gf and i ordered \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" burger.  to be honest, the server who brought our burgers out said this was the best burger in his opinion on the menu.  (i'll be the judge of that myself sir, lol).  well this burger was seriously a masterpiece in of itself.  kobe beef patty with a teri glaze, brought me back to punahou carnival days (if your from hawaii and know what im talking about), and on top of that you get the little shredded yam crispies adding color and a little bit of sweetness to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, nori furikake inside, with a generous piece of fried avocado, again giving another element of texture and creaminess to your bite.  then for the finale, the spicy mayo spread on the bun (like the kine you get with spicy tuna sushi), is like a ninja just hiding there as you gaze at all the other elements of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, waiting to make its presence known.  this my friend gives you that zing of heat (without being overpowering) that really brings all these flavors together, and for me this spicy mayo was the winnaz.  quite honestly one (if not the) best burger i've had the honor to come across in my life.  you also get your choice of bun (white or wheat).  both of which are quite tasty, as i got the white and the gf got the wheat, really can't go wrong with either.  they come with your choice of fries: shoestring or steak-cut.  i didn't want to copy the gf as i wanted the shoestring, so i convinced her to ask to upgrade to <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  they come in little mock fry-baskets which is a thumbs up for presentation.  for the taste of each of the fries, both were very good, would definitely recommend either in a heartbeat.  also they give you a nice amount of fries which is always great!\n\nprice:  ok so this is always <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> side of a vegas story, but honestly people it is vegas and yes $16-17 bucks for a designer burger is on the steep side for most people, but it is in my honest opinion worth it.\n\nverdict:  holsteins presents itself as a hip, modern burger/diner type joint in the heart of the new cosmopolitan hotel.  it's decor and atmosphere really mesh well with the feel of the hotel itself and the food it presents.  you really get what you pay for in my opinion, a great designer burger, one that you quite honestly could not find anywhere else.  in comparison, for $16-17 i would take it over blt's wagyu beef burger & max brenner's kobe burger any day for the same price range.  it's definitely a place to check out if you're in the moooood for some good burgers!\n\n(they are known for their shakes too, but we didnt get to try them as the idea of a shake first thing in the morning after a long night clubbing didn't quite fit the agenda, if you know what i mean)", 
            "it's hard to resist a restaurant that offers spiked shakes and gourmet burgers.  my friend june had been to holsteins on an earlier vegas trip and come back raving that it was the one restaurant she'd hit that she wanted to revisit.  i can't tell you how many times i stared drooling at the menu before we went for dinner.\n\nholsteins is in the new and beautiful cosmopolitan hotel, and it's right across from marquee.  we went and got stamped for the marquee before we checked in for dinner, and we ended up missing our reservation (held for fifteen minutes).  the staff was nice about it, though, and it turned out that seating, even for a party of seven, was not a problem.  holsteins is a swanky place, with comfortable booths and a giant pink cow on display.  we had a waiter named chaz, and he was friendly and on his game.\n\nthe drinks were everything i wanted and more.  the spiked milkshakes were absolutely delicious.  the frozen grasshopper came with peppermint meringue, chocolate crunchies, creme de menthe, and van gogh dutch chocolate vodka.  i can't imagine it was terribly boozy, but it was a fabulous milkshake, with full mint chocolate flavor and the perfect thickness.  the little meringue was delightful, and the crunchy chocolate bits added texture to every sip.  the brown cow was also fantastic, an adult <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float made with <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, vanilla ice cream, pop rocks, and charbay tahitian vanilla rum.  it had all the kid-pleasing taste of a great <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, and i can't overstate the fun of pop rocks.  i also tried the bloody mary, without ice cream, but with smirnoff infused with pepper and cilantro, combined with bloody mary mix and garnished with a toothpick bearing an olive and a cocktail shrimp.  i love a good bloody mary, and this was a good one.  it had a heavy spicy flavor but a thin clean texture, and i appreciate food in my drink when appropriate.\n\nour table split three appetizers, and that felt like the right amount.  the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> were easily my favorite, breaded and deep-fried dill spears, olives, and caper berries, served with small sides of prosciutto and salami and an herb-caper mayo for dipping.  these were magical.  the breading was flavorful, crispy, and light, and the pickles oozed their pickly flavor.  i would also recommend the bucket of <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark>, which came with a bleu cheese dip.  nothing fancy, but delicious.  i was disappointed, though, by the truffle lobster mac' n cheese.  the creamy tallegio-mascarpone sauce was more creamy than it was cheesy, making the appetizer more like a macaroni salad.  the maine lobster was barely there, and the black truffle didn't come through.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were very good, though i suspect that the strength may lie in the toppings.  <mark>The Classic</mark> - with just lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, ketchup, and pickles - was the most boring of the bunch, and that doesn't hold true with a remarkable patty.  the patties were definitely tasty, though, with plenty of juice, and they held up well to some fun accompaniments.  my favorite was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>.  with a kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado, it was definitely a loaded gimmick of a fusion burger - but damn if i didn't gobble it down.  the teriyaki was sweet but not cloying, and the salt of the speckles of dried seaweed was great.  the crispy yam gave a welcome crunch, and that strip of avocado tempura was creamy and beautiful.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was also good, a dry-aged beef sirloin burger topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli.  it was less of a stand-out, though, and the tomato confit did not bring on the umami parade i'd hoped for.  if you like lamb burgers, the big fat greek is a good choice.  with greek spiced lamb, feta cream, lettuce, tomato, tzatziki sauce, and red onion and olive relish, it's a little like a greek menu threw up on a burger.  the result, though, is hearty and pretty well done.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> all come with a side of fries, and you have a choice of shoestring, sweet potato, and steak cut.  i prefer my thin fries, and the shoestring and sweet potato were both superb.  holsteins knows its way around a potato - even the steak cut fries were well seasoned and not at all mushy.\n\nwhen we left for marquee we were all stuffed to the brim.  the meal was not cheap - burgers started at $13 and shakes were $11 - but it was a satisfying feast that hardly qualified as a splurge in vegas.  i've had better burgers, but i was impressed by <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, and i doubt i've had better milkshakes.  if you're in vegas hankering for a fattening meal, check holsteins out.", 
            "believe the hype...this place is real. we ate here on a saturday night and the food and atmosphere is awsome.  quick tip: make reservations or you'll be waiting for a while and do not ask for \"duck-fat fries\" because they don't serve it anymore\n\nthis place is situated inside the comopolitan at city center, it sits right across from the chandelier room (?) and from tao. the atmosphere is very modern, hip, trendy.  the server we had was awsome. she was very attentive to a larger group (we had 12 peeps) and patient with us.\n\non to the food: i had the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> appetizer,  \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" burger with shoestring fries and \"midas touch\" beer. the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> were good, they bread and deep fried a regular size pickle that is sliced lengh-wise with <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> ass dipping sauce (forgot what it was called). burger = i had mine done medium, and it came out perfectly with t-l-o (tomato-lettuce-onions) you really can't describe in words how good this gourmet hamburger was other than to say, its on my list of top 3 hamburgers i've eaten. i really wanted to limit what other ingredients that made up the hamburger itself.  i wanted to taste the kobe beef, and yes, please believe, all thats been said about kobe beef.  the house made bread, i think, was the perfect ingredient to the hamburger, it was fresh, not too \"doughy\". the shoestring fries was \"eehh\" only thing that saved the fries was the dipping sauce i had leftover from the appetizer. it was more of an afterthought.\n\nbeer = i could have gotten another one of these, its made by dogfish and it was really good. it really complimented my meal. \n\nnext time i'm in sin city, i will make it a point to make another stop here", 
            "i've been dying to try this place since the cosmopolitan opened and i really wanted to love it.  but it was just okay.\n\nthe prices were a little crazy.  i know it's the strip, but $11 for a dogfish head beer??  $11 for a drunken milkshake is one thing but the beer situation is crazy.  speaking of drunken milkshakes, i tried the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> milkshake.  it's basically a huge milkshake with banana, reese's cups and frangelico.  was sooo good!  what was not so good is the massive gut ache i got shortly after eating it but that could be on me.\n\nthe <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> i ordered as an appetizer were pretty good and i have high standards being from the place which claims to have invented the frickled pickle.  the lobster roll i ordered, in addition to being kind of bland and all mayo, consisted of two teeny buns and were definitely not worth the $18 price tag.  for $55 before tip, i can think of many other places i would rather go.  i have seen reference to some popcorn in other reviews but i didn't see this while there.  overall, very underwhelming, but i still may give it another try.", 
            "hubby & i decided to try this place after a movie last night... and the major failing was a lack of wheelchairs to take us out of there after we totally stuffed ourselves.\n\nhubby got a loaded shake, the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>... it was supposed to be a banana/peanut butter/chocolate shake but no banana flavoring was detected.  he said it was still excellent, just not what he thought he was ordering.\n\nappetizers... we got the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>, which were very good... and the fried green tomatoes, which were extremely excellent.\n\ni got the mini-buns with the asian pork belly, which i loved, and a side order of fries (ridiculous quantity, but good).  hubby got the korean bull-gogi burger, and it was fantastic.\n\none of the rare places where a medium burger is actually cooked to medium instead of well done.\n\ningredients were fresh, food was excellent.. they even make their own mayonnaise & ketchup (udder sauce) in house.\n\nwe will definitely be returning to sample more items.. oh, and they gave us a 15% off locals discount, which we hadn't expected.. very nice!", 
            "i love, love the kobe beef burger.... in my opinion i take off the fried avocado and add a friend egg.  super good!!!  i'm bummed that they took the duck fat fries off the menu, tried them there for the first time and they were delicious.  for an appetizers you must try to <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>.  yummy!!!!", 
            "deeeeelish! but you may feel too bloated, too sluggish, too lardy to be productive. but you'll feel very satisfied you had a yummy meal. (though, at $76 for lunch, we could have done without a few dishes. more on that later.)\n\nmy husband and i went on a sunday morning at 11:05 after they first opened for the day. we got seated right away at a table near the flat screens to watch the games, but within 10 or 15 minutes, the place was jam packed with diners. \n\nhere's a rundown of what we ordered: all very well executed, though would have benefitted from a few minor changes. fun novelty items too. \n\n1. <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>: loved this preparation, because these <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> are spears, not chips that fall apart and taste nothing like a pickle. this gives each bite a nice tang. flavorful sauce condiment and nice touch to have sliced meats on the side. also came with fried olives ad fried capers...though the capers were kinda dried and tasteless. \n\n2. crispy pork belly bun : steamed mantou type buns (two mini sized) and two large chunks of crispy pork belly and hoisin. very, very good,  i've had variations of this dish many times, and this one is nice. very fatty, very crisp and flavorful. though. i'd appreciate more cilantro, and some acid to cut through the fat. \n\n3. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger: juicy and hot, slathered in sauce, kimchi and a <mark>Fried Egg</mark>...get your napkins! just get is. that's all i have to say about this one. \n\n4. tenderloin rossini: pork tend loin sliders with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> (sp? i dunk, i dot eat enlarged duck liver...is that right, very often!) was good...but as always with tenderloin, desperately needed some fat. came with house made chips, but would have preferred fries or rings. \n\n5. cake lollypop, nitrogen merangues, (sp?) push pop: strawberry cheesecake lollypop was delicious, dipped in white chocolate and had a small strawberry gel disc on top. the nitro meringue (sp?) is bubblegum flavored, and  tiny, but prepared tableside and more for show than anything. blow smoke for 30 seconds and impress your friends! for $2 it's a fun way to end a meal. the push pop...overrated. nice novelty, but the sorbet is hard and makes it difficult to eat. cute concept though. \n\nservice rocked. glasses always full, plates cleared as soon as we were finished. warm environment, creative menu items. would hit up again...and would try the long list of milkshakes!", 
            "burgers, shakes, and more burgers....\n\nfirst being a popcorn lover, you can only imagine my excitement when the waitress dropped off some complimentary cheddar popcorn to start our meal! \n\nbasically this place is the biz for its gourmet burgers and alcoholic shakes.  i went here twice in one day, that's how much i liked <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and shakes.  there's other stuff like truffle lobster mac n cheese and interesting snacks like pizza \"twinkies\", <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>, fried green tomatoes and kalbi beef with kimchee quesadillas.  they also have sliders as well.  i'll def. be back to try these.\n\ni had the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> shake and a taste of my friend's <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake....both sooooo gooooood!  \n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>- juicy meat and i surprisingly liked the combination.  \nkorean \"bull\"gogi- juicy meat, i liked the flavor of this.  if you like bulgogi, you'll love this.\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark>- so i thought this was kinda dry, plus i\"m not really into goat cheese so i didn't like it as much.  but my bro loved it.\nburgers were pretty decent in size, i was stuffed after one and the guys were satisfied after theirs.  burgers also come with a choice of shoestring fries or steak cut fries, both were deelish. \nthey also have a pretty decent stocked bar and a selection of beer that my fiance enjoyed.\n\nthese gourmet burgers are pricey, 13-17.5 bucks.  shakes are around 11 bucks.  but it's vegas and the food was great, so in that case i didn't mind!  i recommend checking this place out if you're in the mood for some tasty burgers and shakes...", 
            "read the menu online and had heard a lot of good things about this spot, so i figured i check it out.  plus anywhere that offers <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> on their menu gets a thumbs up from me.  i ordered the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>, a chocolate shake and a <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger.  <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>.....meh.  it had great texture, but i was looking for a slightly saltier finish.  the herb-caper mayo was really good though.  the chocolate shake, although a bit expensive, was good.  the valrhona pearls were a nice textural touch.  and now to the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger.  i loved the texture of the bun and my burger was cooked perfectly.  the arugula was great balance to the sweetness of the tomato confit.  the flavor of the beef really stood out.  the shoe string fries were very good too with great crunch.  very well executed burger.....expensive......but good", 
            "let me start off by saying that i can't wait to come back here. i love all the starters and tiny buns - oh and lets not forget about the milkshakes! okay okay - i am getting ahead of myself..let's start at the beginning.\n\ni came here with a co-worker and we decided to get a bunch of plates to share. we had the following (listed in order by favorite):\n\n1-lobster mac & cheese - lump chunks of lobster in a decant creamy mac and cheese sauce. my mouth is watering just thinking about it.\n\n2 - pizza twinkie - mozzarella cheese and pepperoni in a twinkie type of dough - deep fried with tomato dipping sauce. grown up pizza rolls - yum!\n\n3 - <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> - nothing more to say - they speak for themselves.\n\n4 - lobster filet tiny bun - two tiny burgers that are made with filet mignon and topped with lobster. \n\n5 - blue cheese kettle chips with french onion dip - these were a bit average. would not get these again. i could have bough the chip and made the onion dip at home for the same or less price.\n\nwe then moved on to the best part...the huge milk shakes (\ni couldn't even finish it and i love me some ice cream :-) try to oreo or pumpkin - out of this world delicious!!", 
            "a bit of yelp research led us to have a late lunch at holsteins during our trip, and we were definitely not disappointed.\n\nit was a monday afternoon, around 2pm, so it wasn't too busy. we chose to sit in the lounge and i was surprised that our service was much better than foursquare told me it would be - our waitress was quick with menus and water, and our food came out of the kitchen at a pretty standard speed.\n\nwe started with a <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> and a black cow. my bf is notoriously picky about milkshakes, and claims that the monkey is the best milkshake he's ever had. i doubled checked because that seemed like a big claim for him, but he stood by it. both shakes were really delicious, and my black cow didn't seem too boozy, but it must've had plenty of that cherry vodka, because i could taste cherry pretty well. the menu seems to have been adjusted from the one on their website, i think a few of the shakes were different but not the ones we wanted, so it didn't really bother me.\n\nwe also ordered the pizza twinkies - it was either that or <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>, but we can get those everywhere in florida, so we went with what would be more unique. they were really yummy, and the marinara dipping sauce was also delicious.\n\nburger-wise, i had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and the bf had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, both cooked medium. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> did not disappoint from the rave reviews online - their teriyaki sauce was freakishly delicious,  and the spicy mayo was just the right amount of spicy (the two mixed together were amaaaazing on my fries). the avocado was a little unwieldy, and i would have preferred a few thin slices. i didn't think the avocado needed to be tempura'd, either, but i guess i get the appeal.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was almost completely devoured by the time i got a bite, so i guess he enjoyed it. both the shoestring and the steak fries were awesome, i couldn't stop eating either of them. super crispy and delicious.\n\ni can't think of any reason to give holsteins less than 5 stars besides the price (a bit high for burgers but honestly reasonable for the strip) and the fact that there isn't one in orlando.", 
            "this was my third time here. \n\nthe service was not like it was before. our server had too many tables and wasn't able to properly serve. \n\nthe <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> are amazing!\n\none thing that i really dislike are the buns. they seem very cheap and store bought, definitely not fresh. i would love to have a few different bun options, such as wheat or sour dough. \n\nfor a $50 lunch before tip i feel a little short changed.", 
            "the best <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> we've found!! they come with some fried olives and capers too. the greek burger with lamb and fetta is to die for as well as the little brat's with the best unground mustard i've ever had. exellent selection of beers too!!", 
            "this past monday my gfs and i dined here for the first time... everything tasted amazing, the service was excellent. mike sanchez was our server and super friendly, prompt, made great suggestions on what to order.. let me say, the lobster mac n cheese, <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>, calamari, urth burger with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and a <mark>Captain Hook</mark> burger with a salad was what we all shared and it was superb... everything had amazing flavor, very addicting.. if you're looking for drinks, try a strong rita... jalapeno infused tequila drink very tasty, not too sweet, my girlfriend ordered a shake which i've been told are the best.. the atmosphere is comfortable, nice, welcoming, and fun. i'd definitely visit this place again.. it was very convenient to dine here before we went to marquee..",

            "very disappointing.\n\nour group came here starving and we were all very excited. not only did everything look good on the menu, but it was highly rated on yelp, and our waitress spoke highly of several dishes. \n\nwe ordered a bunch of things: calamari, lobster truffle mac & cheese, fried pickle, and several burgers. the majority of the group ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, because it was the most popular and it won \"best burger in vegas\" 2 years and i ordered the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>.\n\nunfortunately, only the calamari was good amongst the starters. the lobster truffle mac & cheese was not cheesy at all and lacking in flavor, the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> were okay and i've definitely had better. i did enjoy the calamari though. it was fried perfectly so it was crispy and i loved the spicy kick in the tomato sauce.\n\nnow, for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. wow. what a major disappointment. we all ordered our burgers medium rare and medium, but they were all overcooked to well done and it was so burnt that all you could taste was the smoky flavors of the charcoal. definite plus that the patties are grilled over charcoal and has a smoky flavor, but the whole thing is not supposed to taste overly smoky! the taste was so overpowering that we couldn't taste anything else on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and all of us were poking at our patties and extremely annoyed.\n\ni definitely do not recommend dining here especially since it's overpriced and not very tasty.",

            "well, just a few days ago i learned that holsteins prepares a damn fine burger--and a superior chocolate shake!  after being escorted to a comfortable corner booth, we began with complimentary freshly popped popcorn.  it was unnecessary but good.  \n\nnext came juicy <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> with a really good caper mayo dressing.  a hot and crisp outer shell encased a scorching hot but very tasty pickle interior that truly satisfied after the breaded spears were dipped in the mellow mayo.  meanwhile, i had a hard time deciding whether i preferred the delicious chocolate milk shake with chocolate syrup or the thick and sweet whipped cream that took up one-fourth of the drink's height.  i even lamented to diane that it was too bad that there wasn't more liquid in the shake until she reminded me that the silver canister set down on the table with the shake contained still more chocolatey fluid (about a quarter of a tall glassful).  and, so it did!    \n\nthen <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fries arrived.  for me, a classic with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, onions, and ketchup was medium rare as ordered, and happily contained no visible char.  there was an excellent grilled taste to the meat, and although the plain bun and solid sheet of green lettuce were not my favorites, there was no question that this was a top-tier burger, and i had no problem finishing off the ample half-pounder, along with the tasty shoestring fries that accompanied it.\n\nmeanwhile, diane clearly enjoyed her medium-rare <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> with kobe beef and cheddar cheese, as well as fulfilling fat fries.  our server was slow in executing what he promised, but was busy with a mostly full house and eventually came through with water refills, extra ketchup, and a salt shaker as hard driving music enveloped the cow-adorned dining room. \n\nit was a nice, filling, and satisfying dinner, which i expect to repeat despite the next day's uptick on the home scale.",

            "i'm surprised by the disparity in reviews.  i guess this means that service and quality of food is not always consistent at holsteins.  however, we went on monday night this week around 630pm.  we were worried there would be a huge wait, but it only took a couple of minutes to get seated.  \n\nwe were pretty hungry so once we were seated we ordered both <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> and <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>.  i've never had <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> and while they were tasty, i don't think its something i would order again.  i liked the crunchy <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>...just lamented that there were so many!  the food runner who brought them out proudly announced that he tried to stack them as high as they could.  really though?  it was lot and there were only 3 of us!  \n\ni had to decide whether i wanted to drink my calories or eat them, and i decided in favor of chewing versus sipping.  i passed on the adult milkshakes, though many of them looked tempting.  i ordered <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger which was really delicious.  piping hot burger, with yummy mushrooms and cheese.  it was a great combination.  everyone else at the table enjoyed their burgers as well.  i ordered <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> with this burger, but seriously?  who could eat that when <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> filled you up!  \n\nthis is a really great little spot and  although you pay more than you would for an average burger, we all felt this was way above the average.  definitely worth the money and experience.  give it a try!  it's on my repeat list for my next vegas visit in october.", 
            "i had to write an update to my review of holstein's because it was even better the second time around!  everything from start to finish was amazing, and we ordered a lot of stuff.  even the complimentary popcorn tasted great and was not as over saturated with oil as my first visit here.  what really stole the show for me though was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger.  it was the best thing that i ate in vegas during my most recent visit, and i am salivating just thinking about it as i write this review.  i also shared sides of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, and <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> with my wife, and i loved them all.  i was so glad that we came back to eat at holstein's again when we were in las vegas, because it was my favorite meal of our trip.  i can't wait to come back here again soon!", 
            "i really had high hopes for this place, as its highly rated here as well as some magazines and internet articles. we had a very short wait to get in, which was fine....but when we did get in there we tons of tables open so that was a bit weird. didn't really bother me though. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> to start and i then got <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark>. this is a burger i would typically get. my husband guessed that's what i'd order. it just missed the mark for me. it was a little too well done and lacked flavor. \nmy husband got the el machete and really liked it. \n\ni had checked in on four square which gave me a free beer, so i ordered that with my waiter. he ended up forgetting about it, which i really didn't care about it and wasn't going to say anything. when he came back to ask if we wanted dessert he realized he had forgotten it. i said it was fine and didnt need it but he went and got it for me in a to go cup which was really nice of him. \n\ni wrote another review for burgr that we went to the next night. i preferred burgr over holsteins, but i might give them another chance if i'm out here again. \n\nservice was very nice and friendly.", 
            "on the first night of my bachelorette party, my friends and i came back to holstein's for a dinner of burgers and booze.  i repeated some favorites from my first visit - the spicy bloody mary, the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>, <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, and the frozen grasshopper - and all were as remembered.  in fact i'm mostly updating this just to document my bachelorette party in full, so if you want to see a full useful review, please see the original and ignore this post, which is basically for my diary use only.\n\nwe came at around seven o'clock and were told they were so backed up they were turning people away.  we put our name and number down anyway, expecting to wait at least an hour and a half.  i guess a lot of people were discouraged enough to bail, because we were seated after something like forty minutes.\n\nservice was good, polite and moderately quick.  a few of my friends and i use foursquare (sorry, yelp), and we each got a complimentary holstein's spacial (not a typo on my end) lager.  it was tasty, refreshing, and free, and i'm sorry to admit that we were too full to finish them and felt pretty bratty.  we did leave a nice tip.\n\ni did try a couple new things this time around, and i'll just note those here.  <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> (hey, you know that joke, don't you?) was a great burger with a beef patty, roasted portobello, caramelized onion, truffle oil, gruyere, frisee, and aioli.  the mushroom was great, and went really well with the beef.  all the other accompaniments took a back seat, letting the two top players have their day.  for dessert, we supplemented our frozen grasshopper with a <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> shake - smirnoff marshmallow vodka, chocolate, marshmallow, and a graham cracker crumble.  i mean please i will never stock smirnoff marshmallow vodka in my home bar, but it worked here.  the shake tasted like s'mores, and it was delicious.\n\nmy girls got my dinner, for which i am very grateful.  holstein's was fun and full of tasty things, a great start to an epic bachelorette weekend.",

            "we ate there on our first night in vegas for this year's trip.  since we got in late on a wednesday it was close to our hotel and opened late.  we each had an adult shake.  i had the almond joy which was great.  we ordered the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> which were not great they had too much coating and mayo dipping sauce did nothing really to improve the pickles.  i ordered the maine lobster roll. which was just ok.  my companion had the tiramisu shake and a burger.  the lobster roll although not bad i would not recommend as it was mediocre.  legal seafood is far superior for a lobster roll.  my companion said <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was average.  lastly, the service was fairly unmemorable from a girl that was clearly bitter she had to work late.  therefore, in light of all the numerous other burger places in vegas i would not go back to this one.",

            "upon hearing more bad than good reviews regarding this eatery, i decided that it wasn't worth the risk of a potentially bad meal. however, since a large group of us were already on property tonight, it was the best choice for a relatively inexpensive dinner. \n\ni attempted to make a reservation via opentable, but it stated that there were no reservations remaining for the evening. then i called. the hostess explained that they are no longer taking reservations for the evening, but she would be happy to get us a table when we arrived and that there was a \"short\" wait for less than 30 minutes. since we were not physically at the restaurant, we could not put our name on the list. humph. anyway, we get to the restaurant and are given a 30-35 minute wait for our group of nine. a bit longer than i enjoy waiting, but it worked out well - we received our table within 10 minutes (and via text message; very convenient)!\n\nmost of us decided on selections from the \"big buns\" category (good ol' burgers and fries). i had a hard time choosing between a couple of their burgers, but i'm very pleased that our server directed me to their most popular selection - the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" ($17.50). dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli. holy tastebuds. that first bite was euphoric. i can't even describe it, but i'll always remember how i felt - amazing. i was raving to everyone at the table and the two people that tasted my burger affirmed my praise, as well as stating that it was much better than <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> they were eating (memphis burger - very tasty - and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> - shrug). i've had other goat cheese-arugula-tomato burgers and this one does it much better. because the goat cheese is blended with cheddar (haven't quite wrapped my head around this yet lol), it isn't too pungent and all the other flavors were so well balanced. get the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>; medium rare, of course. really, really good.\n\nwith your \"big buns\" order, you have a choice of regular fries, side salad, or a $2 upgrade for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> or thick cut <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. i got their regular fries and they were really tasty and well cooked. i also tried the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> ($9) - perfect dill spears with good crispy exterior, served with an herb-caper mayo - and a strawberry milkshake ($8) - really creamy, delicious strawberry flavor. overall, all the food was great!\n\nour server was really nice and very helpful, however, we received only one visit between receiving our food and finishing our meal, so most of our water glasses weren't refilled. then we found ourselves having to wave our arms for attention. i figured the servers must be overwhelmed, but it seems that the restaurant is always busy and it's as if no one has figured out how to properly handle the capacity of customers.\n\ni'm curious as to why people have been so unhappy with holsteins, but i can guess. based on our experience prior to and during our dinner, i'm sure they have their off days or the service may be even less attentive than it was today. hopefully i won't have to experience any of those things during future visits or even better, that it'll improve!", 
            "this was the first meal i had in vegas when we arrived.  it was amazing! the options are awesome.  i actually got a turkey burger, i think it was called the <mark>California Turkey</mark> burger.  i never eat turkey burgers but it sounded so good.  it was delicious! \n\nfirst off, this burger was huge! the bun was so perfect.  it was light, crispy and had a little bit of a sweet taste to it.  delish! everything was super fresh! the fries, i could have eaten at least 3 servings of them! the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were super good also.  i wish i would have had a milkshake from there, they all sounded so good! \n\nmy cousin got the el machete (sp?) burger.  it was cooked perfectly!!!!after seeing that burger and how it was cooked, made me wish i would have gotten a beef burger, but i wouldn't discourage anyone from getting the turkey burger. \n\nwe also had <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> which were delicious! the aioli sauce they came with was really good and creamy.  it had a different taste to it.  the pickles were super crispy and the batter was seasoned so well! some times friend pickles can be super salty, but these ones were perfect and the batter didn't come off of them after you took a bite! \n\ni highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual, but delicious place to eat on the strip.",

(hard to mess up anything deep fried lol) we swapped out the caper dressing for ranch. but there were other options available. \n\ni ordered the urth burger- the patty itself wasn't the greatest. it was okay as far veggie patties go, but seasoning wise...meh. the toppings were amazing though. the urtha burger came with avocado, sprouts, two slices of tomato, lettuce and cucumber. i added proval<mark>One <mark>Two Dollar Cheese</mark></mark>, but the list if options was pretty good (read: egg, salmon,  brisket, cheeses etc). \n\nmy husband ordered the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> medium, seemed slightly rarer than medium, so order up of your usual. he added and over easy egg toping and found it quite delicious. \n\nservice was good! everyone was friendly and nice about switching menu items (ie gluten free buns for white, cheddar for american etc)", 
            "holstein's is exactly what a \"burger and brew\" fan wants in a meal.  their appetizers are a little pricey, but that's expected at a hotel / strip property, especially the cosmopolitan.  my friend and i opted to go with the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> to start knowing <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> included a heaping portion of meat.  they were a pleasant surprise as they were the full spears instead of the normal \"chip\" format.  the herb-caper mayo really complimented the cornflake-like crust.  the drink menu and beers on tap will satisfy any libation request.  my friend ordered <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and i opted for the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> (protein style aka. lettuce wrap).  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was crusted w/ black pepper, creamy steak sauce, tomato confit, onions, mushrooms and swiss.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> had <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar, tomato confit, arugla and garlic aioli.  overall, both were very tasty, however the kitchen misunderstood medium rare and sent my burger out well done.  i've eaten here over four times and each prior visit i haven't had any issues w/ cooking temperature.  the server was very nice and stopped by a few times during the meal to check in on us as well.  if you're in town looking for a good drink and bite to eat, i would recommend stopping in."

            "i had high hopes for holsteins. i love a good burger, and shakes with booze...yes please!! \n\ni was there with a party of 12, and we were early for our 6pm reservation, but we were told we couldn't be seated until our entire party was there. not a problem, that's not unusual. by the time the majority of our party was there, they seated us. we were all ridiculously hungry, so were excited with the quick appearance of our servers. because of the size of our party, they split our table in half. they attempted to split the bill as well, but we asked it to be kept on one. we quickly ordered some appetizers and waited in anticipation. \n\nlobster corn dogs: good, but not great \n<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>: extremely tasty! \nlobster mac n cheese: i only had a small bite of this, but could have easily eaten a whole plateful! \nphilly steak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> (i think): ehhh \n\nso far so good...i was pleased with the appetizers, and ready for my burger! i kept it simple and ordered a classic cheeseburger, and it was great. i can't complain. i had it with steak fries which were also good. the overall consensus of the group was that the food was good. \n\nso why the 2 stars? while the food was good, maybe even great, the service was terrible. wait, i have to clarify, half of the table's service was terrible. while pete's side of the table got their food right away and with no problems, nicole's side of the table had several problems... \n\n1. <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> girl ordered a classic burger with cheddar cheese, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, bacon, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark> and no tomatoes. what she got was a cheeseburger with tomatoes, no onions, bacon or mushrooms. while i acknowledge this was not nicole's fault, because she read back the order correctly, so someone messed up in the kitchen...what upset me was that by the time she got the right order, the rest of us were almost done eating! and throughout the whole time nicole never came back to give us any kind of updates. \n\n2. someone else ordered a burger (i honestly can't remember which one) with brie and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>. when she got her burger and opened it up, the brie was mostly rind and barely any cheese, so she asked it to be sent back and just asked for cheddar instead. this also took a ridiculous amount of time. \n\n3. someone ordered a beer that never came \n\nduring this time another one of our party decided to say something to the manager, steve. as soon as we said something to him, he brought <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> out. he was very helpful and apologetic, but he messed up too. the second burger was supposed to have <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> and it didn't, we noticed this immediately so the one who ordered it let steve now, he immediately said \"oh no, there are <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> on there, i saw them put them on\" then in what seemed like a scene out of a movie or a cooking competition, she slowly lifted the bun to expose raw onions on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. obviously steve was left a little red in the face. to his credit, he did comp us those two meals, but the ordeal left the majority of us disappointed and upset. <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> girl couldn't even finish half of her burger because she had been so hungry she was left feeling sick and unable to eat. \n\nthe duck fat fries were disappointing, but the shoestring and steak fries were yummy, and i also enjoyed the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. \n\noh and the server (who's name i didn't catch) who was pouring drinks, then \"tying his shoes\" while we talked to the manager...you're not slick dude.  we know you were listening, probably hoping it wasn't you we were complaining about.\n\nwhat is most disappointing, is that the food is good enough for a return visit, but the service alone makes me not want to set foot in the place ever again.", 
            "strike 1: the hostess looked me up and down judgmentally the second i walked up, which felt really welcoming, except the exact opposite. strike 2: i accidentally ordered a bottled beer that turned out to be $16.50 each. my fault for assuming that we don't live in a world where any human pays that much for a bottle of beer. the beer in question costs $9.99 a six pack at whole foods. strike 3: although hubs and i ordered the same thing with no weird substitutions, one of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came with garlic aioli on the side and we had to cut into <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> to discern which was well done and which was medium.  for a $120 dinner i didnt expect to be so annoyed.  the quality of burger was all right; we both had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>. the steak fries were actually seasoned potato wedges. and they were...all right. hated the philly cheese steak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> (not a fan of anything involving cheez whiz). all in all,  i left bummed and whats even sadder, unsurprised. the cosmopolitan needs to hire capable people that care about their jobs, not these vapid robots that look great but can't even get a burger right.", 
            "there are some really fun  fusion food options like kalbi beef & kimchee quesadillas and philly cheesesteak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark>.  you can order a side of bulls balls, an alcohol infused shakes like the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> and pick up strippers at the bar or club right outside the restaurant.  what more do you need in vegas?", 
            "would have been 5 stars but they were lacking in the service department.. lol. \n\nso when you give your name & party number they take your cell phone number so they can call you. which is awesome because you can still mingle in the casino or if you have a longer wait could even go back out to the strip. they told us 25 mins & i believe it was about that long.. wasn't paying attention.\n\nthe restaraunt is huge which is good. they were not that busy at all. it was a friday around 2:30 p.m. buuuuuut for some reason it still took at least 10-15 mins to be greeted & get our drink order taken. then at least another 10 to get our water. and when all your going to order is water.. that suxs sitting there thirsty & waiting!\n\nordered philly cheesesteak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> for an app. very tasty & perfectly cooked. the roll part was more like won ton eggroll wrap not the thick kind of wrap. the 'udder' sauce they serve with it compliments it perfectly!\n\nordered <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> that had coleslaw & bbq pork on it.. yum! forgot to order chesse on it but didn't even notice. ordered it med well & was cooked to perfection. i had a salad as my side & it was great. husband ordered ff.. nothing special.\n\nno room for dessert.. plus it was my bday so had to save room for cake..lol. but we'll be back for their \"boozled\" milkshakes :)", 
            "i have previously professed my vegas burger love for stripburger, but holstein's come in a very respectable second to my favorite burger spot on the strip, if only for the price.  holstein's is a fairly new face on the strip, but it has already far exceeded burger bar and blt burger, among the plethora of other mediocre upscale burger joints on the strip.  \n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are obviously top notch, and the creativity on some of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is really refreshing; more importantly, it's executed perfectly.  there isn't really much else that needs to be said about <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> at holstein's, aside from try as many as possible, because they are all good.  what separates holstein's from the ever growing crowd of burger spots is their appetizers.  the kimchi quesadillas, the philly cheese steak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark>, the incredible pork buns - there is no way to properly describe how good some of these appetizers are.  and the kicker, at least for me, is that they are different.  how many places, especially burger joints, serve kimchi quesadillas? as far as i can tell, not too many.  the incredible creativity that is seen in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> menu is also seen in the appetizers and the rest of the menu - and again, it's all executed flawlessly.  i personally am not a big drinker, but i have tried one of their alcohol infused shakes, and it was delicious as well.  \n\nthe service here is always great, but this place can get slammed in the evenings and the bar can get rather loud, especially if there is a big game on the tvs, so i would definitely recommend this as a lunch destination if possible.  \n\nbottom line: if you're looking to spend a bit of money for a good burger, holstein's should be your go to spot from here on out.", 
            "wow, where do i begin?!?! this place is amazing!!! this was the best hamburger i have ever had! i ordered <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger, added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to it and some yummy cheeses. we had an appetizer of <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> and <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark>, both delicious. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> selection is out of this world!! everyone loved their hamburgers!!!. lots of customization options for the perfect burger. if you order a burger, you have to get one of their shakes. these shakes are phenomenal. they are served both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, and are the perfect match to a great burger. i had the <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> shake, with an extra shot, its vegas after-all and i loved it! atmosphere was very fun and cool. service was excellent. will definitely be going back next time i'm in town.", 
            "shakes are awesome. food sounds very creative, comes out just a bit wanting from the description but was still tasty. just not as tasty as the descriptions sound. philly cheesesteak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> were my favorite, the dipping sauce it came with added a whole other level of flavor.", 
            "this is an ok place.  i probably would have rated it 4 stars based on my first visit but my second visit was disappointing so it evens out to 3 stars.   a word of caution, if you get a hamburger, (i got the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>) be careful as they are hot.  hot enough to burn your mouth.  it's a good burger, the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> are really good but the shakes are just standard - at least my chocolate shake was.   that was my first visit and i would have said it was a 4 star experience.   the second time i got the truffle lobster mac and cheese (almost $17) and the philly <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> ($13).  while the food was good, especially the <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> i felt taken.  the amount of food for almost $30 that you receive was pathetic.  i was completely blown away.  i wish i would have gone elsewhere and had it not been for my first experience here i would have rated this place a 1 star joint.  i would recommend this place if you don't order anything from the nosh menu, unless of course you're just rolling it and don't care to be ripped off.", 
            "ehhh.... it's definitely a unique place with unique menu items that's why i'm even giving 3 stars. the ladies are dressed like hootes girls. a little trashy for the place. \n\nfirst off we got the philly cheese steak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark>. which sound delicious!!! but!  it wasn 15 bucks for 3 rolls with barely any cheesteak inside. it was hard to find any meat. and it was just super fried and bleh. no thanks. \n\n5/10\n\nnext up was <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> shakes!! this was a very clever idea! i like it a lot we got the oreo and bailey's. it tasted amazing. makes you feel like a fatass but it was very very good!\n\n9/10\n\nnow onto the main attraction. the burrrrgerrr. we got the el machette. my thoughts? no. \ndidn't like it  won't eat it again. the bun was cold and that kinda ruined it for the start for me.... i did not love the meat but my girlfriend   did. it wasn't that good. i'm not a huge burger fan but i know when i taste a great burger. this wasn't it unfortunately. \n\nwell not all bad news! the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> are fantastic! perfectly crispy! they are amazing. get them with a drink and bounce hahah that's it. they charged an extra dollar for the chipotle ranch. il stick regular ranch.  don't charge us a buck for chipotle ranch....come on now. include it  \nwell i won't come back! not a fan.", 
            "i thought i had already discovered my burger place in vegas and that was gordon ramsay's burgr and no one could take that place from my heart.\n\nholstein's though, came pretty close. but i think it was my zeal talking more than anything and my weakness for those little moments where a person can feel top of the heap just from buying a meal. \n\nyou see, i had hit it pretty big at roulette and craps the night before and was feeling confident. i knew going in that i wanted that <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>, with its truffle aioli and <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, elements of a burger i know i would never eat anywhere else but on vacation. i did order it. and then some. that burger came medium rare, with additions of aged goat cheese and lobster, heightening an already indulgent, gluttonous, and decadent burger into a whole other realm. it was luscious.\n\nbut like i said, it wasn't fair. i made it luxurious because i willed it. is the law of attraction in action? perhaps. more than likely, though, it was me riding the high of a couple of wins and wanting to eat like a winner.\n\nthe philly cheese steak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> were average. nothing memorable or special.i also had a taste of the bamboozled shakes, the tiramisu and <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>. most gush about <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> but it was too candy-like for me. boyfriend had the memphis burger, which had a layer of pulled pork that he believed might have been crisped up on the flattop beforehand to create a crust. i had a bite and was impressed but really, i only tasted it for the sake of tasting because i refused to part with, even lay down, my obscenely excessive truffle, lobster, foie burger, oh no.\n\nyou had better believe i am still thinking about that burger. late at night, when all the lights are out, i reminisce about the taste of that false luxury.", 
            "after hearing so much about holsteins, i had to try it during my first trip to vegas. i waa not disappointed. i made reservations on open table since i'd heard it can get busy. the restaurant even called that morning to confirm my reservation. pretty impressed considering this is a millennial restaurant. my friend and i arrived at 1pm sharp and were promptly seated. the restaurant has a separate bar area but both have a lively atmosphere. our waiter have us some time to look over the menu, and brought a small bucket of their complimentary popcorn which my friend declared was \"addicting.\" we caught a glimpse of a burger going out to a table and they're huge! way too much for me. our waiter asked if it was our first time dining there. when we said yes he gave us a few suggestions. we took his digestion and decided to split a <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and a lobster roll with regular fries. we also ordered the philly <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark>. in case you hadn't heard, holsteins is known for their milkshakes. i ordered a black and whire, and my friend got a creme bruise. both were amazing. the philly <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> were delicious. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was tasty. tempura avocado won me over. the only disappointment was the lobster roll. it was just ok. not worth the price or the calories. \n\nservice was definitely above average. my water glass was never empty and all of my questions were well answered. plus since i asked for a souvenir or waiter gave me a drink koozy. woohoo! any way i can't wait to go back and try another burger and shake.", 
            "fun place with great food!  we decided to come here before hitting up the club.  the dj was playing hot music and everyone was vibing and having a great time!  me and my crew ate some yummy apps and had some good drinks.  i loved the philly <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> and the steak quesadillas with kimchi.  our sever britney was really cool.  she got us our food and drinks quickly and she had a great personality.  some badly dressed, married dude wandered up to me and my girls and bought us a round of patrone shots!  nice!!  this spot was ideal for people watching as it was right next to the line for marquee nightclub.  the line was packed and watching wasted, scantily clad people is very entertaining.", 
            "my boyfriend and i were looking for a quick bite to eat that would also prove to be tasty and holstein's is definitely all that. \"holstein\" cow pop art adorns the wall and adds to the energy of not only the restaurant but the cosmopolitan as a whole. it truly is my favorite hotel/casino on the strip! \n\n   i was told to try the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> but couldn't really see myself eating it, so i opted for the \"philly\" <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> and <mark>Ahi Poke Tostadas</mark>. the <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark>, although non-traditional, are my new favorite! if i am ever craving a philly cheesesteak i would choose these over a messy sandwich any day! the <mark>Ahi Poke Tostadas</mark> were good, nothing out of this world. the tostada was nice and crispy and the avocado aioli was perfectly portioned for each serving. i am used to fresh-off-the-boat florida seafood so i guess i should give vegas a little slack in that department considering you can't catch tuna in the middle of the desert.\n\n   since i wasn't incredibly hungry i ordered the dulce de leche swirl cheesecake to go. i ended up having this for breakfast the next morning so i most definitely enjoyed the corn flakes garnish. as an added touch, they put the caramel sauce and corn flakes in little side containers so my cheesecake would be fresh and not soggy.  \n\n   i wish i had a bigger appetite so that i could have tried one of their alcoholic milkshakes. i will definitely be back to test one out!",

            "i love this place and the cute cow theme.  they start you off with these yummy flavor packed popcorn.  had the unspiked <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> - chocolate, marshmallow, graham crumble.  pretty sweet!  noshed on some <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> - dill spears with herb-caper mayo.  grazed on some <mark>Greener Pastures</mark> - house organic greens with tomato, cucumber, and avocado tossed in balsamic vinaigrette.  had the tiny buns crispy pork belly bun - asian flavored wrapped in a chinese steamed bun with hoisin sauce, cucumber & pea shoots.  and the big buns <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> - beef patty, roasted portabello, carmelized onion, truffle oil, gruyere, frisee, aioli.  liked everything!  can't wait to come back!", 
            "great experience and the service (charles) is top notch!!! ordered <mark>Greener Pastures</mark> and <mark>Gold Standard</mark>. good standard came out a bit overcooked but otherwise amazing!!!", 
            "good:\n- <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger - the fried avocado in it and the sauce make <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. this was my favorite part of the meal.\n- the <mark>Greener Pastures</mark> salad \n\nokay:\n- lobster mac and cheese - has a strong truffle oil taste, which i love but not worth the $16. didn't have a lot of big chunks of lobster. \n- steak cut fries: not bad, but nothing spectacular"

            "after checking out the cosmo hotel, we went on a hunt for something to eat. most of the restaurants weren't opening until later that day (opening weekend of the hotel) so we didn't have many options.\n\nwe waited a while before being seated, despite the fact that there were numerous open tables and tons of staff just standing around.\n\nit took about 15 minutes before anyone approached us. staff was extremely disorganized, but i'll give that to them since the establishment had hardly been open for a few days.\n\nour food came and it was pretty good, despite the fact that the kitchen didn't get our orders right. my medium well burger was pretty charred and extremely overcooked (well done).\n\nthen, my friend pulled out a hair from her burger!!!!!\n\nwe told one of our waiters (won't even get into the confusion with this), who informed the manager and told us he would speak to us. the manager never approached us. at this point, we were extremely fed up. after the waiter spoke to him again, the manager came to our table, apologized and asked to replace the meal. we ordered our friend a chicken <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> salad and a shake since the poor thing hardly had a quarter of her burger.\n\nour waiter brought out the salad and shake to go along with our bill and informed us that the manager would not exclude the shake from our bill. considering the above events, this was pretty ridiculous. \n\non top of it all, there was no chicken on the salad.\n\nthe end.\n\nwish jose andres new restaurant upstairs was open as this was our first choice. at least we got a glimpse of the chef while we were checking that place out.", 
            "visited this restaurant for the first time for lunch today.  for the table we ordered kalbi beef and kimchee quesadilla, philly cheez steak spring rolls and truffle lobster mac n cheese.  the were all incredibly good.  i had to hold back from eating every last bite on each plate to save room for dinner.  i had the chicken <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which had good size pieces of chicken and a nice little touch of sunflower seeds which was a nice change of pace from your typical caesar.  my friends ordered the cobb salad which looked fantastic and another had a salmon burger which she loved.  beware of the shoe string fries... they are so good that i had to push the bucket away to stop myself from eating them all.  you must try their milkshakes.  they are amazing!\n\noverall i would absolutely come back to this restaurant.  there are so many things on the menu that i would like to try not to mention their alcoholic shakes!", 
            "my husband and i had a pleasant dinner at holsteins. the time estimate for the wait was accurate (about 5-10 mins on a wednesday evening). the server (jonathan) was polite and efficient. we were in a bit of a hurry as we tickets for a show that night, and fortunately the food came out quickly.\n\nwe shared the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> ($12), which the server split into two plates for us, and the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger with steak fries ($17.50), which we split ourselves with the extra plate. (note that medium-well was closer to the medium side for our visit.) everything was tasty, but nothing amazing.",

            "for a burger, it's pretty expensive, but that should be expected when in las vegas. it was a reaaaally good burger, which made the pain of spending $18+ on it hurt just a little less. \n\nservice was average. ordered a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> to share that was painfully below average...stick to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fries. or just fill up on the dangerously good popcorn (crackcorn!) they serve pre-meal. \n\nmy biggest regret was not getting a shake. next time.",

            "we came here because the line for secret pizza was too long. but i very much regret coming here. i was looking for something small so i looked at their \"mini buns\" section. i ended up getting the lobster roll. it came with two small rolls but the bread was cut so shallow that there was barely any fillings. plus i didn't like the taste of it. it was $16.50 which is way too expensive for how small/not tasty it is. my friend ordered a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with grilled chicken. the salad was $12, the chicken was $8. $8 for a small piece of grilled chicken?! are you crazy?!\n\ni'm never coming back here again.",

            "since the cosmopolitan didn't exist last time i was in las vegas, we wanted to check it out and we stumbled upon holstein's, a restaurant that specializes in shakes (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and burgers. it's like the shake shack or good stuff eatery on the east coast. \n\ninstead of bread, there was a medium sized pail of mixed popcorn - bbq cheddar and regular. it was a bit too early for an alcoholic beverage so i got a strawberry malt (which consisted of strawberry ice cream and milk mixed together and topped with whipped cream and strawberry meringue. for starters, we shared a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> (which consisted of purple and green romaine lettuce, croutons, and shaved grana padano cheese tossed in a garlic-parmesan dressing. it was topped with two, small, thinly sliced bread with melted cheese. for entrees, we ordered the following burgers: <mark>Captain Hook</mark> and <mark>California Turkey</mark>. they allow customers to substitute the regular fries for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> or <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> for an additional $2. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were served in a small pail. the <mark>Captain Hook</mark> burger consisted of pan seared salmon cooked to medium and glazed with remoulade sauce, smoked salmon, fricassee, and red colored pickled shallots. the <mark>California Turkey</mark> consisted of turkey party with parsley and spices, sprouts, tomato, avocado, cucumber, thinly shredded coleslaw, pepper jack cheese, and russian dressing.",

            "i stopped in here with a friend while in las vegas in early december. we actually tried to go to the wicked spoon buffet, but it had just shut down to flip over to dinner, so we wound up at holsteins, starving to death!\n\ni had the <mark>Thai Steak Salad</mark>, which is interesting due to it being made with radicchio lettuce, which is a little bit more sour than you would normally expect to see. \n\nthe service was pretty fast and the waitress was extraordinarily accommodating regarding my order for quadruple steak on my salad.  \n\nthe environment is a little noisy but not in a bad way. it's just busy and that's kind of the vibe of the place, very upbeat. having been in enough spots in casinos that are like crypts, this was a welcome change. \n\nit's a little pricey but that's vegas for you...the quality is high enough that you shouldn't be concerned about it.\n\nhonestly i wish now that i had had the fully monty, ordering up a shake and a hamburger. i'll definitely be back here again. and this time i'm ordering a burger!", 
            "we had about a 20 minute wait to get a table, but it was ok. when we did get seated we ordered drinks... my husband had a beer of some kind, which he really liked, and i had an oreo and bailey's milkshake, which was excellent. \n\nfor dinner my husband ordered the big fat greek - a spicy lamb burger. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was excellent. the feta cheese and tatziki sauce paired with the flavors of the meat very well. it was a great burger all-in-all. \n\ni ordered the radicchio <mark>Thai Steak Salad</mark>, and it was quite a disappointment. first off, i've ordered a radicchio salad before, but the radicchio in this one was extremely bitter, so bitter i couldn't eat it. so i called the waiter back and told him it was extremely bitter. he was very obliging and offered to change the radicchio out for some regular greens, which i decided to take him up on. he also mentioned that a lot of patrons do this with the radicchio salad, which made me wonder why he hadn't offered to do this when we ordered, or warned me that the radicchio would be bitter. either way, they changed out my salad for no charge and brought back my steak on a bed of greens. the second thing i did not like in the salad was that the steak was done medium rare, and i like mine well done. i was not asked how i wanted it cooked, and when i asked to have it cooked a little more the waiter apologized and said it would not be possible due to safety regulations. once a dish is plated and brought out to a customer, it cannot be put back in a pan. so i just ate a few bits of the steak. the rest of the salad was ok. the dressing it came with was pretty tasty, but if i go back to holsteins shakes and buns, i'll be sticking to a burger.",

(for further reading: fried butter)\n\nthe <mark>Thai Steak Salad</mark> was barely average: grilled steak, tomato, cucumber, red onion, romaine lettuce, green papaya, mint, cilantro, roasted peanuts, tossed in a sweet-chili vinaigrette. the steak strips were substantial, but completely dry and tough, and i usually expect a sweeter sauce with my \"asian\" salads, but the sweet-chili vinaigrette was more vinaigrette than sweet or chili.\n\nthe regular fries & the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were mediocre at best, but the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were crisp, firm, and delicious.\n\nuseful: everything is super salty. everything. water will get you nowhere. my lips continually shriveled up from beginning to end no matter what i was eating. i was re-applying moisturizing lip balm like it was the air i breathe. i may try to ask for \"less salt\" if i ever go back!",

            "rule no. 1:  don't piss me off before i even get seated.\nrule no. 2:  refer to rule no. 1\n\nfresh from a cosmopolitan event at the yard, their fourth floor pool, with threekindsofrumandmangopuree powerhouse drink in hand, my husband and i descended from up above for a burger at holstein's.  having attended a lot of beautiful, upscale, free functions at the cosmopolitan, making it my favorite casino hotel, it was time to give back and actually patronize and pay for a meal there. \n\nnow i've traveled a good part of the world and most of the united states, and almost always have something drinkable in my hand, usually a starbucks cup but, in a casino it's more likely a glass of wine after i've been gambling for a while.  never, ever, anywhere, have i been told that i can't bring an outside drink in.  this forced me either to leave the drink or chug-a-lug it.  guess what i did?  but i wasn't happy.  the manager, when asked about their policy, was completely lame.  \"we don't want anyone to get drunk.\"  duh, is that why they have a full bar, complete with multiple flat screen tvs showing all manner of sports programs???  \n\nbad beginning.  but i have to tell you that my burger - the <mark>California Turkey</mark> burger - may have been the best turkey burger i've ever eaten.  moist.  perfectly seasoned.  on a bun that was dense, so it didn't turn to mush like at all the other burger joints.  with all the other good stuff, too:  guacamole, pepper jack cheese, a huge tomato slice that was actually red and ripe, and a bit of slaw.  the steak fries were crisp, hot, and stayed hot, probably due to the little metal pail they're served in.\n\nmy husband had brisket burger, a beef burger with a topping of juicy brisket in barbecue sauce.   he loved it.  he also loved his <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, which were presented as one of the four potato options to accompany <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  but he wasn't told that there was a two-buck upcharge for them, which is a no-no in my book.\n\nwe didn't try the shakes, because we were too full from all the drinks and chips we stuffed ourselves with upstairs, but they look great.  \n\nour waitress was efficient, but not all that friendly, until she delivered the check.  then it was all smiles and pr<mark>Best Of Las Vegas (7.2%) NV, USA</mark> thanks.  and we did appreciate the 15% discount for locals, though i'm not sure if it's a regular policy or because we bitched about the drinks.\n\ngiven the quality of the food, we'll definitely go back.  hmmm, if i pour my drink into a starbucks cup, i wonder...", 
            "let me just cut to the chase on this review, do not eat here. i love fine dining and have no problem dropping a good amount of money on a good meal, but i've never had a worse dining experience than at holsteins. with that being said, let me explain myself.\n\ni had been to holsteins once before my nightmare of an experience with them, and had a decent experience, the food was good, but none of the visit was anything noteworthy. on my second visit we came to celebrate a friend's 21st birthday, her having chose the venue. we were all dressed up and went to holsteins sparing no expense and had plans to go to marquee monday after dinner. we were seated promptly, and all was well. we then each ordered several drinks, burgers, appetizers, shakes, you name it, and we were all just getting into our meals when our waiter came to fill our water glasses. as he filled our water glasses he accidentally knocked one over, spilling water onto my meal as well as my friend next to me.  we jumped back, as the water was ice cold and we were surprised. he panicked and then promptly began to mop up the water. as he did so, he leaned heavily on our table and the table toppled over, knocking our drinks and food into my friends lap, as well as mine. my friend was wearing white pants, so their cranberry and vodka and my birthday cake cocktail made their white pants look like a menstrual accident. our waiter went to retrieve some towels, and another staff member tried to bring towels as well. the pants were not salvageable, nor was my barely touched meal. i had ordered a burger and fries, a 13 or 14 dollar cocktail, and an appetizer, all of which were destroyed. i'd only had a sip of my cocktail, less than half of my burger, and just a mere fried pickle before my food was doused with cocktails and spilled into our laps. our waiter apologized, but no solution was offered. no one asked if they could replace our soiled, inedible meals, or offered to cover our portion of the bill.\n\ni work in a company that prides itself on flawless customer service, and was appalled at the response i received. we were handed our bills and nothing more was said. my friend and i were livid! any half decent restaurant manager would have comped our entire party and apologized pr<mark>Best Of Las Vegas (7.2%) NV, USA</mark>, but he didn't even come to see our party and apologize when the waiter informed him of the situation. we payed our bill and i asked the hostess to see the manager. he came out to talk to me and was the epitome of a young, overly confident prick. i recanted the story of what happened at our table and he stared blanky at me until i finished speaking. his exact words were \"i am sorry about the inconvenience, but i saw the whole thing happen, and it was you guys moving the table that caused it.\" \n\nat this point i was seething with rage. i told him that he wasn't even on the restaurant floor when it happened, and that we had completely leaned away from the table witht the initial spill. he just stared at me with glazed eyes, and nodded his head. i then told him that i knew he really didn't care what i was saying and i didn't appreciate him being patronizing rather than showing any form of empathy. words cannot describe how horrific this manager was, and because of his lack of any sense i will never give any of my business to this restaurant ever again. i'm quite frankly floored that such an incredible establishment like the cosmopolitan would allow such people to run one of their restaurants.\n\nall i can say is don't waste your time, the service alone makes this establishment boycott worthy. save your money and eat elsewhere on the strip. i've heard horror stories about strip eateries, but i've never heard or experienced one as ghastly nightmarish as this.  so again, do not eat here.", 
            "this is the 3rd time i've been to holstein's and i have to say it's one of my favorite places on the strip! ;) \n\nthe first two times i had a great experience, and so i will tell you about my 3rd. \n\nmy two friends and i got there about 2pm on saturday and the place was pretty jumping. almost every time we have come it's been jumping so expect a 10-15 minute wait to get seated. we left our name with the cute hostess and  they took our phone number. instead <mark>Best Of Las Vegas (7.2%) NV, USA</mark> those little beeper things, they just text someone's phone in the group when your table is ready. i love technology. \n\nwe waited in the chandelier lounge and had a fire-breathing dragon cocktail while we waited. it was a little pricey, but fun none the less. \n\nwe got seated, and boom-got the complimentary salt & vinegar popcorn to start off and some chilled waters as soon as we sat down. \n\nafter perusing the menu, which seems to get new items every few months, i chose the portabello mushroom burger and the cereal shake (made with 3 scoops vanilla ice cream,1 oz. vanilla vodka,  1/2 cup cap'n crunch cereal (dry),milk, as needed to get desired consistency,whipped cream (for garnish) and a shot of whipped cream vodka i think?) which tasted delicious! the shakes come in standard shake glass and make room for the extra they bring out in the silver shaker-bonus! my friends ordered the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> ($28 -ouch!) and the tiramisu shake-and my other friend ordered the gold medallion burger i think it was? \n\nif your on a budget, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and shakes are just big enough meal\nto split between two people or a couple, in addition to the free salt & vinegar popcorn.\n\nshakes came our first, which are almost a meal in themselves. the last two times i ordered the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> and almondy joy (cause i love chocolate) but decided to try the cereal shake because i love cap'n crunch. i have to say i like the tiramisu over my cereal shake which was super sweet. \n\nwe ordered the lobster mac & cheese which is always good (wish they gave us a larger serving!) and we gobbled that dish down in no time between the 3 of us. \n\nburgers showed up shortly after without a beat. i also ordered a <mark>Fried Egg</mark>  on mine. my meat was moist, the portobello succulent, the avocado delish, and the <mark>Fried Egg</mark> cooked just enough not to run all over the place. this burger is way too big to eat without spilling everywhere so i cut it in half to make it easier. the fries here are not my favorite, but come with meal, the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were pretty good though.\n\nthough my burger was good, i tasted my friends <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> and the aged-kobe beef topped with goose liver (which is why it was expensive) and i have to say her burger was better than mine. don't know if i could justify the extra $12 for it. my other friend who is a big foodie, said his medallion burger was one of the best burgers he's had in a restaurant, and he's a very picky foodie. \n\nall in all another great experience,  i like the hustle and bustle of the place, and all the good looking people in cosmopolitan is never a let down. thought he place is not cheap if your looking for an inexpensive place to eat, it's a fun experience overall and great to get a slight buzz from from a shake!\n\n*note* i went hope and napped after my amazing meal. \n\nhope this helps!\n\ncheers!\n\n~mikeb", 
            "<mark>Holsteins Special Lager (4.8%) <mark>Best Of Las Vegas (7.2%) NV, USA</mark></mark> to be my favorite burger place ever.. until i returned yesterday with my family. \n\nburgers were not as juicy as before and when paying $18 for a burger, i at least expected my fries to be crispy. if i was served those fries from mcdonalds, i would have asked for a replacement.", 
            "review #1000 goes out to holsteins shakes and buns!\n\nthe roommate and i were staying at the cosmopolitan. having to catch a flight a couple hours after we checked out, i wanted to fit one last meal into our trip. thankfully, holsteins was right downstairs!\n\n*holsteins special lager (4.8%) <mark>Holsteins Special Lager (4.8%) <mark>Best Of Las Vegas (7.2%) NV, USA</mark></mark> ($5.50 for 12.5oz)\nhaving a meal without a drink in vegas is weird to me. so of course i ordered a beer. this was super light and easy to drink.\n\n*<mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>: kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, truffle mayo ($32)\nyum! i'm a foie-aholic, so this definitely hit the spot! a huge tender piece of foie topped this beautiful burger. great flavor. the kobe beef also melted in my mouth. i was in heaven.\n\n*<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>: beef patty crusted w/black pepper, greens, creamy steak sauce, tomato, onions, mushrooms, cheese ($18)\nthe roommate's burger. i took a bite. but after eating the kobe beef, this seemed tough. the roommate seemed to enjoy it and finished the whole burger.\n\nso is the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> worth $32?! absolutely! one of best burgers i've had in a while!", 
            "some people only go for half-steins.  not me though.  i say you gotta go holstein's or nothing at all.  i feel light-headed.\n\nfinal verdict: holstein's is pretty good and i enjoyed it.\n\nservice was excellent.  our waiter, [name removed for legal reasons], was always on top of checking up on us and making sure we were enjoying our food.\n\nfood breakdown:\n\n-popcorn: i didn't know you got this automatically, or i would have mentally prepared myself.  it's ok.  it's popcorn...you gotta do reeaaallly well to impress me with popcorn.\n\n-<mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>: good, but a mixed bag.  the first one i had was the prefect onion ring: perfect breading, a clean bite (no strings following you out), and perfectly crispy.  and while two of those never changed, i kept getting strings after that.  not a deal killer, but definitely not \"perfect\" throughout the meal.\n\n-fun-ghi burger: do you get it? fun-ghi?  i...i actually don't get it.  you should probably just call it the fungi burger...save everyone the trouble.  that being said this was honestly, without a doubt, the <mark>Best Of Las Vegas (7.2%) NV, USA</mark> of mushrooms on a burger i have ever had.  it had a delicious earthiness to it.  not my favorite burger of all time, but definitely my favorite mushroom-based burger.  that might sound like a small field...but it is.\n\n-<mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>: it must be for the kobe beef, but i find it funny that a burger with truffle mayo is cheaper than one with potato chips.  it was good, but i wasn't blown away.\n\n-fries: you get a lot of fries.\n\nnow i know everyone is waiting for me to get to the shakes...and by everyone i mean you, dale...but we didn't get one.\n\nfirst off, the regular, non-alcoholic shakes were basic and didn't seem worth the time.  second, i looked over the menu for the alcoholic shakes and every time i read the ingredient list all i could think about was the taste of straight alcohol and i lost my appetite for a shake.  is that my fault?  sure.  should i have even mentioned all this?  who's to say?  you?  i don't think so.  you don't own me.\n\nwill i be back?  perhaps.  i enjoyed it, though i wouldn't wait in a long line for it.  they just opened one nearby my house, though that one is just getting slammed for poor service so i don't know.\n\nalso, whoever did the art for the walls either worked for disney or learned a bit from their style.  i saw the 3-oval trick for the eyes, which works so well it's insane."

            "the big fat greek lamburger has an unfrotunately cutesy name, but an awesome flavor. most of the fancy burgers run about 14 bucks and <mark>The Classic</mark> burger is 11 bucks. prices are not too unusual for a fancy strip burger joint. my wife loved her burger too. we will be going back sometime in the future.", 
            "our first interaction in holsteins came via our douche-tastic waiter who, upon our sitting, proclaimed, \"hey! what's up???!\" my english boss, with his best sarcastic manners, responded, \"well, hello?\"\n\nthough i didn't catch his name, waiter-man-boy was annoying and slow. he never brought the promised samples of beer, proclaimed boddingtons (an english bitter) was a white/wit beer and took so long to bring extra cranberry sauce for the sawdust-dry turkey burger i ate, it was long choked down before he reappeared.\n\nbeyond service, the food wasn't substantial, but some in our party loved their burgers.\n\nkettle chips - like any other kettle chip.\nsouthern fried chicken fingers-n-waffles - nice crisp to the chicken, syrup was warm and the waffle was.... well, a waffle.\nnew england turkey - avoid. avoid. avoid. dry like the dessert we were sitting in.\n<mark>The Classic</mark> - juicy and medium-rare.\nthe longhorn - meat-lovers delight.\nduck, duck, goose - rich and hearty.\nkorean 'bull' gogi - the egg was unnecessary and added nothing extra.\n'big fat greek' - creamy and dreamy.\n\nduck fat fries - didn't taste any different than the shoestring fries that came with our burgers.\ntruffle popcorn - tasted like butter with no hint of truffle.\n\nmaybe it's a hit or miss type of place, but one thing's for sure: our party all agreed - the best 'dish' of the evening was the frozen grasshopper alcoholic milk shake. it was smooth mint ice cream with bits of chocolate and a peppermint meringue on top with just enough 'buzz' to make you remember this wasn't your average kid's treat.", 
            "it all started with the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> which pretty much should be my tribal name from now on. hands down the best milkshake i have ever tasted in my life!!! it's malted banana gelato, peanut butter crisps, frangelico and priced at $11. whoever decided to start making alcoholic milkshakes should get a medal. genius. it is the perfect marriage of flavor without being to overpowered by <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>. \n\non to the grub. \nstarters: \nphilly cheez steak spring rolls with udder sauce $11 \nthey were alright, but could have used more seasoning. the meat was tender and the rolls were crisp. i did not enjoy the utter sauce which bares similarities to ketchup, but with more vinegar. \n\nfor the beef and fake beef selections we had: \n<mark>The Classic</mark> with two dollar cheddar (ridiculous) $15 \nurth burger with one dollar swiss $14 \nnew delhi chicken $14 \nall served with shoestring fries and that gross utter sauce. i ordered ranch, of course, and they turned out to be the winner of best potato in a supporting role to compliment the monkey shake. as far as <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> go my burger was ordered medium and came to me very well done. i ate one third of it. the bun was buttery and toasted to perfection and that two dollar cheddar was worth it. the veggie burger was probably my favorite of the three with a strong mushroom taste. pretty good. the chicken burger could have been executed better. the chicken lacked taste and the only saving grace was the apricot-date chutney on top. \n\noverall i will absolutely be back because the cosmopolitan is a good time and that shake has my heart and waistline captive. the menu has tons of creative options that intrigue me such as bull's balls, crispy pork belly bun and duck confit street tacos. i will get the tribe together and give it another go at it!", 
            "02/16/11 dinner: \n\nwithout planning in advance we ended up here. didn't have a burger! instead, had drinks, \"appetizers\" (turned out to be plates bigger than appetizers) and desserts. <mark>The Classic</mark> martini was terrific, i got the gin variety (does no one drink gin in this town?), containing a gin of which i had never heard (\"nolet silver\"?) which was floral and smooth, garnished with pickled shallot. (expecting shallot bulbs on a stick, instead it was shaved in <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> of the glass!) another had a\"bloody mary\", which came \"up\", containing pepper/cilantro infused vodka, which was greatly liked, especially the gigantic shrimp that came with it! food was \"<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>\" (fried dill spears, fried olives, caper berries, prosciutto, salami w/ herb-caper mayo), \"street tacos\" (crispy shells filled w/ shreds of duck confit, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, trufle crema & cranberry relish), \"truffle lobster mac n cheese\" (maine lobster, black truffle & mac in a tallegio-marscapone sauce), and \"bull's balls\" (2 risotto rice balls stuffed with veal, topped with \"tomato fondue\" and a slice of lardo). a very rich, decadent collection of dishes, i thought all were very well done, especially the mac (wow!). the \"bulls' balls\" weren't as good as i had hoped, mostly rice with very little filling, and the lardo kinda lost amongst the strength of the \"tomato foudue\", which was genius. (an angel-hair pasta with that fondue would be crazy good.) the \"street tacos\" were really good but really rich. my fave thing on the \"<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>\" were the fried olives (only 2, we had to fight over those!). ended with a \"stout float\" (guinness, ice cream, oatmeal crumble), very good. after food we had a really wacky concoction: \"johnny apple seed\", consisting of knob creek, honey and apple cider. first of all, the very nice server said it was the first time that it had been ordered since it was added to the menu (!) and second, they had no idea what \"hard cider\" was! we had to explain, there are alcoholic apple ciders out there, was this one of those?, but the answer never came. no matter, it was a nose and throat clearer! ahem! but a great idea, imho. sipping it took about 15 minutes, and well worth it! so overall, i'd say go. now i need to go back for a burger, perhaps that \"duck duck goose\", stuffed with duck confit, duck cracklings & <mark>Foie Gras</mark>! yikes!", 
            "clever. \n\ni really liked this place. to me it was fun. cute and different ideas make this place worth checking out. its not gonna blow your socks off but i think you'll have a good time if you're not too serious about everything. they try  - at being gourmet, hip, boozy, and on-trend - and they do all of that decently.\n\nwe had no issues with service, but it was a monday that we stopped in. so take that for what its worth. nobody was rude to us, our waitress was attentive and everything came out in timely fashion.\n\ndrinks - this is definitely worth 1-2 stars on its own. they make what they call \"adult vitamins\" which are drinks that use vitamin waters as their bases. basically vitamin water plus vodka/gin and some additional fruit juices. i know it sounds like pretty ridiculous but why not?  they were tasty and pleasant drinks after a long day. they were fairly strong. they also offer milk shakes with alcohol...you know you want it!  if i'm ever back at this place, i'll probably try one of these out. \n\nfood - mostly burgers and variations on the concept. they make a good effort at gourmet or fusion-y type burgers - burgers made of duck, lamb, etc. or with various ethinically inspired toppings.  i appreciate the attempt, but i do think that if your place has the name of a type of cow in its name, you should probably offer at least a handful of beef burgers. \n\nanyways, i had the \"classic\" which is a beef patty-based burger with cheese. it was fantastic! perfectly cooked and juicy. the patty itself maybe had a touch more salt than it needed but when eaten with bread, condiments, and toppings its fine.  the bun was nicely toasted and buttery. <mark>The Classic</mark> is your standard burger with lettuce, tomato, mayo, ketchup, and onion.  you can add on varying cheeses or a number of other toppings (<mark>Fried Egg</mark>, bacon, mushrooms, beef brisket, etc). \n\ni like the offerings and variety of flavors and palettes this place can appeal to. the quality of the ingredients is great. the flavors are nice. food and drinks here are made unabashedly. will definitely come back if i'm at the cosmo.", 
            "to be completely honest, my husband and i stopped in for a quick bite to eat, not expecting anything...but what we got was spectacular!  this is the best burger i have ever had!  and the oreo shake with baileys was the icing on the cake to this place.\n\ni had the \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" burger and my hubby had <mark>The Classic</mark> burger.  these burgers are so flavorful, so soft and tender...like no other burger i've had.  my best comparison, frankly, would be in 'n out...but with a little more pizzazz.  they are fresh, juicy, and tasty!  the extra flavors and ingredients they add to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are unconventional ideas, but oh-so delicious!  the prices are spot on for what you get...i don't mind paying $15 for these burgers at all.  for the record, after this place, i'm no longer giving my money to the ruby tuesdays-sorts anymore.  i'd much rather fly to vegas for my next burger!", 
            "had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger made of kobe beef, topped with nori furikake and avocado tempura.  just da bomb!  i rarely order anything other than <mark>The Classic</mark> burger but am so glad i did here.\n\ngotta love a place that has ommegaang on tap.  plus, they serve it in a pint glass - which is kinda dangerous since it's 8.5% abv but hey, i aint complaining.\n\nand don't sleep on those <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>.  \n\nthis place is a bit expensive but no more so than any other places on the strip.  quickly became one of my favorite spots in vegas to eat.",

            "i came here last friday for a friend's birthday (sorta) dinner, and besides the service, which was pretty good for the size of our party, the food didn't seem to be that great. it does sit in a convenient location, since it's across from marquee's entrance.\n\ni guess it might just be that i've had more than enough of my share of burgers the past week, but <mark>The Classic</mark> burger didn't have any real stand out flavor to it.  the steak fries were okay, but not much different from something  you'd get from red robin. \n\nthe only thing that got me interested in the place was their selection of beers. i actually spent more time deciding on what beer i wanted to drink the on what i wanted to eat, probably if i spent more time on deciding what to eat i might've enjoyed it more.  anyway i ordered the red fox stout, and it had someone of a similar taste to guiness but with interesting flavors of what seemed similar to wine.\n\nfrom the other reviews, it's seems like the place has better things to offer, so it's possible that i'd give this place a shot again. but there are other great restaurants in the area, so i wouldn't force myself to eat here if i couldn't decide on anything to eat.", 
            "it's hard to resist a restaurant that offers spiked shakes and gourmet burgers.  my friend june had been to holsteins on an earlier vegas trip and come back raving that it was the one restaurant she'd hit that she wanted to revisit.  i can't tell you how many times i stared drooling at the menu before we went for dinner.\n\nholsteins is in the new and beautiful cosmopolitan hotel, and it's right across from marquee.  we went and got stamped for the marquee before we checked in for dinner, and we ended up missing our reservation (held for fifteen minutes).  the staff was nice about it, though, and it turned out that seating, even for a party of seven, was not a problem.  holsteins is a swanky place, with comfortable booths and a giant pink cow on display.  we had a waiter named chaz, and he was friendly and on his game.\n\nthe drinks were everything i wanted and more.  the spiked milkshakes were absolutely delicious.  the frozen grasshopper came with peppermint meringue, chocolate crunchies, creme de menthe, and van gogh dutch chocolate vodka.  i can't imagine it was terribly boozy, but it was a fabulous milkshake, with full mint chocolate flavor and the perfect thickness.  the little meringue was delightful, and the crunchy chocolate bits added texture to every sip.  the brown cow was also fantastic, an adult <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float made with <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, vanilla ice cream, pop rocks, and charbay tahitian vanilla rum.  it had all the kid-pleasing taste of a great <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, and i can't overstate the fun of pop rocks.  i also tried the bloody mary, without ice cream, but with smirnoff infused with pepper and cilantro, combined with bloody mary mix and garnished with a toothpick bearing an olive and a cocktail shrimp.  i love a good bloody mary, and this was a good one.  it had a heavy spicy flavor but a thin clean texture, and i appreciate food in my drink when appropriate.\n\nour table split three appetizers, and that felt like the right amount.  the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> were easily my favorite, breaded and deep-fried dill spears, olives, and caper berries, served with small sides of prosciutto and salami and an herb-caper mayo for dipping.  these were magical.  the breading was flavorful, crispy, and light, and the pickles oozed their pickly flavor.  i would also recommend the bucket of <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark>, which came with a bleu cheese dip.  nothing fancy, but delicious.  i was disappointed, though, by the truffle lobster mac' n cheese.  the creamy tallegio-mascarpone sauce was more creamy than it was cheesy, making the appetizer more like a macaroni salad.  the maine lobster was barely there, and the black truffle didn't come through.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were very good, though i suspect that the strength may lie in the toppings.  <mark>The Classic</mark> - with just lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, ketchup, and pickles - was the most boring of the bunch, and that doesn't hold true with a remarkable patty.  the patties were definitely tasty, though, with plenty of juice, and they held up well to some fun accompaniments.  my favorite was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>.  with a kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado, it was definitely a loaded gimmick of a fusion burger - but damn if i didn't gobble it down.  the teriyaki was sweet but not cloying, and the salt of the speckles of dried seaweed was great.  the crispy yam gave a welcome crunch, and that strip of avocado tempura was creamy and beautiful.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was also good, a dry-aged beef sirloin burger topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli.  it was less of a stand-out, though, and the tomato confit did not bring on the umami parade i'd hoped for.  if you like lamb burgers, the big fat greek is a good choice.  with greek spiced lamb, feta cream, lettuce, tomato, tzatziki sauce, and red onion and olive relish, it's a little like a greek menu threw up on a burger.  the result, though, is hearty and pretty well done.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> all come with a side of fries, and you have a choice of shoestring, sweet potato, and steak cut.  i prefer my thin fries, and the shoestring and sweet potato were both superb.  holsteins knows its way around a potato - even the steak cut fries were well seasoned and not at all mushy.\n\nwhen we left for marquee we were all stuffed to the brim.  the meal was not cheap - burgers started at $13 and shakes were $11 - but it was a satisfying feast that hardly qualified as a splurge in vegas.  i've had better burgers, but i was impressed by <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, and i doubt i've had better milkshakes.  if you're in vegas hankering for a fattening meal, check holsteins out.",

            "as a burger lover i was really excited to try this place out after having read all the great reviews.  we came a little after noon and were seated promptly, though it started filling up quite a bit after that.  i ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> burger with cheddar cheese and bacon and split the campfire s'mores milkshake with my dining companion.  the shake was delicious and the alcohol taste was very subtle which i did not mind.  it comes with some extra in a tin container and was more than enough for the two of us to share.  i was disappointed though that some of the other shakes i wanted to try were only seasonal.   \n\nas we were waiting i noticed popcorn being brought out to another table twice.  i had to ask for some after seeing that and our server acted surprised that none had been brought out.  hmm, wasn't it his job to do it or at least see to it that we got some and didn't he look at our table and see that we had none?  by the time our popcorn was brought out our burgers came out a minute later, so we didn't get to enjoy too much of the popcorn. \n\nwe were debating as to whether we should split a burger or get our own and in the end we each got our own because from what we could see they looked pretty small.  turned out we actually could have split one and it would have been enough for the two of us.  personally that would have been fine for me because i wasn't too thrilled with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and have definitely had better.  i usually do not mind pickles in my burger but theirs just did not taste good and i had to pick them out.  the other greens in my burger did not taste good either.  to top it all off i asked for my burger to be cooked well done and it came out pink inside.  my burger came with shoestring fries which were ok.  they were super skinny so at the end of the meal it looked like i hadn't even touched them.  \n\nif you are looking for a good burger and fries at the cosmopolitan i highly recommend <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> at commes ca, truly some of the best burgers and fries i've had and for about the same price as what you'd get at holstein's.  come to holstein's for the shakes, but just make sure they currently have the flavor you've been wanting to try.", 
            "my bff and i recently stayed at the cosmo and visited holsteins twice. here's how it went for us:\n\nday one - bff had just finished running the las vegas rock 'n' roll marathon, so we were in no mood to be messing around. vegas was crazy-crowded, and we had no reservations, so we expected to wait quite some time. i was pleasantly surprised when our beeper went off after only 15 minutes.  i started with an absolut dirty martini (the best way to judge a decent bar), and it was very good!    then i ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> with blue cheese, and had no idea what type of fries to order. i panicked and went with steakcut.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was excellent; big, thick and juicy, with a bun that was just the right size and a good amount of cheese. the fries were good, but nothing spectacular.\n\nday two - bff and i both had some things on the menu that we wanted to try, so back we went.  absolut dirty martini? yes, and though it was a different bartender, it was again excellent. this time we were prepared for an appetizer, and agreed on the pizza twinkies out of sheer curiosity (and a mutual lifelong love of pizza).  they were a revelation; crispy bread surrounding melty cheese with a delicious tomato relish-type dip.  truly great.  then we both ordered a burger. i can't remember the name, but it was a thick burger between a layer of kettle chips and thousand island dressing. it was awesome. we ordered the shoestring fries and were again underwhelmed, so we ordered a side of <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. those. were. excellent.\n\nto summarize, i would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the vicinity. the only thing keeping me from awarding it 5 stars is that i found the service to be rather slow and indifferent. on both nights it took them quite awhile to check in with us once we were seated, and even longer to make sure we were ok once we had our food.",

            "if you're looking for a delicious, mouth-watering, more-badass-than-fast-food burger, come here. they're just done right. i had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> (dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli) and my friend had <mark>The Classic</mark> (lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, ketchup & pickles). some other tempting choices on the menu include the memphis burger, the big fat greek, and <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger. one friend did try the turkey burger and thought it was a tad dry. \n\nhowever, i ordered dry aged beef sirloin in a burger form, cooked medium rare, and it was perfect. it was cooked just right, it was high quality beef, it was flavored well, and the aged goat cheddar and arugula was an interesting combination. i couldn't finish the entire burger, but i certainly tried- and i barely touched my fries (which were good, although perhaps a little salty) in order to eat as much of that wonderful burger patty as i could. the sacrifice was worth it. \n\nwhile <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were fantastic, i also ordered a mixed drink that wasn't great here (we were eating at the bar, so i was a little surprised). and it is extremely loud at night- there was a dj in the middle of the restaurant, and it was almost impossible to hear each other speak or have a conversation. i was texting with the person i was sitting near because we kept misunderstanding each other or having to get awkwardly close to each others' ears in order to be heard. i'm not sure what time the dj starts, and it is very likely my faulty for going to get dinner after 10pm in vegas and expecting anything but a dance club feel :) \n\ni would definitely come back for a burger, preferably earlier in the day when it doesn't have such a club feel, and i'd order a less complicated drink.", 
            "let me start off by saying that my husband disagrees with me, but, i'm just not that into holsteins. sorry.\n\nwent here tuesday late july, seated right away, polite and helpful waitress. ordered mexican car bomb appetizer. those were blow your face off hot. light on the cheese, apparently unseeded jalapenos. \n\nhusband had the steakhouse,  that was okay. i had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, it was meehh. daughter had <mark>The Classic</mark>,  it was mediocre.  baby girl had kids sliders,  no cheese because she's nine years old, wtf? \n\nthe saving grace for holsteins is the shakes, baby girl and i share the strawberry,  magnificent!  chocolate shake was also exquisite. \n\nthe problem, one app, two shakes, three burgers, kids sliders,  $123, $150 with tip. can't do it, sorry. for burgers, i'd rather have in n out (but their shakes are nasty).", 
            "we arrived without a reservation at 8pm on a saturday night and had to wait about 45 minutes. they said they'd text us, so we went down to the casino and did some gambling. 45 minutes later, i received no text, so we went back upstairs and checked in. we were seated after a brief pause, which made me wonder how long i'd be waiting for a text if i didn't go up and check back in.\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> and two of their boozy milkshakes. a coworker recommended i try the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, and they were fantastic. the order came out quick, as did the milkshakes. the milkshakes were awesome, barely a booze taste and worth the price.\n\nour entrees on the other hand took quite a while to arrive. i would guess nearly 30 minutes. the waitress said the kitchen was backed up, but for a burger place on a saturday night i had a hard time believing they weren't prepared for the evening rush.\n\ni had the pork belly sliders which were excellent. if you've had pork buns at a chinese restaurant, they were like that, including the soft bun and the sauce, but crispier and better. they serve 3 to a plate, which was enough for me but i was already getting full from the milkshake and the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>.\n\nmy wife had <mark>The Classic</mark> burger and said it was alright, but nothing extra ordinary. considering it took 30+ minutes to come out, she said it was about as good as she's had at red robin. i had a bite and it was fine, but again i don't think it was anything amazing. it was a decent burger, properly cooked to a medium rare, not exceptionally huge or covered in exotic toppings, and considering the prices in vegas, it was worth the $14.\n\nbest part of the meal was the milkshakes and the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. a word of caution about the milkshakes - they  fill you up! if you finish one it's like eating a huge ice cream sundae with booze on it. they are definitely worth the price.\n\nif i'm gambling at or near the cosmopolitan i'd give the place another try, maybe for lunch. the food was good and the price was right.", 
            "although i absolutely hate the cosmopolitan, i was really happy to find this place. every single time i visit the cosmopolitan i have a horrible experience. whether it's the disgraceful customer service, the trashy clientele, the pathetic excuse for pool attendants-- it all sucks. so when my cousin asked us to meet her and her parents here, i was crazy skeptical. i was honestly just gonna grab a coke and eat somewhere else later. i'm so glad i didn't. i had the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" burger with <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> and it was, by far, the best burger i've ever had. my mom had <mark>The Classic</mark> with regular fries and we both spilt an order of the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> (which were also, the best i've ever had). for both of us the check came out to $63. i would have paid twice that much for a burger of that quality. seriously just amazing. if you love a good in-n-out burger, you'll love this place. they put \"umami burger\" to shame and need to be in a category all to themselves. i can't wait to eat here again.", 
            "after a big night in vegas we needed grease!!! we were craving burgers so we hit this place up, we both ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were huge - they really hit the spot. we also ordered <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> & fries (they come with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>). there was a 25 minute wait but we decided to sit at the bar - my husband ordered a shake and he said it was the best he had ever had.", 
            "oh, holsteins. \n\nlet's see, where do i start? the popcorn. it came out first. it was surprisingly spicy! i love me some spice, but it was kind of an odd flavor. i won't hold this against holsteins since it was a free appetizer. \n\nthe bamboozled milkshakes. these bad boys are 5-star all the way. creamy, huge, delicious. really interesting flavors along with <mark>The Classic</mark>. you could just barely taste <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>- it was perfect. i could taste it, so i knew it was in there, but it didn't ruin or impact the overall flavor. so, so good. \n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> didn't live up to the hype. they were really good, but i expected a life-changing burger, and this just didn't deliver. for the price and the hype i was disappointed. \n\ni'd return in a heartbeat, but i'd just grab a shake and go.", 
            "i had <mark>The Classic</mark> burger which was only a 3 out of 5.  my burger was cold when i got it and the fries were ok.  the other diner in my party had the <mark>El Caliente</mark> burger which was spicy and good- a 4 out of 5 stars.  one problem with this restaurant is that it smells like cigarette smoke from the casino below.  our server was very nice.", 
            "the hosts in the front were snobby, but our waiter was awesome. the decor were trendy, very colorful, with funny and uniquely cute cow paintings. \n\novercooked burgers for $18-35! no thank you. when you ask for a medium burger, you definitely don't mean an overcooked chard patty or dried patties! it is a burger joint, so you would think they would learn how to cook the beef patty by now right? wrong!\n\nwe tried <mark>The Classic</mark>, the typical cheese burger with beef patty, tomato, lettuce, and ketchup; and the caliente, hamburger with jalapenos, avocado, jack cheese, and some cilantro mayo. <mark>The Classic</mark> was so bitter because of the chard on the patty. we did not finish that burger. the caliente's patty was slightly better, but patty was still really overcooked. it was not spicy, even though, it was called hot in spanish. i was not pleased. we order the black and white milkshake and the <mark>Death Valley Black Cherry</mark> soda, which were okay.\n\nbill was around $60 without tip...not worth it. go to a fast food burger joint and you'll get better burgers.", 
            "as far as burger places go, this place is like the upscale casino who want a gourmet of burger place.  located in the cosmopolitan hotel, it's a good place to get burgers, fries, shakes or that stick to your gut feeling food.  we ordered <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark> ( nice), green salad ( basic, but good), <mark>California Turkey</mark> burger ( turkey patty, well flavored, avocado, sprouts, lettuce, onions, i said hold the secret sauce). my husband got <mark>The Classic</mark> which basically is a big burger, he said it was good. our daughters got the sliders and fries, they said they were very good, and shakes ( vanilla for the little, chocolate for the older ) and they said they were thick, sweet and delightful. \nstaff was friendly, fast with service and attentive. decor is like urban graffiti farm, clean and well maintained. for a \"burger place\" it's definitely more on the pricey side,the bill was around $120, but like i said, it's like \"let's all us a gourmet burger place\" in the cosmo, so you're going to pay more.", 
            "i was so excited when my friends came to visit again and stayed at the cosmo. i had bookmarked this place and was eager to bring them since he loves hamburgers. \ni do enjoy a good hamburger (distill, cure burger....drool) and that's what i was hoping for when i ordered <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> over <mark>The Classic</mark>. i didn't care for it. it was too much that didn't come together right for me. <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were above average but not great. maybe, had i ordered <mark>The Classic</mark>, i would have loved it. i'll try again next year when they come back!", 
            "this place was legit. me and the fam came through after some drinks on the strip wanting some grease in our bellies. \n\nwe placed to-go orders (which you place at the bar) and the bartender who assisted us was nice and helpful. \n\ni ended up getting <mark>The Classic</mark> with no mayo and some regular <mark>French Fries</mark>. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was good. it was a bit dry and the amount of ketchup was a bit stingy. lettuce and onions were plentiful and tasted fresh. fries were good and they threw in enough ketchup packets to keep me happy. \n\ni also ordered the chunky monkey adult milkshake. the chunky monkey is the main reason why i'd return. awesome milkshake and i'm really considering going back today to pick up another one. bananas, chocolate, and reese's peanut butter cups. yassss. \n\nother than the dry burger, it was a bit pricey, but hey, it's vegas. go big or go home, right?", 
            "so far i've visited this restaurant twice now while in vegas for an event. i've tried <mark>The Classic</mark> burger, cookies and cream boozie shake, <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. all of the food i've had has tasted really fresh and delicious. the only issue i've encountered is how long you have to wait before being greeted by a waiter/waitress. i understand that they may have other tables but it's a bit irritating when your sitting around waiting for what seems like forever.", 
            "ok .. so i waited a full day before writing this review for holsteins .  it just hit me... awesome burgers.  i tried both <mark>The Classic</mark> burger and a chicken sandwich.  the meat so fresh and juicy... i love spicy food so i asked for jalape\\u00f1os on the side.  it was a great move ..  it gave it the perfect kick .  i am definitely gonna go back one more time before we head back to orlando .  \nif your in vegas , you gotta try this place .. it's at rhe cosmopolitan hotel."

            "meating time.\n\nthere are burgers, and then there are burgers.  holsteins serves one of the best burgers i've ever eaten. and overall i had a positive first time experience enjoying good food with great company.\n\nlocation:  second floor of the cosmopolitan hotel.\n\non my recent trip, i visited holsteins for lunch with two friends, one of whom had previously dined last year.  we decided to meet when they opened, and its a lucky thing as we did since a small line had already formed before their 11am opening.  thank goodness for being early.  in this case, the early diner gets <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.\n\nfood:  there were three of us and collectively we ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, the <mark>California Turkey</mark>, and the big fat greek.  all burgers/sandwiches were served with fries.  i was initially unsure on what to order, but thanks to a glowing recommendation from our server, i decided on their award winning <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger.  \n\nthe <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger is aptly named, and worth its weight in gold for that matter.  this has to be one of the best burgers i have ever had.  this dry aged beef sirloin (<mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic aioli) was prepared well, while the goat cheese didn't bother me that much, though other reviewers have stated otherwise.  i thought all the condiments served complemented <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> well.  my taste buds were quite happy indeed.  the fries, sadly, were just ok in my humble opinion.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was the true shining (gold) star at lunch.\n\nas for my two friends, i believe they enjoyed their burgers too, as evidenced by the nearly spotless plates at the end of the meal.    overall, we all enjoyed our meal/food.\n\nservice:  the hostess was quite friendly and promptly showed us to our table.  the server was a friendly and polite young woman.  she greeted us and took our drink orders.  she also recommended some appetizers and milk shakes, but we all decided to order just burgers and fries.  as previously mentioned, the server made such an enthusiastic endorsement regarding the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, and i thanked her more than once for her recommendation.  she  provided extra napkins, provided drink refills, checked on us periodically throughout the meal.  \n\nbottom line:  great food and great company.  i strongly recommend the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger.", 
            "amazing shakes!\n\nlocated on the second floor of the cosmopolitan, holsteins seems to be the place to eat here.  a friend and i stopped in before a show.  on the weekends they do not take reservations.  good thing it wasn't too busy so we only had to wait about 5 minutes before being seated.  while waiting in their lounge area, it was very very loud.  almost too hard to carry on a conversation with someone sitting right next to me.  i was keeping my fingers a crossed for a quieter dining area.  \n\nmore quiet? not so much.  still a little loud but we powered through.  service wasn't too shabby.  we were checked on frequently during our meal with drinks always refilled. \n\ni tried their <mark>California Turkey</mark> burger with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> had a good flavor with avocado, cucumber slaw, spouts and a russian dressing.  pretty tasty.  the fries were also good but a little too much salt.  \n\namazing shakes... indeed.  i had the <mark>Pecan Turtle Cheesecake</mark> shake.  yum.  cheesecake, pecans, dark chocolate pieces, caramel sauce and stoli salted caramel vodka.  i fell in love.  so good.  \n\nfood was ok for me but i'd definitely come back for a shake any time!", 
            "as far as burger places go, this place is like the upscale casino who want a gourmet of burger place.  located in the cosmopolitan hotel, it's a good place to get burgers, fries, shakes or that stick to your gut feeling food.  we ordered <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark> ( nice), green salad ( basic, but good), <mark>California Turkey</mark> burger ( turkey patty, well flavored, avocado, sprouts, lettuce, onions, i said hold the secret sauce). my husband got <mark>The Classic</mark> which basically is a big burger, he said it was good. our daughters got the sliders and fries, they said they were very good, and shakes ( vanilla for the little, chocolate for the older ) and they said they were thick, sweet and delightful. \nstaff was friendly, fast with service and attentive. decor is like urban graffiti farm, clean and well maintained. for a \"burger place\" it's definitely more on the pricey side,the bill was around $120, but like i said, it's like \"let's all us a gourmet burger place\" in the cosmo, so you're going to pay more.", 
            "holsteins is awesome for a quick bite. if you are staying at marquee east tower, it is literally outside the elevators! they have great burgers of all varieties. i saw that they even had a <mark>Foie Gras</mark> burger! i had the <mark>California Turkey</mark> burger and it was great, pretty straight forward. next time i try this place, i think i will step a little outside my comfort zone and to really experience this place. \n\nthey have an extensive milkshake menu if you like milk shakes, i love milkshakes. oddly enough, they are all adult milkshakes infused with alcohol because why not?! its vegas! i chose the <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> vodka milk shake and i could hardly taste the vodka. it came garnished with a red velvet macaroon cookie. a+", 
            "i've had holstein's bookmarked for at least 2 years now. i finally got the chance to try it and it just doesn't live up to the hype! we came in at around 9pm and there was still a wait for a table for 2 so we just sat at the bar. \n\nour bartender/server was great! super knowledgeable and friendly. so convincing that i changed my order from the <mark>California Turkey</mark> to <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado - sub for turkey patty + add <mark>Fried Egg</mark>). the terikyaki glaze isn't so much a glaze - it's goopy and way too sweet. thus, i couldn't even drown it in ketchup. if you love the taste of beef jerky, you'll like this burger! but if you're like me and don't really like sweet in my savory, peh. \n\ni didn't have their boozy milkshakes but i wasn't too interested."

            "i had high hopes for holsteins. i love a good burger, and shakes with booze...yes please!! \n\ni was there with a party of 12, and we were early for our 6pm reservation, but we were told we couldn't be seated until our entire party was there. not a problem, that's not unusual. by the time the majority of our party was there, they seated us. we were all ridiculously hungry, so were excited with the quick appearance of our servers. because of the size of our party, they split our table in half. they attempted to split the bill as well, but we asked it to be kept on one. we quickly ordered some appetizers and waited in anticipation. \n\nlobster corn dogs: good, but not great \n<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>: extremely tasty! \nlobster mac n cheese: i only had a small bite of this, but could have easily eaten a whole plateful! \nphilly steak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> (i think): ehhh \n\nso far so good...i was pleased with the appetizers, and ready for my burger! i kept it simple and ordered a classic cheeseburger, and it was great. i can't complain. i had it with steak fries which were also good. the overall consensus of the group was that the food was good. \n\nso why the 2 stars? while the food was good, maybe even great, the service was terrible. wait, i have to clarify, half of the table's service was terrible. while pete's side of the table got their food right away and with no problems, nicole's side of the table had several problems... \n\n1. <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> girl ordered a classic burger with cheddar cheese, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, bacon, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark> and no tomatoes. what she got was a cheeseburger with tomatoes, no onions, bacon or mushrooms. while i acknowledge this was not nicole's fault, because she read back the order correctly, so someone messed up in the kitchen...what upset me was that by the time she got the right order, the rest of us were almost done eating! and throughout the whole time nicole never came back to give us any kind of updates. \n\n2. someone else ordered a burger (i honestly can't remember which one) with brie and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>. when she got her burger and opened it up, the brie was mostly rind and barely any cheese, so she asked it to be sent back and just asked for cheddar instead. this also took a ridiculous amount of time. \n\n3. someone ordered a beer that never came \n\nduring this time another one of our party decided to say something to the manager, steve. as soon as we said something to him, he brought <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> out. he was very helpful and apologetic, but he messed up too. the second burger was supposed to have <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> and it didn't, we noticed this immediately so the one who ordered it let steve now, he immediately said \"oh no, there are <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> on there, i saw them put them on\" then in what seemed like a scene out of a movie or a cooking competition, she slowly lifted the bun to expose raw onions on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. obviously steve was left a little red in the face. to his credit, he did comp us those two meals, but the ordeal left the majority of us disappointed and upset. <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> girl couldn't even finish half of her burger because she had been so hungry she was left feeling sick and unable to eat. \n\nthe duck fat fries were disappointing, but the shoestring and steak fries were yummy, and i also enjoyed the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. \n\noh and the server (who's name i didn't catch) who was pouring drinks, then \"tying his shoes\" while we talked to the manager...you're not slick dude.  we know you were listening, probably hoping it wasn't you we were complaining about.\n\nwhat is most disappointing, is that the food is good enough for a return visit, but the service alone makes me not want to set foot in the place ever again.", 
            "out of all the places we experienced this trip to vegas, this was by far the most memorable, happy and delicious dining experience we had! \n   let me just say i'm a huge top chef fan.  also a huge yelper.  so i had done a lot of research before our trip to vegas, and this was on my top 3 list to experience on this adventure.  having been a fan of carlos on top chef (darn those macaroons that did him in), i really wanted to try his restaurant and husband liked the sounds of burgers and shakes.\n   so, early on a monday night, we stepped into holsteins, was greeted warmly and shown to our table.  waitress was quick and friendly.  service could not have been better.  we were brought some bbq popcorn to start (neat touch)...i ordered a glass of wine (sorry, know it should've been a shake, but i knew i could count on husband for that and he did indeed order <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake one).  having eaten at wicked spoon earlier in the day, we opted to share a burger. \n     <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>* / 16.5\nbeef patty crusted with black pepper, \nholsteins creamy steak sauce, marmalade \nonions, tomato confit, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>, swiss cheese.\n\n    i asked that the mushrooms be served on the side for my husband as i don't do mushrooms.  (no problem).  he chose shoestring fries for the side.  \n   i asked the waitress if the \"top chef\" happened to be there on a monday night?  (surely he would not be?)  she said she didn't know but would check.  next thing i know he's not only there but coming out of the kitchen to meet us!  what a delightful friendly guy!  and he informed us that he had hired craig from the same top chef series.  yep.  a little while later carlos came out with craig!  husband took my picture with both of them!  oh my gosh, i'm such a geek, but geez these guys worked their tails off on that show and i so respected them and appreciated them for it.  and now i was not only meeting them but eating their food!  this burger was the best burger i've ever had (sorry bobby flay, you've finally been surpassed).  and fortunately husband's shake made him so full he couldn't finish his half of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> so i got it.  (waitress later told us that it had five scoops of ice cream in it).\n    so, full, dessert was mentioned.  i said we were full but had heard about the donuts.  no they didn't serve them any more except with a particular drink.  i expressed sadness to not be able to try it.  next thing i know, here comes two donut holes, one for each of us, with a cream filling...maple and bacon.  yum yum yum.\n    thank you holsteins for our favorite dining experience on this trip to vegas!  excellent waitress (sorry i can't remember your name), thank you too and carlos and craig, please know you made our trip to vegas this time!", 
            "mmmmm! i went to holsteins on a birthday trip to vegas last weekend based on yelp reviews. as a vegetarian (i eat some fish) i had studied the menu ahead of time to make sure there was enough food for me to eat. i was beyond excited to try <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> shake and was not disappointed one bit, it was the perfect shake/cake combo! wow! my friends tried the peppermint and chocolate banana shakes also and they were all fantastic. i'm not sure there is much booze actually in them but i really wanted it more for the shake factor!\n\nwe ordered some appetizers, i had both the lobster truffle mac and cheese and the calamari, both were excellent. the mac and cheese was amazing, i could have easily ordered that for dinner and been satisfied. \n\nafter the appetizers i should have called it quits (i was full enough and extremely satisfied) but i decided to order the vegan burger and shoestring fries, the vegan burger was good, piles of avocado on top which i love but the patty wasn't anything special. i've had better vegan patties.....the avocado though was awesome. the fries were cooked perfectly also. \n\nmy boyfriend and mom both had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> n turf sliders, i did not try these but both of them said they are well worth the price tag.....\n\noverall the prices were decent for vegas, not too expensive and definitely enough food to fill us up for dinner. i definitely recommend the restaurant!!",

            "las vegas burger mission part 3 took place just a couple weeks ago, and my travel companion and i decided on holstein's. it did not disappoint one bit.\n\nright out of the gate, things were looking good....we found the place in the cosmopolitan hotel easily, we were seated without a wait (it was a late tuesday afternoon), and our waiter looked like jared leto. i like jared leto. sweet. \n\ni decided to go with a black and white shake (like jerry seinfeld's black and white cookie, but in milkshake form, and it didn't make me puke) and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger. if i ever go back to holstein's, i might have to get the same thing...i loved both. i particularly got into the tempura avocado on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. my pal got <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake shake, which had cake flavored vodka in it. let me just say this....the person who invented cake flavored vodka deserves some sort of a nobel prize, and my friend who decided her life's problems could be washed away with a combination of ice cream and booze deserves some sort of a prize as well....because that's just awesome. and surely explains in part why we have been pals since 1975. anyway, she enjoyed her burger and shake as much as i enjoyed mine. \n\nburgers come with fries....nice that you don't have to order them (and pay for them) separately. we were both disappointed in the fries at burgr, so the fry test here was paramount....alas, great fries. big sigh of relief. \n\nto top it off, jared leto was the perfect server and took good care of us. oh hell, give him a prize, too...maybe an oscar.\n\nif you're looking to try one of the many burger places on the strip, be sure to consider holstein's. and say hi to jared for me.", 
            "over thousand reviews later what could i add?? well i will give it a go!! in the world of gourmet burgers whether on the strip or venture outside no shortage of quality spots get your burger on...most part hit all of them exception of umami or guy fieri. the thing that stood out the most for me is the atmosphere at holsteins shakes and buns. it just screams good vibes, family atmosphere (between pasture and pastures of cows everywhere you look) cartoon characters interior decor, and far cry from all the other restaurants in the cosmo. the prices are reasonable price or should say same like most of the other \"gourmet\" burger places $12-15. they do have the over the top foi gras burgers that not reasonable price. \n\ni came to holsteins for recovery volunteer meal after working the rnr marathon with family. after seeing over 40,000 runners working hard that makes anyone hungry. thankfully we had reservations cause anything on the strip on rnr day is madhouse. just made even more impression that the service we had was awesome. the restaurant literally had no empty tables. yet out waiter was very much on it! he did great job explaining the menu for couple first timers like me. very attentive once we got our food making sure our glass never empty and checking see if everything was good. we even split the bill with different credit cards but never complain and still had smile at the end of the night.\n\ni ordered <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. it was really good. i was leaning towards some of the main stay popular choices. the more keep looking at <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> not get off it. their steak house sauce combine with tomato confit, cheese, and more just working out in my head delicious. i got my burger first impression was looks like dam good burger. sorry about no picture. i was starving going full volunteer shift my choice no break. it was the perfect recovery meal. the size is nice. it not tiny nor over the top huge burger. all <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> comes with choice of side. free side that worth star by itself considering most of the other gourmet burgers spots just paying for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was cooked perfect medium just liked i ordered. the flavors was the perfect combination. think of it as pepper crusted steak with creamy a1 sauce. ok. it might not be doing it justice but just giving you idea. \n\nif not in the mood for burgers they got you covered from salmon burger (looking good also), veggie burger, or turkey burger. the shakes got to see <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake (think that was it). i passed on the shakes. talk about list! am sure if shake fan they got you covered. \n\njust for the 808. the cows reminded me of meadow gold taking the tour in 808. cartoon character cows forget the name of two??", 
            "this review will be based only on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. \n\nsince christmas day basically consists of my mom and my boyfriend, we decided to spend some time walking on the strip and grab lunch at holsteins.\n\ni ordered <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> ($16) which was ok - not terrible, but not something i'd order again either. it was a chicken breast burger with kettle chips (more like kettle crumbs), a pickled shallot (? .. it was something pink), lettuce, and tomato. in the description it listed garlic aioli which is why i leaned towards ordering that item, but i honestly really couldn't depict it in my bites.\n\nmi madre went with <mark>Captain Hook</mark> ($17) - a salmon burger with lettuce, tomato, the pickled pink stuff, and smoked salmon. that was much more worth the money and if i ever paid a visit again, that's probably what i would order. the salmon wasn't dry and the smoked salmon actually complemented very will with the grilled salmon filet, giving <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> a strong salmon kick.\n\nmy boyfriend went with the big fat greek ($17) - a burger basically with all the ingredients you'd find at a greek restaurant like lamb, feta, lettuce, tomato, and tatziki. that was pretty tasty as well if you don't mind a hint of gaminess from the lamb. <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> quite enjoyed it but said it didn't hit the spot like he hoped.\n\nthere were definitely other options i would've been keen on trying but the average pricing was $18 for all other types of burgers and i just don't care that much about burgers to spend close to $20. all comes with a small personal-sized bucket of fries or you could sub it for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> or <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> for an extra $2.\n\nthe bill came out to be $70 after taxes and tip... that's pretty rough in my opinion but i guess i shouldn't expect any less from restaurants on the strip. \n\nwould i come here again? sure if my out-of-town friends dragged me. as for the shakes, i think they are definitely worth a try since some of the concoctions are pretty interesting and unique (not to mention it also includes liquor) if you don't mind spending the extra $13. as for me, a non-drinker, i'll just stick to off-strip joints for any burger cravings...", 
            "both delicious and affordable! its about $16-20 a plate (all <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> come with fries as well). \n\ni got <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> (i think that's what it was called) which was the chicken burger. it had candied shallots, garlic aioli, cheese, lettuce and kettle chips. i ended up scraping the candied shallots off because i didn't like them much but everything else was spot on! \n\nmy favorite part, however, was the <mark>French Fries</mark>. absolutely delicious. they didn't taste like fake packaged potatoes you get at a lot of other places and the serving size was good! \n\nthe service was good, i don't know our waitress' name but she was fast and attentive. \n\ncons: \n\nthe food took quite long to come out. but i will also mention that it was saturday night, it didn't seem too busy to me but hey this could've been why. this was the main reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars. \n\nthe shakes are overpriced. $9 for a basic shake. \n\nthe popcorn they gave didn't really have a taste, but hey it was free so can't really complain there. \n\noverall, good experience here. i would recommend this place when you don't want a big buffet but want a good meal. you'll leave here full for less than $20 if you don't add on any extras!", 
            "great place! \n\ni love the atmosphere of this restaurant. it's fun, vibrant, and full of energy. the artwork is pretty fun to look at, and the service was good. \n\ni came here for my 23rd birthday with some friends. they definitely need to organize their waiting lines better though. the was some confusion because the menu was right in front of the hostess desk,and people were crowding around it. i waited for 15 min behind these people, thinking it was a line, but no, they were just crowding and didn't bother to say anything though they all saw us standing there. \n\nanyway, food was great! i ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger and <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake bamboozle shake. i'm not a big fan of bacon on my burgers, but damn, that burger was /amazing/. it was juicy and cooked to by perfection. the buns were soft, warm, and buttered generously. my friend ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. he doesn't even like burgers much (and came for the alcoholic shakes haha), but he just ate everything and proclaimed it all delicious. \n\nthe shake actually tasted like birthday cake and gave me a mild buzz. they also give you the shaker it was made in, so it's pretty much two shakes for the price of one. friends ordered maple bacon shake and smores shake. the maple bacon had pieces of chocolate-covered bacon in it, which was strangely delicious. smores tasted exactly like smores. i wish i had the stomach for dessert because everything they had on menu looked great. i'm definitely coming back here, so i'll make sure to order some next time. \n\nconclusion: definitely try this place out! prices are reasonable for what you get, and food is delicious!", 
            "holsteins is a good place inside of the cosmopolitan hotel. they serve milkshakes with or without alcohol in them. i've had the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake and <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake shake and they are both really good. \n\nfor appetizers i've had the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and turf quesadilla. but on my last visit <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and turf quesadilla was no longer on the menu. the lobster mac and cheese is really good too. \n\nmy favorite burger here is <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. it's so good and topped with teriyaki sauce, crispy sweet potato strings and tempura avocado. the flavors come together nicely. i've also tried the <mark>Captain Hook</mark> sandwich which is salmon with a remoulade sauce and that is really good too. both the fries and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> here are good. \n\ngood atmosphere and great food. service can be a little slow but they are always busy so it's understandable.", 
            "sat at the bar as i was traveling alone on business.  since i asked to be seated at the bar, i was seated immediately.  i had <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake milkshake and <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger. both were very very good. as someone originally from wi, i like to think i know my burgers and shakes. the shake was very rich and creamy, and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was delicious. the service was also very quick and the bartender was very kind. \n\nmy one complaint is that the fries really aren't so great, but i didn't have room in my stomach for them anyway.", 
            "have gone to this place for my last 2 vegas trips & i'm not going to lie, i'll probably come again on my next vegas trip.\n\ni've only gone to holstein's during lunch time and both times i got seated right away with a party of 4 & 5.\n\nthey always give you a bucket of popcorn that is nicely seasoned (& just a tad addicting)! for milkshakes, i have tried their birthday cake, smores, nutella crunch & they are all super delicious. you don't taste any alcohol at all in the smores & nutella crunch and only just a little bit in <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake milkshake. out of all the milkshakes i've tried, the smores is one of my top faves as it has graham crackers blended in, a generous amount of chocolate drizzle, and whipped cream with a lot roasted, glazed marshmallow. one thing to also mention about the milkshakes is that the portions are pretty big so i would def recommend sharing it!\n\nfor burgers, i've tried the funghi and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>- both burgers being medium rare. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> can be pretty big in portion as well; for example, the patty for my last burger was bigger than the bun and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was filling enough that i was able to split it in half and eat it the next day. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> is my personal fave since it has tempura <mark>Avocado</mark> in it and crispy yams!\n\noverall, this is a def a place to check out in vegas... esp if you are a burger and shakes fan!",

            "if your friends love burgers, like mine do, this is the perfect place to take them for any special event. a group of us came here for a birthday. we called ahead of time to make a reservation because it was a mid size group and around the holiday season. when we got there, the place was busy, but you could get away without making a reservation.\n\nthe decor is warm, well lit, with splashes of colorful art. \n\nthe server was friendly, attentive when we needed her, and kept her distance while we were celebrating. orders were taken promptly, waters were refilled regularly, and food was brought out in a timely manner.\n\nthe star of this place is the food. the ambiance is nice, but you forget about all that when the food appears. the alcohol milkshakes are amazing. they will definitely satisfy the child and adult within you. we tried four different kind that day. the framboise float was not well balanced. although we love the raspberry cider, it overpowered the vanilla ice cream. on the other hand, the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark>, orange dreamscicle, and the brown cow were delicious. they had enough alcohol to get you feeling good without the constant reminder.\n\nstarting out with the artichoke \"guac\" was unimpressive. in fact, looking back, i cannot remember it as vividly as i do with everything else we ordered.\n\nnow <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are spectacular. if you like it rich, decadent, and everything not good for you then this is the place for you. my group had our burgers family style to share. we got two <mark>Gold Standard</mark>; aged beef, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, goat cheese, greens and aioli. they were delicious. the meat was moist, the saltiness of the cheese and bacon balanced well with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. next was the <mark>Captain Hook</mark>; a salmon filet, greens, pickled shallots, and a caper mayo. the fish was charred and crispy on the outside while moist on the inside and the shallots gave it a nice zing. now this is were we started to go over board and into the heart attack warning zone. the longhorn burger is amazing because it not only has a patty, but stacks on beef brisket, coleslaw. dill pickles, and then slathers it in whiskey bbq sauce. this monster was disgustingly delicious, had my friend panting half way. nothing beats the duck, duck, goose if you are talking about self indulgence. the duck confit and froie gras stuffed patty is ridiculous. when you bite into <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> patty, you are first greeted by mouth watering beef, followed by the creaminess of the duck liver. the blend of all this with the plum sauce is amazing. if you are not a duck or liver fan, avoid this burger because it is ever present throughout. top it all off with a few orders of duck fat fries and you might as well check into the hospital next.", 
            "the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger was excellent as was the <mark>Captain Hook</mark>.  the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were also delicious.  this place may have the best selection of quality beers in the entire state.  the service was fast and our server (alicia) was friendly without making it sound rehearsed.  the manager (steve) came by our table to make sure we were pleased with our meal and tell us a little about the beers.  later he even offered us, and others nearby, a sample of some sort of \"nitrogen meringue\" that was a fun and unique experience.  all-in-all we thoroughly enjoyed our experience at holsteins and will definitely return in the future.", 
            "overall, i think, although slightly pricey, what you get at at holstein's felt worth it. if you price your foods higher than average, i will expect higher than average food and service. i believe holstein's delivered. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and shakes were delicious and the service was excellent.\n\ncompletely open to the pedestrian way, so it is a bit noisy, but it's a comfortable restaurant to dine in. our server was very prompt, gracious and attentive. i really appreciated their attention to detail. within moments of sitting down we were served the trademark mini-bucket of tasty popcorn and glasses of water without asking. they've clearly put thought into what a good customer experience should be in their restaurant. you've got a customer, immediately give them something to eat and drink. makes sense to me!\n\nthe menu is well-presented and easy to understand. burgers and shakes and some other stuff. everything on the menu sounded great. we opted for a <mark>Captain Hook</mark> (salmon burger) and a <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (teriyaki burger). both, due to their combination of flavors and textures, transcended the normal definition of \"burger\". they were delicious.\n\non leaving we ordered a cereal bowl and a <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>. these were a couple of the most delicious and unique milkshakes we've ever had. you'll just have to go a try one for yourself. a very tasty treat.\n\ni think that, although i can't afford to eat here as often as i'd like, this burger joint is my favorite in lv.", 
            "this past monday my gfs and i dined here for the first time... everything tasted amazing, the service was excellent. mike sanchez was our server and super friendly, prompt, made great suggestions on what to order.. let me say, the lobster mac n cheese, <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>, calamari, urth burger with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and a <mark>Captain Hook</mark> burger with a salad was what we all shared and it was superb... everything had amazing flavor, very addicting.. if you're looking for drinks, try a strong rita... jalapeno infused tequila drink very tasty, not too sweet, my girlfriend ordered a shake which i've been told are the best.. the atmosphere is comfortable, nice, welcoming, and fun. i'd definitely visit this place again.. it was very convenient to dine here before we went to marquee..", 
            "at close to 500 reviews for holstein's, i guess i don't really need to add my opinion but what the hell.\n\ni cannot come to vegas without a stop at this restaurant. seriously. i often wish that i had starved myself a little more before coming so that i could eat more. it's that good.\n\nlet's start with their bam-boozled shakes. shakes, yum. add alcohol? uh yes please. i've had the frozen grasshopper (peppermint, chocolate, creme de menthe, and chocolate vodka) <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake (i think this might be new since i don't see it on their online menu. think sprinkles, and bits of cake), and the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> (reese's, banana, malt, and frangelico). all amazing.\n\nas for their food, i love their apps. hello fried cheese curds, truffle lobster mac and cheese, and <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> served with fried caper berries, olives, and salami. though i think their menu has changed. i got the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> again this weekend and there were no other sides to the dish. i was a little sad about it.\n\nokay, now for the main course. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. i'm already drooling... <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger is still one of my favorites. kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. wow. no really, wow. the hen house burger? delicious but nothing super fancy. the korean bull'gogi burger is yum. i'm a sucker for a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> and kimchi and this burger has both as well as chili mayo. and last but not least (for the beef burgers anyway), the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger. beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic chive aioli. you can't be serious.\n\ndon't worry vegan/vegetarians, there's something for you too. they have a vegan burger which actually sounds pretty tasty and there is a wonderful salmon burger called <mark>Captain Hook</mark>. the salmon is thick and moist and comes with pickled shallots, caper herbed mayo, and house cured gravlax. salmon on salmon. i won't say no.\n\nall burgers are served with a side and i love their shoe string fries. crispy, thin and perfectly salted for my taste.\n\nat this point, if you still care about the ambience and the service, here it is. i like both. the restaurant is nice but not overly fancy.  service is prompt and friendly but not overbearing. \n\nafter writing this review, i'm tempted to jump in my car and drive down there just for the food. i wish i was kidding...", 
            "so here's the thing: i love this place, but i'm teetering on 3 stars. if there were 3.5, i'd give it that. when we first visited this place not long after it opened, we raved and told everyone how amazing it was.  and their burgers are very good. very, very good.\n\nbut, we've gone a handful of times now and the last few, i've been kind of embarrassed that we raved so much about it to the guests we brought with us. our server, the last two times, hasn't offered us our locals discount (even though we introduced ourselves as locals when we sat down). the first time, we didn't know and another server is the one who asked if we got our discount. the second time, we pointed it out on the bill and he went back and took it off.\n\nbut the guy who served us the last two times, while nice enough, was more interested in chatting with the hostesses than bringing us popcorn or refilling our water or pretty much anything. and we were seated in this corner so if we wanted to get anyone's attention, we'd have to get up and poke our heads around the side to flag him down.\n\nhe (or the kitchen, can't be sure) slathered my turkey burger in russian dressing, despite me asking for it on the side twice -- in fact, the server and i had a whole conversation that went something like this:\n\nme: \"could i please have the russian dressing on the side or not at all?\"\n\nhim: \"so, look, do you want it or not?\"\n\nlook, flo, i don't want it at all, i was just trying to be flexible. instead, i had to wait while my friends ate so they could de-russian my turkey burger, which if i'm being honest, wasn't that great. (the turkey burger sliders are also a snooze, skip 'em.)\n\nmy other beef (no pun intended) with this place is the volume. i appreciate that it's vegas and that people are there to par-tay, etc, but i'd like to eat my dinner without having to scream across the table. and this is in the dining room, not even in the lounge area, where it's seriously hearing-damage territory and the bass rumbles under your ass while you're trying to enjoy your sliders. it's just not my jam, so to speak.\n\ni can highly recommend the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, both of which are delectable and worth every penny. i like their wedge-cut fries, as well.  two of my friends have told me the <mark>Captain Hook</mark> salmon burger is also really good.  \n\nother high points: the decor is interesting and creative, and aside from this one lackluster server and the occasional snooty hostess, the staff is warm and welcoming. they menu has expanded as well and they've got a lot of interesting choices. they're great at their social media, too. love that.  \n\noverall, i do really like holstein's and am rather bummed to review it this way.a year ago, it would've been at least 4.", 
            "i decided to try this place out after work & what a lively, happening atmosphere i walked into. you can easily access this restaurant, which is located in the cosmopolitan hotel by entering in their garage parking & find a spot in the east side area. once you get in the elevator, hit the button #2 that says wicked spoon and convention center. when you come out, walk to your right & in seconds you'll be hearing some jammin' music & see an array of colorful artwork all over this place.\n\ni checked in with the hostess & was told to walk in the middle of the room, where another hostess was waiting to escorted me to my table. quick & prompt just the way i like it ;) i sat in front of two nice sized flat screen tvs to watch the sports channel. it was literally a money spot. front row view & nobody to block lil' ol' me. i like this spot.. oh yes i do.\n\nmy server, jonathan acknowledged my presence & was greeted ever so swiftly as he finished with an order from another party. giving me his undivided attention, he did the squat to talk to me, which i felt was a better way in interacting and actually connecting with a guest. a more personable approach i would say... i asked him if there was any way i could take my food to go, since i explained that i would like to share it with my family and he was more than willing to oblige my request. \n\nhe went over the menu with me & gave me the highlights on each item i was interested in trying. i appreciate his honesty on how i should get my salmon cooked and what i could possibly add if i would like it to be more juicy & flavor in the turkey choice that i ordered. jonathan was very helpful and didn't mind taking the time to let me know what he thought would enhance my dining experience. kudos to that & without even giving me my food yet & i gave him his well deserved tip. i think he even bowed & said thank you so much. wait.. i think i bowed to him first?!?? eh it's in my culture to bow when i appreciate & respect someone. koreans have a certain hand gesture when giving someone a card, dish, drink, anything exchanging from one another. don't mind me.. i'm just being me.\n\ntom turkey sliders ( comes in 3's ) from the tiny buns section - when you first glance at these trios... adorably cute. it consists of sprouts, cucumber slaw, & russian dressing on the side. the dressing itself is between a hint of horseradish & thousand island dressing. it gives off a tangy bite at first, then instantly mellows out like cream. the tiny buns oddly enough had the texture of taffy.. a bit on the dry side, but i ended up liking the chewy bites. i generously dipped my slider in the dressing & although it wasn't all grand slam.. i was pleasantly happy with the meat portion, which was thick & juicy. \n\ncrispy pork belly bun - ( comes in 3's ) think of peking duck steamed bun & instead of chives, its thinly sliced cucumber & pea shoots. i swear there was cilantro in the mix too. the hoisin sauce is more like a chinese barbeque-like sauce that has somewhat a balanced mix of tangy, salty, and sweetness some fruity undertones. the steamed buns were fluffy and so soft. the pork belly was nicely cooked to perfection in such a way, being so tender, yet crisp on the outer portions of the meat. a combination that anybody would love.\n\n<mark>Captain Hook</mark> - i ordered the grilled atlantic salmon medium as my server recommended and it looked ravishing. i would say this is a good looking burger. succulent and vibrant. marvelous in taste combining the house cured gravlax aka thinly sliced raw salmon atop with the grilled salmon. together with pickled shallots, herb-caper mayo, and frissee leaves.. this was definitely a hit for me, especially if you like textured meats. i chose the shoestring instead of steakcut fries that comes with this meal. thin, crispy, and tasty! i have to note.. the meat was unbelievably moist and juicy. i'm hook'ed!\n\nmy family and i enjoyed all <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. the music at holstein's is fresh. even made me want to workout in my mouth and tapped both of my feet to the beats. friendly staff and wonderful service. i would recommend jonathan again to be my server. i did observe his interaction with his guests while waiting for my food to go. he was exceptionally polite and attentive to every table he had. i even heard compliments to him from another table next to me. i did skip on the shakes this time, but the oreo is my favorite! the artwork here is uniquely admirable. i like the way they hold this place down with colors that will tickle your sweet tooth. great location for people watching and even mingling :p", 
            "nice high end burger joint at the cosmopolitan right across from the marquee club.\n\ni came with a my vegas local friend to grab a bite before watching our show zarkana and decided to eat here since it wasn't too far from the aria. like all the other restaurants in the cosmopolitan are trendy just like the hotel, the music was loud and the decor around the restaurant was fun to look at especially the holstein's bull right across from the bar. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Captain Hook</mark> that had raw and grilled salmon all on one burger and i thought was very unique and my friend ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger that included kobe beef and tempura avocado. we both shared each others burgers to get a taste and we loved it but it was pricey just like everything  else inside the cosmopolitan but who cares if you just want to relax with friends and family and have a great time. our meals included strong fries and for the appetizer we got the lobster quesadilla and complimentary popcorn.  service here was excellent and i'll definitely be back to try other burgers on the menu.", 
            "please move over! can you imagine a group of gals walking up and down the strip looking for some grub that didn't require too long of a wait. well believe it because my friends and i were starving upon entering. the place was pack, but we were seated promptly. \n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> here are divine. excellent in flavor. gourmet, simple, call it whatever you want,  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are definitely worth it. i ordered the <mark>Captain Hook</mark> and the salmon was grilled perfectly. not at all overcooked. the herb caper mayonnaise is good, but if you are not a mayonnaise person ask for it on the side. the fries are just as delicious, you can choose between steak fries or shoestring. the steak fries are fatty. i ended up cutting off the ends and squeezing the potatoes out. mmm, just like mash potatoes. \n\nthe seasoned popcorn is what they give you as appetizer. i believe it is tossed with vinegar and cheese. different, but tasty. \nand if you want some booze in your shake, this place has it covered! i was not too inspired to try one, but the options sound just as good as <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.\n\nwe left very stuffed. too stuffed that we looked rather unflattering in our night clothes. haahaa. nonetheless, i will dine here again!", 
            "the <mark>Captain Hook</mark> fish salmon sandwich is one of my favorite burgers. i have tried to replicate it at home with meagre success.  it is very fresh, tasty and enormously satisfying.\n\nthe place is a little loud, but a really fun time.", 
            "what an awesome burger place, the decorations and atmosphere was great. i ordered the tiramisu shake and complimentary cajun popcorn. i also ordered the lobster mac and cheese which is one of the best i've had! i ordered the <mark>Captain Hook</mark> as well, i plan to return the next time i'm in vegas and get a burger!", 
            "#vakseen4taste at this point holsteins has become one of those spots we hit anytime we're in vegas. they have a great beer, cocktail and food selection. last night we started with the truffled lobster mac n cheese. i've actually been dying to try this dish and it was pretty good. not great, but good. i'd say it was more the seasoning (or lack of) and flavor of the actual cheese sauce used that could've been better. i expected something a little more rich and creamy. the best thing about this dish is that they didn't go light on the lobster. you had chunks in almost every bite. from there i had the <mark>Captain Hook</mark> (grilled atlantic salmon w/ frissee, pickled shallots, herb-caper mayo & house cured gravlax) which was excellent. i ordered the salmon medium and it came out a little closer to medium welll, yet it was still flaky and amazing. the combination of flavors in this sandwich are crazy! the house cured gravlax...wow. service was pretty quick considering the final 4 was on and the place was packed. i'd actually recommend making reservations before coming because this place is always packed. before i forget, our server was very friendly and barely clothed lol. i mean literally her ass was hanging out of her shorts, a la hooters. no complaints on my end, but the ladies found it pretty entertaining lol. just a tip if you bring the jealous type. all in all, a great experience as expected. food 8.5/10. service 8/10. atmosphere 8/10", 
            "to say that holstein's is incredible is an understatement. \n\ni have had a few burgers from holstein's, and each burger is beyond phenomenal. this is one of the few restaurants that offer a gluten free bun, let alone a gluten free bun that is delicious, so when i found out they had this option we immediately ran to this restaurant without passing go. add on the fact they have spiked milkshakes, and i am all set to go.\n\nthe three burgers i've had at holstein's are:\n\nburger of the day: short rib burger\nthis burger had huge chunks of melt in your mouth short rib that made everything seem right in the world.\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger: dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli \n\nthis burger should be the first burger you eat at holstein's. everything about it is right. you'd think a burger with that many ingredients would be overwhelming, but it's not. no wonder this burger has gotten them several well-earned awards. everyone we know that has come to holstein's with us has loved this burger.\n\n<mark>Captain Hook</mark> burger:\ngrilled atlantic salmon w/frissee, pickled shallots, herb-caper mayo & house cured gravlax \n\nto be quite honest, i don't know what gravlax is, but whatever it is i love it and will go back to holstein's to eat it whenever my waistline can bear it. the salmon was cooked perfectly: tender in the inside with a buttery crust on the outside and definitely not greasy. if you're looking for a lighter option instead f a burger, this is the way to go.\n\ngo here. you will love every bite. if you have a gluten allergy or not, you will be able to eat their regular <mark>French Fries</mark> (natural cut and good, but nothing life altering) or their <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> which are a delicious treat in a world that rarely gets <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> right. if you're looking for less fried, go with the coleslaw. so, so good. eat up and enjoy!", 
            "this review will be based only on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. \n\nsince christmas day basically consists of my mom and my boyfriend, we decided to spend some time walking on the strip and grab lunch at holsteins.\n\ni ordered <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> ($16) which was ok - not terrible, but not something i'd order again either. it was a chicken breast burger with kettle chips (more like kettle crumbs), a pickled shallot (? .. it was something pink), lettuce, and tomato. in the description it listed garlic aioli which is why i leaned towards ordering that item, but i honestly really couldn't depict it in my bites.\n\nmi madre went with <mark>Captain Hook</mark> ($17) - a salmon burger with lettuce, tomato, the pickled pink stuff, and smoked salmon. that was much more worth the money and if i ever paid a visit again, that's probably what i would order. the salmon wasn't dry and the smoked salmon actually complemented very will with the grilled salmon filet, giving <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> a strong salmon kick.\n\nmy boyfriend went with the big fat greek ($17) - a burger basically with all the ingredients you'd find at a greek restaurant like lamb, feta, lettuce, tomato, and tatziki. that was pretty tasty as well if you don't mind a hint of gaminess from the lamb. <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> quite enjoyed it but said it didn't hit the spot like he hoped.\n\nthere were definitely other options i would've been keen on trying but the average pricing was $18 for all other types of burgers and i just don't care that much about burgers to spend close to $20. all comes with a small personal-sized bucket of fries or you could sub it for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> or <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> for an extra $2.\n\nthe bill came out to be $70 after taxes and tip... that's pretty rough in my opinion but i guess i shouldn't expect any less from restaurants on the strip. \n\nwould i come here again? sure if my out-of-town friends dragged me. as for the shakes, i think they are definitely worth a try since some of the concoctions are pretty interesting and unique (not to mention it also includes liquor) if you don't mind spending the extra $13. as for me, a non-drinker, i'll just stick to off-strip joints for any burger cravings...", 
            "since the cosmopolitan didn't exist last time i was in las vegas, we wanted to check it out and we stumbled upon holstein's, a restaurant that specializes in shakes (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and burgers. it's like the shake shack or good stuff eatery on the east coast. \n\ninstead of bread, there was a medium sized pail of mixed popcorn - bbq cheddar and regular. it was a bit too early for an alcoholic beverage so i got a strawberry malt (which consisted of strawberry ice cream and milk mixed together and topped with whipped cream and strawberry meringue. for starters, we shared a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> (which consisted of purple and green romaine lettuce, croutons, and shaved grana padano cheese tossed in a garlic-parmesan dressing. it was topped with two, small, thinly sliced bread with melted cheese. for entrees, we ordered the following burgers: <mark>Captain Hook</mark> and <mark>California Turkey</mark>. they allow customers to substitute the regular fries for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> or <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> for an additional $2. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were served in a small pail. the <mark>Captain Hook</mark> burger consisted of pan seared salmon cooked to medium and glazed with remoulade sauce, smoked salmon, fricassee, and red colored pickled shallots. the <mark>California Turkey</mark> consisted of turkey party with parsley and spices, sprouts, tomato, avocado, cucumber, thinly shredded coleslaw, pepper jack cheese, and russian dressing.",

            "holsteins was on my list during my last trip to vegas and we didn't end up going, so this was at the top of my list this time around. we had a party of 8 during friday night at around 10 p.m., and ended up splitting into two tables of 4 because it was packed. the two musts here are their burgers and shakes. the bf and i split <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger, which was really good. i also had a bite of <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> which was great as well (think burger with an asian twist). their patty is really juicy and most importantly, cooked to a perfect medium rare. since we were sharing <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, we decided to get the truffled mac n cheese with lobster, which was piping hot and delicious. i wasn't sure about the lone potato chip on the side though.\n\nwe ordered a couple of milkshakes: brown cow float, oreo, <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>, and <mark>Campfire Smores</mark>. my favorite was the oreo. the brown cow had chocolate pop rocks which made it very unique. it's pricey at ~$11 but they do give you a cup and a half, which makes it feel like a little better deal. \n\nholsteins ranks right under father's office in la in my book.", 
            "one of the best burgers i've ever tried.  first of all, this restaurant is usually packed, so prepare for a wait.  second, the decor is adorable!  the cartoon cow graces their windows and in the wall paintings, which creates a fun and relaxed environment.  they have interesting gourmet burgers and sliders and spiked milkshakes!  \n\nmy favorite was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger - kobe beef with tempura avocado, teriyaki glaze, and sprinkles of furikake.  so many different flavors and textures that worked together.  i also tried <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark>, with portabello mushrooms, aioli, and truffle oil, but it was too much goodness in one that it was overwhelming.  the flavors were too similar and heavy, especially the two thick pieces of gruyere cheese.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> come with a side of either skinny or steak fries.  i recommend the steak fries because their skinny fries are too crispy and almost chip-like.  \n\ndon't forget to try their shakes and malts!  i wanted to try their spiked shakes, but got grossed out thinking about alcohol from the night before, so i got a simple vanilla malt, which was thick, creamy and fatty.  yum!",

            "what's not to like about great burgers and even better shakes (especially when you can get them with alcohol in them). holsteins is located in the cosmopolitan hotel and just like the hotel has quite the vibe to it. there is open seating in the bar area but if you get there early enough you can get a seat in the dining area. \n\ntypically when i have friends in town, we seem to end up at holsteins (either because they want to try it or they are staying at the cosmopolitan hotel). either way, it's a great way to enjoy some pretty good burgers (but be prepared to spend a bit of money as the prices are definitely not that inexpensive).\n\nthere is definitely a large selection of alcoholic beverages that you can choose from, but i definitely recommend the adult shakes that they have. between my friends and i we tried the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>, oreo, and cereal bowl (tastes just like captain crunch). for burgers, we've tried quite a few of the different burgers - <mark>The Classic</mark>, the longhorn (with beef brisket as well), <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (asian flavors with teriyaki sauce), <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> (with assorted mushrooms), the el machete (with an anaheim chili - sounds spicy, but it really is not, it's good, but it could use some more spice), and of course, the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> (kobe beef patty with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>). the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> is what a lot of people like to try (especially those from california that can't get their <mark>Foie Gras</mark> anymore. you can also add a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to your burger (which i recommend) - just to make it even more tasty with another layer of flavor.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> also come with either shoestring or steak cut fries. i have ordered a side salad (to try and be a little healthier - although not by much since we were indulging in a burger), and was disappointed that they charged $2 extra dollars for <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> of a side salad over the fries (and it wasn't even a large salad). i guess next time i'll just indulge in the fries.\n\noverall, a great place to hang out with your friends, get some good burgers and have a lot of drinks. i'd definitely recommend enjoying the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> at least once.",

            "i really had high hopes for this place, as its highly rated here as well as some magazines and internet articles. we had a very short wait to get in, which was fine....but when we did get in there we tons of tables open so that was a bit weird. didn't really bother me though. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> to start and i then got <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark>. this is a burger i would typically get. my husband guessed that's what i'd order. it just missed the mark for me. it was a little too well done and lacked flavor. \nmy husband got the el machete and really liked it. \n\ni had checked in on four square which gave me a free beer, so i ordered that with my waiter. he ended up forgetting about it, which i really didn't care about it and wasn't going to say anything. when he came back to ask if we wanted dessert he realized he had forgotten it. i said it was fine and didnt need it but he went and got it for me in a to go cup which was really nice of him. \n\ni wrote another review for burgr that we went to the next night. i preferred burgr over holsteins, but i might give them another chance if i'm out here again. \n\nservice was very nice and friendly.", 
            "this was the first restaurant we ate at when my sister and i arrived in vegas. at first we were a bit overwhelmed because *everything* sounded good! and the milkshakes??? oh man. she and i split a <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> shake. they brought it in a glass and the rest in the shaker. it was delicious. we drank a lot of it before the meal and saved some for after.\ni ordered <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> with a veggie patty instead of beef. and ate the whole thing. as a small person, that is pretty impressive. so ya, this place was delish. and service was good. free popcorn, too.", 
            "on the first night of my bachelorette party, my friends and i came back to holstein's for a dinner of burgers and booze.  i repeated some favorites from my first visit - the spicy bloody mary, the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>, <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, and the frozen grasshopper - and all were as remembered.  in fact i'm mostly updating this just to document my bachelorette party in full, so if you want to see a full useful review, please see the original and ignore this post, which is basically for my diary use only.\n\nwe came at around seven o'clock and were told they were so backed up they were turning people away.  we put our name and number down anyway, expecting to wait at least an hour and a half.  i guess a lot of people were discouraged enough to bail, because we were seated after something like forty minutes.\n\nservice was good, polite and moderately quick.  a few of my friends and i use foursquare (sorry, yelp), and we each got a complimentary holstein's spacial (not a typo on my end) lager.  it was tasty, refreshing, and free, and i'm sorry to admit that we were too full to finish them and felt pretty bratty.  we did leave a nice tip.\n\ni did try a couple new things this time around, and i'll just note those here.  <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> (hey, you know that joke, don't you?) was a great burger with a beef patty, roasted portobello, caramelized onion, truffle oil, gruyere, frisee, and aioli.  the mushroom was great, and went really well with the beef.  all the other accompaniments took a back seat, letting the two top players have their day.  for dessert, we supplemented our frozen grasshopper with a <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> shake - smirnoff marshmallow vodka, chocolate, marshmallow, and a graham cracker crumble.  i mean please i will never stock smirnoff marshmallow vodka in my home bar, but it worked here.  the shake tasted like s'mores, and it was delicious.\n\nmy girls got my dinner, for which i am very grateful.  holstein's was fun and full of tasty things, a great start to an epic bachelorette weekend.",

            "this place is a hit or miss as for experience dining inside.\n\ni can't deny that their burgers are delicious but depending on what time and server you get, your experience will depend on service.\n\ni came to holsteins a couple of times and the first time was great. good service, good waiters and good food. the second time i came, it was horrrrrrrible!! the food was good as always. but the service was just terrible! the thing that angered me the most is that it was only our table receiving such bad service. we see others receiving their food promptly and watching the managers check up on them but when the manager came across our table, he straight turned away and ignored us!!! didn't even ask if we were doing alright. which we weren't! we waited forever to get our food and the waiter was pretty much non-existent to us! it took forever to get his attention and we even waited forever for our check even when we asked for it.\n\nthe third time, we learned better so we decided to order togo and eat in our rooms. that way, we don't have to deal with inconsistent service.\n\nanyways, as for the food. definitely try the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>. hey, you're in vegas so go big or go home! the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> is perfectly seared and so flavorful and the combination of the onions and truffle sauce is sooo good! so worth the price! only $28! if you want something a little bit reasonable, <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> and el machete are all delicious as well! \n\nit's surprisingly a good burger joint and is a must try if you're staying in cosmo!",

            "came here on what seemed to be an uneventful and random tuesday night with another guest. we luckily snagged a dining area right up front from the hostess stand while the other current diners were just leaving. apparently the restaurant was packed and quite eventful despite our feelings otherwise.\n\nthe table was still full of food, given the fact we were offered the only available seating at the time, but service was very quick to remove and set up for us promptly. \n\nwe decided on <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger & the crispy pork belly buns. for desert, we were recommend the tiramisu shake based on our preference of chocolate. we even got it to go and non-alcoholic. everything came out surprisingly fast. *the menu is quite extensive so there are many choices for everything. look online in advance or take a look on the menu outside.\n\n<mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> was delicious, but i really was expecting more from a 17$ burger. truffle marinated portabella mushroom, caramelized onions, frisee, and mayo with a beef patty. rich and pleasantly mild despite the idea of alluring funky-nees from the truffle and gruyere. ordered with sweet potatoes fries that were executed perfectly, although they only came with your normal and boring grocery ketchup rather than a unique dipping sauce or aioli that most burger places in its caliber of category offer.\n\nthe crispy pork belly buns were such a disappointment. so unpleasantly sweet, as if the pork itself were candied. and to add insult to the matter, the herbs or greens accompanied did not compliment the dish what so ever and gave it a medicinal and rather off putting taste. terrible really.\n\nshake was great but not anything special, and again, for the price of 13+?\n\nthe service from our waitress could not have been any better. so polite and friendly and frequently checked back on us despite a full house; impressive. i also believe the owner stopped by at one point and asked us how we were and carried on by removing some trash from our table.\n\nit's the questionable prices and the food quality that contributed to the 3 stars. i understand the atmosphere is apart of the experience (beautiful artsy and urban decor, obviously located in the upscale  and modern cosmopolitan) and leads way into the pricing, but it's quite unnecessary and confusing when the food isn't as up to par. i will be back to try some other burgers, but not planning on it anytime soon.",

            "to top off a successfull vegas trip , we came to holsteins hungry and anxious after seeing all the solid reviews. located right across the entrance to marquee, it's an all too familiar location, but unfortunately a location i probably won't return to.\n\nupon walking in, we were asked whether we wanted bar or table seating. the hostess literally stated that if we wanted a table, it would mean she would \"have to\" walk us over. she made it sound like we were causing the biggest inconvenience in the world to her if we didn't sit at the bar. rude. we still went for a table, and she pointed us to another waitress who would take us. a horrible system.\n\nit took 10 minutes to have a waiter even greet us after sitting down. another 35 passed before we became intolerably grumpy and impatient, flagging down our waiter to see what was going on. two burgers, one of which was rare, should not take 40 minutes to make. after a long day, 5 minutes was very agonizing, and our burgers finally came out.\n\n- \"meat ball\" burger ($15): beef, pork, veal, pecorino & provol<mark>One <mark>Two Dollar Cheese</mark></mark>, basil walnut pesto and arugula on herb foccacia roll. the meat concoction was great, but it lacked flavor or marination. of course, i loved all the cheese, but you could barely taste the walnut pesto. it could use some marinara sauce. not the best choice here.\n\n- <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> ($17): beef patty, truffled marinated portabella mushroom, caramelized onion, gruyere, maro & frisee.  this one was much better and was wonderfully crafted. there was plenty of gruyere, you could taste the truffle oil in the mushroom, and all ingredients balanced well with each other. a superb burger indeed. \n\nfries with one burger, <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> with the other. both were good quality. the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> weren't too deeply fried and maintained a nice crunch.\n\n- banana cream pie shake ($13): bananas, vanilla custard, nilla wafers, caramel, creme de banane, licor 43 and white chocolate covered banana. absolutely delicious. although it was technically two servings, a shake should not be worth as much as a burger. also, there was barely any hint of alcohol in here. despite this, i sipped it down to the last delicious drop.\n\nafter finishing our meal, it took another 20 minutes to hunt down a different waiter because ours kept ignoring us. the restaurant was less than half full and there was plenty of staff, so service like this is unacceptable. even the table next to us noted how long our order was taking. \n\noverpriced, extremely slow, but quite a treat if you get the right burger.",

            "i've been here a few times. i've had <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger, the lobster mac and cheese, and the asian-themed kobe beef burger. they were all fantastically crafted with unique flavor so complex that you forget you're eating a burger. \n\nthe fries and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> are amazing, but the variety of adult milkshakes and 100 beers they offer really make this place a destination. \n\nin the cosmopolitan hotel, filled with a dozen $75+ a person dinner restaurants, this place sets itself apart for its laid back atmosphere and great flavor for a more reasonable price (for vegas, that is)",

            "i went here for lunch on the opening week at cosmopolitan.  it's on the same floor as some other restaurants but seems to get more business than the others; we had a 20 minute wait.  once we were seated, we noticed that there were a lot of empty tables in the restaurant; i'm guessing that they're a little understaffed.\n\ni had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> cheeseburger, which comes with sirloin beef, bacon, sliced goat cheese, arugula, tomato confit, and a garlic aioli.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was quite good.  the ingredients tasted fresh and the meat was cooked perfectly.  unlike a lot of gourmet cheeseburgers i've had, the grill taste isn't overly aggressive here.  the bacon definitely made an impact and the arugula, while mostly dominated by the other ingredients, added a nice crunch to cut the grease.\n\ni upgraded my fries order to the duck fat fries.  it was my first time trying duck fat fries, but i wasn't impressed.  i was hoping to taste some duck in there!  they were definitely crunchier than the standard fry, but the steak fries here are very tasty as well and i would recommend those instead.  i also had the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> spiked milkshake, which was delicious.  very creamy and chocolatey, but for a spiked milkshake it was perhaps too smooth.\n\nin conclusion: this is one of the better gourmet cheeseburgers i've had in las vegas so far.  stick with the steak fries unless you're curious about the duck fat or really like your fries crunchy.", 
            "pros: holsteins is a nice looking burger joint in a very nice hotel (cosmopolitan of las vegas). the prices are reasonable, the service attentive, the drink menu extensive, and the servers attractive. \n\ncons: my burger was not quite what i had expected. i got the korean bulgogi burger that comes with a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> and kim chi. sounds epic right? turns out that the patty was drenched in some type of sweet teriyaki sauce, which i was not particularly fond of. also, the prospect of duck fat fries was presented to us. sounds epic too right? its more or less just a gimmick that resulted in overly hard fries with no extra flavor whatsoever. all in all, a decent filling meal with fresh ingredients and a nice atmosphere, but not the best burger joint i have ever tried. i would go back to sample another burger because my friends did enjoy theirs (they got the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger.)\"",

            "this is going to sound like a farce, but i daydream about my meal at holsteins on a nearly daily basis - <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were that good.  i was a little, um, rough from 2 consecutive nights of partying, and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> here dazzled my taste buds and satiated my poor stomach.\n\nwe started with radicchio salad which was large enough for two to share as a starter and was perfectly tossed and loaded with fresh parmesan.  we split a korean bullgogi burger and a <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, and trying to pick the better of the two would be like trying to pick the more obnoxious twin between mary-kate and ashley.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was a glorious pastiche of meat and cheese, vegetable and fruit, starch and sauce.  and then the bullgogi, with the glaze, the egg, the trite kim-chi whatever-it's-going-to-be to make the dish \"korean\" (in this case, kim-chi slaw) worked equally well together to create a fabulous burger.  i would urge anyone to order either of these but all of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> looked appetizing on the menu.\n\nmy only regret (due to an impending drive back to la) was not being able to try one of the alcoholic shakes.  \n\noh! and since they mistakenly brought out the salad with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> (i asked for it before <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, naturally), they offered us a complimentary whimsical dessert sampler (i think it's \"the candy store\" on the menu) that was great; save the mini-drumstick cones for last!", 
            "went here with my fiance on our yearly vegas trip. it was loud because of the football playoffs being shown in the bar. \nthe fiance ordered an oreo shake, which was yummy. we ordered the truffle lobster mac n cheese as an appetizer. it was pretty good, but not the best i'd ever had. the blend of cheeses was nice and creamy, with a little sharpness, and the truffles really added to the dish. the lobster in the mac n cheese, however, did not taste like it was very high quality.\n\nthe fiance ordered the duck duck goose burger, which neither of us were very impressed with. he ordered a side of smashed potatoes, which were awful and completely inedible. they were cold and tasted like old dirty potatoes with no seasoning and no effort put into them.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, which was honestly the saving grace of this restaurant. it was the best burger i've had in my life, and despite all the other problems we had with the food here, i would definitely go back for that burger. i ordered a side of duck fat fries. not impressed at all. i've had better fries from in 'n out burger. i was really disappointed because i had heard that duck fat fries are supposed to be really good. i'm sure they are, just not at holstein's.\n\nwe may go back the next time we're in vegas just for the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, but with so many other amazing restuarants in vegas, maybe not.",

            "let's start out with the service. i can be very judgmental with a restaurant on how you are greeted. when we approached the restaurant, the hostess' were smiling and friendly. we had a party of 10 and put down our name. the hostess told us it would be a 30-45 minute wait so we decided to wait and help ourselves to chinaplobano right next door just to eat something to carry us over so we don't get grumpy because of low blood sugar levels. i put in my order and literally 5 minutes later, our table was ready. i was like \"wth...i thought you said it's gonna be a 30-45 min wait, so now i'm stuck with dim sum and what i'm going to order off the menu.\" the waitress was very friendly but kinda slow at times. she never came back to offer anyone another drink/shake or refill my water.\n\nas far as food goes...i agree with mike h...<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are waaaaaaay expensive for how small they are, but then again...what do you expect...it's a restaurant in los vegas. i had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and wasn't very impressed. the menu consisted of some random burgers....i feel that if you wanna burger...\"the more basic the better\" the \"tiny bites\" are literally tiny bites. some of them cost almost as much as a regular size burger....if you want more bang for your buck....get a regular size. as far as the \"adult milkshakes,\" i don't drink usually but damn....the <mark>Virgil's Orange Cream</mark>....was absolutely amazing!!!!!!! if anything that was the only thing that i would go back for. \n\ni'd give the service a 2 and the food a 3. like i said...i'd only go back for an \"adult milkshake.\"", 
            "this was really impressive.. i thought, a burger place at the cos would be a big disappointment, but really not... i had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, dry aged beef burger, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic-chive aioli, which was freakin amazing...", 
            "strike 1: the hostess looked me up and down judgmentally the second i walked up, which felt really welcoming, except the exact opposite. strike 2: i accidentally ordered a bottled beer that turned out to be $16.50 each. my fault for assuming that we don't live in a world where any human pays that much for a bottle of beer. the beer in question costs $9.99 a six pack at whole foods. strike 3: although hubs and i ordered the same thing with no weird substitutions, one of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came with garlic aioli on the side and we had to cut into <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> to discern which was well done and which was medium.  for a $120 dinner i didnt expect to be so annoyed.  the quality of burger was all right; we both had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>. the steak fries were actually seasoned potato wedges. and they were...all right. hated the philly cheese steak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> (not a fan of anything involving cheez whiz). all in all,  i left bummed and whats even sadder, unsurprised. the cosmopolitan needs to hire capable people that care about their jobs, not these vapid robots that look great but can't even get a burger right.",

            "what a disappointing experience! my fiance and i chose holsteins this past sunday. we arrived at 8pm and the hostesses asked if we had a reservation. we did not, and they weren't seating until 8:45pm without reservations, which is fine, so we went to another fine block 16 hospitality establishment across the street--pinks--as we were in a hurry. \n\nafter eating our delicious hotdogs, we went back to the cosmopolitan and asked the hostesses if we could make a reservation for after the concert we were headed to that evening. they told us that we couldn't make a reservation but it shouldn't be a problem as their last seating was 11:45pm. \n\nfast forward, the concert ended and we hurried over to holsteins and arrived at 11:30pm. we waited our turn in line and then the hostess informed us that they were no seating. now i'm upset so i complained and asked for a manager's contact information and instead of giving it to me, they seated me. \n\nthe service by our server, scot, was terrible. he was clearly bothered by our late seating, noting upon arriving at the table, \"well, you guys sure got a late seat\". not hello. no greeting. terrible. he took our orders (food and drink) all at once so that we could make it a faster dining experience. my milkshake came out as did our friend's diet coke but my fiance's miller lite didn't come and then the food arrived. i asked the runner about the beer and 5 minutes after the food arrived, scot runs by, slams an unopened can of miller lite down on the table and then runs away. he didn't inquire about our food. he didn't open the beer. he was just generally absent from the entire experience and made us feel rushed and unwelcome. \n\nthe food was delicious but overcooked. i asked for my burger, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, rare and received a burger that was tan with a hot pink center. same for my fiance. additionally, both of us became violently ill about 2 hours later that evening. as someone who works in the service industry living in a town that revolves around service, this experience was extremely disappointing.", 
            "amazing burger...  got to love the new trend in high end burger joints.  would i spend $18 on a burger everyday? no, but when i did i sure enjoyed it.  i had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and it was fantastic.  the only thing i did not like was the steak fries.  i tried my wifes shoestring and friends <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and they were both great.  the steak fries reminded me of something from jack in <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>.  service and atmosphere was great.  the cosmopolitian hotel/casino is awesome.", 
            "my first trip to vegas was a total culinary disaster. so this time, i did some research. i'll admit, what drew me to holstein's wasn't really the food...it was <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> shakes. <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>? yes, please. and that's what i ordered, which turned out to be delicious beyond my comprehension. whoever thought to mix banana gelato and frangelico deserves to be worshipped.\n\nthe food was equally as outstanding. when i ordered my <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger \"medium rare to rare,\" my server warned, \"the rare is cold and red, while the medium rare is warm and red. would you prefer it warm or cold?\" and so i ordered it medium rare. and out it came, warm and red and juicy kobe beef. i was shocked that for once i didn't have to overcompensate in my ordering just to get a decent amount of pink in my burger. the toppings were perfect (you can't not love tempura avocado, really), and even the teriyaki glaze, which i was skeptical of, wasn't overpowering. the shoestring fries that accompanied it were great, especially with a side of truffle mayo.\n\non top of everything, our server was excellent and very attentive, which in my experience hasn't been the norm in vegas restaurants. holstein's reassured me that there, in fact, is good food to be found on the strip, and i will certainly be returning here on my next trip.\n\nupdate: i finally got back here and had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger this time. a little overcooked, and not as bold in flavor as <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. also, the fries were thicker and not as crisp--why the change?! i'm not as in love with holsteins as i used to be, but it's still one of my favorite affordable spots on the strip. i'll be back a third time for sure!",

            "any place there's a pink and white cow in the middle of the bar, i'm there.\n\nholstein's was a great find last night, after countless hours of scouring the yelp site for something other than sushi.  i was ready for a change, for a new spot to grab a burger, and when i saw the reviews for holsteins and it's location, i had to give it a try.  \n\nlet me start by saying that the cosmo itself is beautiful, and this place makes it even better with a pink and white cow in the middle of the bar.  \n\ni made reservations through their website (highly recommended) for dinner at 9pm.  late?-sure, but it prevents us from eating with the regular dinner crowd.  we arrived and were greeted by the nice hostess who seated us immediately a corner half booth.\n\nthe ambiance is really comforting and chic, which i love.  with the chocolate leather seating to the bright colored tiles aligning one wall and picture-framed tv's, it's metrosexual.  the menu is interesting, too, boasting unique sodas, shakes, and burgers.  obviously, the menu was in the higher dollar range for a burger considering it is in the cosmo, but i went all out and ordered what i wanted.  \n\ni ordered their newest shake--the cereal bowl--which tasted like breakfast in the morning but in a really fantastic way.  with vanilla ice cream mixed with crushed cap'n crunch and fruity pebble cereal, it was quite a treat to have, almost like dessert before dinner.  i love it.  i'm a big cereal person, so this was perfect for me (and it was suggested by the server).\n\nfrank picked up this crazy strawberry soda that was really really good.  i'm going to try and find it at the soda shop on trop and the 215.\n\nwe had the philly spring rolls with tempura pepper slices and ketchup.  it was freakin' great.  the flavors and textures were all on point.  when you combine a philly with a spring roll, magic happens.  squishy, creamy, gooey cheese oozes out of the end and the ketchup makes it all the better.\n\nwe ordered their kettle chips, which had this great bleu cheese salt on them, and the french dip was awesome, too.  unfortunately, the spring rolls trumped the chips, but they would go great with a beer at the bar, for sure.\n\ni ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger: kobe beef patty with tempura avocado, crispy yam strings, teriyaki sauce and spicy mayo.  wow. just the right amount of sauce and the yams gave it this nice, sweet, spicy flavor and texture.  the meat itself was well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  with that soft, white bun that didn't overpower the meal (it was really light), i believe that i found my favorite burger in vegas.\n\nfrank ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>: aged beef patty with guyere (substituted for the aged goat cheese), lettuce, tomato, and onion.  he added lobster, which made it decadent and very flavorful. the sweetness of the lobster accentuated the patty's aged flavor.  it's a winner, for sure.\n\nwith no room for dessert, we tapped out with an 81.00 bill, which was expected.  i would definitely eat here again. and again. and again.\n\nif you want to try this place out, do.  there's a lot of try and many days out of the year to do it.", 
            "loved this place.  went twice on my latest trip to vegas and each time was great.  had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and the long horn burger and each was fantastic.  the philly cheese steak rolls are to die for, but the artichoke guac is a miss.  \n\nbeer selection is off the charts and the servers were attentive and fun.", 
            "buns and shakes...i guess they are alluding to..well they didn't say it specifically and it wasn't a breastaurant in case you are wondering! they have a nice selection of different burgers each with a different spin. i had the kimchi burger and was really impressed. very flavorful with the sweet sauce and crunchy kimchi and the bun was soft and sweet. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> on the side were nothing special. just anyplace frozen kind. would have been nice to have some banchan instead, but it's a burger place :p\nmy friends were also nice enough to share the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger w tomato & arugula--very peppery. the delhi chicken sando--mild indian flavor. the salmon--lots of salmon for the seafood lover. i liked the pickled shallots. wanted more of them! other than the food the atmosphere is laid back, waitstaff fine, not in your face.\nit's a bit expensive, but it's vegas! i'd go back~", 
            "the name says it all. come for the shakes and buns, but not for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. \n\nholsteins is in the cosmopolitan casino on the 2nd floor shopping area. i was there a little after the lunch hour and had no problem getting a seat at the bar (i was flying solo until my peeps arrived in vegas). \n\nthe service was decent and i quickly ordered the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" burger with dry aged sirloin, goat cheese, bacon, arugula and a wheat bun. let's just say <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was ok and the bun was the highlight. \n\nwhatever taste of the sirloin was drowned out by the goat cheese. it was basically a goat cheese burger. the ingredients were fresh and the bun was the best hamburger bin i've ever had...but that isn't going to get it a 4-star rating.\n\nthe shoestring fries were cooked to perfection by extremely salty. maybe it is to help you retain water in the desert climate. or maybe the cook spent too much time on the strip last night. who knows?!\n\nbottom line. holsteins was the typical flashy, overpriced midrange vegas restaurant letdown. good, but certainly not great...and not worth the price.", 
            "came here for lunch with a rather big group, the restaurant was pretty empty at the time.  i was very disappointed with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, namely because the bun's were absolutely terrible!  i had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> with <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> patty was cooked medium, and all the fix-ins complimented <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> well...but i can't get over the fact that the bun was so terrible.   <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> bun was dry, cold, and slightly stale...it was so terrible that i could not enjoy my burger.  i almost had to eat <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> patty by itself and toss the bun.   everyone else in my group agreed, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> bun was stale and dry.  if it wasn't for the dry bun, i might be able to give it 4-stars, but i just could not enjoy my burger on a stale dry bun!  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> patty was good quality, but i can't enjoy a burger without a good bun!  the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were okay, i've had better, i really wished they were beer battered.   for the price of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, i really expected a more satisfying burger; <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were not that big to begin with.  i think i will stick to burger bar in mandalay bay.\n\nas with everything else in vegas, high prices don't always equate to high quality.   my meal came out to be $25 for a burger, <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, and water...for this price i expect a damn good burger, which holsteins did not deliver.  burger bar has much better burgers, and better prices!", 
            "the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger was excellent as was the <mark>Captain Hook</mark>.  the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were also delicious.  this place may have the best selection of quality beers in the entire state.  the service was fast and our server (alicia) was friendly without making it sound rehearsed.  the manager (steve) came by our table to make sure we were pleased with our meal and tell us a little about the beers.  later he even offered us, and others nearby, a sample of some sort of \"nitrogen meringue\" that was a fun and unique experience.  all-in-all we thoroughly enjoyed our experience at holsteins and will definitely return in the future.", 
            "it's hard to resist a restaurant that offers spiked shakes and gourmet burgers.  my friend june had been to holsteins on an earlier vegas trip and come back raving that it was the one restaurant she'd hit that she wanted to revisit.  i can't tell you how many times i stared drooling at the menu before we went for dinner.\n\nholsteins is in the new and beautiful cosmopolitan hotel, and it's right across from marquee.  we went and got stamped for the marquee before we checked in for dinner, and we ended up missing our reservation (held for fifteen minutes).  the staff was nice about it, though, and it turned out that seating, even for a party of seven, was not a problem.  holsteins is a swanky place, with comfortable booths and a giant pink cow on display.  we had a waiter named chaz, and he was friendly and on his game.\n\nthe drinks were everything i wanted and more.  the spiked milkshakes were absolutely delicious.  the frozen grasshopper came with peppermint meringue, chocolate crunchies, creme de menthe, and van gogh dutch chocolate vodka.  i can't imagine it was terribly boozy, but it was a fabulous milkshake, with full mint chocolate flavor and the perfect thickness.  the little meringue was delightful, and the crunchy chocolate bits added texture to every sip.  the brown cow was also fantastic, an adult <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float made with <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, vanilla ice cream, pop rocks, and charbay tahitian vanilla rum.  it had all the kid-pleasing taste of a great <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, and i can't overstate the fun of pop rocks.  i also tried the bloody mary, without ice cream, but with smirnoff infused with pepper and cilantro, combined with bloody mary mix and garnished with a toothpick bearing an olive and a cocktail shrimp.  i love a good bloody mary, and this was a good one.  it had a heavy spicy flavor but a thin clean texture, and i appreciate food in my drink when appropriate.\n\nour table split three appetizers, and that felt like the right amount.  the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> were easily my favorite, breaded and deep-fried dill spears, olives, and caper berries, served with small sides of prosciutto and salami and an herb-caper mayo for dipping.  these were magical.  the breading was flavorful, crispy, and light, and the pickles oozed their pickly flavor.  i would also recommend the bucket of <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark>, which came with a bleu cheese dip.  nothing fancy, but delicious.  i was disappointed, though, by the truffle lobster mac' n cheese.  the creamy tallegio-mascarpone sauce was more creamy than it was cheesy, making the appetizer more like a macaroni salad.  the maine lobster was barely there, and the black truffle didn't come through.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were very good, though i suspect that the strength may lie in the toppings.  <mark>The Classic</mark> - with just lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, ketchup, and pickles - was the most boring of the bunch, and that doesn't hold true with a remarkable patty.  the patties were definitely tasty, though, with plenty of juice, and they held up well to some fun accompaniments.  my favorite was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>.  with a kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado, it was definitely a loaded gimmick of a fusion burger - but damn if i didn't gobble it down.  the teriyaki was sweet but not cloying, and the salt of the speckles of dried seaweed was great.  the crispy yam gave a welcome crunch, and that strip of avocado tempura was creamy and beautiful.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was also good, a dry-aged beef sirloin burger topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli.  it was less of a stand-out, though, and the tomato confit did not bring on the umami parade i'd hoped for.  if you like lamb burgers, the big fat greek is a good choice.  with greek spiced lamb, feta cream, lettuce, tomato, tzatziki sauce, and red onion and olive relish, it's a little like a greek menu threw up on a burger.  the result, though, is hearty and pretty well done.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> all come with a side of fries, and you have a choice of shoestring, sweet potato, and steak cut.  i prefer my thin fries, and the shoestring and sweet potato were both superb.  holsteins knows its way around a potato - even the steak cut fries were well seasoned and not at all mushy.\n\nwhen we left for marquee we were all stuffed to the brim.  the meal was not cheap - burgers started at $13 and shakes were $11 - but it was a satisfying feast that hardly qualified as a splurge in vegas.  i've had better burgers, but i was impressed by <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, and i doubt i've had better milkshakes.  if you're in vegas hankering for a fattening meal, check holsteins out.", 
            "had a quick lunch here and it was good. the cosmo is really hip and this place follows that vibe. i almost  didn't feel cool enough to be there. anyway, i had a s'mores shake (awesome!), and <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger. it was a great burger but the 17.50 price tag is alittle much. for that price i expected more i guess. there are other things on the menu that sounded really good, so i'd probably go back. i'll just be prepared to spend $35 on lunch.", 
            "it's almost hard to believe that holstein's is run by the same people responsible for lbs at the red rock. i guess if i had to make an analogy, this place is like michael jackson (in terms of talent, not behavior or affinity for boys) whereas lbs is latoya (or maybe even janet) and the lbs patty wagon is tito.\n\nwhat that means, is this place rocks. the menu is more diverse and creative than it's sibling establishments with it's spiked milkshakes, apps, burgers, alternative dishes for non-burger folks, and an extensive beer list.\n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> ($16.50) is an amazing burger made out of a sizable kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake (yeah, i had to look up furikake to know what it was... i'm not ashamed to admit it), crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. the ingredients gave it a rich, sweet, unique flavor and the crispy yam bits a crunchy texture. if i have any complaint about this burger it's the height of it. the thick patty and huge slices of avocado make it difficult to get the whole thing in your mouth (didn't macauley culkin say the same thing to mj?).\n\nmy wife got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> ($17.50) - dry aged beef sirloin with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli. she loved it and only let me have one bite. if you want a more traditional burger, go for this. but, i still thought <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> was better.\n\neach burger came with an order of fries. so she got the regular fries and i got he steak cut fries. both were very good -- crispy exterior, light and soft interior.\n\nour son got the kid's chicken fingers and fries. that's always a winner with him. it came with 3 big tenders and some carrots and celery.\n\neven after those big burgers we still had room for dessert. our choice... lollipops. the chocolate brownie and strawberry were excellent. the lemon meringue and <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> were largely forgettable and uninspired and the blondie was bland and didn't come close to reminding me of a blondie brownie.\n\ndespite the lackluster dessert, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were so good i can overlook that misstep. we didn't have any issues with the service, especially the kitchen, which sent out the food surprisingly fast. i'm not sure if i'd say this is my favorite burger place, but it's definitely one of the top and one that shouldn't be missed.", 
            "awesome burgers and sides. shakes were fine, but save the belly room for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. we had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. both were incredible, perfectly cooked, and had an very cool mix of burger additions, such as tempura avocado. \n\ngreat spot for lunch and a 5 minute wait!! highly recommended.", 
            "holsteins is a little pricey for what you get, but the shakes and burgers are really good.  i ate here with my family for a birthday celebration, and was impressed with the food that we got.  the menu is setup interestingly and can be a little confusing at first.  we got some pretty good flavored popcorn as a little appetizer.\n\nthe kids menu is simple and decent as my son had two mini burgers with fries.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were good and the fries are well prepared.  i would like a softer bun on the mini burgers though.  fried green tomatoes are ok and not worth the price in my opinion (worst thing we ordered).  my wife had the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" burger with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> as no duck fat fries were offered.  the aged beef was really good and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> had great flavor overall (4 stars).  i actually like the buns they use for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> as they are somewhat soft and taste good.  she also had the \"power shake\" which was amazing as it was a good mix between shake and drinking yogurt (5 stars).  i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger with <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> and a brown cow (<mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with pop rocks).  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was great but overcooked as i wanted medium and got medium well (4.5 stars).  <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were a disappointment as i expected better (3 stars).  if you want a good dipping sauce ask for the spicy mayo used in <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger and add a little ketchup to it for a good sauce for your fries and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>.  the brown cow was really good as they use a good <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> and ice cream for it (4 stars).  you get a lot of shake which is nice and the pop rocks are kind of fun addition to the drink.  \n\nholsteins has decent service great shakes and some great hamburgers.  if the price and some of the items were better i would give this place five stars, but with some ok items and a somewhat hefty price i give them four stars.  great food and worth eating here once while in vegas if not more often depending on what you like to eat.  i want to try some of the other burgers and shakes though.", 
            "cool vibe.  great people watching.  expensive.  i got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, which came with shoestring fries.  both were great.  friendly service.  they had a dj on a monday night.  the music was thumpin', but really added to the whole experience.", 
            "we stayed at the cosmoplitan hotel and were pretty excited to have a this in our hotel.  the night we went, we placed a to--go order to take back to our room.  bad mistake!!!  we had about 5 of us, that ordered a variety of food... probably totalling over $200.  not only did it take about 40-minutes to get our order but most of the order was wrong.  i ordered potato chips w/ onion dip, a salad and a burger.  the potato chip order was sad... i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.  the salad, never happened... it was an order of pita chips and guacamole when i got back to my room.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>... i got the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.  i couldn't stomach the flavor and had to stop eating it after a few bites.  i seriously would have called to complain but i didnt have another 30-40 minutes for them to figure out a solution.  probably wouldn't ever come back here because the service was horrible this night and the food was not worth the money.", 
            "probably one of the worst places that calls themselves a burger joint, my boyfriend and i decided to give this place a try so we ordered a couple of things we had the duck fat fries, the chicken and waffles and 2 different burgers. \n\n let's just say the duck fat fries were the biggest disappointment, they definitely need to do some research and find out what duck fat fries should be. the chicken and waffles was soooo bad, and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.... let's not even go there.... so bad\n\nso i stupidly decided to give it another try, i ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, i ordered it medium, and it showed up 2 minutes after i had ordered it.... meaning that it had been precooked... who knows how long that burger had been sitting because they were not busy enough to keep precooked burgers, and they don't even grind their own meat!!! yeah i couldn't finish it, and i can say i'm never going back, nor would i recommend this place to anyone.", 
            "i had nothing but high hopes for holsteins, sadly my dining experience did not live up to expectations. it wasn't that the food was bad, it was actually good. what killed the experience for me was the horrifically bad service and the ridiculously loud music.\n\ni arrived at holsteins at about 9:15pm on a monday night, walked up to the hostess desk, and after being ignored for a few minutes was \"greeted\" by the snottiest hostess in the whole world. after some exasperated sighing and excessive eye-rolling i was told that they were full, the waiting list was full, and they wouldn't even take my name for the waiting list until after 9:30. boom, that was it....and then she walked away. we were aghast! wtf? oh, game on! so, i walked 3 feet away, pulled out my phone, and looked at opentable.com. oh hey, look at that...there are reservations available for holsteins...now. i promptly made a reservation for 4, pushed send, got my confirmation, and walked the 3 feet back to the hostess desk. phone in hand and with a gigantic smile on my face i greeted the snotty hostess and said i had a reservation. she once again grunted and rolled her eyes saying, \"oh, are you carrie?\" after i happily confirmed that i was indeed carrie...the carrie with the 9:30pm opentable reservation snotty hostess said, \"i saw that you just made the reservation. (eyes rolling up a storm) there is a long waiting list, but because you just made a reservation i will put your name at the top of the list. but just to let you know, it might take 20 minutes or more to get you a table.\" i honestly have never encountered a more snotty, hostile, and unaccommodating hostess anywhere. it would serve holsteins well to hire hostesses with temperaments more appropriate for the position.\n\nhere is what we ordered:\n\nbam-boozled \"shakes\" all $11.00\n\n<mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>\nfrozen grasshopper\ncereal bowl\nblack cow\n\nthey were all fine...nothing special and not very boozey. fyi, the black cow is a float not a shake, despite the fact it is not marked as such.\n\nburgers:\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> $17.50 - \nlonghorn $16.00\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> $16.50\n\nall <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were cooked perfectly and they were tasty, but the toppings were very skimpy. i have indeed \"experienced better.\" they are served with fries...two of us chose shoestring fries and one upgraded to <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. sadly, both types of fries were mediocre at best. additionally we ordered the fried green tomatoes which were also mediocre.\n\nour server was fine, but not fantastic. the music was so loud we could barely hear the waitress or carry on a conversation. overall our experience was a less than stellar one. the experience with the snotty hostess put a taint on the evening and there was nothing that happened during the rest of our dinner that made up for it. there are way too many other restaurants in las vegas with bigger, better burgers and better service. i will not be returning, unless it is to punch the snotty hostess in the face (i kid! i kid!)", 
            "let me start by saying that i am not a \"cool\" person, so when i approached holsteins for dinner i thought i would feel out of place.  it turned out to be a very enjoyable, memorable experience.\n\nthe restaurant is on the second floor of the chic cosmopolitan hotel which is packed with the young and hp on a saturday night.  the restaurant was crowded when we arrived, and the hostess was not accepting names for a table.  however, we were told we could wait in the bar area and visit her again in a half hour to inquire about a table.\n\ni'm not sure if this is typical, but it seems like a smart business decision on their part -- to get the guests into the bar to buy drinks first.  it worked for my party.\n\nwe actually ordered two appetizers from the bar: fried green tomatoes and lobster macaroni & cheese.  both were excellent, but the macaroni and cheese is other worldly good.\n\nholstein's \"adult\" shakes all sounded incredibly delicious -- about ten to fifteen listed options including everything from cap'n crunch to chocolate covered pop rocks.  i settled on their \"brown cow\" which has <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, vanilla ice cream, pop rocks and rum.  it was wonderful.\n\nafter about 45 minutes in the bar, we finally got a table in the restaurant.  i got the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" burger which -- though not fancy -- was delicious.  the three people in my party each ordered different burgers and different fries (shoestring, steak and sweet potato).  we shared and loved it all.\n\nwith dinner, i had the red sangria which was wonderful.  i tried my friend's white sangria which was light and refreshing.\n\ni would definitely recommend holsteins and would return the next time in las vegas.\n\nfinal word to the wise: the bar is loud.  the music is cranked so incredibly high that i am shocked hotels across the street couldn't hear it.  conversation in the bar is strained at best.  once in the restaurant, the music is less assaultive, but the wood-clad restaurant is also naturally loud.  this is a fun restaurant -- but not one to relax and converse in.", 
            "the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger here was amazing. really, just bursting with robust savory flavor. not too salty - which is how you know the meat here is really high quality.\n\n18 bucks for a burger seems high, but its worth it. and besides, when you come to vegas you don't do it cause its cheap. you do it to live it up a little bit. \n\ni really liked this burger. i head they're gonna take holstein's national - i think a spot in la is on the horizon....i hope so.",

            "hands down the best burger place in town. i am writing this review after the 2nd time coming here...forgive me...i am a very busy person with 2 crazy monkeys to raise...yelp kinda takes a back seat. \ni was lucky enough to come here a second time with my bestest foodie friend, rob m. (ll cool mack if you're nasty) for a belated birthday dinner (i told you i was a busy girl). it wasn't very crowded and we were seated right away. on our way back to our table i spotted the server we had last time...the lovely noelle. noelle is what every server should aspire to be. she is knowledgeable, genuinely caring about your experience (my monkeys loved her) and an all around cool person. if you are smart you will trust her recommendations (she's batting for 1000 after 2 visits). we had the most amazing food:\n-new belgium hoptober beer\n-lobster truffle mac n' cheese (a must...you will be licking the plate clean)\n-mini sliders with beef tenderloin, fois gras, arugula, truffle mayo and a <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark> demi glaze (they are small but bursting with flavor)\n-the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger (what they are famous for...i can see why)\n-the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> adult milkshake (so tasty, not super boosy...even gave some to the monkeys. they loved it)\n-maple glazed donuts with vanilla cream filling and bacon bits on top (holy cow i died and went to heaven).\n\nnow the downside....this place isn't a fast food restaurant. good food is worth the wait and you will wait a bit here. i appreciated the wait time in between courses so i could digest and really enjoy all my food. if you are in a hurry don't come here...you will be bummed. also...its kinda pricey but well worth it in my mind. you are looking at around $60 per person depending on what you drink. if you can't afford it...don't eat here...simple as that. \n\ni will be back soon and hopefully miss noelle will be our girl again.", 
            "ok, lets keep this in perspective.  if you want a great dining experience, this isn't the place.  if you want a big menu to choose from, nope... not here.\n\nif you want a great burger.... this is the place!  yes, it's a bit expensive, but hey, it's vegas!  i had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, and it was fantastic!  don't put ketchup on it, eat it just the way it comes out.  it could have used a bit more bacon, but that's knit picking.  it was a great burger, and while expensive, the samuel smith organic apple cider is a great way to top it off!", 
            "holstein's is a must if one finds himself in las vegas. granted i was in an \"altered\" state of mind, but damn, words don't do this place justice. if the phrase, \"too much flavor\" ever had a face, it would be mr. holstein himself. my friend and i both had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and it definitely lived up to that standard. savory, fresh, and rich. don't miss out friends! indulgence has a new location and it's at the 2nd floor of the cosmopolitan hotel in las vegas.", 
            "another featured burger in the \"vegas seven\" magazine\". came here to have the obvious..\n\nafter i ordered the bartender replied: \"that's what we're known for.. it was ranked top 5 in the nation..\"\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> with steak cut fries: <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came out perfectly constructed and everything looked proportioned from the top to bottom. looked like a \"lbs burger or bachi burger\".. well, come to find out this place was related to \"lbs\", same chef.. it came with dry aged beef sirloin, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, garlic-chive aioli on a kinda sweet bun.. the medley of flavors worked pretty well but just like \"lbs\" and even bachi burger, i was not blown away. just merely satisfied.. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> patty wasn't that flavorful but had a nice texture. it was all <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> toppings that gave it some life. overall, it just didn't do it for me..\n\nsteak cut fries: awesome! delicate light crunchy skin and inside had a crumbly fine mashed potato textured consistency. loved it!\n\nservice outstanding, atmosphere fun (probably would of been even more fun with one of their insane alcohol shake blends!), value was fair (pricey ingredients but <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> didn't deliver much flavor) but i liked the fries! =/", 
            "this was by far the best burger i've ever had!!! i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger and the meat was sooo moist!  i loved the teriyaki glaze, tempura avocado, and yam crisps.  such an interesting and unique blend of flavors.  my boyfriend got the campfire s'more bam-boozled shake which was delicious and the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was smokey and rich and the aged goat cheddar cheese, bacon and arugula brought it all together.  \n\nholsteins will surely become our go-to amazing meal spot in vegas.  sooooooo good!  why does it have to be so far away?", 
            "i make it a point to try all the fancy burger places that pop up in vegas.   \n\nholsteins is definitely one of the best.   i'd say <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are probably better then burger bar @ mandalay bay.  and i'd probably end up frequenting holsteins more then burger bar due to the cosmo being in a much better location on the strip.\n\ni got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> which is the sirloin burger with all the trimings.   i knew <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> wasn't going to disappoint after the first bite of the nicely toasted bun.  you cannot believe how many burger places fail to toast the buns correctly.  \n\nthe aged goat cheddar was a little too much though i think.   halfway into <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and the taste of the cheese was getting old.  it might have been better with just regular aged cheddar.    i did find that adding some horseradish to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was a nice compliment to the goat cheese.\n\nyou'd think a good burger would be easy to make but a lot of places fail.  you want to be able to taste <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> patty, the cheese, the bacon, and whatever else is on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> both distinctly and as a combination.  a lot of places make their burgers so you can only taste one or two of the ingredients.   holsteins does a good job of creating a \"complete\" burger experience  :)\n\nthe other main attraction of holsteins is the alcoholic shakes.  they were ok i guess,  none of the shakes really have much alcohol in them so to me these are basically just regular shakes.", 
            "i have lived in vegas for 10 years.  this is by far the best \"high-end\" burger place in town.  you can get a beer, burger and fries for under $20.  a real bargain on the strip.  try the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, amazing.", 
            "burgers, shakes, and more burgers....\n\nfirst being a popcorn lover, you can only imagine my excitement when the waitress dropped off some complimentary cheddar popcorn to start our meal! \n\nbasically this place is the biz for its gourmet burgers and alcoholic shakes.  i went here twice in one day, that's how much i liked <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and shakes.  there's other stuff like truffle lobster mac n cheese and interesting snacks like pizza \"twinkies\", <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>, fried green tomatoes and kalbi beef with kimchee quesadillas.  they also have sliders as well.  i'll def. be back to try these.\n\ni had the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> shake and a taste of my friend's <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake....both sooooo gooooood!  \n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>- juicy meat and i surprisingly liked the combination.  \nkorean \"bull\"gogi- juicy meat, i liked the flavor of this.  if you like bulgogi, you'll love this.\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark>- so i thought this was kinda dry, plus i\"m not really into goat cheese so i didn't like it as much.  but my bro loved it.\nburgers were pretty decent in size, i was stuffed after one and the guys were satisfied after theirs.  burgers also come with a choice of shoestring fries or steak cut fries, both were deelish. \nthey also have a pretty decent stocked bar and a selection of beer that my fiance enjoyed.\n\nthese gourmet burgers are pricey, 13-17.5 bucks.  shakes are around 11 bucks.  but it's vegas and the food was great, so in that case i didn't mind!  i recommend checking this place out if you're in the mood for some tasty burgers and shakes...", 
            "i'll give it a 3.5.\n\ncame here on a busy night, but was seated rather promptly. the place was hectic with a dj playing and a gathering crowd lining up outside of the marquee.\n\nthe menu has some really good looking things on it, but everything is pretty damn expensive.\n\ni went with the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger and a side of <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was cooked to a perfect medium rare. it was really juicy and rich and had great flavor. all of the accompaniments worked well together, but worth 17.50? not sure about that, then again it is vegas.\n\nthe <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were also pretty damn good. nice batter and seasoning with a great crunch to them. would get them again..\n\noverall i was pretty pleased with holsteins. nothing was amazing or lifechanging, but a pretty great spot for burgers and shakes although you are going to be spending some $$$", 
            "read the menu online and had heard a lot of good things about this spot, so i figured i check it out.  plus anywhere that offers <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> on their menu gets a thumbs up from me.  i ordered the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>, a chocolate shake and a <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger.  <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>.....meh.  it had great texture, but i was looking for a slightly saltier finish.  the herb-caper mayo was really good though.  the chocolate shake, although a bit expensive, was good.  the valrhona pearls were a nice textural touch.  and now to the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger.  i loved the texture of the bun and my burger was cooked perfectly.  the arugula was great balance to the sweetness of the tomato confit.  the flavor of the beef really stood out.  the shoe string fries were very good too with great crunch.  very well executed burger.....expensive......but good", 
            "been to holsteins about 4 times now, and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger is my fave burger so far; tasty, crispy, slightly salty, and overall yummie! the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger had too much going on, and it fell apart after a couple bites. and the korean 'bull'gogi, with kimchee slaw, actually tasted sweet instead of spicy that kimchee is suppose to be. as far as the spiked shakes, i had the frozen grasshopper which was sweet and not very 'spiked.' and the service is quick, and the atmosphere is loud and bar-like.", 
            "did someone say fancy hamburgers and alcoholic milkshakes?  this is the definitive upscale vegas burger joint with a pricey menu and coffee table dining arrangements.  sure you could go across the street and stuff your face for 1/10 of the price at fatburger, but you wouldn't feel sexy like you do here.\n\nfrom the high class cheddar popcorn served in a stainless steel bucket to the wildly over priced beers on tap, you can rest assured you're dining on the vegas strip when you pay the check.\n\neverything we ordered was on a level above.  from the perfectly cooked thick cut bacon to the freshest avocado that tasted like it came straight from your mother's garden.  just reading the menu will have your mouth salivating and anyone who loves food will appreciate the interesting and creative combinations displayed in their menu.\n\nit was a tough decision but i went forth with the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>.  how could i pass up an awesome dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli?  oh man, my mouth is salivating just thinking about it!\n\nthe <mark>French Fries</mark> were fresh and the attention to detail was impressive.  our food arrived in perfect photogenic state and we didn't hesitate to flash a few photos of those beautiful burgers to honor the day.  taking time to masticate our fine fare and truly savoring our meals only added to the experience.  a few beers later our very attentive wait staff had us mulling over the dessert menu.  any other meal with a lesser burger and dessert victory would have been mine.  however, this burger deserved to be tasted the rest of the night.\n\nhere's to expensive burgers!  cheers!",

            "a bit of yelp research led us to have a late lunch at holsteins during our trip, and we were definitely not disappointed.\n\nit was a monday afternoon, around 2pm, so it wasn't too busy. we chose to sit in the lounge and i was surprised that our service was much better than foursquare told me it would be - our waitress was quick with menus and water, and our food came out of the kitchen at a pretty standard speed.\n\nwe started with a <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> and a black cow. my bf is notoriously picky about milkshakes, and claims that the monkey is the best milkshake he's ever had. i doubled checked because that seemed like a big claim for him, but he stood by it. both shakes were really delicious, and my black cow didn't seem too boozy, but it must've had plenty of that cherry vodka, because i could taste cherry pretty well. the menu seems to have been adjusted from the one on their website, i think a few of the shakes were different but not the ones we wanted, so it didn't really bother me.\n\nwe also ordered the pizza twinkies - it was either that or <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>, but we can get those everywhere in florida, so we went with what would be more unique. they were really yummy, and the marinara dipping sauce was also delicious.\n\nburger-wise, i had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and the bf had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, both cooked medium. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> did not disappoint from the rave reviews online - their teriyaki sauce was freakishly delicious,  and the spicy mayo was just the right amount of spicy (the two mixed together were amaaaazing on my fries). the avocado was a little unwieldy, and i would have preferred a few thin slices. i didn't think the avocado needed to be tempura'd, either, but i guess i get the appeal.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was almost completely devoured by the time i got a bite, so i guess he enjoyed it. both the shoestring and the steak fries were awesome, i couldn't stop eating either of them. super crispy and delicious.\n\ni can't think of any reason to give holsteins less than 5 stars besides the price (a bit high for burgers but honestly reasonable for the strip) and the fact that there isn't one in orlando.", 
            "food:  \n\nthey start you off with some flavored popcorn as a free appetizer.\n\n<mark>Campfire Smores</mark> shake (virgin):  a little on the sweet side, but what did i expect ordering smores? i wish they included more than one toasted marshmallow.\n\ncrispy pork belly bun:  the pork belly was a bit too dry. it didn't taste very authentic, so this was probably my least favorite dish.\n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> hamburger:  after looking through yelp reviews, most people recommended <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> hamburger, so we ordered it and it was by far the best hamburger. very juicy and the flavors are just right.\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger:  not the best hamburger i've ever had, but it was satisfactory. tomato confit, aged goat cheese, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, garlic chive aoili, arugula...you would think it was the best hamburger ever created, but it was just okay. \n\n\napple pie a la mode:  so interesting! they come in these dumpling shapes and you squeeze the frosting out of toothpaste looking containers! comes with vanilla and ginger. you should order it!",

            "while the rest of our friends were getting ready to go clubbing later that night, a couple of my buddies and i decided to grab some burgers before going bar hopping around fremont street.  i originally wanted to check out holstein's after seeing them on our last vegas trip, but there wasn't an opportunity to go since we had already planned out the rest of our meals.  after i read yelp friend cat c.'s review though, i told my friends it was a must for our next trip!\n\nalthough some yelpers have complained about how long the wait was for a table, we didn't run into the same problem.  luck must have been on our side because not only did it take just a few minutes until we were seated, but we also got a server (jennifer?) who was both awesome and way cute.  double win!  a bunch of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> on the menu sounded pretty appealing (especially <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, the steakhouse, and korean \"bull\"gogi), but somehow the three of us managed to order the exact same thing - the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> (dry aged beef sirloin with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic chive aioli) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p7pxqfqr7ybkmmi2j51udw?select=verdaowpafm6pp_ufdmjeq).\n\nthe patty was cooked perfectly - just a touch of pink on the inside, juicy, and a light char on the outside.  adding in the <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark> just made it that much better (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p7pxqfqr7ybkmmi2j51udw?select=t6cdvih3qcnh95l9pnfava).  while all of the condiments worked really well together, i have to admit all that aged goat cheddar got to be a bit much.  not bad for the first half of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, but i was reminded during the last half why i'm not a huge fan of goat cheese.  we all agreed though that the biggest knock was the bun - a bit dry and pretty plain.  just making it smaller and less airy would have gone a long way.\n\nall things considered, the prices for their burgers aren't unreasonable.  at about $13-$18 each, you actually get your money's worth for the most part (unlike china poblano next door...).  whichever one you get though, i'd suggest choosing the shoestring fries to go with it (they're more like regular cut fries than \"shoestring\").  while the tin of steak fries that came with my order were fine, i thought the shoestring fries my friend had were crispier and a little more flavorful.  now i just have to go back and try one of holstein's shakes - preferably of the alcoholic variety.", 
            "<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was amazing!!! <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> was a little too sweet, but the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was perfect. expensive ass burgers, but very well worth it. tasteful, full of juice and flavor. i usually like my meat medium rare, but the waitress recommend rare stating that medium rare would be really red and bloody. ummmmmm it was not red enough! burgers were still good but wished it was more red. staff was very friendly, and there was no wait at all during lunch time. fries weren't that great, but i need to try the shakes next time.", 
            "came here twice on our most recent trip to vegas.  a burger will run about $18.  first time i had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>.  it was like named, a pretty standard burger.  our party also tried the lobster mac & cheese, it was too watered down.  the redeeming factors are a whole bunch of other entrees and burgers though.  i had the kimchee quesdilla the second day, it was perfection.  i'm not sure what burgers my friends ordered the second day, but again, it was more memorable than what we had for dinner the previous night.  they also have shoe string fries.  yum.  service is slow........we were starving and it took about 40 minutes for the food to come out after we ordered.", 
            "my husband and i went to holsteins for lunch on a monday, around 12pm. we didn't have to wait at all for a table. i had the best burger of my life (the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>) at this place...it may have set me back $17.50, but it was worth every penny (well, i suppose it didn't set me back quite that much since we had a groupon, but i would gladly go back and pay full price for that burger). they brought out smoked cheddar popcorn when we arrived. quite tasty. my husband got the wings, which were a generous sized portion and also very good. the fries were also crispy and delicious. \n\ngo. get the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger. oh, and <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake milkshake.", 
            "i've been to this place nearly a dozen times and still haven't written a review.. oops. while my favorite burger lives at the barrymore (same owners as holsteins!), holsteins has become my favorite burger joint. i highly recommend the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\", but honestly everything i've tried has been fabulous. \n\ni'm a bit bummed the pizza twinkies are no longer around, but the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> is a nice addition. honestly i make yummier <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> at home, but it's nice to have someone else make it for you :) \n\nlastly, i urge you to try the delicious shakes! <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake one is amazing, but my favorite is the first one on the menu (monkey something or other) with peanut butter and banana. yum. with or without booze, these shakes are amazing!\n\nfrom the free smoked cheddar popcorn at the beginning, to the tasty burgers, to the yummy shakes - this is one of the yummier places to get a pricey burger on the strip! while burger bar was the first, holsteins is my pick for the current best !", 
            "so here's the thing: i love this place, but i'm teetering on 3 stars. if there were 3.5, i'd give it that. when we first visited this place not long after it opened, we raved and told everyone how amazing it was.  and their burgers are very good. very, very good.\n\nbut, we've gone a handful of times now and the last few, i've been kind of embarrassed that we raved so much about it to the guests we brought with us. our server, the last two times, hasn't offered us our locals discount (even though we introduced ourselves as locals when we sat down). the first time, we didn't know and another server is the one who asked if we got our discount. the second time, we pointed it out on the bill and he went back and took it off.\n\nbut the guy who served us the last two times, while nice enough, was more interested in chatting with the hostesses than bringing us popcorn or refilling our water or pretty much anything. and we were seated in this corner so if we wanted to get anyone's attention, we'd have to get up and poke our heads around the side to flag him down.\n\nhe (or the kitchen, can't be sure) slathered my turkey burger in russian dressing, despite me asking for it on the side twice -- in fact, the server and i had a whole conversation that went something like this:\n\nme: \"could i please have the russian dressing on the side or not at all?\"\n\nhim: \"so, look, do you want it or not?\"\n\nlook, flo, i don't want it at all, i was just trying to be flexible. instead, i had to wait while my friends ate so they could de-russian my turkey burger, which if i'm being honest, wasn't that great. (the turkey burger sliders are also a snooze, skip 'em.)\n\nmy other beef (no pun intended) with this place is the volume. i appreciate that it's vegas and that people are there to par-tay, etc, but i'd like to eat my dinner without having to scream across the table. and this is in the dining room, not even in the lounge area, where it's seriously hearing-damage territory and the bass rumbles under your ass while you're trying to enjoy your sliders. it's just not my jam, so to speak.\n\ni can highly recommend the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, both of which are delectable and worth every penny. i like their wedge-cut fries, as well.  two of my friends have told me the <mark>Captain Hook</mark> salmon burger is also really good.  \n\nother high points: the decor is interesting and creative, and aside from this one lackluster server and the occasional snooty hostess, the staff is warm and welcoming. they menu has expanded as well and they've got a lot of interesting choices. they're great at their social media, too. love that.  \n\noverall, i do really like holstein's and am rather bummed to review it this way.a year ago, it would've been at least 4.", 
            "the cosmopolitan features fancy, expensive places: nightclub can set you back $50 for certain events, wicked spoon is nearly $40, stk will set you back at least $50 for a hearty meal, the clothing is expensive, etc.\n\nmake no mistake, the shakes, burgers, cocktails, and beer is overpriced at this place but compared to other venues in the cosmopolitan, holsteins is a great value. i ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and that was a dam good burger. \n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> also got rave reviews from my friends along with the shakes. the ambiance of the place feels like i'm in some cartoon network-like place, which is pretty cool, i feel. \n\nif you're eating at the cosmopolitan, chances are you're going to spend a lot of money. if you're looking for the best value for your dollar in this hotel, make it holsteins.", 
            "so i stayed in the cosmo from march 8-12 and this was the first restaurant that we decided to dine in. honestly wasn't planning on it but some friends from las vegas wanted to meet up here.\n\nfirst impression....ambiance, music, decor were all spectacularly modern. place seemed like the spot to be for a friday night bite. we were seated immediately (arrived at 7ish). the beer list is top notch and that is a huge deal for me when i am getting the evening started. took us a while to all decide on what we should eat. seemed like the server got a bit frustrated with our inability to make decisions.\n\ni went with the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, based on the servers recommendation. i have never had a dry aged burger, but boy am i craving one now holy smokes. dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli....i usually like to dry dog my meat....not one for lubrication as far as condiments and such go. but they did a fantastic job focusing on not slopping up such a delightful cut... er uh grind of beef. pretty close to the best burger i have ever sunk my teeth into. didnt even get around to polishing off the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>....first ones i have ever had that were actually crispy...i understand how dificult it is to crispify a sweet potato fry.\n\nserver really pushed the spiked shakes...but i was so full....he said \"dude i can put it in a to-go cup for you\"....i caved into the raspberry cheesecake shake it was damn good....even after a night in the freezer...vodka shake is good for breakfast boys and girls.\n\n****server cheesed it up by fist bumping me*****\nthought that was kinda lame but whatever\n\neat \nat\nthis\nplace\nwhen\ngoing\non\na\nbender\nin\nlas\nvegas!", 
            "until about 5 minutes ago my review for holstein's was \"awesome food, tasted so good, i just can't remember what we ate!\" - don't judge. it was our last supper of a 10 day showing family around vegas trip.\n\nhaving pieced together the pieces of the dining experience i find that the memories come flooding back. we were seated rather late on a saturday evening promptly and efficiently. the server (his name? please, i can barely remember what i ate!) was good and guided us appropriately through the menu. we had ahi poke and artichoke guac (this i remember being very good!).\n\ni ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger which was delicious, the tomato confit sweet and the goats cheese tart - perfect combo! hubby had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> which he said he wouldn't order again.\n\nmy 1 gripe is, for the most part our fault. we were looking forward to trying the \"bam-boozled shakes\" however we found that dining late at night the shake preparer leaves for the evening. unfortunately the shake preparer was also the dessert preparer, so no dessert or shakes for us. however this does provide the perfect excuse to return which we would be more than happy to do!", 
            "good burgers & shakes, especially the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger. would be so much better if the service was more consistent. servers often disappear for long periods of time and drinks are left unfilled for too long.", 
            "when you are in the mood for a burger and want something with a creative spin, there are plenty of options in this town. this is certainly one of the top ten.\n\nyou'll love the environment here. it's got a trendy, unique array of decor, much like the rest of the cosmo. sort of a street art style. \nthe waiter will definitely pressure you to have alcohol, which is as you'd expect, a bit expensive here. we weren't in the mood for any drinks at the time and were feeling pretty cheap with our groupon in hand so we politely declined. he recommended their award winning <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger for myself, and their asian style burger for my girlfriend. i must say that they both came out heavenly.\n\nmine was a savory, sirloin steak patty served on blue cheese, arrugula and tomato. i substituted an egg in place of the bacon. not particularly unique but what can i say-- it was love at first bite. the meat just melted off <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with each bite, the arrugala complimented the rest of the flavors so well. i devoured every last bit, including the steak fries, which are noteworthy here. something about the way they cook their steak fries gives them this dark brown hue, much like the potato logs that you can get at the grocery deli. i absolutely love this style and much prefer it over the yellow, solid texture of the steak fries at fatburger or golden steer.\n\nlet me also say that my girlfriends meal was absolutely delightful as well. i ended up finishing the last 1/3 of her burger made with kobe beef and drizzled with a tasty sweet teriyaki glaze. damn good but i prefer a similar one i had at bachi. i still think that as far as asian style burgers go, you are better off making a trip to bachi burger, but for anything else you ought to give this place a try. \n\nperhaps i wouldn't have been so enthusiastic about the food if i had paid full price. this place is far from cheap and my groupon really helped lessen the burden on my wallet. still, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was just so memorable that i could very well see myself coming back here when i'm in the cosmo again. and we haven't tried the shakes so i guess that alone is a good reason to come back. i thoroughly enjoyed this place and i am confident that you will too--give it a shot.", 
            "been here a couple times and it's a must if you're hankering for a burger. \n\n- <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>: kobe beef with a tempura avocado, genius. i ask for the teriyaki glaze on the side because it's too sweet for me and i also add a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> ($1). it's freaking awesome - just get it already. \n- <mark>Gold Standard</mark>: the aged goat cheddar cheese was too overpowering for me. it's good just not as good as <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>.\n- korean bullgogi: the kimchi was good. a little on the sweet side. \n\nbottom line - just get <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. i prefer the steak fries out of the shoestring fries, <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> and steak fries but they're all really good. \n\nshakes: don't make the mistake i did and get them to-go. you do not get as much as you would dining in and everyone knows the best part of a shake is that extra in the silver mixing cup. \n- cereal: my favorite so far and i like the captain crunch. \n- cow float: pop rocks sounded cool. that's it - just a float. \n- <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>: like eating a candy bar  if that's what you want. \n\noverall, good burgers but at a price. if you were lucky and snagged a groupon, nice because after talking with the manager, it doesn't seem like they plan on doing it again.", 
            "wow.  one of the best burgers i've had in a very long time, and the overall meal was exceptional and reasonably priced.  went with a buddy of mine for a late lunch, expecting to pop in and out, but this was a meal worth savoring.  i got the lobster truffled mac & cheese to start, which was slightly runnier than i would have liked, due to what the waiter referred to as \"copious amounts of tellagio and mascarp<mark>One <mark>Two Dollar Cheese</mark></mark>\", but the dish was flavorful and solid.\n\nthe real treat however was <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  my friend and i both had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, his without the goat cheddar in favor of regular cheddar, and mine with.  they were both cooked perfectly, which is hard to do when you get an order for \"extremely rare, and i mean mooing\", but they nailed it.  they nailed my medium rare as well, and the combination of the tomato confit in place of standard tomato (simply brilliant idea, why have i not seen that done before?) and the strong cheese combined with a thick, juicy, perfectly prepared piece of bacon and garlic-chive aoili made it the first burger i haven't put ketchup on in i can't even remember how long, and i'm so glad i did.  ketchup would have destroyed this exquisitely crafted creation.\n\ndespite the raving, i considered giving this review 4 starts rather than 5 due to the consistency of the appetizer and the over-saltiness of the steak fries that came with my burger, but ultimately, those trivial details pale in comparison to the awesome that was that burger.  if you're in vegas, and you're looking for a meal that won't break your budget and will give you plenty to talk about, try out holsteins.  you will not be sorry.  also, if waitresses that are easy on the eyes are your thing, i suggest sitting at the bar and ordering from there.",

            "i've been looking forward to trying holstein's since reading an article on their unique and exceptional desserts. i finally got there last night, and boy was i excited. i'd read positive reviews and food suggestions earlier in the day so i knew exactly what i wanted. to my surprise, it was dinnertime on friday and we got seated right away. there were several open tables, but the hostess seated us at one of the smallest tables in the restaurant...and the top of it wobbled when we moved our arms. my husband ordered a $6 <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> and i got the $11 cereal bowl shake. my husband's glass was dirty and he asked to exchange it with a clean one...no apology, but at least the 2nd glass was clean. my shake was good, but i couldn't taste the flavored vodka at all. i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger medium-well and my husband got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> medium-rare, both with steakfries. when <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> arrived, they looked delicious, but not nearly as \"pretty\" as in the photos in the gallery on their website. i tried a crispy fry first and burned the roof of my mouth...those little metal pails must really hold in the heat!? both of our burgers were tasty, but came overcooked. and my beef patty was a lot thinner than i anticipated. i think <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are called \"big buns\" because the bun's bigger than <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fixin's! the waitress brought our bill without asking if we wanted dessert...the main reason why i wanted to try the place! i told her we wanted to order the candy store, and she said, \"oh, since you ordered the shake, i just figured you wouldn't want dessert too. most people don't get both.\" it might've been all the cool piggy artwork surrounding me, but that was a bit offensive and made me feel like a lil' piggy! the dessert was the best part of the meal...especially the shooters on <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>. it was fun eating cotton candy in a restaurant! it was adorable! but i wouldn't say their handmade candies are worth $15. i probably won't return to holstein's after dropping $81 at the mediocre burger joint with fun desserts. atmosphere was fun and artwork was amazing!

            "my wife and i went here for a late dinner while on our anniversary vacation in vegas. after a 25 minute wait, we were finally seated. it was crowded and loud with people and the music. the walls had humurous cartoon murals of a pig in a cow suit doing hilarious things...much funnier than the chik-fil-a cows!\nthe food was very good and delicious! my wife ordered the blueberry pie shake without <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> in it (we're pregnant) and it was just as good as eating the pie itself! apparently all the shakes can be made with out alcohol, which makes it a bit more helpful if you have kids in tow, although the crowd seemed to be mostly young partiers at that time of night.\n\nshe ordered the chicago dogs which came in 3 mini hot dogs, they were flavorful and the bun was really tender. i took the server's advice and tried the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger (which was one of the number one rated burgers on the lv strip so i was told). it was very good and juicy full of flavor and on a good bun. the shoestring fries came out a bit cold. everything was pricey as expected for a restaurant in the cosmopolitan but the quality was all there along with the service. overall, minus the loud noise and the wait time, it was worth the good tasting food!",

            "every time i try to come here, the wait is always ridiculous.  i never remember to make reservations either cause, well, it's a burger place!  finally, this past weekend around 2pm, after a somewhat \"short\" wait of 40 minutes, i got to try holsteins.\n\nit actually took the 4 of us awhile to look through the menu, and in the end, i went with the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, which is a burger with dry aged beef sirloin burger, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli.  i ordered it medium rare and came with a nice pink middle.  what really caught my attention about the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was the dry aged beef, since dry aging beef condenses the beef flavor, and wow that burger was juicy.  out of all 4 burgers, mine was the only one that had juices dripping down my fingers, even versus the kobe beef burgers!\n\nthe toppings were all great, especially the aged goat cheddar.  you can tell it's a little different than your normal cheddar.  the garlic-chive aioli has a mellow garlic taste.  besides hoping the bacon was a little bit crispier, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> is really a burger that's up there in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> world.  it's just a very tasty burger and i can see why it is so popular!\n\ni also tried a bit of <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, as well as the korean bull-gogi.  <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> is more of an asian fusion burger, with teriyaki glaze and a tempura avocado that sits on top of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  it also has a kobe beef patty, so the whole burger had this velvety smooth texture thanks to the fatty patty and the smooth creamy avocado!  i would like a bit more teriyaki sauce though.\n\nas for the korean bull-gogi burger, the patty is marinated to give it extra flavor.  the best part is definitely the <mark>Fried Egg</mark> that sits on top.  who can resist the egg yolk just running all over the kimchi slaw and the beef patty??\n\nout of all the fries, i liked the steak cut fries the most.  crunchy exterior with a creamy potato center.  <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were great as well.  the shoestring fries were a little stale to me.\n\nnow, with shakes as part of its name, we knew we had to try a few of their shakes and ended up getting the black cow float and the frozen grasshopper.  black cow float is a fun and somewhat nostalgic shake since it is more like a coke flat with the ice cream rather than a true shake.  it even comes with pop rocks!  the frozen grasshopper is a must for any mint chocolate fans.  smooth creamy minty frozen goodness.  for both shakes, we could taste the alcohol but it was pretty well masked!\n\nthey also have a bunch of beers on draft.  <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> triple karmeliet is a good one!\n\nprice-wise, it is pricey.  our burgers were around $18, with shakes at $11.  the price should reflect great service but i found the service a bit lacking.  our waitress only came to check on us twice and it took awhile to get her attention for the check as well.\n\nafter our meal, i can see why so many people like <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> at holsteins.  can't wait till the next time to try our other burgers!", 
            "my husband and i had a pleasant dinner at holsteins. the time estimate for the wait was accurate (about 5-10 mins on a wednesday evening). the server (jonathan) was polite and efficient. we were in a bit of a hurry as we tickets for a show that night, and fortunately the food came out quickly.\n\nwe shared the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> ($12), which the server split into two plates for us, and the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger with steak fries ($17.50), which we split ourselves with the extra plate.

            "**** 4.5 stars ****\n\none of the great miracles of las vegas is that you can eat like a fatty fat fat all day every day and still go to pools surrounded by gorgeous plastic-pumped women and sing nonsense like \"sexy and i know it\", regardless of any absence of truth to that assertion. holsteins provides the perfect venue for stuffing your face on delicious patties of top quality beef while also getting an eye full of the local ladies. unbeknownst to me at the time, the same chef is behind this as public house, where i had dined the night before, and his love of squeezing his employees into clothing that might be mistaken for a table cloth was much more prominent here than there. the d\\u00e9cor here is also just dope. i love the slightly sick toons on the walls, and there are homage to pigs and cows all around. if you look at most of the complaints here it's from people who didn't actually order a burger, so i suggest you take those reviews for what they are, and don't make the same mistake.\n\nbut, since it's vegas, you will still stuff your face to the maximum in front of this beautiful bevy, knowing that you're helping to pay for their salary so that they can go to the pool tomorrow and pretend guys like you don't exist (until you buy them a pitcher of margaritas, then you're superstar hero of the next couple minutes, congrats). brian and i both took the luxury route on the menu here, although i passed on the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> with kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo, because i've already had half a dozen burgers like this across america and they all taste roughly the same...rich and oily. it was honestly more difficult passing up <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, a truly unique combination of kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado...super intriguing, and if i had been dining with someone i was dating i likely would have tried to persuade them in that direction. somehow i managed to also resist ordering a decadent milkshake, perhaps because we were eating dinner just 4 hours after we had managed to roll out of bed for lunch.\n\ni finally wound up deciding on the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, a dry aged beef sirloin patty topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and a garlic-chive aioli...nothing too crazy, but lots of big, bold, wonderful flavors, and at $18 the most expensive burger not topped with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>. the result was pretty fantastic, definitely one of the better burgers i've had lately, and came with a monstrous basket of nicely done <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (for a supplemental charge). my biggest complaint, which is kind of random, is that they skewer <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with their own stupid little logo stick to keep the bun on for presentation, which has the resulting effect of causing huge gobs of mayo or sauce to squirt from the hole in the top every time you take a bite. eating these burgers is a mess, to be sure, especially when you add on a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> as i do, but if you're like me you've already realized you're not taking one of the voluptuous vixens home (although my reason is probably different than yours) so you've resigned your face to more indulgent pleasures, like egg yolk, garlic aioli, and hamburger grease.\n\njust make sure to thoroughly wash your beard, or your own lady might catch on...and get jealous.", 
            "located on the 2nd floor of the cosmopolitan, i brought a friend from out of town to check out this joint known for high end burgers and boozy milkshakes.  the restaurant space has a good mix of seats at the bar, low tables with comfy couches, and standard booths/chairs.  music is pumping and artwork on the walls definitely add a cool vibe, but it's not overwhelming where one can't enjoy good conversation amongst close friends.\n\nas for the menu, there is quite the impressive beverage selection including a wide array of international/domestic beers, wines, cocktails, and unique sodas.  my friend and i were definitely in the mood to pair some burgers with their signature shakes and i got the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> (with reese's, banana, malt, and frangelico) whereas my friend ordered the creamsicle float (whipped cream smirnoff,  orange sherbet, ibc cream soda, and orange bubble sugar).  my biggest fear was that the alcohol component would actually distract one's enjoyment of the milkshake, but unexpectedly the problem ended up being the complete opposite in that neither of us tasted nor felt any effects of any trace of alcohol in our shakes (i.e. neither one of us had our trademark asian flush go into effect).  perhaps the holstein's staff has figured out some magic ratio/technique to eliminate both the taste and effect of alcohol in their shakes, but a little of both would serve to go a long way especially if one is paying double digit dollars.\n\nas for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, we opted to split the crowd favorite <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> consists of dry aged sirloin with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli, but my taste buds felt like they were in charlie brown's classroom in that all the ingredients were rendered a slur of incomprehensibility by the overpowering goat cheese.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, on the other hand, did a much better job showcasing its melange of ingredients consisting of pepper-crusted beef, housemade creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>,  and swiss cheese.  taste buds were dancing their way upstairs to marquee on this one.  for every burger, one has the choice of shoestring fries or the thick steak fries (which resemble seasoned potato wedges) so one will not go wrong depending on personal preference.  \n\noverall, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>  do not come cheap (ranging from $14-28) nor do the milkshakes ($11) but to paraphrase vincent vega from pulp fiction,  \"that's a pretty f*cking good milkshake/burger. i don't know if it's worth (insert some double digit number) dollars but it's pretty f*cking good.\"",

            "the fellas and i were looking for a quick dinner option before hitting the club this particular night. luckily, after walking to the exit and realizing it was pouring outside, we turned around and noticed holsteins across the hall from the marquee. \n\nfirst and foremost, the service was friendly and the staff did a great job. secondly, the food was well worth it. \n\nto start, they bring out seasoned popcorn that was quickly devoured by us. next i ordered the frozen grasshopper (a bam-boozled shake) that consisted of peppermint, chocolate, cr\\u00e8me de menthe, van gogh chocolate vodka. while it was good, it was definitely a lot (couldn't finish it after <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>). \n\nand lastly, their burger. my, what a burger! after being torn between the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> & fun-ghi big buns, i decided to go with the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>. now this burger is as follows: dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli. i ordered mine medium and it was plated as such. the sirloin was cooked to perfection with a beautiful char outside and juicy inside. the <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark> and aged goat cheddar gave it a great kick, but for me, the magic came in the garlic-chive aioli. i mean, wow, what a burger! \n\nevery bite was tasteful, satisfying, and worth every penny. it was easily one of the best burgers i've ever had. all the ingredients played beautifully with one another, and came together to form a great experience. \n\nwill remain a favorite in vegas and one i must revisit whenever i'm in town. so should you.",

            "went to cosmo to watch polica rock out at <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> pool last night (buy their album! review w/in a review).   i always like to try out a new restaurant in whatever casino i'm seeing a concert in (or in the case of the cosmo i include aria's options).   since i splurged a little with julian serrano a few weeks back, i thought we should take it easier on our bank accounts with holsteins.  this wasn't seen as a downgrade in my eyes too much because i'd been wanting to try their <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger ever since i'd read john curtas praise it as (one of?) the best in las vegas.\n\ngiven the fact that one of their signature milkshakes would probably cause me death due to my lactose intolerance (and not a quick, lethal injection/firing squad death which might make it worth it, but more of a slow, chinese water torture/buried alive death) i passed on those, though they sure sounded delicious.  i instead opted for my usual jack and coke which was an acceptable version, but not as strong as i normally prefer.\n\nfor food we skipped appetizers because the majority seemed fried or slathered with cheese and or some sort of ranch dressing (i know, it's a burger joint) and i just didn't feel like i needed any of that before i gorged on a giant burger and fries along with the whole slow death sentence thing.  i ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> with no altering of the standard fixings cooked medium, and shoestring fries on the side.\n\nshortly thereafter <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> arrived and looked delectable and consisted of a dry aged sirloin patty, nice <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese (goat cheese tends to sit easier with my intolerance in case nosy minds were inquiring), tomato confit (i had to google confit to remind myself what it was.   i already forgot.  roasted?), and arugula and some garlic aioli.   <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was perfectly cooked, and i really enjoyed every bite of it.   i do think that there might have been too many flavors going on which took away from the quality of the beef.  i'm not sure it really needs the aioli or maybe it needs less, and the cheese tasted really nice, but i felt like it may have overpowered the whole thing a little.  i'm being very nitpicky as it was a tasty burger as sam jackson would say, but all in all i still prefer almost any i've had at bachi or fuku burger and they are more reasonably priced.   the fries were very average and had zero qualities worth mentioning here which was a bit of a disappointment.   service was friendly and responsive for the entire meal, if not a little robotic seeming at times.  i can live with that for an $80 dinner and drinks for 2 at the casino where the table minimums are my monthly salary.", 
            "i'm not sure what the hype is about. having experienced the gourmet burger craze in both la and dallas maybe my expectations are just too high. their \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" burger has been touted as the best in vegas... this has to be a joke. the mix of flavors were not balanced well. the goat cheese did not compliment the beef in any way. the ingredients were of good quality but not what i would expect for the price point. \n\nin general i would say everything on the menu was quite overpriced (even by vegas standards). this is where holsteins really fell short for me. i've had $10 burgers that blow this one away. not to be super whiny but on top of the food not meeting my expectations  the service was a bit slow and my burger was slightly overcooked. nothing egregious, but i would feel remiss to not point it out here. we tried the lobster mac & cheese appetizer to start and i can't help but compare it to the lobster mac at the capital grille which is of better quality, a larger portion and actually cheaper than holsteins. even the steak fries were uninspired and blah. \n\noverall i was disappointed at every turn by this place. the food was acceptable and i won't say it was a bad meal but it does not live up to the bar they have set for themselves. i would not go back. save your money and go to one of the many other great restaurants in las vegas.",

            "i hate to compare any burger i've ever eaten in my life to my all time favorite umami burger, but given the price you pay at holsteins i figured it'd at least come close to it. unfortunately, my first experience here was quite disappointing. i yelped holstein's shakes and buns & decided to give it a try after seeing it was given 4 stars. \n\nwe came here on <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> of halloween weekend & were glad that the wait wasn't that long. our waitress kindly informed us about their \"special\" shakes (which i thought was unique to their establishment). i ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, which our waitress said they were most famous for. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> looked really good, but as i bit into <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, i quickly realized that the patty was very bland. they had cooked it the way i wanted, but there was just no flavor whatsoever in the patty. my appetite disappeared soon after as i found it hard to even eat the <mark>French Fries</mark>. our waitress seemed to have disappeared for a while as well. \n\nperhaps my taste buds were off that day from all the drinking the two nights before, but my meal just wasn't appetizing to me. based on my first try here at holsteins, i don't believe that they deserve the 4 stars. i am, however willing to give them another try & order something that would better appeal to my taste. i'm hoping after that, i could also consider this fine establishment a 4 star restaurant.", 
            "ok so to start of the place is nicely designed and very hip. this is the only reason i even chose to give it a star.  the menu is sharp and creative.  holstein's is a burger bar and restaurant but are best known for their extensive list of alcoholic milkshakes which at $15+ each are tasty but a little hard to swallow.\n\nwe had 4 people for dinner, the total was $160 and it was to say the least, one of the worse burgers i have ever eaten...ever.\n\ni started off and had a milk shake which was good, a little hard to swallow at $12 but at least it tasted good. we ordered the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> $28 kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, truffle mayo and the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger   $17.5 dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli.\ni told our slightly slow server several time make sure <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are meidum-rare.  \n\nafter a 40 minute wait time, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> arrived, and they looked amazing.   i took my first bite and was unpleasantly surprised by the rapid sizzle of the skin on the roof of my mouth. slightly alarmed by the burning feeling i removed the bun to see what was going on.  the entire roof of my mouth was burned on a quarter size piece of foie-gras in my burger.  apparently no one bothered to consider learning how to prepare foie-gras before apply for a job at holsteins and instead fried the hell out of it in a pan.  my rather nicely sized $30 burger had a piece of foie-gras on it that was the size of a quarter and burned.  \n\nwhat i received was far from a medium-rare burger.  the greasy, oily and hard to swallow burger was far from delicious and even further away from edible.  i asked the server if this was a joke and showed him the inside of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> i had taken one bite of.   confused and surprised, he apologized and said he will be back. after waiting for 10 minutes he returned and apologized mentioning that the \"size of fie-gras varies in each burger\"  ....the question is by how much?  \n\nin an effort to make the most out of this horrible ordeal, i ordered a piece of foie-gras to place on my burger and requested they don't fry the hell out of it.  the server told me that it would be $20 extra which i told him was clearly not a problem. it arrived 20 minutes later once <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was cold.  once again it arrived burned to a brown color and tasted almost as bad as my now cold and tasteless $30 burger. \n\nto be fair the place is very cute and well designed, the staff is polite but slow and poorly trained. \n\n the service is sub fast-food quality.  our server was slow and didn't take orders very well.   \n\noverall, i would never go back and have holstein's again unless it was for a $15 milk shake which was good but sadly not good enough.", 
            "when i had to make my way across the \"skywalk\" to work on the other side of the street, i always took a \"short cut\" through the cosmo upstairs.  after our dinner at china poblano, i learned to pay more attention to what else was up there, which was the reason why i zeroed in on holstein's.  and hey - any restaurant serving burgers that even utilizes the cow's freakin' name, had better be ready to 'bring it', as far as i'm concerned.  so when bear and i selected it for our burger fix, we were prepared for - at the very least - a 'transformative experience.'\n\nso was it that kind of deal? nope, not really.  but you could do so much worse.\n\nfirst of all - as promised - i have to give a shout-out to our server, amanda.  just that right, attractive combination of smiles, sass and 'savoir faire'' (note to managers: get this woman a raise, stat!) i've always loved that in the better restaurants in town, the staff always have an 'inside/out' knowledge of the menu and the daily specials, and in this particular area, amanda did not disappoint. (which is why holstein's gets an extra star.)  with so many different styles of burger to choose from, it could have been an all-day task to select just one, but with her help, i chose the nom-<mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> ($16.50), while bear went \"classic\" and got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> ($17.50). \n\npricey? well, duh! what does anybody expect when they're using kobe and dry- aged sirloin to craft the frickin' burgers? (and don't forget - this is a 'strip' joint we're talking about here, people!) and while we waited - but not for long - we got to check out the unique decor that included anime-style artwork of the holstein's \"mascot\".  cute...especially considering that he's on the menu as well as the wall!\n\nfor our 'intro', we had the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> ($12.00) a cluckin'-good twist on chili con queso served with warm tortilla chips, and bear's 'de rigeur' item to try, the cuban street tacos ($13.00) a delicious menage-a-trois of roast pork, ham and swiss lovingly drizzled with pickle and spicy mustard aioli. the bite i had of one of them made me wonder if i should've gotten a separate appetizer as well....\n\nand then came the burgs.  bear liked his standard just fine, and i added some 'meat candy' (aka bacon!) to my nom-nom for about two bucks more. i didn't know if i expected a burger with barbecue potato chips and 1000 island dressing to actually work, but damn if didn't, and in quite a tasty way, too. (but then again...name one thing that doesn't taste better with bacon on it.)  it was quite the stunning companion to my frozen grasshopper shake ($11.00).  and the fries served with were just the way i like them: crispy, spicy shoestrings, with none of the greasiness you get from other burger joints.\n\nso, sure, holstein's is giving up burgers, but not at jack-in-the-box prices, so it's always best to keep that in mind.  and as repeat visits go, i think we can file this one under \"special occasions\" mostly.  and we will always ask to be seated in amanda's section...",

            "i've been in la too long. i've missed gambling and people who smoke indoors. so, during a much-needed trip to las vegas, i decided to stop in to holsteins to see how these alcohol-infused milkshakes and gourmet burgers compare to the ones in the city of angels.\n\nafter winding my way through the cosmopolitan hotel past the chandelier bar, i spotted the decorative pink-and-white plastic cow emblazoned with the holsteins logo. at the restaurant, you have the option of sitting at the bar, in the dining area or in the lounge up front, which is composed of some low-riding couches and decorative cartoon tables. i opted to sit in the more traditional dining room because i felt like the seriousness with which i was ready to eat could not be done in a reclining position.\n\nthe cocktail menu is awfully impressive, but i knew that i wanted to try one of the alcoholic milkshakes because, obviously. i chose the tiramisu milkshake, and, my goodness, it was good. the milkshakes are all $11, but at least they give you the fancy glass as well as the tin container filled with the remaining shake. the tiramisu shake is made with mascarpone ice cream, ladyfinger cookie crumbs, patron caf\\u00e9, chocolate syrup, cocoa powder and espresso beans. the shake was thick, chocolatey, liquory and delicious. it was the perfect dessert.\n\ni also ordered a <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger ($17.50), which is a burger topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic-chive aioli. my main complaint about the menu is that half of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> listed aren't really burgers -- they're fish, fowl or veggie patties, which is totally uninteresting to me. so, as for actual beef patties, there aren't too many to choose from.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> i ordered was still great. it was cooked medium-rare when i requested medium, but i really don't care too much unless i catch salmonella and die. the patty was flavorful. the toppings were pretty good (especially the aioli and cheese), but were not anything that would be my first choice in burger toppers. i was delighted that <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was so sizable and filling, and it even came with a side of delicious, crunchy, salty shoestring fries.\n\nthe waitress was fantastic. she helped us navigate the menu and was patient with our indecision, and she was also very friendly and stayed to shoot the breeze with us for a while, which made the whole experience a lot more fun and personable. both the shakes and burgers were brought out quickly, which i appreciated very much because i could not wait another moment to dive into this restaurant's offerings.\n\nthe meal was expensive, but everything was delectable. you won't be hungry again for a good long while after dining at holsteins.\n\nthey even let us take our alcohol in to-go cups so we could finish drinking while we walked around. i could have cried. oh, how i've missed nevada, the land free from open container laws.",

            "great as far as a burger bar is concerned. even though, i am not a fan of overpriced gourmet burgers in general. the price does not match the value.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger was fantastic. it definitely made with quality beef and you can easily taste the difference from other burgers. but you can get similar quality at far better price from a restaurant burger.  my burger was a little dry from lack of a sauce but the meat was juicy. i added mustard that was provided on the table which complimented the cheese well. the milk shakes were over priced but the alcohol in them was undetectable. i found that to be a fun twist.",

            "pretty good place located in the cosmopolitan for a great tasting burger. while i don't believe it's at the same level as burgr by gordon ramsey in planet hollywood, they still offer delicious burgers and shakes, nonetheless, and should definitely be given a shot!\n\nthe place -\nas i mentioned, holstein's is located in the cosmopolitan and is centrally located with everything else. it's fairly easy to find and doesn't require a great deal of navigation. casino's in vegas can tend to be very large and trying to find a restaurant within one is a challenge within itself, but holstein's wasn't too hard to spot. at first glance, the place itself looks like a glorified cafe as the restaurant is very open in terms of people on the outside of the restaurant being able to look in. the decor is pretty modern, the bar is a pretty good size, and there's also, what seemed to be an impromptu, lounge area right in front of the bar for people to come in, sit on couches and socialize while still being able to enjoy the menu and the drinks. the lounge being right in front of the bar didn't look all that comfortable and appealing; however, with the right group of people and the right amount of drinks, i'm sure it would be fine for most haha. because i sat at the bar, i didn't get a chance to see the rest of the restaurant; however, the kitchen looks to be exposed so that people can look in on the action going on at the back of the house and, as a customer, that's always interesting and nice to see. not too bad, holstein's.\n**** 4/5 stars ****\n\nthe service -\ni was in vegas for a conference and i came to holstein's right after the last session ended, which was around 5:00pm or so on a thursday. there, unfortunately, was no hostess to greet me; however, i chalk that up to them being particularly busy and probably running around. no biggie on my end as i was gonna end up sitting at the bar anyways, which i did; however, if i was a party hoping to get a table, having no hostess at the front would certainly make me question. i found an open seat at the bar and immediately by one of the most friendliest faces i've seen during my visit in vegas. she was entertaining, down to earth, willing to talk with everyone at the bar, and wasn't afraid to razzle folks to try and get them to smile, which i didn't mind at all. the great service continued throughout with her making sure i was taken care of and when she had to leave for the day she made every effort to make sure i was ok and gave the next bartender updates on all her guests, which is always nice to see rather than someone leaving the next person in the dark. great service, holstein's and shout out to bridgot for making my trip to holstein's wonderful!!\n***** 5/5 stars *****\n\nthe food -\njust like any other of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> joints located in vegas, there are many different options to choose from. each burger has its own signature ingredient and level of appeal for everyone. with that being said, it'll be pretty difficult for someone to not find a burger that sounds delicious as there are many different burgers to indulge in. i settled for the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> (see picture) and decided to have that served with some <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> instead of fries. first, the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. definitely not the best <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> i've had in my life as you can probably tell they just came from a bag in the freezer; however, it got the job done and satisfied my craving for them. the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>, which is kobe beef, cheddar cheese, 1000 island dressing, and potato chips (yes...potato chips....don't lie and say you never put potato chips in your cold cut sandwiches as a kid....i don't care who you are, everyone did that and you would swear it was the best thing ever! haha). <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was perfectly cooked, the cheddar cheese and 1000 island dressing gave it that zest and creaminess it needed and then finally, the homemade potato chips, as it did in cold cut sandwiches, gave that textural difference and crunchiness that we always desire in our food. the only gripe i have about the potato chips is that there was no flavor to them, it was literally just there for the crunch, i wish they would've seasoned them with something to make it pop more. other than that, i was fairly satisfied with my selection. good job, holstein's.\n**** 4/5 stars ****\n\noverall -\nlike i said, after comparing <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> that i've had from burgr to holstein's, i would definitely choose burgr; however, if you happen to be in the cosmo and the mood for having a burger strikes you, this place can definitely deliver. i look forward to coming back and trying out the other options like the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, but all in all, not too shabby holstein's! thanks!",

            "i'm sure my perception of food choices in vegas is skewed as more often than not they come after a heavy drinking session (either immediately after or the next day).  at that point almost anything would taste great.  holsteins came highly recommended and after sleeping through the breakfast hour it was time to skip directly to lunch anyway.\n\nwhen presented with a burger voted vegas's best, it's hard to consider anything else.  i went with the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger and wasn't disappointed.  <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were another plus. to top things off i ordered one of the \"boozy milkshakes\", going with the oreo and bailey's version (i wasn't adventurous enough to go for the captain crunch).  i left plenty satisfied and a little overstuffed, but overall i would recommend this place for a hearty lunch or dinner (skipping breakfast was a good call).", 
            "3.5 stars, not deserving of a full 4 stars. \n\nsolid, solid burger spot. first of all, the artwork. they have a pig for a mascot and the artwork depicts said pig experiencing various culinary delights. very very good stuff. \n\non to the food. we started the meal with mexican car bombs. no, no, this isn't a play on the irish bombs. no dos equis patron shots. they are jalapenos stuffed with cheese, black beans and corn then wrapped in bacon!!! holy bacon fat batman! excellent creation and a must order. \n\nburgers: \n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> was delicious. bacon and aged goat cheddar with their udder sauce. the sauce is tangy and could use an addition of spice. \n\n<mark>The Classic</mark> was pretty good. basic burger dressed with tomato, onion, lettuce and of course, we added some swine and queso. \n\nshakes:\n\ni went for the peppermint choco shake, no alcoholic cause i don't drink anymore. it tastes a bit like a girl scout cookie that may have found it's way to your doorstep in months past. \nstrawberry was solid, with some gummy candies added to the top .whipped cream is fresh and made in house, excellent touch there. \n\noverall this is a solid spot to get a burger. it's a bit pricey, so plan accordingly.", 
            "this place has been reviewed a bit on yelp, and the 4-star is about par for the course. the atmosphere is very lively, but that might have been just because there was a thursday night football game going on at the time of our meal. either way, it definitely seems like the place gets a lot of action. gotta love the decor of the place: cartoon cows \n\nwe had the thai beef salad, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, and the oreo shake. watch out for the thai beef salad! it's good but it has a sweet/super spicy sauce mixed into it... it tasted a lot like korean gochujang. the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> lived exactly to its expectations, but what else would expect from a $20 burger? and the oreo shake was the perfect mix of thick consistency: not too watery but not thick enough that you feel like you need to suck your brains out through the straw. \n\nthe place is expensive (my only semi gripe about the place... it's hard to justify buying a $20 beef sandwich) but you're in vegas so just deal with it! the place is far from a 'deal' meal, but i would still highly recommend it.", 
            "holsteins is definitely my go to spot for burgers. i had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger which was hands down the best burger i've ever had. the fries were just okay, but other than that everything was perfect. service included, which i find quite rare these days. \n\ni will definitely be back to try one of the shakes and the lobster mac and cheese which everyone raves about. and there's no doubt that i rave about this spot to everyone who loves a great burger.",

            "i've been here on a couple of different trips and you can't go wrong with the food. i've had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> (aged goat cheese and bacon) which was just smashing, and really, any place that volunteers a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> on your burger is a winner in my book. <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> shakes are an extra plus (cause, aren't you keeping a consistent level of alcohol in your system at all times in vegas anyway?). \n\nthe service is good, the prices are reasonable, and overall it's a good strip-stop that's a happy medium of tasty-yet-affordable.", 
            "upon hearing more bad than good reviews regarding this eatery, i decided that it wasn't worth the risk of a potentially bad meal. however, since a large group of us were already on property tonight, it was the best choice for a relatively inexpensive dinner. \n\ni attempted to make a reservation via opentable, but it stated that there were no reservations remaining for the evening. then i called. the hostess explained that they are no longer taking reservations for the evening, but she would be happy to get us a table when we arrived and that there was a \"short\" wait for less than 30 minutes. since we were not physically at the restaurant, we could not put our name on the list. humph. anyway, we get to the restaurant and are given a 30-35 minute wait for our group of nine. a bit longer than i enjoy waiting, but it worked out well - we received our table within 10 minutes (and via text message; very convenient)!\n\nmost of us decided on selections from the \"big buns\" category (good ol' burgers and fries). i had a hard time choosing between a couple of their burgers, but i'm very pleased that our server directed me to their most popular selection - the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" ($17.50). dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli. holy tastebuds. that first bite was euphoric. i can't even describe it, but i'll always remember how i felt - amazing. i was raving to everyone at the table and the two people that tasted my burger affirmed my praise, as well as stating that it was much better than <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> they were eating (memphis burger - very tasty - and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> - shrug). i've had other goat cheese-arugula-tomato burgers and this one does it much better. because the goat cheese is blended with cheddar (haven't quite wrapped my head around this yet lol), it isn't too pungent and all the other flavors were so well balanced. get the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>; medium rare, of course. really, really good.\n\nwith your \"big buns\" order, you have a choice of regular fries, side salad, or a $2 upgrade for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> or thick cut <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. i got their regular fries and they were really tasty and well cooked. i also tried the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> ($9) - perfect dill spears with good crispy exterior, served with an herb-caper mayo - and a strawberry milkshake ($8) - really creamy, delicious strawberry flavor. overall, all the food was great!\n\nour server was really nice and very helpful, however, we received only one visit between receiving our food and finishing our meal, so most of our water glasses weren't refilled. then we found ourselves having to wave our arms for attention. i figured the servers must be overwhelmed, but it seems that the restaurant is always busy and it's as if no one has figured out how to properly handle the capacity of customers.\n\ni'm curious as to why people have been so unhappy with holsteins, but i can guess. based on our experience prior to and during our dinner, i'm sure they have their off days or the service may be even less attentive than it was today. hopefully i won't have to experience any of those things during future visits or even better, that it'll improve!", 
            "the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger with an egg added was really really good. i thought the patty had just the right amount of bite and flavor. the bun was also superb-- just the right texture. i'm pretty easily impressed when it comes to gourmet burgers though. \n\nmy husband got <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with the chips in it.. nom nom. it was a little plain and not so nom nom. he wanted mine.\n\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are way worth the $1 upgrade. they were perfection on my tongue. nice and crispy and chewy.\n\nwe also split the autumn house salad... it was so good. lots of fresh greens and fruit tossed with a sweet but tart apple vinaigrette.\n\nwe split the tiramisu adult shake and it was delicious with little chocolate and espresso bean shavings. wanted to try others but we were way too full.\n\ngreat draft beer selection too.\n\nbut the 5 stars really goes to the outstanding waitstaff. my husband was in a wheelchair and barely up on crutches during our visit. he needed to use the restroom and when he asked where it was, our waitress was like \"wait, there's a line right now\" and actually offered to keep checking to see if the line cleared and let us know. i can't remember her name but she was a sweetheart!",

            "i was skeptical in trying holsteins because of the mixed reviews, but after eating at gordon ramsay's burgr so much, i wanted a different burger place. originally we came here around midnight fri to try the place, but were told they stopped serving their regular menu at 11pm. they offered a late night menu instead which were basically just appetizers (no burgers/shakes). no biggie, we came back the next day after a fabulous time at marquee's dayclub...spoiler alert: we also came back the next day before we left on the drive back home because it was sooo good!!\n\nthe decor is so cute here w/ the anime pig wall posters and the theme totally matched w/ the cosmopolitan. our server made great recommendations for us & started us off w/ the complimentary small bucket of lightly salt/sweet popcorn. my bf killed that thing, talk about drunk munchies\n\nbamboozled shakes:\n<mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> - i added toasted coconut marshmallow to it and this was one damn good shake! the description/ingredients seemed so minimal, yet the shake tasted so amazing. it was like a cookies n cream reese's <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark>. this was my fav out of all the other shakes. \n\ntiramisu - they had me at mascarpone ice cream. i love mascarpone, but you could barely taste it in this shake. this tasted like a chocolate shake, not much espresso/coffee flavor. \n\nbanana creme pie - my bf go this 'cause he loves bananas and i would say this was my 2nd fav shake. it tastes exactly like a banana cream pie, but in shake form w/ chocolate. i liked that they topped it w/ white chocolate covered bananas.\n\nthe shakes are big enough to share, but trust me you won't want to. i like that you get a full glass shake and the extras are in the metal mixing cup so you can eat it w/ a spoon (yum!) i also like that their shakes all were thick & creamy!\n\napps:\nsurf 'n turf quesadilla - delish my favorite app! this ain't no taco bell quesadilla. it was crunchy and not oily at all. the lobster, steak and manchego cheese inside all just melted in your mouth and is bursting w/ flavor. must order!!\n\nsoft shell crab bruschetta - for a burger place, their presentation of these apps were tapas style and as nice as any fancy steakhouse. the softshell crab was on top of a thick cut brioche bread, the aioli and tomato salad made the app refreshing\n\ncrispy calamari - big enough portion to share, i couldn't stop dunking these rings in the sweet chili sauce. i like that they don't overbread the calamari rings\n\nmaine lobster roll - pricey for this, but there were generous amount of lobster. \n\ncrispy pork belly bun - tasted better than the ones at ramsay's burgr. the steamed buns weren't dry & sauce was spot on\n\nburgers:\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> w/ <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>(normally comes w/ fries, but paid $2 to upgrade) - the best burger ever!! most asian fusion burgers get overpowered by the sauce, but not here. it didn't taste like an ordinary overly sweet typical terriyaki burger. everything was perfect about this burger, that first bite was so orgasmic. this is what a burger should taste like! the whole brioche bun was toasted to perfection. i am not sure how they did it, but the top part of the bun and inside had a nice toast crisp to it. the tempura avocado was nice, added a different texture. you could taste each item in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and they all blended well together. the kobe beef patty was cooked medium, yet it was juicy and had a nice pink to it. <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were the best we've had as well & worth the upgrade! they were thick, fried, fresh, and crispy, no soggy oiliness at all. make sure to ask for buttermilk ranch to dip the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> in!! it tastes so divine\n\nfun-ghi on wheat bun w/ salad ($2 extra) - healthy combo huh? my 2nd fav burger, but my bf preferred this over <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> because he prefers the truffle flavor. again, patty was cooked perfect along w/ toasted wheat bun. i actually prefer the regular bun's flavor although the wheat bun was toasted the same way as the regular brioche bun. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> wasn't smothered in mayo thank god! the gruyere helped accentuate the truffle portabella & caramelized onions. salad was a generous portion of mixed greens & the dressing was tangy yet sweet & light (sort of like a coleslaw dressing w/ lemon). the only negative is that we added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, but there was no runny yolk...the egg was fully cooked :(\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> w/ <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>- everyone kept talkin about this burger, but we thought it paled in comparison to <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were bomb!\n\ni would have to say that holstein's outranks ramsay's burgr. we were so pleased w/ our meal that we sent compliments to the chef. we were lucky that both days we ate here, the executive chef was working. the food comes out fast and you will leave happily stuffed. don't forget to give them your identity player's card for points!\n\nnote: try and get a girl server. the first day we had a girl and she was totally on top of it. the 2nd day, we had a guy and he seemed easily overwhelmed",

            "i would give this place 3.5 stars if i could. i didn't think this place was anything different than any other burger joint. maybe i've been to too many burger places?! got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and i thought it was alright. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was definitely large, finished half, but for some reason it wasn't hitting the spot. the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> is a dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli. the tomato confit was overpowering. couldn't taste the garlic-chive aioli. it just tasted like tomato. maybe i'm not a tomato fan? maybe i'm a bit too harsh of a critic? <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was good, but not a wow factor. maybe next time i'll hold the tomato confit and add mushrooms instead. a plus for this place is that it is a large restaurant. went on a really busy vegas weekend and didn't have to wait for a table. maybe all of vegas was still recovering from the weekend's vegas motor speedway festivities and we were the few that got ourselves up to get some lunch.", 
            "i wanted this to be my last stop before leaving vegas. it's conveniently located inside cosmo and takes reservations. our party of 6 was able to call in that morning and have our table ready in 15 mins! bright and spacious restaurant that can fit a variety of groups.\n\nthey offer complimentary butter and vinegar popcorn, (pretty darn good) while you look through their menu. holstein's is popular for their alcoholic milkshakes, so naturally, we spent longer picking a milkshake than a burger.\n\nmy bf and i each ordered their most popular burgers along with the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> milkshake to share.\n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> ($18) -- kobe beef covered in a teriyaki glaze with tempura avocado. i enjoyed the first few bites but was over the glaze, i don't usually prefer sweet sauces. fairly large sized burger that will certainly make you feel guilty.\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> ($18.50) -- this dry aged beef sirloin burger is similar to others you will find, with bacon, arugula, and garlic-chive aoili. we both enjoyed this more and agreed you can't go wrong with it. their natural cut fries are also better than the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, which are nothing special.\n\n<mark>Campfire Smores</mark> milkshake ($13) -- they have a great selection of milkshakes and it was really hard to choose! the waiter recommended this and you can't really go wrong with graham cracker crumbles. very tasty and sweet but you couldn't taste any of the smirnoff marshmallow vodka. presentation was also nice with the toasted marshmallow.\n\nout of the two burger joints we tried this weekend, we prefer burgr more. this was the most i have ever paid for a burger and have had better. if i come back, it would have to be for a milkshake, i don't think i can throw down $15+ for another burger.",

            "i must first state that i was a solid 3 on this; however, what happened once we left really soured my mood along with my stomach. \n\ni must also be clear that this was my first - and subsequently, only - meal of the day. \n\nfirst, the food: my trusty companion and i each had a burger. i had the flagship \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" and she had the \"el machete\". \n\nthe <mark>Gold Standard</mark> is made with dry aged beef, which is a good choice, and topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar and arugula. this should be delicious, and i assume if seasoned properly it is. unfortunately, there was too much salt seasoning - and believe me... i love salt - which left the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> feeling merely standard. \n\nmy tardis companion had the \"el machete\" which is a spicy aoli and pepper based burger. this was actually delicious from the two bites i had. if there was any seasoning issue with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself it was covered by the delicious peppers and aoli!\n\nalong with that we had regular fries and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. the fresh cut fries were tasty, albeit again heavily bathed in salt. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were on the soggy side but fresh and not overly salted. \n\nwe also had milkshakes. hers being some fruit compote fourth of july special concoction and mine being chocolate strawberry. mine was very sweet but it was strawberry with chocolate sauce, so of course that was unsurprising. (i had asked for chocolate ice cream but i wasn't about to whine about the small oversight.)\n\nas we left, i thought \"unspectacular... but worth a second look\".  the food wasn't bad but it wasn't great. i figured that i might try it again when next in town. \n\nnot long after my companion and i started feeling sour in our stomachs. come dinner time, still sour... i have slightly upchucked and swallowed it back down on two occasions. even as i write this, the meal from lunch feels like it is remaining in the upper regions of my stomach and the gassy bloating remains.\n\nwe tried later to force a small meal elsewhere for consistency as it was getting late but we couldn't even touch our food. it literally went into <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> the same way it came to the table. \n\ni really didn't intend on writing a negative review... and many of the reviews are positive. i would like to think this is an isolated incident in which i suspect the culprit to be the milkshakes. \n\ni really wanted to like this place. the menu is creative.  the decor is attractive. there are a dozen reasons to be drawn to this place.  unfortunately, i went from \"looking forward to eating there\" to \"pondering a second chance\" to \"likely not looking forward to a future visit\"... \n\nif not for the promise and potential of my initial thoughts, compared to the way i feel right now, it would have resulted in one star. so in fairness, i decided to average the two opinions. \n\nall in all a very disappointing visit. thank god for pepto.",

            "i've been here a few times and feel like this place deserves a 4 because they continue to have good food and good service. we enjoyed our medium-well  burgers but next time we'll probably go with medium being that the patty could've been juicer.  but still, not bad. we split two burgers between the two of us since we both had mentioned we wanted to try them. <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger was absolutely delicious! you can taste the truffle in every bite. truffle and gruyere cheese in the same burger? perfection! the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> is their most popular burger and i can see why. they took the all-classic cheeseburger and deconstructed it. first, the cheese isn't just your typical cheddar, it's an aged goat cheddar. second, instead of adding a thick slice of tomato, that usually creates a mess and ends up sliding out anyway, they added a tomato confit! lettuce was replaced with arugula which gave <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> a lot of flavor. bacon, bacon, bacon! and for the best part instead of plain mayo this burger had a garlic chive aioli. ah-maze-ing! this changed the whole dynamic of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>! honestly, i don't even remember what the buns were like because i was too busy enjoying all the unique flavors inside. the only downside to our meal was that i was so excited to have the \"unndon\" cake for dessert that i skipped on the raved about shakes. i came to find that it was a seasonal item that is no longer on the menu. seriously?! until they bring that back i am not returning. take a look at the pictures others posted of it and tell me that does not look amazing? if you don't think so, then there's something definitely wrong with you. sorry. we ended up getting the dulce de leche cheesecake because #1 i love anything ddl and #2 it said it had frosted flakes cereal in/on. normally, i wouldn't even eat cheesecake unless it's the godiva or s'mores ones from the cheesecake factory but the description made this one hard to skip. it had the perfect consistency, too! the densely moist cracker crust underneath tasted like a combination of crushed <mark>Reed's Ginger Brew</mark> man and snicker doodle cookies. salivating much? for the perfect bite you have to start at the top, taking a bit of the whipped cream, ff cereal, cheesecake and then sweep it all up with the trail of oozing caramel sitting next to it. yummmmm-meee!! now remember, their desserts are seasonal so hurry in!", 
            "this place does not disappoint!  my husband and i shared the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> of us were very impressed at how layered the flavors are, especially the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>!  i also had a vegan milkshake (i think it's the only one on the menu) and it was awesome!  i cannot wait to get back to vegas to have another.", 
            "inattentive servers who seemed more worried about looking cute then service. i ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger which was good, but just ok, and a coke. i was with a group of 6 and for some reason my burger wasn't delivered until after everyone at my table had finished there meal. also, i was never given the coke after asking for it multiple times. when i got my bill (everyone had separate checks), the coke was still on and when i brought it to the servers attention, she said she would take care of it. i was then brought my change with a coke in a to-go container and it still on the bill. in addition to auto-gratuity it was $30. so not worth it! i recommend gordan ramsey burgr across the street at planet hollywood!", 
            "popular casual dining spot in the cosmopolitan hotel.\n\ncame here since hubby raved about their burgers here from a previous trip without me, so we stopped here for lunch. kid friendly place.\n\nhuge selection of milkshakes that you can order with or without alcohol - i had the pecan turtle one... it probably has as many calories and fat as what i ate for the rest of the day, but definitely a nice treat. rich creamy ice cream with all the goodness of pecans and chocolate as well! it's about $4 less than the posted price if you order one without alcohol.\n\ntheir burger selection is impressive. i sampled hubby's classic <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and thought it tasted good. i had the funghi burger and the tastes went well together with a touch of truffle, but it was a bit too greasy for my liking.\n\ndelicious <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>! average fries.\n\ngood service and decent burgers but i thought it was a bit expensive for lunch (about $30 pp).", 
            "mooooo! this place is awesome for high quality tasty burgers. \n\ni agree with other reviewers that the place smells kind of like a dirty mop - wtf?! besides that, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger was ridiculously good and huge. i was so lucky i had all that burger goodness in my stomach since i drank probably half a bottle of goose at the marquee (at a table, nonetheless!) i would definitely come back here if i stay at the cosmo again. i would likely order a shake the next time since i was too full to order that during dinner. the appetizers are also pretty good. i had the bulgogi quesadilla and it was quite tasty but my only wish was that it was served warmer since it was lukewarm.", 
            "this is now on my list as one of the best restaurants i've dined at in vegas, and one of the best burgers i've ever had. my friend and i split the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and were shocked to find out we could order it with a house-made gluten-free bun (score!). we also split the moscow moo milkshake with an extra shot of vodka for good measure. our server fabrixio (aka fab) was just that (fab) and even brought us out some extra goodies, including a creme de menthe meringue infused with liquid nitrogen at the end of the meal. when you bite into it, green \"smoke\" comes out of your mouth - so cool and super minty and refreshing. highly recommended!", 
            "i usually don't like to eat on the strip when i'm in vegas, but i was tempted to check out this place. i loved the cow art all over the restaurant. our waiter was very attentive and the service was amazing. yes, these buglers are not cheep, and your bill will probably go up if you're drinking, but then again it's the strip. \ni had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, which was one of the best burgers ever. the meat was delicious and the goat cheese complimented <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> perfectly. my friend had <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with pork rinds and oaxacan cheese, which was so good. it was my heavy at all it was actually perfect. i really wanna try their adult shakes next time\ni'm there. great beer selection also. they know their beers and burgers which is an a+ for me.", 
            "i love <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> here! coming from all the amazing burger joints in la, i would say holstein's has my second favorite burgers ever. it beats umami burger for sure, is on par with bachi burger, but father's office still wins. nothing could beat father's office.\n\nanyway, holstein's is fabulous in it's own respect. the restaurant is casual and comfy; decorated with cute little cows. prices are on the more expensive side at ~$15-20 per burger with a side of fries but it is located in cosmopolitan so i think it's pretty fair for vegas prices. service is only mediocre to me since the waiters check in too slow at times so that's why i'm giving it 4 stars.\n\ni've tried the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burgers.  whenever i have these, oh man i am in burger heaven. <mark>Gold Standard</mark> has bacon, aioli, arugula, and aged goat cheddar cheese on top of a sirloin burger. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> has a teriyaki glaze with kobe beef and tempura avocado!! the avocado seriously is amazinggg. i definitely recommend these two burgers. \n\nnot only are <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> but the alcoholic milkshakes are too!  you can also ask them to be non-alcoholic if you really want that. they have a variety of flavors that they rotate around. you really can't go wrong with any of them. i've had the frozen grasshopper, banana creme pie, and red velvet before and they were all yummy.  \n\noverall a fun restaurant with delicious burgers and milkshakes perfect for your vegas gluttony!", 
            "meating time.\n\nthere are burgers, and then there are burgers.  holsteins serves one of the best burgers i've ever eaten. and overall i had a positive first time experience enjoying good food with great company.\n\nlocation:  second floor of the cosmopolitan hotel.\n\non my recent trip, i visited holsteins for lunch with two friends, one of whom had previously dined last year.  we decided to meet when they opened, and its a lucky thing as we did since a small line had already formed before their 11am opening.  thank goodness for being early.  in this case, the early diner gets <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.\n\nfood:  there were three of us and collectively we ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, the <mark>California Turkey</mark>, and the big fat greek.  all burgers/sandwiches were served with fries.  i was initially unsure on what to order, but thanks to a glowing recommendation from our server, i decided on their award winning <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger.  \n\nthe <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger is aptly named, and worth its weight in gold for that matter.  this has to be one of the best burgers i have ever had.  this dry aged beef sirloin (<mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic aioli) was prepared well, while the goat cheese didn't bother me that much, though other reviewers have stated otherwise.  i thought all the condiments served complemented <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> well.  my taste buds were quite happy indeed.  the fries, sadly, were just ok in my humble opinion.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was the true shining (gold) star at lunch.\n\nas for my two friends, i believe they enjoyed their burgers too, as evidenced by the nearly spotless plates at the end of the meal.    overall, we all enjoyed our meal/food.\n\nservice:  the hostess was quite friendly and promptly showed us to our table.  the server was a friendly and polite young woman.  she greeted us and took our drink orders.  she also recommended some appetizers and milk shakes, but we all decided to order just burgers and fries.  as previously mentioned, the server made such an enthusiastic endorsement regarding the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, and i thanked her more than once for her recommendation.  she  provided extra napkins, provided drink refills, checked on us periodically throughout the meal.  \n\nbottom line:  great food and great company.  i strongly recommend the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger.", 
            "great place! \n\ni love the atmosphere of this restaurant. it's fun, vibrant, and full of energy. the artwork is pretty fun to look at, and the service was good. \n\ni came here for my 23rd birthday with some friends. they definitely need to organize their waiting lines better though. the was some confusion because the menu was right in front of the hostess desk,and people were crowding around it. i waited for 15 min behind these people, thinking it was a line, but no, they were just crowding and didn't bother to say anything though they all saw us standing there. \n\nanyway, food was great! i ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger and <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake bamboozle shake. i'm not a big fan of bacon on my burgers, but damn, that burger was /amazing/. it was juicy and cooked to by perfection. the buns were soft, warm, and buttered generously. my friend ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. he doesn't even like burgers much (and came for the alcoholic shakes haha), but he just ate everything and proclaimed it all delicious. \n\nthe shake actually tasted like birthday cake and gave me a mild buzz. they also give you the shaker it was made in, so it's pretty much two shakes for the price of one. friends ordered maple bacon shake and smores shake. the maple bacon had pieces of chocolate-covered bacon in it, which was strangely delicious. smores tasted exactly like smores. i wish i had the stomach for dessert because everything they had on menu looked great. i'm definitely coming back here, so i'll make sure to order some next time. \n\nconclusion: definitely try this place out! prices are reasonable for what you get, and food is delicious!", 
            "while at ces 2015, went with a friend to check this place out. i ordered the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" burger and the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were cooked perfectly as well. ordered a side of garlic aioli for dipping (wonderful taste). i skipped the shakes but have had it once before (believe it was the grasshopper), they are a bit pricey (about $10 a shake without alcohol).\n\nall in all would definitely return, but probably do what i did this time around and skip the shake.", 
            "so we went here after the ufc 182 since we were staying at the cosmo.  first of all the place is way too loud!  it's like eating at a club.  we could barely hear each other talk nor think.  but at 11pm there weren't too many options.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> we got, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was stellar!  we added a piece of <mark>Foie Gras</mark> which elevated <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  it was one of the best i ever had.\n\nthe 3 alcoholic shakes we got were by far the best shakes we ever had.  the <mark>Pecan Turtle Cheesecake</mark> was the best.  it had caramel vodka and small pieces of cheesecake in it.  it was like eating a boozed dessert.\n\nthe <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> was solid too.  it had a mini whoopie pie and vodka in it too.  it tasted like taking small bites of red velvet cupcakes.   \n\nthe coffee & doughnuts one was good too.\n\nthis is a nice place to get good burgers and shakes but you better bring some earplugs.",

            "i've heard a lot of good things about this place. i wish i didn't hear it because my expectations were really high, and while <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> here are pretty good, i wouldn't go wild over it. the manager was nice enough to allow a reservation for 19 people at 6 pm on a saturday.  that's definitely a star well earned there.  \n\nthe service was very good.  warren took very good care of us and was so enthusiastic the whole time. i loved his excitement and spirit, and he was just on top of it.  there's another two star there.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> ($18) and added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> ($1) and avocado ($2) and subbed my fries for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> ($2).  i ordered it medium rare because i love my beef mooing and bloody at the same time.  my expectation was that it would come out that way.  20-30 minutes later we got our meals, and to my udder disappointment (or shall i say udder disappointment), my burger came out medium well.  ewww.  ground cardboard.  while <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was still good, having it medium rare could have made it that much better and probably one of the best burgers.  so it was just good, not amazing.  i was not the only one in my group of 19 with this issue.  at least 5 others stated they also ordered their burgers medium rare and it came out medium well to well done, and the one guy who ordered it well got a medium or medium rare burger.  um...that made no sense, but maybe the cooks were having an off day.  for $21 i was hoping for an orgasm in my mouth.      \n\ni didn't have any shakes because i'm not into shakes, but i had a lot of friends there who loved theirs.   \n\ni would rule this place completely out, but i can't give it bragging rights either.  i still prefer red robin  burgers over my experience at holstein's and this was the consensus amongst my group.  good burgers but poor execution.  i would try this place again just because they might have been having an off day, but in general, i'd still with cheeseburger in paradise or red robin.  we'll try again later, holstein's!",

            "first let me say, this review might have scored differently had it been 7pm instead of 10:30pm, but i will also say this would have gone a lot different if sam didn't save the night.\n\nwe had a couple of drinks at the chandelier bar directly across the way.  it was our wedding anniversary and we were out with a couple of friends.  we decided to go with holsteins instead of china poblano based on yelp reviews.  as we left the bar the music in the area went from background dance music for the night club on the other side of the room, to deafening.  we were greeted by the hostess who offered to seat us once we finished our drinks from the other bar.  that didn't sit so well with members of our group.  we walked around and debated skipping and going across the road to any of the dozens of places to eat, but my lazy kicked in and we decided to give it ago.\n\nback to holsteins, sans our cocktails, greeted by the same hostess.  i mentioned it was a bummer of a policy, to which she stated don't shoot the messenger.  again, almost sent my friends into a tailspin, but we trudged on!\n\nonce seated, the music got louder. so loud we had to literally yell across the table to each other.  at this point we were all ready to leave, until sam greeted us.  he was so genuine and polite, i felt bad for him having to work right then!    we expressed the fact we were deciding to stay or go.  he completely understood and even offered to mention it to his manager, knowing full well nothing could be done.\n\nwe stuck it out.... the food was average.  we got 4 different full sized burgers and fries; classic, <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, <mark>El Caliente</mark>, and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (mine).  i'm on a burger mission this year, obviously, and i love teriyaki.  the meat was cooked properly and the bun wasn't soggy (all bonuses) but with all the other options out there, this place was underwhelming, especially with the other outside influences.  i'd say skip it.", 
            "got here around 6pm on a thursday and was told our wait was around 25 mins. the hostess told us we can wait or leave our number just in case we decide to walk around. i left my number with her and decided to just wait there as well. after 25 mins, i decided to go up to the host stand and ask how much longer seeing people after us were being seated. the guy told me they put down the wrong number and that our table had been ready but didn't bother to walk 5 ft outside or ask for my name.\n\nservice 3/5 - service was okay. although the waiter did recommend things to go with our burger when we were ordering, we rarely saw him. he came by to refill my water once and then back again when we needed the check. i understand it gets busy here but he seemed all over the place and the busboy ended up helping us more.\n\nfood 5/5 - my bf got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and coffee & donuts shake while i got the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> and cookies & cream shake. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were cooked really well but i felt like the chips on my <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> tasted stale and just took them off. the fries that came with them were good but after that i was so full i could barely finish my shake. the shakes we got supposedly have alcohol in them but you don't taste any, however they did taste good for regular shakes. \n\nthe atmosphere was fun and modern with cartoon cows all over the place. there's also a bar if you wanted to grab drinks and i liked that they offer smaller tables near the front for drinks. \n\noverall, i would come back for the food and hope they work on their service.", 
            "this really is one of the best burgers on the strip! \nnow, it is an expensive burger......... you are on the strip.\nbut, compared to some other big name burger places here in vegas,  this one is right up on top the list.\nthe <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger is amazing!! i also really like the holstein sliders!\nthe <mark>French Fries</mark> are delicious and really good ranch dressing for those of us who like ranch with our fries.....",

            "have been wanting to try this place as a local hearing great things. amazing. from <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> to the beer selection to the shakes and awesome service. the <mark>El Caliente</mark> burger was perfect as was the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, which might be one of the better burgers i've had. highly recommended", 
            "the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger was cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered.  wow!  that burger is worth coming back to!!  the fries were delicious too however, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was by far the star.  service at the bar was excellent.  thank you holsteins!", 
            "with so many \"award-winning\" restaurants in the tourist mecca of las vegas, sometimes it's hard to wade through the hype. i'm always looking for a great burger so when i hear about holstein's i was eager to try it. matching the vibe of the cosmopolitan, holstein's is a burger joint with a mix of night life.\n\nservice here was great as our server was quite friendly. we sat in the bar area since there was no wait. but i wouldn't recommend eating in the bar area tables. the tables are too low for eating. i scoured the menu for all the unique options for burgers and eventually decided on the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, one of their most popular burgers. it was well-cooked with some good toppings. i did not care for the chive-garlic aioli. it wasn't a flavor i cared for. the standard <mark>French Fries</mark> are good though.\n\nholstein's is well known for their grown-up milkshakes with liquor in them. go ahead and hate me for not trying one but it sounded too rich and thick for me at the time. i was already quite full.\n\noverall, holstein's wasn't too bad. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was average to good but not quite award-winning for me personally. but i appreciated the friendly service and those cartoon cows are just oh so cute!",

            "i came here 4 years ago and thought it was amazing, however this time it was way different. i ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, and my fianc\\u00e9e ordered the longhorn burger. \n\nmy burger was just ok... i can't really say much other than the fact that the garlic chive aioli was amazing on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. the baby arugula was pretty good on there too. my fianc\\u00e9es burger on the other hand was pretty bland. we were expecting it to be super bbq as it had brisket on there but honestly it wasn't very impressive at all.\n\nfor dessert we ordered a <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> milkshake and that was probably the greatest milkshake ever. however, we were a bit disappointed bc it seemed like the portion you get for ordering it to go is less than the portion than if you were to order and drink it at the actual restaurant... and it's the same price. regardless, the shake was great and not too overpowering with the richness. let's just say that i didn't need a glass of water after drinking that shake.\n\nhonestly, bachi burger remains my favorite in las vegas as of now...so i don't think i'll be back here anytime soon.", 
            "this place was a toss-up from gordon or holstein.  i asked a couple of friends just by the reviews and pictures and we went ahead and tried this place. line was short when we got here, service was great. we sat at the tables near the bar which was fine for us. i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and i have to say it was pretty good. my friends had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and also said it was good. place was decent no complaints more pros overall. we didn't go to gr burger because of the long wait and judging the pictures it just looked ok. a few of my friends went to the more expensive gr at paris and they said it was freaking amazing. they never thought they would love a beets salad, amongst other things. gr is a pretty rewritable place on all restaurants in lv, but maybe next time. four stars",

            "just like rodgers and luck are in the upper tier of nfl qbs, i consider holstein's in the upper tier for burgers in vegas. they have a classic burger and the rest are creations with flavorful combinations. the beef is quality, cooked to order, and juicy with a bun that will hold <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> together with its toppings. i've been pleased with every burger that i've tried.\n\ni've had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, fun-ghi, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, and longhorn burger with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> being my favorite. the longhorn is <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> i ordered on my most recent visit. i think the cole slaw, barbecue sauce, and brisket with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is a very good combination. the anderson valley barney flats oatmeal stout from the above average beer selection paired well with my burger.\n\nthe price of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> includes the natural cut fries which are standard, not exceptional. there are plenty of other add-ons, including foie, that you can choose to augment your burger. if you order a shake, you are given a full glass plus the tin. i can't speak at all about dessert.\n\nservice from shina was excellent on our most recent visit without an extended wait from the kitchen. i would say most of the food is priced at least $3 over what you would expect. go in knowing you're going drop a little cash, but also go in knowing you're going to get a solid, top-end burger", 
            "holstein's is one of my consistent favorites here in vegas, always coming up with fun new burger offerings. this time i went for <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. i wasn't sure about its teriyaki glaze as i always fear sweet goopiness, but it was a really light glaze, and the crispy yam, avocado, and spicy mayo gelled together perfectly over the kobe beef. it was my first time there with a group, so i got to see all kinds of good burgers served that night - <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark>, <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, and urth burger were all well-reviewed. <mark>Ahi Sliders</mark> were tiny, but we were warned. \n\nwashed it down with a gritty like i love oatmeal stout. i have yet to try a booze milkshake, but i also have yet to take a photo in the giant stiletto. the day will come.",

            "i would never spend the amount of money at a burger joint that i did the night i went, but my mom won some $$$ so we indulged a bit.\n\nthe hostesses were......not the most welcoming. i don't know why, but they were distracted and just not very nice. not rude, just not nice.\n\nwe had multiple waiters but one in particular who was dressed differently than anyone else in all black was probably someone special like the manager or something. he was super nice and very helpful when it came to ordering our food. i wanted to leave him a bigger tip but we weren't sure who would get it so we just left a 15% tip. i would not have left that much though if it wasn't for him. service was slow and needed repeating multiple times. by chance, one of my friends and his girlfriend were seated next to us. she asked for her food to go. she got it and then asked for her check. by the time she got her check (which she had to ask for again) she had finished the food she had gotten \"to go\".\n\nthe food was really good. i ordered the duck duck goose because nice-waiter-guy said it was the most popular and very gourmet. maybe so, but i didn't enjoy it that much. the taste was weird to me and it was kind of dry.\n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> on the other hand was completely excellent to me!!!! so much and many flavors. if you've read my other reviews, i'm all about many flavors!!! ----------get this!\n\n<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were okay. i still haven't had really amazing spf anywhere.\n\nstrawberry shake was okay. would not order it again.\n\ni would come back here for <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger. \n\nalso, i'm really tired of loud, \"fun\" restaurants. i hate having to yell to talk.", 
            "this restaurant was located on the 2nd floor of the new cosmopolitan.  it was my first time in the casino and although the place was packed, the bartender was courteous and let me know she would be right with me.  after i ordered a corona (22oz!!) i found a chair and order <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger.  i love this place. kobe beef, house glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado!!! i'm done...  good food and big drinks, perfect for a quick stop in las vegas, they've re-made <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> joint another favorite destination for my vacations here.", 
            "i will start out by saying, this place has good food.  i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> kobe burger. it was totally awesome and worth 16 bucks.\n\n\"why the shitty 2 star review kate?\" you ask.  i will splain it to you...\n\nso its about 4pm on a monday. the place is not packed.  its our last meal in vegas before we drive back home. we walk up the the hostess, tell her party of 2.  she asked us if we wanted to be at the bar or in the restaurant.  i tell her restaurant.  she says the wait till be 20 minutes.  i then say, if the bar has regular tables, then we can swing that. she says yes, and then takes us to a coffee table.  i dont want to eat a burger at a goddamn coffee table. so we move to the bar. hmmm. ok... \n\nbartender/waitress-  shes a case.  i ordered a diet coke. she says \"really?\"  yes bitch really. she then also proceeded to criticize my fiance's order. \"thats really small you know. are you sure thats what you want?\"  she also complains about her co workers not getting her??? wtf . at some point she tells this couple next to us, that shes young but knows her drinks?? as if they give a shit.  the whole time shes just talking to us sarcastically and then at some point im quite positive that shes hitting on my dude.  \n\ni can appreciate that they want the staff to be cool/tattooed/young but these people lack any basic customer service skills.  i will assume they will get many complaints before they figure out how to staff this place properly.  \n\nif you can deal with these morons, then eat here.  the food is for sure really good.  maybe you will have better luck than we did.", 
            "holsteins .... take me away \nthe first thing i noticed was the feel and vibe of the restaurant. it has clean modern high-end lines with fresh contemporary \"local?\" graffiti artist art work. it immediately grabbed my interest. the staff is friendly down to earth and looked like they were having fun. ( who wouldn't wearing hot jeans and chucks to work everyday ) . i was entertaining friends so we immediately ordered the appetizers that were perfect for everyone ( the foodies at the table and the overworked and just plain hungry) we had the duck tacos .... amazing and the crab mac and cheese .... to die for ! for lunch our table was impressed with the array of offerings. we had everything from burgers, the homemade sausages and salads. every dish tasted better then then the last. then .... the best part of every ones day... the candy store. you must order it. i don't want to ruin <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> but everyone in the restaurant knows it is at your table. it is a sweet head turner that takes your breath away litter ly. \nholsteins shakes and buns made my day ! and i recommend it highly to anyone.", 
            "just because it's a saturday night in lost wages doesn't mean every restaurant needs to turn into a damn club. at least, not in my world. and yet, here i am trying to enjoy my delicious burger and some conversation with my dad and his fianc\\u00e9 the night before their wedding over the droning sound of a dj spinning coldplay. so unnecessary.\n\nmy burger was really good though. i had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> at the recommendation of our ultra flaky waiter, and it was delicious. tempura avocado? i have told at least 5 people about the hunk of tempura avocado on top of my burger. \n\ni will hit holsteins again for sure, on an afternoon. if i see a dj i'm walking away.", 
            "the alcoholic milk shakes are something that should be tried here. sure, they cost about as much as an entree, but these shakes are probably the highlight of each meal i get here.\n\nburgers are overpriced for what they are. i'd go for the more obscure sounding burgers instead of the more traditional fare. you will not be impressed by the standard burgers (i.e. <mark>Gold Standard</mark>), since they will taste very familiar at a premium price. try something like <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> or the korean bulgogi burger; both very good. these burgers always remind me why i love cows so much.\n\ndo not order the chicken & waffle. all you get is one waffle and snack-bar quality chicken fingers with it. very disappointed on that one. it was like something i could get at a bowling alley. some of the other appetizers look interesting though (lobster corn dogs). the sausages also look like something i need to try on a future visit.\n\nholstein's is definitely a place to check out. place has a great vibe and atmosphere, with enough twist to keep me coming back for more.", 
            "yes, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> at this place are pricey. however, you get what you pay for and in my opinion, the food here is worth the price!  i had the longhorn and it was one of the best burgers i have ever tasted.  friends of mine had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and the duck duck goose and they all said that their burgers were delicious!  combine the excellent burgers with the unique alcoholic shakes and trendy vibe and you get a great restaurant!", 
            "i've been trying to find an awesome burger spot in vegas for quite a while now and the reviews made this place seem pretty decent. \n\nthe restaurant is nice with simple decor and a cool bar. the happy hour seems awesome with the 1$ beers and 1$ shots.\n\nthe service was great and so was the food. the reason this is getting 4 stars is because they appetizers and fries are not that tasty. we ordered the lobster mac n cheese which was just okay, the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> which were decent, and the duck fat tacos which were horrible and small. there are a variety of fries you can order with your dinner. i got the duck fat fries, which i thought might taste a little gamy or greasy, instead they were gross and overcooked. \n\nnow, the best part about this restaurant. i got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger ( i think that's the name of it) and it was delicious! this is by far the best burger i've had in las vegas. i ordered the kobe burger rare and on top of it came, fried yams, cheese, wasabi dressing, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado.  it was to die for! everyone needs to try it. \n\nthe prices are also really great. for the four of us to eat it cost about 130$.\n\nwe will be going back soon", 
            "korean burger over <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> if your feeling adventurous.  my non adventurous friend preferred <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>.  i preferred the korean burger.  which one are you???\n\ngot the truffle lobster mac n cheese and it was sooooooo good!!!  too bad the portion was small.  everyone agreed that it was yum.\n\nmy friend also got the <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with pop rocks... it was good too.", 
            "gonna start with desert.\n\nthe adult shakes are incredible espicaly the <mark>Virgil's Orange Cream</mark> (which really taste like a creamsicle) and the brown cow (a <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with pop rocks and rum).  \n\nthe food is typical of  a good gastro pub; new american fusion.  you are rewarded for being adventurous.  \n\nthe \"street tacos\" are made from duck confit, <mark>Foie Gras</mark> cranberry relish.  they are incredible.  other appetizer standouts include the kalbi and kimchee quesadilla, the bull's balls (no they are not rocky mountain oysters), and the lobster corn dogs. the crispy pork belly bun is worth special mention.  served with hoisin sauce and pea sprouts, its high end dim sum.\n\nmeat in a tube is well represented.  try the greek touri.  different but very flavorful.\n\nfinally, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  although i'm still partial to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> bar, holsteins offerings are very creative and good eats.  cooked perfectly to order.  the \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" (teriyaki glazed kobe burger with spicy mayo and tempura avocado) is a winner.\n\nservice is fast and efficient.\n\none final note, the beer selection is excellent and very reasonably priced for the strip.", 
            "my first trip to vegas was a total culinary disaster. so this time, i did some research. i'll admit, what drew me to holstein's wasn't really the food...it was <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> shakes. <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>? yes, please. and that's what i ordered, which turned out to be delicious beyond my comprehension. whoever thought to mix banana gelato and frangelico deserves to be worshipped.\n\nthe food was equally as outstanding. when i ordered my <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger \"medium rare to rare,\" my server warned, \"the rare is cold and red, while the medium rare is warm and red. would you prefer it warm or cold?\" and so i ordered it medium rare. and out it came, warm and red and juicy kobe beef. i was shocked that for once i didn't have to overcompensate in my ordering just to get a decent amount of pink in my burger. the toppings were perfect (you can't not love tempura avocado, really), and even the teriyaki glaze, which i was skeptical of, wasn't overpowering. the shoestring fries that accompanied it were great, especially with a side of truffle mayo.\n\non top of everything, our server was excellent and very attentive, which in my experience hasn't been the norm in vegas restaurants. holstein's reassured me that there, in fact, is good food to be found on the strip, and i will certainly be returning here on my next trip.\n\nupdate: i finally got back here and had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger this time. a little overcooked, and not as bold in flavor as <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. also, the fries were thicker and not as crisp--why the change?! i'm not as in love with holsteins as i used to be, but it's still one of my favorite affordable spots on the strip. i'll be back a third time for sure!", 
            "to be completely honest, my husband and i stopped in for a quick bite to eat, not expecting anything...but what we got was spectacular!  this is the best burger i have ever had!  and the oreo shake with baileys was the icing on the cake to this place.\n\ni had the \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" burger and my hubby had <mark>The Classic</mark> burger.  these burgers are so flavorful, so soft and tender...like no other burger i've had.  my best comparison, frankly, would be in 'n out...but with a little more pizzazz.  they are fresh, juicy, and tasty!  the extra flavors and ingredients they add to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are unconventional ideas, but oh-so delicious!  the prices are spot on for what you get...i don't mind paying $15 for these burgers at all.  for the record, after this place, i'm no longer giving my money to the ruby tuesdays-sorts anymore.  i'd much rather fly to vegas for my next burger!", 
            "if your friends love burgers, like mine do, this is the perfect place to take them for any special event. a group of us came here for a birthday. we called ahead of time to make a reservation because it was a mid size group and around the holiday season. when we got there, the place was busy, but you could get away without making a reservation.\n\nthe decor is warm, well lit, with splashes of colorful art. \n\nthe server was friendly, attentive when we needed her, and kept her distance while we were celebrating. orders were taken promptly, waters were refilled regularly, and food was brought out in a timely manner.\n\nthe star of this place is the food. the ambiance is nice, but you forget about all that when the food appears. the alcohol milkshakes are amazing. they will definitely satisfy the child and adult within you. we tried four different kind that day. the framboise float was not well balanced. although we love the raspberry cider, it overpowered the vanilla ice cream. on the other hand, the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark>, orange dreamscicle, and the brown cow were delicious. they had enough alcohol to get you feeling good without the constant reminder.\n\nstarting out with the artichoke \"guac\" was unimpressive. in fact, looking back, i cannot remember it as vividly as i do with everything else we ordered.\n\nnow <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are spectacular. if you like it rich, decadent, and everything not good for you then this is the place for you. my group had our burgers family style to share. we got two <mark>Gold Standard</mark>; aged beef, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, goat cheese, greens and aioli. they were delicious. the meat was moist, the saltiness of the cheese and bacon balanced well with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. next was the <mark>Captain Hook</mark>; a salmon filet, greens, pickled shallots, and a caper mayo. the fish was charred and crispy on the outside while moist on the inside and the shallots gave it a nice zing. now this is were we started to go over board and into the heart attack warning zone. the longhorn burger is amazing because it not only has a patty, but stacks on beef brisket, coleslaw. dill pickles, and then slathers it in whiskey bbq sauce. this monster was disgustingly delicious, had my friend panting half way. nothing beats the duck, duck, goose if you are talking about self indulgence. the duck confit and froie gras stuffed patty is ridiculous. when you bite into <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> patty, you are first greeted by mouth watering beef, followed by the creaminess of the duck liver. the blend of all this with the plum sauce is amazing. if you are not a duck or liver fan, avoid this burger because it is ever present throughout. top it all off with a few orders of duck fat fries and you might as well check into the hospital next.", 
            "like every other person i know, i am subject to food cravings. i had been riding the wave of trying to find a good burger to appease my senses when i stumbled upon holstein's. not only did the menu look appealing but they had seemingly found a way to combine two things i love most: sweets and alcohol. sounded like a winner. \n\ni'm a huge fan of goat cheese and avocado so i immediately gravitated to the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger and my dining companion chose <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. of course, we ended up trying each other's and, i have to say, i was definitely not disappointed with what was hitting my tastebuds. both burgers were cooked to perfection and much different than any i have ever eaten; major points for that. \n\nas i said before, two words: alcoholic milkshakes. i didn't get the chance to try one my first time around but the second time, i brought some friends from out of town who i thought would really enjoy it, and we ordered the grasshopper and the smores. both were incredible! sweet, tasty, smooth. they were so delicious, i didn't even mind the price.\n\nholsteins is a treat for everyone, no matter what their eating habits. conservative, experimental, vegan; they do it all! i will definitely be returning soon!", 
            "i've eaten a lot of burgers at a lot of places and i would be hard pressed to name a better one than the ones i sampled here. i can't wait to come back and keep working my way down the list.\n\nwe went with a big group and were able to sample a few different burgers. i order the '<mark>Gold Standard</mark>' which was epic. loved the goat cheese. friend across the table ordered the 'longhorn' and we did a little burger swappage. the longhorn was also excellent, and the brisket was fantastic. the star of the show for me though was when i sampled the '<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>'. it was literally an explosion of tastiness in my food hole. i had never heard of tempura avocado, much less considered putting it on a burger, but i think i'm going to put it on all my burgers from now on.\n\nwhile <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> all were exceptional, the fries were pretty ordinary. i ordered the duck fat fries myself and was underwhelmed. not sure what i was expecting, but i thought they would be noticeably different than regular fries. they were tasty, just not different like i expected. i also tried some of the regular fried which were well... regular fries. i did manage to snag one onion ring from the spousal unit while she wasn't looking. much better than the fries. nice and crispy and cooked through to the inside.\n\nas it was st patrick's day and we were busy drinking green beers and shots, we did not get around to sampling the shakes. i will put that on the agenda for the next visit(s).", 
            "had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger made of kobe beef, topped with nori furikake and avocado tempura.  just da bomb!  i rarely order anything other than <mark>The Classic</mark> burger but am so glad i did here.\n\ngotta love a place that has ommegaang on tap.  plus, they serve it in a pint glass - which is kinda dangerous since it's 8.5% abv but hey, i aint complaining.\n\nand don't sleep on those <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>.  \n\nthis place is a bit expensive but no more so than any other places on the strip.  quickly became one of my favorite spots in vegas to eat.", 
            "2:00 pm, saturday in las vegas.  you wake up, finally, and realize that your intense inebriation from friday night has been replaced with a hankering for some good food.  this is me a few weekends ago.  \n\ni was supposed to wake up and go to bouchon in the morning to get a fancy breakfast, but somehow that didn't happen.  i even told my friends i would meet them there.  sleep prevailed for a few more hours.  when my friends got back from their breakfast, i was hungry for lunch.  as we ventured to explore the new cosmopolitan hotel, holsteins immediately caught my eye... well the pink cow in front sure did.  the modern feel and fun music drew us in. \n\nthe menu has a bunch of fun items to choose from.  their list of burgers is amazing.  delicious meaty burgers.  they also had a great selection of alcoholic shakes (bam-boozled shakes) and some cute flavored shots.  they also have plenty of beer and wine.  the ultimate burger spot i'd say.\n\ni decided to get <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>.  it was a kobe beef burger with teriyaki glaze, furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado.  this was recommended from the waitress as her favorite burger.  it was honestly quite salty but it was really good.  the best part was the tempura avocado.  we also tried the korean bull-gogi.  that came with an over easy egg, kim chee, and kalbi glaze.  this burger was not as salty and also very good.  the kobe beef of <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> made that burger super moist though.\n\nto drink we shared the oreo shake, which had bailey's irish cream in it.  make sure that you finish it cold because a luke-warm alcoholic shake is not so good.  the bailey's was really good and just barely noticeable, except when i felt my the heat in my face.  it is kinda pricey for a shake though $11.\n\ni would definitely come back to get some yummay burgers next time i am in lv... which i hope is soon!", 
            "any place there's a pink and white cow in the middle of the bar, i'm there.\n\nholstein's was a great find last night, after countless hours of scouring the yelp site for something other than sushi.  i was ready for a change, for a new spot to grab a burger, and when i saw the reviews for holsteins and it's location, i had to give it a try.  \n\nlet me start by saying that the cosmo itself is beautiful, and this place makes it even better with a pink and white cow in the middle of the bar.  \n\ni made reservations through their website (highly recommended) for dinner at 9pm.  late?-sure, but it prevents us from eating with the regular dinner crowd.  we arrived and were greeted by the nice hostess who seated us immediately a corner half booth.\n\nthe ambiance is really comforting and chic, which i love.  with the chocolate leather seating to the bright colored tiles aligning one wall and picture-framed tv's, it's metrosexual.  the menu is interesting, too, boasting unique sodas, shakes, and burgers.  obviously, the menu was in the higher dollar range for a burger considering it is in the cosmo, but i went all out and ordered what i wanted.  \n\ni ordered their newest shake--the cereal bowl--which tasted like breakfast in the morning but in a really fantastic way.  with vanilla ice cream mixed with crushed cap'n crunch and fruity pebble cereal, it was quite a treat to have, almost like dessert before dinner.  i love it.  i'm a big cereal person, so this was perfect for me (and it was suggested by the server).\n\nfrank picked up this crazy strawberry soda that was really really good.  i'm going to try and find it at the soda shop on trop and the 215.\n\nwe had the philly spring rolls with tempura pepper slices and ketchup.  it was freakin' great.  the flavors and textures were all on point.  when you combine a philly with a spring roll, magic happens.  squishy, creamy, gooey cheese oozes out of the end and the ketchup makes it all the better.\n\nwe ordered their kettle chips, which had this great bleu cheese salt on them, and the french dip was awesome, too.  unfortunately, the spring rolls trumped the chips, but they would go great with a beer at the bar, for sure.\n\ni ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger: kobe beef patty with tempura avocado, crispy yam strings, teriyaki sauce and spicy mayo.  wow. just the right amount of sauce and the yams gave it this nice, sweet, spicy flavor and texture.  the meat itself was well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  with that soft, white bun that didn't overpower the meal (it was really light), i believe that i found my favorite burger in vegas.\n\nfrank ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>: aged beef patty with guyere (substituted for the aged goat cheese), lettuce, tomato, and onion.  he added lobster, which made it decadent and very flavorful. the sweetness of the lobster accentuated the patty's aged flavor.  it's a winner, for sure.\n\nwith no room for dessert, we tapped out with an 81.00 bill, which was expected.  i would definitely eat here again. and again. and again.\n\nif you want to try this place out, do.  there's a lot of try and many days out of the year to do it.", 
            "i'll get the bad news out of the way: the hostesses were shockingly rude and their ineptitude staggering. had i not had my heart set on a burger, i would have turned on my heal and gone next door (who had a friendly greeting just viewing the menu).  i overheard the table next to me going on about the ridiculousness of these horrid hostesses after being sat by one.  these girls had a \"what are you doing here?\" attitude. i imagine one of them answering the phone: \"holsteins, you're welcome.\"  perhaps smiling 101 could be a start?\n\nthat being said:  server (kyle) recommended <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger and it was the best burger i've had ever.  tempura avocado, nori furikaki, crispy sweet potatoes...give me one right this second.  service was cool, friendly, and professional.  nicely done.\n\natmosphere was fun and lively, but the stupid bass from the dj was literally vibrating <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> i was sitting in.  let's go for quality over quantity here, holsteins. \n\nbamboozled shakes are inventively crafted, by suggestion had the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>...yum.\n\n1 star for door, 5 for service and food.", 
            "burgers and shakes...yum!\n\ncame here for lunch with some friends from china. they wanted to try some \"american food\" so we brought them here to check it out.\n\nthis place has some awesome burgers and shakes. they are a bit pricey though. the shakes are good tasting and a bit creative, although at $11 dollars, are a bit on the expensive side. \n\nhad the drunken money ( reeses pieces and bananas), and the cereal bowl (vanilla with pieces of cereal) \n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are very tender, and although i only had the \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" (kobe beef, with spices and avocado) ($16.5), the other burgers looked very good too.\n\nvery good food at a higher price, but if you're in las vegas everything is going to cost more!", 
            "in a slightly inebriated state, i once tried to make ice cream shots with one of my best friends because we thought the ice cream would mask the taste of alcohol. we thought we were geniuses. til we tried it. and it was not good.\n\nbut...holstein's has somehow managed to change that. if you're at the cosmo or near the cosmo, it'll be worth your while to try a \"bamboozled shake.\" after being heavily advertised to go here by thia g, i forced my friends walking around the strip with me during the day to come get a shake with me. the wait was rather long for them to make it, but take pictures of the spotted pink cow while you're waiting!\n\nordered a frozen grasshopper because i love mint. it came with a cute light green peppermint meringue on top and sprinkled mini chocolate malt balls. alcohol content was creme de menthe and van gogh dutch chocolate vodka. \n\nbest. milkshake. i've. ever. had. period. and i mean, at $11 a pop, it had better be damn good. but it was! i couldn't taste the alcohol at all, although i felt the effects later, but shoot, i'll be damned if i ever had such a delicious milkshake before in my life. i may just be biased because it was mint flavored and i have an obsession with mint, but i'm pretty sure everyone else with me agreed that it wasn't just me. \n\ntry it! i can't wait to go back to vegas and try another flavor! =) 5 stars for their bamboozled shakes! and thanks thia g. for <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>!",

            "after reading many yelpers raving about this place, the girlfriend and i decided to give it a shot.  the pink cow didn't hurt too (how can you turn away a pink cow?!? she says)\n\nlocation:  located in the new cosmopolitan hotel right outside of marquee nightclub, this joint is in a prime spot to see and be seen in.  definite positive points in my book.\n\natmosphere:  the top 40s music really gets your heart pumping and is very fitting for a cosmo hotel food establishment.  i honestly didn't take much notice to the artwork and aesthetic elements of the restaurant.  very pop modern feel without being too noisy or overbearing.  there is a bar and lounge area at the front if your in the mood for a more casual mingling time with knee high tables and lcd tvs behind the bar.  beyond that is the regular dining portion of the restaurant.\n\nfood:  \n-<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>\n-\"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger\"\n-<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\n-shoestring fries\n\n<mark>Fried Pickles</mark> baby!  money. ok honestly this was the first time i had <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> in my life, and well i am a die hard pickle lover (so really any sort of pickles would be great), these were pretty bomb.  they give you a little tin with some breaded <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> in them, fried olives, and caper berries!  what is a caper berry? yes first time i have come across one myself (like ash finding a new pokemon i guess? kinda puzzling, yet exciting).  but yah, it was pretty darn good.  i was kinda sad that there were only a few of them (about 5-6 wedges of pickles, 2 olives, 2 caper berries), but they were good, while they lasted. :(  also there was a small assortment of deli meats (salami, ham, prosciutto) which seemed like an odd pairing with the fried items, but they were a a nice tasty tid bit before our meal came.  we both having similar tastes, the gf and i ordered \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" burger.  to be honest, the server who brought our burgers out said this was the best burger in his opinion on the menu.  (i'll be the judge of that myself sir, lol).  well this burger was seriously a masterpiece in of itself.  kobe beef patty with a teri glaze, brought me back to punahou carnival days (if your from hawaii and know what im talking about), and on top of that you get the little shredded yam crispies adding color and a little bit of sweetness to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, nori furikake inside, with a generous piece of fried avocado, again giving another element of texture and creaminess to your bite.  then for the finale, the spicy mayo spread on the bun (like the kine you get with spicy tuna sushi), is like a ninja just hiding there as you gaze at all the other elements of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, waiting to make its presence known.  this my friend gives you that zing of heat (without being overpowering) that really brings all these flavors together, and for me this spicy mayo was the winnaz.  quite honestly one (if not the) best burger i've had the honor to come across in my life.  you also get your choice of bun (white or wheat).  both of which are quite tasty, as i got the white and the gf got the wheat, really can't go wrong with either.  they come with your choice of fries: shoestring or steak-cut.  i didn't want to copy the gf as i wanted the shoestring, so i convinced her to ask to upgrade to <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  they come in little mock fry-baskets which is a thumbs up for presentation.  for the taste of each of the fries, both were very good, would definitely recommend either in a heartbeat.  also they give you a nice amount of fries which is always great!\n\nprice:  ok so this is always <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> side of a vegas story, but honestly people it is vegas and yes $16-17 bucks for a designer burger is on the steep side for most people, but it is in my honest opinion worth it.\n\nverdict:  holsteins presents itself as a hip, modern burger/diner type joint in the heart of the new cosmopolitan hotel.  it's decor and atmosphere really mesh well with the feel of the hotel itself and the food it presents.  you really get what you pay for in my opinion, a great designer burger, one that you quite honestly could not find anywhere else.  in comparison, for $16-17 i would take it over blt's wagyu beef burger & max brenner's kobe burger any day for the same price range.  it's definitely a place to check out if you're in the moooood for some good burgers!\n\n(they are known for their shakes too, but we didnt get to try them as the idea of a shake first thing in the morning after a long night clubbing didn't quite fit the agenda, if you know what i mean)", 
            "it's hard to resist a restaurant that offers spiked shakes and gourmet burgers.  my friend june had been to holsteins on an earlier vegas trip and come back raving that it was the one restaurant she'd hit that she wanted to revisit.  i can't tell you how many times i stared drooling at the menu before we went for dinner.\n\nholsteins is in the new and beautiful cosmopolitan hotel, and it's right across from marquee.  we went and got stamped for the marquee before we checked in for dinner, and we ended up missing our reservation (held for fifteen minutes).  the staff was nice about it, though, and it turned out that seating, even for a party of seven, was not a problem.  holsteins is a swanky place, with comfortable booths and a giant pink cow on display.  we had a waiter named chaz, and he was friendly and on his game.\n\nthe drinks were everything i wanted and more.  the spiked milkshakes were absolutely delicious.  the frozen grasshopper came with peppermint meringue, chocolate crunchies, creme de menthe, and van gogh dutch chocolate vodka.  i can't imagine it was terribly boozy, but it was a fabulous milkshake, with full mint chocolate flavor and the perfect thickness.  the little meringue was delightful, and the crunchy chocolate bits added texture to every sip.  the brown cow was also fantastic, an adult <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float made with <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, vanilla ice cream, pop rocks, and charbay tahitian vanilla rum.  it had all the kid-pleasing taste of a great <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, and i can't overstate the fun of pop rocks.  i also tried the bloody mary, without ice cream, but with smirnoff infused with pepper and cilantro, combined with bloody mary mix and garnished with a toothpick bearing an olive and a cocktail shrimp.  i love a good bloody mary, and this was a good one.  it had a heavy spicy flavor but a thin clean texture, and i appreciate food in my drink when appropriate.\n\nour table split three appetizers, and that felt like the right amount.  the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> were easily my favorite, breaded and deep-fried dill spears, olives, and caper berries, served with small sides of prosciutto and salami and an herb-caper mayo for dipping.  these were magical.  the breading was flavorful, crispy, and light, and the pickles oozed their pickly flavor.  i would also recommend the bucket of <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark>, which came with a bleu cheese dip.  nothing fancy, but delicious.  i was disappointed, though, by the truffle lobster mac' n cheese.  the creamy tallegio-mascarpone sauce was more creamy than it was cheesy, making the appetizer more like a macaroni salad.  the maine lobster was barely there, and the black truffle didn't come through.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were very good, though i suspect that the strength may lie in the toppings.  <mark>The Classic</mark> - with just lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, ketchup, and pickles - was the most boring of the bunch, and that doesn't hold true with a remarkable patty.  the patties were definitely tasty, though, with plenty of juice, and they held up well to some fun accompaniments.  my favorite was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>.  with a kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado, it was definitely a loaded gimmick of a fusion burger - but damn if i didn't gobble it down.  the teriyaki was sweet but not cloying, and the salt of the speckles of dried seaweed was great.  the crispy yam gave a welcome crunch, and that strip of avocado tempura was creamy and beautiful.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was also good, a dry-aged beef sirloin burger topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli.  it was less of a stand-out, though, and the tomato confit did not bring on the umami parade i'd hoped for.  if you like lamb burgers, the big fat greek is a good choice.  with greek spiced lamb, feta cream, lettuce, tomato, tzatziki sauce, and red onion and olive relish, it's a little like a greek menu threw up on a burger.  the result, though, is hearty and pretty well done.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> all come with a side of fries, and you have a choice of shoestring, sweet potato, and steak cut.  i prefer my thin fries, and the shoestring and sweet potato were both superb.  holsteins knows its way around a potato - even the steak cut fries were well seasoned and not at all mushy.\n\nwhen we left for marquee we were all stuffed to the brim.  the meal was not cheap - burgers started at $13 and shakes were $11 - but it was a satisfying feast that hardly qualified as a splurge in vegas.  i've had better burgers, but i was impressed by <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, and i doubt i've had better milkshakes.  if you're in vegas hankering for a fattening meal, check holsteins out.", 
            "it's almost hard to believe that holstein's is run by the same people responsible for lbs at the red rock. i guess if i had to make an analogy, this place is like michael jackson (in terms of talent, not behavior or affinity for boys) whereas lbs is latoya (or maybe even janet) and the lbs patty wagon is tito.\n\nwhat that means, is this place rocks. the menu is more diverse and creative than it's sibling establishments with it's spiked milkshakes, apps, burgers, alternative dishes for non-burger folks, and an extensive beer list.\n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> ($16.50) is an amazing burger made out of a sizable kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake (yeah, i had to look up furikake to know what it was... i'm not ashamed to admit it), crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. the ingredients gave it a rich, sweet, unique flavor and the crispy yam bits a crunchy texture. if i have any complaint about this burger it's the height of it. the thick patty and huge slices of avocado make it difficult to get the whole thing in your mouth (didn't macauley culkin say the same thing to mj?).\n\nmy wife got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> ($17.50) - dry aged beef sirloin with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli. she loved it and only let me have one bite. if you want a more traditional burger, go for this. but, i still thought <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> was better.\n\neach burger came with an order of fries. so she got the regular fries and i got he steak cut fries. both were very good -- crispy exterior, light and soft interior.\n\nour son got the kid's chicken fingers and fries. that's always a winner with him. it came with 3 big tenders and some carrots and celery.\n\neven after those big burgers we still had room for dessert. our choice... lollipops. the chocolate brownie and strawberry were excellent. the lemon meringue and <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> were largely forgettable and uninspired and the blondie was bland and didn't come close to reminding me of a blondie brownie.\n\ndespite the lackluster dessert, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were so good i can overlook that misstep. we didn't have any issues with the service, especially the kitchen, which sent out the food surprisingly fast. i'm not sure if i'd say this is my favorite burger place, but it's definitely one of the top and one that shouldn't be missed.",

            "i came here specifically to try the duck fat fries but unfortunately it is no longer on the menu. didn't get to try the spiked milkshakes but the four of us came in so hungry, we each ordered a burger. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (fried avocado tempura, fried yam, 8 oz. kobe beef, and teriyaki sauce) yum. also tried the bulgogi burger (not bulgogi at all, just same beef patty, kimchee, and a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> with runny yolk)\n\nit was very tasty and came with either shoestring or steak cut fries, but i sorta wished the fried yam in my <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> was one thick slice that was tempura fried as well instead of shredded (they looked like carrot shreds).\n\ntruffle popcorn was tasty since we were so hungry but there wasn't much truffle taste to it. still yum though!",

(though, at $76 for lunch, we could have done without a few dishes. more on that later.)\n\nmy husband and i went on a sunday morning at 11:05 after they first opened for the day. we got seated right away at a table near the flat screens to watch the games, but within 10 or 15 minutes, the place was jam packed with diners. \n\nhere's a rundown of what we ordered: all very well executed, though would have benefitted from a few minor changes. fun novelty items too. \n\n1. <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>: loved this preparation, because these <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> are spears, not chips that fall apart and taste nothing like a pickle. this gives each bite a nice tang. flavorful sauce condiment and nice touch to have sliced meats on the side. also came with fried olives ad fried capers...though the capers were kinda dried and tasteless. \n\n2. crispy pork belly bun : steamed mantou type buns (two mini sized) and two large chunks of crispy pork belly and hoisin. very, very good,  i've had variations of this dish many times, and this one is nice. very fatty, very crisp and flavorful. though. i'd appreciate more cilantro, and some acid to cut through the fat. \n\n3. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger: juicy and hot, slathered in sauce, kimchi and a <mark>Fried Egg</mark>...get your napkins! just get is. that's all i have to say about this one. \n\n4. tenderloin rossini: pork tend loin sliders with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> (sp? i dunk, i dot eat enlarged duck liver...is that right, very often!) was good...but as always with tenderloin, desperately needed some fat. came with house made chips, but would have preferred fries or rings. \n\n5. cake lollypop, nitrogen merangues, (sp?) push pop: strawberry cheesecake lollypop was delicious, dipped in white chocolate and had a small strawberry gel disc on top. the nitro meringue (sp?) is bubblegum flavored, and  tiny, but prepared tableside and more for show than anything. blow smoke for 30 seconds and impress your friends! for $2 it's a fun way to end a meal. the push pop...overrated. nice novelty, but the sorbet is hard and makes it difficult to eat. cute concept though. \n\nservice rocked. glasses always full, plates cleared as soon as we were finished. warm environment, creative menu items. would hit up again...and would try the long list of milkshakes!", 
            "this was by far the best burger i've ever had!!! i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger and the meat was sooo moist!  i loved the teriyaki glaze, tempura avocado, and yam crisps.  such an interesting and unique blend of flavors.  my boyfriend got the campfire s'more bam-boozled shake which was delicious and the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was smokey and rich and the aged goat cheddar cheese, bacon and arugula brought it all together.  \n\nholsteins will surely become our go-to amazing meal spot in vegas.  sooooooo good!  why does it have to be so far away?", 
            "this place is the definition of gourmet burger! i had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, with a friend egg on top?! genius!!! very big and juicy burger, you really cant go wrong. the get real creative with their burgers and its sooo huge that i just gotta keep coming back to try more!", 
            "my friends and i were getting ready to head over to marquee in the cosmopolitan, but had to stop somewhere to get our grub on before we get our freak on. we walked by holsteins and decided to pop in for some burgers and fries.\n\nthe ambiance was nice and the dj was spinning some awesome music. we were quickly seated and the waiter took our order. my sister and i settled on the hen house (has bacon and a <mark>Fried Egg</mark>, bam!) while the others got korean bull'gogi (<mark>Fried Egg</mark> and lots of kimchi) and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (teriyaki). the waiter was super patient and helpful with us when we tried to decided and even allowed for us to cut burgers in half to share. if you decide for smaller portions, they even have sliders which is a great option for those who wanna keep it light before dancing.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came out with either shoestring or steakcut fries and both were delicious. i think i may have been a fan of the shoestring though as it had a great crisp to it while steakcut had a great potato-y inside. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were cooked exactly how we we wanted (in my case it was medium) and was a big-ass burger. i'm glad i opted to share mine with someone because i wouldn't have been able to finish it on my own. \n\ni'd definitely come here in the future to eat if i'm headed to the club since it's right across from holsteins but i gotta go back next time to try their shakes! they looked great, but something about all that milk and alcohol didn't mix for me, so i decided against it this time around. all in all, i much prefer this joint compared to burger bar at mandalay bay.", 
            "burgers, shakes, and more burgers....\n\nfirst being a popcorn lover, you can only imagine my excitement when the waitress dropped off some complimentary cheddar popcorn to start our meal! \n\nbasically this place is the biz for its gourmet burgers and alcoholic shakes.  i went here twice in one day, that's how much i liked <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and shakes.  there's other stuff like truffle lobster mac n cheese and interesting snacks like pizza \"twinkies\", <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>, fried green tomatoes and kalbi beef with kimchee quesadillas.  they also have sliders as well.  i'll def. be back to try these.\n\ni had the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> shake and a taste of my friend's <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake....both sooooo gooooood!  \n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>- juicy meat and i surprisingly liked the combination.  \nkorean \"bull\"gogi- juicy meat, i liked the flavor of this.  if you like bulgogi, you'll love this.\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark>- so i thought this was kinda dry, plus i\"m not really into goat cheese so i didn't like it as much.  but my bro loved it.\nburgers were pretty decent in size, i was stuffed after one and the guys were satisfied after theirs.  burgers also come with a choice of shoestring fries or steak cut fries, both were deelish. \nthey also have a pretty decent stocked bar and a selection of beer that my fiance enjoyed.\n\nthese gourmet burgers are pricey, 13-17.5 bucks.  shakes are around 11 bucks.  but it's vegas and the food was great, so in that case i didn't mind!  i recommend checking this place out if you're in the mood for some tasty burgers and shakes...", 
            "been to holsteins about 4 times now, and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger is my fave burger so far; tasty, crispy, slightly salty, and overall yummie! the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger had too much going on, and it fell apart after a couple bites. and the korean 'bull'gogi, with kimchee slaw, actually tasted sweet instead of spicy that kimchee is suppose to be. as far as the spiked shakes, i had the frozen grasshopper which was sweet and not very 'spiked.' and the service is quick, and the atmosphere is loud and bar-like.", 
            "order: we (6 people, all sharing) had the steak house burger with steak-cut fries and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> with shoe-string fries, calamari, thick cut <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, lobster bisque sliders, coke, arnold palmer, and a drink that starts with a \"b\" that i can't remember right now... but it tasted like beer and apple cider. the bill (comes with gratuity for 6 people) with a little extra was $114.\n\ngood:\n+ food: everything was tasty, juicy, flavorful, delicious. everything looked beautiful as well, and the table comes with (instead of a basket of bread) a bucket of bbq popcorn. how fun! it was a great non-filling munching snack too (because you'll definitely want to save room for the delicious food).\n+ atmosphere: very energetic, fun, a little colorful with a life-size hot pink cow statue... and very warm.  a good place to come with a group of people.\n+ service: our server, chaz, was super nice and shared a great story of how he was carded even though he's a super-tall guy.  he was quick, friendly, and very attentive.  also, other servers we didn't know came by and picked up the empty plates fairly quickly.\n\nbad:\n- price: i would come here to try it once, which i did and i am glad i got to taste such a high-end delicious burger! but, really, a $16-$20 burger is craziness. worth trying, once or twice! but craziness.  this is not a place for the kids (unless you're ready to spend more) because they probably won't even appreciate the high-quality burgers--i was a kid once, and honestly, a burger's a burger when i was little!! (and if you're not willing to spend a bit more at this joint, they'll probably go hungry.)\n\n\noverall: i really enjoyed my experience here, and i'd come back if i felt like splurging.", 
            "the deco of this place is pretty neat - a bit hipster, a bit modern. for the food, we had:\n\n1. for the life of me, i cannot remember the shake that i got. but it was very delicious! it was an alcoholic one, and consisted of some kind of passion fruit alcohol/schnapp, vanilla ice cream, and dry ice. it was very good and refreshing. if you're looking for more of a milkshake, don't get this one, as it wasn't thick and creamy. it was refreshing though, and not too sweet, which was amazing.\n\n2. kimchi quesadillas - as someone who is from la and very used to korean food, i was expecting an exotic quesadilla with spicy kimchi. however, the kimchi tasted a bit sweet, and was not what i was expecting. just a mess of oily goodness, if you ask me.\n\n3. my boyfriend got the \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" burger, and it was pretty good. the best part of it was the tempura avocado, which was something i've never heard of before! it definitely gave <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> a little something special, and with the tender patty, it was a good complement. however, it wasn't that big, and my boyfriend was still starving afterwards.\n\n4. i just got the \"<mark>Greener Pastures</mark>\" salad, which is a basic salad. nothing special about it at all; although they gave me <mark>Avocado</mark>, they were a bit raw.\n\nthe price was about $60 for 2 people, but hey, its vegas, what do you expect? was pretty good comfort food, but definitely can get better elsewhere!", 
            "a bit of yelp research led us to have a late lunch at holsteins during our trip, and we were definitely not disappointed.\n\nit was a monday afternoon, around 2pm, so it wasn't too busy. we chose to sit in the lounge and i was surprised that our service was much better than foursquare told me it would be - our waitress was quick with menus and water, and our food came out of the kitchen at a pretty standard speed.\n\nwe started with a <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> and a black cow. my bf is notoriously picky about milkshakes, and claims that the monkey is the best milkshake he's ever had. i doubled checked because that seemed like a big claim for him, but he stood by it. both shakes were really delicious, and my black cow didn't seem too boozy, but it must've had plenty of that cherry vodka, because i could taste cherry pretty well. the menu seems to have been adjusted from the one on their website, i think a few of the shakes were different but not the ones we wanted, so it didn't really bother me.\n\nwe also ordered the pizza twinkies - it was either that or <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>, but we can get those everywhere in florida, so we went with what would be more unique. they were really yummy, and the marinara dipping sauce was also delicious.\n\nburger-wise, i had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and the bf had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, both cooked medium. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> did not disappoint from the rave reviews online - their teriyaki sauce was freakishly delicious,  and the spicy mayo was just the right amount of spicy (the two mixed together were amaaaazing on my fries). the avocado was a little unwieldy, and i would have preferred a few thin slices. i didn't think the avocado needed to be tempura'd, either, but i guess i get the appeal.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was almost completely devoured by the time i got a bite, so i guess he enjoyed it. both the shoestring and the steak fries were awesome, i couldn't stop eating either of them. super crispy and delicious.\n\ni can't think of any reason to give holsteins less than 5 stars besides the price (a bit high for burgers but honestly reasonable for the strip) and the fact that there isn't one in orlando.", 
            "my overall feeling for holsteins in a sentence: its alright, but not worth the price.\n\ni ordered their <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, which  contained a kobe beef patty in teriyaki glaze topped with furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. i thought <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was overcooked, which ruined the texture of the kobe beef patty.  the spicy mayo was ok and not spicy so if you're not into spicy food you'll do fine with this burger.  i thought the tempura avocado was interesting.  the avocado was nice and soft with a nice crisp tempura coating.  it's a good burger but i don't think it was worth $16.50.  i probably would try a different burger if i dine here again.", 
            "order <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>! everything about it was delicious! prices are a tad high, but not for vegas standards. i deducted one star because the shoestring fries were fried to a crisp making them almost inedible. would probably return when i'm in vegas again and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> craving hits.", 
            "mmmmm! i went to holsteins on a birthday trip to vegas last weekend based on yelp reviews. as a vegetarian (i eat some fish) i had studied the menu ahead of time to make sure there was enough food for me to eat. i was beyond excited to try <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> shake and was not disappointed one bit, it was the perfect shake/cake combo! wow! my friends tried the peppermint and chocolate banana shakes also and they were all fantastic. i'm not sure there is much booze actually in them but i really wanted it more for the shake factor!\n\nwe ordered some appetizers, i had both the lobster truffle mac and cheese and the calamari, both were excellent. the mac and cheese was amazing, i could have easily ordered that for dinner and been satisfied. \n\nafter the appetizers i should have called it quits (i was full enough and extremely satisfied) but i decided to order the vegan burger and shoestring fries, the vegan burger was good, piles of avocado on top which i love but the patty wasn't anything special. i've had better vegan patties.....the avocado though was awesome. the fries were cooked perfectly also. \n\nmy boyfriend and mom both had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> n turf sliders, i did not try these but both of them said they are well worth the price tag.....\n\noverall the prices were decent for vegas, not too expensive and definitely enough food to fill us up for dinner. i definitely recommend the restaurant!!",

            "at close to 500 reviews for holstein's, i guess i don't really need to add my opinion but what the hell.\n\ni cannot come to vegas without a stop at this restaurant. seriously. i often wish that i had starved myself a little more before coming so that i could eat more. it's that good.\n\nlet's start with their bam-boozled shakes. shakes, yum. add alcohol? uh yes please. i've had the frozen grasshopper (peppermint, chocolate, creme de menthe, and chocolate vodka) <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake (i think this might be new since i don't see it on their online menu. think sprinkles, and bits of cake), and the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> (reese's, banana, malt, and frangelico). all amazing.\n\nas for their food, i love their apps. hello fried cheese curds, truffle lobster mac and cheese, and <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> served with fried caper berries, olives, and salami. though i think their menu has changed. i got the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> again this weekend and there were no other sides to the dish. i was a little sad about it.\n\nokay, now for the main course. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. i'm already drooling... <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger is still one of my favorites. kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. wow. no really, wow. the hen house burger? delicious but nothing super fancy. the korean bull'gogi burger is yum. i'm a sucker for a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> and kimchi and this burger has both as well as chili mayo. and last but not least (for the beef burgers anyway), the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger. beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic chive aioli. you can't be serious.\n\ndon't worry vegan/vegetarians, there's something for you too. they have a vegan burger which actually sounds pretty tasty and there is a wonderful salmon burger called <mark>Captain Hook</mark>. the salmon is thick and moist and comes with pickled shallots, caper herbed mayo, and house cured gravlax. salmon on salmon. i won't say no.\n\nall burgers are served with a side and i love their shoe string fries. crispy, thin and perfectly salted for my taste.\n\nat this point, if you still care about the ambience and the service, here it is. i like both. the restaurant is nice but not overly fancy.  service is prompt and friendly but not overbearing. \n\nafter writing this review, i'm tempted to jump in my car and drive down there just for the food. i wish i was kidding...", 
            "a good burger in vegas, but you can find much better for the money.\n\nthe prices are what you would expect for \"gormet\" burgers, and is within reason. \n\nlet me first start off saying that it is crazy busy.  we went on a wednesday night around 9pm and had to wait almost an hour for our table.  then we ordered, and it took 45min to get our food.  the waiter kept coming over saying the food was almost done, but it was literally 45min from order to table for a burger. \n\nalso, it is exteremly loud.  i am only 26, so you will not hear me complaining about noise very often, but this is seriously almost club loud...where you literally have to yell to the person 3ft from you to hear each other.  not really a big deal, but don't come here expecting to have good conversation with your meal.\n\ni always order my $$ burgers medium rare...but mine came out well done.  no pink at all on the insides, and my kobe was not what it should have been.  not the way i wanted to enjoy my kobe....very very minimal juice and everyone else's burger was overcooked as well.   i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, and it was definitely packed with flavor, but  i should have ordered regular sirloin if they were gonna destroy my burger.  my friend ordered the bulgoki burger, and said it tasted like a hamburger with the marinade dripped over it...he wasn't impressed, and that's sad for a $17 burger.\n\ni had a run at an oreo shake \"to go\" and it took about 20min to get it.  it was already a little watery and i should have just refused it...same thing with my burger.  \n\noverall i am happy that i tried it, and i learned from this experience...to reject food when it comes like this.", 
            "while the rest of our friends were getting ready to go clubbing later that night, a couple of my buddies and i decided to grab some burgers before going bar hopping around fremont street.  i originally wanted to check out holstein's after seeing them on our last vegas trip, but there wasn't an opportunity to go since we had already planned out the rest of our meals.  after i read yelp friend cat c.'s review though, i told my friends it was a must for our next trip!\n\nalthough some yelpers have complained about how long the wait was for a table, we didn't run into the same problem.  luck must have been on our side because not only did it take just a few minutes until we were seated, but we also got a server (jennifer?) who was both awesome and way cute.  double win!  a bunch of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> on the menu sounded pretty appealing (especially <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, the steakhouse, and korean \"bull\"gogi), but somehow the three of us managed to order the exact same thing - the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> (dry aged beef sirloin with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic chive aioli) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p7pxqfqr7ybkmmi2j51udw?select=verdaowpafm6pp_ufdmjeq).\n\nthe patty was cooked perfectly - just a touch of pink on the inside, juicy, and a light char on the outside.  adding in the <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark> just made it that much better (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p7pxqfqr7ybkmmi2j51udw?select=t6cdvih3qcnh95l9pnfava).  while all of the condiments worked really well together, i have to admit all that aged goat cheddar got to be a bit much.  not bad for the first half of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, but i was reminded during the last half why i'm not a huge fan of goat cheese.  we all agreed though that the biggest knock was the bun - a bit dry and pretty plain.  just making it smaller and less airy would have gone a long way.\n\nall things considered, the prices for their burgers aren't unreasonable.  at about $13-$18 each, you actually get your money's worth for the most part (unlike china poblano next door...).  whichever one you get though, i'd suggest choosing the shoestring fries to go with it (they're more like regular cut fries than \"shoestring\").  while the tin of steak fries that came with my order were fine, i thought the shoestring fries my friend had were crispier and a little more flavorful.  now i just have to go back and try one of holstein's shakes - preferably of the alcoholic variety.", 
            "<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was amazing!!! <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> was a little too sweet, but the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was perfect. expensive ass burgers, but very well worth it. tasteful, full of juice and flavor. i usually like my meat medium rare, but the waitress recommend rare stating that medium rare would be really red and bloody. ummmmmm it was not red enough! burgers were still good but wished it was more red. staff was very friendly, and there was no wait at all during lunch time. fries weren't that great, but i need to try the shakes next time.", 
            "the \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" is going down!\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was awesome and very reasonable. the patty was cooked perfectly and all of the ingredients were fresh and flavorful. i was pleased to say the least! \n\nbut let's get to the best part of the meal...what i think was the most important part....the milkshake! swear to all that is good in this world, the best milkshakes in the world live here! it's like they invented them and then perfected them by adding alcohol. i had the peanutbutter shake (don't remember the name, too busy destroying it!) and it was amazing. if i could consume 2 shakes in one sitting, it would have been done!", 
            "i really enjoy this spot, and on top of that anything by this same company (block 16, they run barrymore, public house, and more). trendy, good people watching, fast service, unique and good food is always a solid mix for a vegas restaurant. \n\nmy favorite shakes are the green grasshopper, a minty and chocolatey mix of wonderfulness and the straight oreo. i love <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, i've had a bunch of them and i believe <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and the steak/mushroom burger are both delivered to this planet from some culinary god.\n\nthere are a few drawbacks though, price is one. pretty expensive, but its what you expect for being in one of the upper class casinos. my gf got the ahi tuna sliders and they were a joke, not good and cost something like $15. also it has a very club like atmosphere, don't come here expecting a romantic dinner or anything, this is a bar scene more than a restaurant.\n\nstick with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and shakes here and you can't go wrong. stray out of those categories and you may be disappointed. overall this is one of my favorite spots in town, also because the cosmo rocks and the chandelier bar is right next door.",

            "how long does it take?\n\non a weekend trip to las vegas, we decided to stop by to get our fill of some burgers. we arrived around 1pm on a sunday afternoon and were told that a table of 3 would have a waiting period of approximately 30 minutes. they would take down our phone number, we would leave and actually get called back within 10 minutes. this is starting out to be a good experience, but.....\n\nour orders were taken fairly quickly and we were eager to begin our meal. after about 45 minutes of waiting, we started to get restless. not only were we starving, but we had not heard from our waitress. we flagged her down and inquired about our order. when she returned, she said she wasn't sure why it was taking so long, so she offered us some cheese popcorn. \n\nwe inhaled the 1st round of popcorn and a 2nd round was offered since our food was still being prepared. our hunger for food continued to mount and with still no food in sight, our waitress offered to give us some steak fries. again, another 2 rounds of fries came out and after an hour of waiting for our food, we finally received our order. \n\n<mark>Ahi Sliders</mark>, korean \"bull\" gogi and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> were ordered. the <mark>Ahi Sliders</mark> were served between 2 buns that appeared to have been chilled. i don't know about most, but cold bread to me is not edible. both the korean \"bull\" gogi and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burgers were overly charred on the outside to the point that they had this burnt taste to them (both were ordered to be cooked medium). this was quite disappointing and most of the meal was not even finished. \n\nafter our meal, the waitress comes over and asks why we didn't finish the <mark>Ahi Sliders</mark> because she notices that most people don't. i am thinking really?!? we told her the buns were a bit cold and it didn't go well with the ahi. she went on and asked how did we enjoy <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and we told her about the burnt taste. she said that's what holstein's prides itself in cooking their burgers and that some customers like the charred taste on their burgers. i don't know where these customers reside from, but they should understand that burnt/charred food is unhealthy. i do give her credit as she did whatever she could to keep our spirits up throughout the meal and tried to keep our dining experience a positive one, but....\n\nwhen we were settling the bill, we wanted to use our groupon to be applied to the bill. this was a headache as the fries from earlier that were supposed to have been comped by our waitress were included on the bill. trying to apply the groupon just confused the manager/waitress even more. overall, the dining experience did not live up to our expectations. i'd rather roll over to burger bar next time.", 
            "the cosmopolitan features fancy, expensive places: nightclub can set you back $50 for certain events, wicked spoon is nearly $40, stk will set you back at least $50 for a hearty meal, the clothing is expensive, etc.\n\nmake no mistake, the shakes, burgers, cocktails, and beer is overpriced at this place but compared to other venues in the cosmopolitan, holsteins is a great value. i ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and that was a dam good burger. \n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> also got rave reviews from my friends along with the shakes. the ambiance of the place feels like i'm in some cartoon network-like place, which is pretty cool, i feel. \n\nif you're eating at the cosmopolitan, chances are you're going to spend a lot of money. if you're looking for the best value for your dollar in this hotel, make it holsteins.",

            "i came here on a sunday for lunch. the wait for our party of 5 was around 20 minutes which wasn't too bad considering there were shops nearby to visit in the meantime. our server was very accommodating and had all sorts of things to recommend. he brought out free popcorn for us as starters. it tasted very interesting, like spicy bbq...\n\ni got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger which was very delicious with the fried avocado inside! every burger also comes with a side of fries. i had ordered <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> but they gave me the regular skinny fries instead. i didn't mind because they were nice and crispy but once i let them know about the mistake, they brought out the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> immediately which was nice. i also ordered the frozen grasshopper which was one of their alcoholic milk shakes with peppermint and chocolate. it was also delicious and i could not taste the alcohol at all.\n\ntip: if you check-in on foursquare and show your server, they will give you a free pint of draft beer! (we got this and the beer was very smooth and did not taste cheap at all)\n\noverall it was a very nice experience. i loved the cute cartoony cow deco all around the restaurant. our server even made it a point to stop by and wish me a safe drive back to california when i was standing in line for the bathroom, which was not even close to our table. i thought that was a very nice gesture and topped off our visit very well.",

            "every time i try to come here, the wait is always ridiculous.  i never remember to make reservations either cause, well, it's a burger place!  finally, this past weekend around 2pm, after a somewhat \"short\" wait of 40 minutes, i got to try holsteins.\n\nit actually took the 4 of us awhile to look through the menu, and in the end, i went with the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, which is a burger with dry aged beef sirloin burger, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli.  i ordered it medium rare and came with a nice pink middle.  what really caught my attention about the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was the dry aged beef, since dry aging beef condenses the beef flavor, and wow that burger was juicy.  out of all 4 burgers, mine was the only one that had juices dripping down my fingers, even versus the kobe beef burgers!\n\nthe toppings were all great, especially the aged goat cheddar.  you can tell it's a little different than your normal cheddar.  the garlic-chive aioli has a mellow garlic taste.  besides hoping the bacon was a little bit crispier, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> is really a burger that's up there in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> world.  it's just a very tasty burger and i can see why it is so popular!\n\ni also tried a bit of <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, as well as the korean bull-gogi.  <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> is more of an asian fusion burger, with teriyaki glaze and a tempura avocado that sits on top of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  it also has a kobe beef patty, so the whole burger had this velvety smooth texture thanks to the fatty patty and the smooth creamy avocado!  i would like a bit more teriyaki sauce though.\n\nas for the korean bull-gogi burger, the patty is marinated to give it extra flavor.  the best part is definitely the <mark>Fried Egg</mark> that sits on top.  who can resist the egg yolk just running all over the kimchi slaw and the beef patty??\n\nout of all the fries, i liked the steak cut fries the most.  crunchy exterior with a creamy potato center.  <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were great as well.  the shoestring fries were a little stale to me.\n\nnow, with shakes as part of its name, we knew we had to try a few of their shakes and ended up getting the black cow float and the frozen grasshopper.  black cow float is a fun and somewhat nostalgic shake since it is more like a coke flat with the ice cream rather than a true shake.  it even comes with pop rocks!  the frozen grasshopper is a must for any mint chocolate fans.  smooth creamy minty frozen goodness.  for both shakes, we could taste the alcohol but it was pretty well masked!\n\nthey also have a bunch of beers on draft.  <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> triple karmeliet is a good one!\n\nprice-wise, it is pricey.  our burgers were around $18, with shakes at $11.  the price should reflect great service but i found the service a bit lacking.  our waitress only came to check on us twice and it took awhile to get her attention for the check as well.\n\nafter our meal, i can see why so many people like <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> at holsteins.  can't wait till the next time to try our other burgers!", 
            "yummy! came here on a sunday afternoon before driving back to the oc and waited for half an hour - which is definitely a loooong time when you're hung over! we ordered the lobster mac and cheese, <mark>Ahi Sliders</mark>, and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> side up egg. everything was delicious!!!!\n\nif we weren't hung over, we would have tried the shakes with alcohol in them. next time...", 
            "holsteins was on my list during my last trip to vegas and we didn't end up going, so this was at the top of my list this time around. we had a party of 8 during friday night at around 10 p.m., and ended up splitting into two tables of 4 because it was packed. the two musts here are their burgers and shakes. the bf and i split <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger, which was really good. i also had a bite of <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> which was great as well (think burger with an asian twist). their patty is really juicy and most importantly, cooked to a perfect medium rare. since we were sharing <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, we decided to get the truffled mac n cheese with lobster, which was piping hot and delicious. i wasn't sure about the lone potato chip on the side though.\n\nwe ordered a couple of milkshakes: brown cow float, oreo, <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>, and <mark>Campfire Smores</mark>. my favorite was the oreo. the brown cow had chocolate pop rocks which made it very unique. it's pricey at ~$11 but they do give you a cup and a half, which makes it feel like a little better deal. \n\nholsteins ranks right under father's office in la in my book.", 
            "this place is basically a burger club inside the cosmo, and i convinced my friends to stop by here after a recommendation from monica c. i think i didn't enjoy it as much because i was pretty full from my fat tuesday, but it was a pretty cool experience. the ambiance is great, although it is pretty loud inside. \n\nthe wait was about 20 minutes on a friday night. i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, which was a teriyaki burger with avocado and i think fried onions. it was pretty good, but i didn't get a \"burgasm.\" i liked the shoestring fries. i only ate about half <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, which was reasonably sized but still not worth 20 bucks. shakes are around $13 but looked pretty good. for the most expensive burger i have ever had in my life, i don't think it was worth it but for some people i guess its a value deal in vegas!", 
            "**** 4.5 stars ****\n\none of the great miracles of las vegas is that you can eat like a fatty fat fat all day every day and still go to pools surrounded by gorgeous plastic-pumped women and sing nonsense like \"sexy and i know it\", regardless of any absence of truth to that assertion. holsteins provides the perfect venue for stuffing your face on delicious patties of top quality beef while also getting an eye full of the local ladies. unbeknownst to me at the time, the same chef is behind this as public house, where i had dined the night before, and his love of squeezing his employees into clothing that might be mistaken for a table cloth was much more prominent here than there. the d\\u00e9cor here is also just dope. i love the slightly sick toons on the walls, and there are homage to pigs and cows all around. if you look at most of the complaints here it's from people who didn't actually order a burger, so i suggest you take those reviews for what they are, and don't make the same mistake.\n\nbut, since it's vegas, you will still stuff your face to the maximum in front of this beautiful bevy, knowing that you're helping to pay for their salary so that they can go to the pool tomorrow and pretend guys like you don't exist (until you buy them a pitcher of margaritas, then you're superstar hero of the next couple minutes, congrats). brian and i both took the luxury route on the menu here, although i passed on the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> with kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo, because i've already had half a dozen burgers like this across america and they all taste roughly the same...rich and oily. it was honestly more difficult passing up <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, a truly unique combination of kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado...super intriguing, and if i had been dining with someone i was dating i likely would have tried to persuade them in that direction. somehow i managed to also resist ordering a decadent milkshake, perhaps because we were eating dinner just 4 hours after we had managed to roll out of bed for lunch.\n\ni finally wound up deciding on the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, a dry aged beef sirloin patty topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and a garlic-chive aioli...nothing too crazy, but lots of big, bold, wonderful flavors, and at $18 the most expensive burger not topped with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>. the result was pretty fantastic, definitely one of the better burgers i've had lately, and came with a monstrous basket of nicely done <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (for a supplemental charge). my biggest complaint, which is kind of random, is that they skewer <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with their own stupid little logo stick to keep the bun on for presentation, which has the resulting effect of causing huge gobs of mayo or sauce to squirt from the hole in the top every time you take a bite. eating these burgers is a mess, to be sure, especially when you add on a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> as i do, but if you're like me you've already realized you're not taking one of the voluptuous vixens home (although my reason is probably different than yours) so you've resigned your face to more indulgent pleasures, like egg yolk, garlic aioli, and hamburger grease.\n\njust make sure to thoroughly wash your beard, or your own lady might catch on...and get jealous.", 
            "this place is now my must-go place for burgers. it's very reasonably priced for a delicious burger. very comfortable booths with cute cartoon cows all around the restaurant. \n\ni love love love their shoestring fries! they're so fresh and crispy, slightly salted, not too oily! okay, i might be a bit biased, since i'm not a fan of wedge fries, but seriously, try the shoestring fries once, please!\n\nso far i've tried their <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (kobe beef with tangy teriyaki sauce) and their big fat greek (lamb with feta). i was extremely happy with every bite of <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. i was too full to finish <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> in one sitting. but i think that's just because i stuffed my stomach with like 2 long islands and a beer. very juicy patty, i asked for medium rare, it came out medium rare. sauce was a bit overwhelming. their sauce is very strong in taste, i guess i should have ordered it light on the sauce. but hey, that was my first time. big fat greek wasn't too impressive, i should have stayed with the beef patties. it's not too gamey, so if lamb is not your thing because of that aroma, maybe give this one a try, it's not as strong (which is why i didn't like it as much, i love that aroma). it may not look like a giant burger, but all that feta cheese and yummy meat and other stuff inside kept me very full. i was so close in not finishing my plate again.\n\nif you check in here on foursquare, you can get a free house beer or house margarita. i prefer their beer. it's not the best, but their hef is tolerable. i tried their house margarita, and all i tasted was syrup. i can't complain too much, it was free. my server offered a to-go cup for my beer when i had half a burger and 3/4 pint of beer left. so nice of her :) only in vegas where you can take your beer to go.", 
            "so i was trying to be productive tonight, but yet again technology is here to foil my plans. \n\ni was staying at the cosmopolitan with some friends and we were hungry after lazing by the pool. yelp pointed us to this scrumptious looking restaurant and once again, it did not disappoint. \n\nwe made reservations on opentable, but they were not needed since it was not busy. after looking at the menu, we went with <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, which seem to be their best burgers according to yelp reviews. the yelp reviews also talk about how their milkshakes are excellent, and everyone who was eating seemed to have one of these huge milkshakes. one look at my lactard body started to rebel, so i managed to sum up some willpower and abstain from enjoying one. \n\nsoon after ordering, our appetizers were delicious and made me pretty excited for the rest of our meal. delicious ahi tuna, rich and creamy lobster macaroni and cheese...i could have stopped there and been happy with my meal. \n\nour burgers came and although both were pretty good, i liked the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> better than <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> is covered in this sweet glaze that was okay, but i was really looking for something savory. i'm sure if we didn't have all of the other food, i would have eaten that burger without complaint. \n\nanother plus is that we asked for our burgers medium-rare and they came medium-rare. scrumptious! \n\na third plus is that the table next to us heard me griping to the heavens about paying for wi-fi, so they generously gave me their super secret password to get on. yay!\n\na fourth plus was that kevin hart was eating at the same time as us, and our server encouraged us to go say hi and take a picture. i had a sudden bout of awkwardness, which tends to happen when i become uncertain. so, i froze awkwardly, stalked around his table like some crazy person, then lost my nerve and fled the scene. \n\nlet's work on that self-confidence, shall we?", 
            "great burgers, some of the best i've ever had with interesting combinations (i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> this time, and had a bite of my friend's <mark>Gold Standard</mark>).  the steak fries were perfect; fluffy inside and crunchy outside.  great beer selection as well.\n\nthe value wasn't shabby for vegas, where everything is overpriced.  the bill after tip for burgers and a round of beers was about $27 per person.", 
            "actually been a bit almost two months since i went, so i'm going off memory here. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was great, the fries were good and the service was friendly. we went at lunch time and it was very busy. food took a bit longer than i would have liked to come out. i ordered \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" after the server recommended it as one of his favorites. our server was very cool and funny, but was very close to becoming annoying at times. a bit pricey at $17 bucks, but they are on the strip and inside the cosmopolitan. all in all, good experience and i will head back sometime for another go.\n\ntried a spoon of a shake from friend that ordered. it was good, but i'm not much of milkshake fan so it didn't do anything for me.", 
            "this swanky burger joint is located right across the nightclub marquee's entrance inside the cosmopolitan hotel. from the artwork on the wall that reminds me of oldskool 90's taggers to the loud hip music blaring through the speakers, holstein 's is hard to miss. we made it there around 7:30pm on a saturday night and the wait was no more than 20 minutes for our party of four. when your pager starts buzzing and you report to the host at the door, you're ushered to the next host in the middle of place, which that person will walk you over to your table. the place is vibrant, loud, and hip. just like in a nyc subway train, you have everything from skirts to suits to shorts & flip flops occupying this restaurant.\n \nmany items on the menu sound appealing including their numerous $11 alcoholic shakes. we ordered the frozen grasshopper: peppermint, chocolate, cr\\u00e8me de menthe, van gogh chocolate vodka. if you love them little minty & crunchy chocolate balls, then this shake is right up your alley. there's plenty of it, a bit overwhelming actually but some people like it that way. that distinct alcohol taste is barely noticed. we also got the oreo with bailey's irish cream. this is what i considered a \"safe\" shake to order. if you enjoy oreos (who doesn't?) then this is a solid route to go. again, the taste of alcohol isn't really prevalent. warning, if you have issues with dairy then you may want to stay away from the shakes here. i really don't but it did activate.... uhh nevermind.\n \nseems like <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> $17 is quite popular from many of the reviews and sure enough someone on our table ordered it. kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake not to be mistaken by bukake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado. seriously, what is there not to like about that set up? if it was truly an asian inspired burger, then a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> would finish the job. you can add it though for a buck more. i was a little sad that i didn't order this burger for myself but my buddy was kind enough to give me a slice of heaven.\n \ni ended up with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> $17.5: beef patty crusted with black pepper, holstein's creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>, swiss cheese. oh you fancy huh? because it sure did sound fancy. although <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was good, my mind was set on <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> as the unanimous winner this night. the pepper was probably what i remember most about this burger. i did finish it but i most likely wouldn't care to order it again.\n \nthe maine lobster roll $16.5: fresh cooked lobster tossed in chive aioli in a grilled mini hot dog bun with cole slaw. the price is steep, the portion is crazy bite sized, but the taste landed a mike tyson uppercut. why oh why do you tease us like that holstein 's? gimme more!\n \nthe steak cut fries and the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were decent but can be better.\n \noverall, holstein 's should be visited at least once and from there you can determine if you want to be a regular. the meal was quite enjoyable but i'm not sure if it left an uber lasting effect on my appetite glands. i can probably live with or without it. for sure, give it a shot. on fridays, saturdays, and mondays, they are opened beyond their normal hours, midnight to 2am. however, their full menu isn't available but rather a separate and shorter late night menu. check out the art work on the walls, i want one for my place!", 
            "this place is good! hands down. i had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, which was kobe beef topped with teriyaki sauce and avocado. they fumbled my order and i had to wait about 45 minutes total (i was by myself). the bartender apologized though and offered to comp my beer. overall this is an awesome place and i would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves a good burger.", 
            "first thing to remember about holstein's is their menu is reflected by the time of day (a very important tip to avoid frustration). i went late night and expected a full menu, but was told instead it was their late night menu so that was a nice segway to drink and have \"finger food\" as i called it. that would've been nice to know over the phone prior to making the trek over there.\n\ni decided to drain my frustrations in a spicy bloody mary and i'll be damned if it wasn't as advertised. clamato with jock itch is more like it, but either way it did tickle the taste buds quite well and i hate spicy! we also had ordered the lobster mac n cheese (2 by accident) and it was hit or miss. the first one was beyond salty and the 2nd one was spot on and the bread crumb crust was a delight down the pipes! we also did try <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> n turf quesadilla which was small, but delectable!\n\ndisappointed with things we decided to go the day after for lunch. as a \"preflight\" meal, they gave us salt and vinegar popcorn which i wolfed down! i really thought to myself gross, but upon chomping away all i could say was yes yes yes! i felt rockafeller so i dove into the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> and that was by far the best burger i have ever had. i ordered it medium rare after watching the food channel and from bun to bun the taste was nothing but fun! it was juicy, the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and truffle mayo was a true jackpot! \n\nto top it off you must must get an alcoholic milkshake as well to wash down the meal. i had the campfire smore and it's one of the many things in life that make you go hmm. if you don't make this a stop on your vegas outing you forever will be square and not there!", 
            "came here in dec of 2011 and was ready to give it a 3 star rating since i didn't feel like anything stood out. thanks to a groupon offer and upcoming vegas visit, we tried it again and it was a better experience. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> is an excellent selection and the fries were extra crispy this time. i ordered the pork belly buns last time and had better elsewhere. prob why i didn't rate them as high. trying something new on the menu definitely made a difference this time. i'd eat there again if i found myself in the cosmo.", 
            "i went with 4 of my friends so luckily i had the opportunity of trying a lot of different things at once.  (i highly recommend doing this, especially at a place like holsteins where their menus are endless) \n\nfor milkshakes, we were able to try the basic strawberry and the alcohol infused grasshopper.  i would definitely recommend trying at least one of the specialty alcohol milkshake.  the grasshopper was definitely a hit among my friends.  unfortunately for those who love tasting the danger in drinks, the alcohol amount is very light and you'll enjoy the unique mixture of sweet tastes rather than the intoxication.  \n\nlike how the past reviewers mentioned, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are a bit on the expensive side.  each burger meal does come with a pint size-like bucket of fries but it's not worth puffing your stomach if you're planning to squeeze into a dress 2 hours later.   i ordered the crispy pork belly bun under their \"tiny buns\" section.  loved it.  go for any appetizer items for your meal.  the size was more than enough.  my friends were eyeing my meal the most and i was the only one without a burger.  \n\nwith burgers, the \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" is a must.  kobe beef drizzled with nori furikake and crispy yam in between? yeah you want that.", 
            "who would have thought i could really crave for a burger? i had been wanting to try this new burger place in the cosmopolitan for some time. i didn't get a chance to the weekend before but this past week, i did. after marquee day club, my friends and i headed over and waited about 25 minutes. when we got seated the server quickly came and took our order for drinks. for all you light weight alcoholic girls, this is the place to drink. the milkshakes are alcoholic but only contains 1 oz of alcohol. for many, that's way too less. but for me, give me my peaches n' creme! i'll be trying all the flavors, don't you worry. tasted no alcohol at all. but i love the fact of knowing i'm drinking in vegas, still. :) \n\ni got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger. it was a huge patty with some tempura pieces and avocado. avocado always makes <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> better. they gave options for shoestring fries or steak cut fries. uhh.. shoestrings fries of course. i absolutely love shoestrings fries of all fries. on top of that, i also ordered the holsteins cobb salad. i have to make sure to keep my food light if i'm going to all these pool parties, you know. i like the cobb. i'm not sure why people don't think it's worth it. i did note that the avocado slices were not ripe. \n\nwe had decent service. could have been better because they don't come around and check up on you much. we actually waved down our waitress a couple times. but, it was a busy afternoon. the food was good and convenient being right across from marquee on the 2nd floor. it's pricey but gourmet burgers are always double digits so it was expected.", 
            "we were so looking forward to holsteins for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> fix we had been delaying for weeks before our visit to vegas. so when we arrived at cosmo, we headed up to holsteins on the 2nd floor on a sunday evening and walked to the hostess desk at check in. \n\nfrom the get go i already had a predetermination that we weren't going to get the friendliest girls to check in with. i figure, put your tasks aside, and greet your f'in customer. at least acknowledge them immediately. ok, so maybe it was that bad- she took my name, gave me the pager, and told me it will be just a few with a semi-courteous attitude. so we walked around out front a bit, i went over to the bar across the way and picked up a brew, went back to have a seat outside the restaurant. then i noticed my pager was chirping. this wasn't the typical light up and vibrate situation we're all used to when they are paging us to check in. this was an intermittent chirp, no lights, as if it was possibly telling me the battery was running low. i don't know! so i got up, stopped inside to inquire about, or let the hostess know (she was the same one who helped me just like seven minutes prior) the pager, and she acted like if i was freshly coming in for the first time. (mind you i had the pager held up to the hostess desk... and my beer in my other hand) the first words out of her mouth, so directly were, \"i'm sorry! no outside drinks in here\". that tripped me out and i told her about the pager chirping... \"well, it will light up when it's ready\". i was like, ya i knew that i decided she can go f herself, i'll just wait a bit more. \n\nso ok. we were paged, checked in, asked to meet the hostess down in the middle... she was a little more personable. so we sat, and sat... well it was longer than it should have been. got our popcorn :d, my beer, her coke, waitress was pretty nice... told me <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger i just placed my order for was the house favorite (thanks yelp!). it wasn't until she checked in on us, and at which i inquired about the plate i ordered when she got all defensive. i'm sorry, but i just couldn't recall if my burger had a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> on it or not. thanks to all the photos on yelp! excuse me if i got confused. she proceeded to say things like, \"well did you order one?\", \"did you want one?\" as i explained this to her, she just kind of gave me the stink eye and walked away. that is why you didn't receive a tip missy. sorry if that ruined your day.\n\nbut with that said, the hostesses walking around acting like they were directing air traffic with their little radios and smug looks on their face... holsteins, food maybe be packed full of flavor, possibly a little under portioned, you need to give your staff a lesson in attitude... \n\nwhen we visit vegas, we drop money, lots of it. i don't care if your trendy or haute... service is what bring the clients back.", 
            "very good burger....\n\ni have eaten burgers here on three different occasions.  it is convenient since i often stay at the cosmo while in vegas.\n\nmy first two times i was here, i was not impressed by their burgers.  this 3rd time, i ordered again their <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger (kobe beef, teriyaki sauce, yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado).  the combination of different flavors worked really well together and this burger is definitely a hit with me.  the bun, a standard burger bun, was a bit stiffer than i prefer but the overall goodness of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> makes me overlook this minor shortcoming.  i strongly recommend trying this burger.\n\nthe fries were ordinary and need salt, imo.\n\nholsteins offers a good range of exotic beers which i always like to taste-test when i am out.  perhaps about 15 beers on tap of non-standard-fare beers.\n\nget a burger here and have <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>!",

            "admittedly, i would have given this place four stars due to the sheer exorbitant prices if it weren't for the amazing, if not the best, burgers i have had in my 26 years of life. and believe me, i've had my fair share of burgers. okay - enough about the rave and onto the food:  i must start with the free starter popcorn, which was perfectly salted and just the right amount of butter so good that i had to ask for second!\n\nfor appetizer, we ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and turf quesadillas, which has a combination of broiled steak and lobster that complements surprisingly well topped off with manchego cheese to give it a rich texture to go along with avocado cream that leaves a rather refreshing after taste\n\nfor main course, i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger (a must have based on other yelpers' validations) and the steak fries as a side. the juicy kobe beef spread with the teriyaki glaze just burst with flavor, but not too salty as it is matched with a slightly sweet addition from the cripsy yam. at the same time, the spicy mayo and tempura avocada adds a tantalizing kick to the already delicious burger all on its own. i also added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> which just kicks it up another notch. the steak fries that came with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> just left me speechless as i could not even taste the grease but had so much crisp and flavor that left me licking the seasoning off of my thumbs \n\nall in all, what more can you ask for than a perfect burger and a beer in a chilling afternoon at vegas? i would have liked to try truffle lobster mac n cheese but there just was not enough stomach to fit it all or time on the agenda to come back for round 2. definitely a 5 star unforgettable experience - super winning!", 
            "i hate to compare any burger i've ever eaten in my life to my all time favorite umami burger, but given the price you pay at holsteins i figured it'd at least come close to it. unfortunately, my first experience here was quite disappointing. i yelped holstein's shakes and buns & decided to give it a try after seeing it was given 4 stars. \n\nwe came here on <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> of halloween weekend & were glad that the wait wasn't that long. our waitress kindly informed us about their \"special\" shakes (which i thought was unique to their establishment). i ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, which our waitress said they were most famous for. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> looked really good, but as i bit into <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, i quickly realized that the patty was very bland. they had cooked it the way i wanted, but there was just no flavor whatsoever in the patty. my appetite disappeared soon after as i found it hard to even eat the <mark>French Fries</mark>. our waitress seemed to have disappeared for a while as well. \n\nperhaps my taste buds were off that day from all the drinking the two nights before, but my meal just wasn't appetizing to me. based on my first try here at holsteins, i don't believe that they deserve the 4 stars. i am, however willing to give them another try & order something that would better appeal to my taste. i'm hoping after that, i could also consider this fine establishment a 4 star restaurant.", 
            "one of the best burgers i've ever tried.  first of all, this restaurant is usually packed, so prepare for a wait.  second, the decor is adorable!  the cartoon cow graces their windows and in the wall paintings, which creates a fun and relaxed environment.  they have interesting gourmet burgers and sliders and spiked milkshakes!  \n\nmy favorite was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger - kobe beef with tempura avocado, teriyaki glaze, and sprinkles of furikake.  so many different flavors and textures that worked together.  i also tried <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark>, with portabello mushrooms, aioli, and truffle oil, but it was too much goodness in one that it was overwhelming.  the flavors were too similar and heavy, especially the two thick pieces of gruyere cheese.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> come with a side of either skinny or steak fries.  i recommend the steak fries because their skinny fries are too crispy and almost chip-like.  \n\ndon't forget to try their shakes and malts!  i wanted to try their spiked shakes, but got grossed out thinking about alcohol from the night before, so i got a simple vanilla malt, which was thick, creamy and fatty.  yum!", 
            "nice high end burger joint at the cosmopolitan right across from the marquee club.\n\ni came with a my vegas local friend to grab a bite before watching our show zarkana and decided to eat here since it wasn't too far from the aria. like all the other restaurants in the cosmopolitan are trendy just like the hotel, the music was loud and the decor around the restaurant was fun to look at especially the holstein's bull right across from the bar. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Captain Hook</mark> that had raw and grilled salmon all on one burger and i thought was very unique and my friend ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger that included kobe beef and tempura avocado. we both shared each others burgers to get a taste and we loved it but it was pricey just like everything  else inside the cosmopolitan but who cares if you just want to relax with friends and family and have a great time. our meals included strong fries and for the appetizer we got the lobster quesadilla and complimentary popcorn.  service here was excellent and i'll definitely be back to try other burgers on the menu.", 
            "yup.  all that and a shake.  best meal i have had in vegas for the last few trips.  i had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and in my normal fashion wanted to opt out of an ingredient and was recommended not to as the tastes were meant to be together.  i could not agree more - the best, most unique, tastiest burger ever.  fries were great, <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> tasty and drinks divine.  i'm super glad i went and you will be too.", 
            "came here before heading home and had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger!  these were the best burgers i've ever had.  well worth the price and experience!  quality burgers.",

            "super close to a 5 for me, but just a few things knocked it down to a 4.5.\n\nfood: definitely had a great time eating some crazy good food :]\n- popcorn: omg our group devoured these. salt and vinegar popcorn was amazing. thank god the first tin was free.\n- bamboozeled shakes: shakes with booze in them :]. i don't remember the names of them, but i really enjoyed the one with the cereal in it. sweet, creamy, and still had the alcohol taste to it.\n- burgers, omg super good. my friends nomed on the el machete (they suggest you add an egg in it too!). it has a good kick to it. i had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, and the avocado tempura was the part that simply made it spectacular. shredded fried yam and teriyaki sauce were a great touch to make it look super lovely.\n- fries: nooooo this was a major downfall. were pretty bland and tasteless. wish they had more seasoning or something to it!\n\nservice: our table liked our waitress. one guy at our table was pretty much \"well she's for sure getting a 20% tip at least\". she was super friendly, threw in some cool jokes, got us some more free popcorn, helped us take a picture, and all with a genuine smile. definitely the made the night a whole lot better. she was a bit busy, but she came by exactly when we needed it.\n\natmosphere: this place has a strange, but great mix of cuteness and casualness. the cartoonish artwork creates a light and whimsical setting, but the lighting and decor definitely bump this place towards a lounge sort of feel. our group enjoyed it and it fit perfectly into the vegas atmosphere.\n\nprice: i'm not complaining to be honest, since i feel like i got what i paid for. though numerically i spent around $30-$40 (for a shake, and burger) it seemed well worth it to me.\n\noverall opinion: there were a few things that just dropped this place from a 5. lack of solid fries, a tinnnnnny bit pricey on the shakes, and just that ounce of \"this thing is something everyone should try\" was missing.\nhowever despite that, this place clearly has a great variety on their menu, solid use of organic and high grade ingredients, and a unique atmosphere for the hip and casual crowds. i'm excited to come back here to try another shake and burger!", 
            "on my most recent vegas getaway of sorts, i ate the whole time.  this conclusion didn't arise until a particularly high volume of repeated similar questions.  that strong indicator surmised each time a \"how was vegas?\" came up.   \n\none of my favorite landing spots was holsteins.  who doesn't like a good burger?  a vegetarian may raise their hand.  even then, these burgers may sway the opinion of the strongest vegetarian for one meal.  \n\nwe moseyed on in around 2:30 in the afternoon for a late lunch.  \n\nopening up the menu, besides the fascinating selection of shakes were the prices.  expect price ranges to reach double digits.  i was really tuned into <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> so i got that.  our waiter persuaded bun into ordering their award winning burger.  i'm sure the fact the waiter was good looking had nothing to do with her decision either.  i just want to throw that out there for giggles.\n  \ngenerally, i dislike teriyaki sauce.  <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> i ordered really shed a new light on my view of it.  glazed with a teriyaki sauce, it meshed amazingly with the spicy mayo.  \"kobe beef\", honestly labeled or not, was cooked medium on request.  biting down to notice a dash of furikake was probably the biggest glowing surprise.  lastly, the best part of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was certainly the tempura avocado.  not only adding a different layer of texture, it added a good combined taste.  come on.  who doesn't like tempura?  \n\nadd all that up produces an ultra surreal burger experience.  \n\nas a side note since note, bun's <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was a big thumbs up.  in her case, you could say little thumbs up.  speechless through the first few bites, she almost finished <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  i'll have to try it next time.  knowing me, i'd end up getting <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> again since it was so good.\n \nbright graphics on the wall are very energetic and lively.  service was cordial.  it conveyed a vibe of a high class hooter's.  that is with 10,000% better food, minus the hooter's girls of course.  \n\nnow, you may be wondering.  where can you find this joint?  it's right in the cosmopolitan.  find it yet?  enjoy their solidly made burger and thank me when your're done.", 
            "the food was pretty amazing we went back 2 more times. the fungi was amazing, same with <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> i can't decide which ones better.  the ahi poke was phenomenal.  yummmmm\ndon't sit at the bar the bar tenders are so cranky\nmac and cheese was so delicious", 
            "o-v-e-r-r-a-t-e-d. \n\ni don't really understand how this place is supposed to have the best burgers in all of vegas. vegas must really lack good burgers.\n\nthe ambiance is kind of weird - resembling a lounge/club in the front bar area and almost like an applebee's in the back dining room. well, an applebee's with japanese style cartoon cows on the walls. \n\nburgers here are really just mediocre at best. my veggie burger was mushy and didn't taste of the \"12 veggies\" the server proclaimed went into the patty at all! i have had a handful of great veggie burgers elsewhere, sometimes at a fraction of the price. their veggie patty really tasted no different from a garden burger (you know, the frozen kind). \n\nokay, i'm sure you're laughing now about how i'm whining about the quality of a burger joint when i had the nerve to order a freaking veggie burger. well, the oh-so popular \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" burger the bf ordered wasn't too impressive either. not only was the patty cooked to an almost well done when he specifically asked for medium rare, but the plethora of sweet japanese bbq sauce and various toppings totally overwhelmed the meat and was excessively salty, even for him! the one thing i did really enjoy was the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> i ordered with my veggie burger, but i have rarely met a sweet potato fry that i didn't like.\n\nthe concept of holstein's is pretty cool i guess, definitely fun and laid-back. however, they need to deliver on the execution. i would much rather save my calories for another restaurant, or just a few beers.", 
            "ok no joke, this probably the best burger spot on the strip.\n\nlocated inside the cosmo, holstein serves some some burgers unlike anywhere else. to start off, the place looks awesome, i sure they spent alot of money here (as they did on everything in the cosmo) and it shows. there is plenty of street art, anime style graphics, along that old-world leather feel in the dining area. its definitely falls into the stylish chic category. plus that giant cow by the entrance looks cool! \n\nnow for the food, its awesome. everyone tries out the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and for good reason - cheddar, arugula, garlic chive aoili all make for a awesome burger. my personal fave:  is <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> - juicy, perfectly cooked kobe beef burger with crispy yam, teriyaki glaze and spicy mayo, and tempura avocado!.\n\nthe shakes are delicious (they do have alcohol in em) with the best one being <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>. all of the bamboozled shakes have alcohol but you can get virgin as well. try one out, they are delicious!\n\nbut be warned ahead of time, its not cheap, nor quiet. for a burger, fries and shake you are easily going come out spending $30+. come in on a monday or weekend and the place be packed and loud from everyone trying to get inside of marquee.", 
            "i came here with some friends, the menu and yelp reviews looked promising. 4-square has a pretty nice free draft beer check-in. they served a really light beer, i really enjoyed it, it was refreshing, luckily i had this to wash down my burger.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>. i like how <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was well-intact when i cut it and half and ate it. cleaniness makes a world of difference. i ordered <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> medium, and it looked pink and medium (while my friend also ordered medium, but her's looked more well done), but it was extremely dry. it was too dry to taste the quality of the patty. perhaps, it was because the patty was aged, so the flavors were more definitive, but i wonder that's why it made the patty way too dry. don't get me wrong, the flavors of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were bold and tasted pretty good. it came well together, and the goat cheese cheddar stood out in a good way. pretty delicious burger, except for the fact the patty was really dry and it's overpriced.\n\nthe fries were cold and also tasted old.\n\ni did however try my friend's <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, that tasted good. the flavors were once again bold, and it had a pretty unique taste that stands out. i liked that one more.\n\ncomparing this burger with like a father's office or umami (i do not like umami), it tastes about the same (although i like father's office the best), quality and unique taste-wise, they're all about equilavent, except those other burgers costs $13-14, while here it costs $17. not sure if it's worth it. at least it made me not feel as bad paying $13-14 for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> at the other places now.\n\n\noverall, i'd give this place 3.5 stars, rounded down.",

            "what's not to like about great burgers and even better shakes (especially when you can get them with alcohol in them). holsteins is located in the cosmopolitan hotel and just like the hotel has quite the vibe to it. there is open seating in the bar area but if you get there early enough you can get a seat in the dining area. \n\ntypically when i have friends in town, we seem to end up at holsteins (either because they want to try it or they are staying at the cosmopolitan hotel). either way, it's a great way to enjoy some pretty good burgers (but be prepared to spend a bit of money as the prices are definitely not that inexpensive).\n\nthere is definitely a large selection of alcoholic beverages that you can choose from, but i definitely recommend the adult shakes that they have. between my friends and i we tried the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>, oreo, and cereal bowl (tastes just like captain crunch). for burgers, we've tried quite a few of the different burgers - <mark>The Classic</mark>, the longhorn (with beef brisket as well), <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (asian flavors with teriyaki sauce), <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> (with assorted mushrooms), the el machete (with an anaheim chili - sounds spicy, but it really is not, it's good, but it could use some more spice), and of course, the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> (kobe beef patty with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>). the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> is what a lot of people like to try (especially those from california that can't get their <mark>Foie Gras</mark> anymore. you can also add a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to your burger (which i recommend) - just to make it even more tasty with another layer of flavor.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> also come with either shoestring or steak cut fries. i have ordered a side salad (to try and be a little healthier - although not by much since we were indulging in a burger), and was disappointed that they charged $2 extra dollars for <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> of a side salad over the fries (and it wasn't even a large salad). i guess next time i'll just indulge in the fries.\n\noverall, a great place to hang out with your friends, get some good burgers and have a lot of drinks. i'd definitely recommend enjoying the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> at least once.",

(i would bet that the other choices on the menu are just as good!)  i asked for mine as rare as they could make it and they did that to perfection. \nwe didn't have room for dessert, so we ordered it anyway!  the 'cow pie', recommended by our server, was actually a small chocolate cake sitting on marshmallow and a crisp graham cracker, sort of like a super-s'more.  easily shared by two people, it satisfied the chocolate craving i had, at least for that day!\non top of the good food, the service was friendly and helpful, the bar is cool and you are surrounded by the beautiful cosmopolitan hotel, so what's not to like?  \ntip: if you are parking in the garage take the east side garage elevator to the top and you are right there!",

            "hands down the best burger place i have been to. the quality of the meats is very good, and the serving size will leave you completely full and going home with a doggy bag. i've tried half <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> on the list, and they have all been great, although the million dollar burger was the least impressionable and totally not worth it. when in doubt, keep it simple and get the nom nom or get the flavorful <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> with a side salad or the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. also, try the lobster mac and cheese! it comes with lobster chunks and sprinkled with bread crumbs. you're tongue an stomach will be please, and even as a midnight snack or leftovers, it will still taste good!", 
            "good burgers are easy enough to find. but great burgers are treasures that you sometimes have to look for. if you want a great burger in vegas, then look no further, because holsteins is it! \n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are made with the finest ingredients, are thick and juicy and are cooked to perfection. they're also a bit eclectic. while you can get a basic cheeseburger is you're a boring guy who has given up on life, i highly recommend that you try one of the more unique selections. my wife and i split a \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" and a \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" burger. both were excellent. the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were also amazing. they were giant and the breading was nothing short of spectacular. if you're looking for an adult (i.e. alcoholic) milkshake, try the \"<mark>The Fat Boy</mark>,\" which contains pretzels, chocolate/carmel popcorn, reese's, and vodka. it was'nt too strong, but it was delicious! \n\nthe only downside is that this place is expensive, but when you're eating at good restaurants in vegas, what place isn't expensive? i suppose the best way to spin it is that you get what you pay for. \n\nhighly recommended! two thumbs up (and some toes too... it's that good!).", 
            "on our recent visit to las vegas, we were looking for a substantial lunch that would hold us over through the afternoon, past a show, to a late night dinner.  our friends had recommended holsteins, and as fans of burger bar and other fancy shmancy burger joints, we were eager to try out the menu.  located on the second floor of the cosmopolitan, we arrived around 11:30 and were promptly seated at a nice corner table in the middle of the restaurant.  i started off with a spicy bloody mary, which was made with jalepeno and cilantro infused vodka, served with a big old shrimp on top.  spicy and delicious!  our waiter (who was very good) brought us a bag of complimentary popcorn as we perused the menu\n\nthis place is really known for their burgers, as they well should be, but don't ignore the appetizers!  we wanted to try so many of them, but we settled on the \"sausage and peppers\" potsickers and the mexican car bombs (jalapenos stuffed with cheese, corn, and black beans, then wrapped in bacon).  the potstickers were unique and delicious, but the car bombs... o.m.g.  sooooooo spicy, but so flavorful and delicious.  these things are no joke, they are very hot, so if you are a wimp when it comes to spice, these are not for you.  but we absolutely loved them.\n\nfor our main course, we decided to split a burger and another appetizer (i know i know, but we had to last 9 hours until our next meal!)  i had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and turf quesadilla, which contained steak, lobster, manchego cheese, and bacon lardons, served with an aioli sauce.  very yummy.  for our burger, we had such a hard time choosing, but we decided on the el machete, described on the menu as \"beef patty, fire roasted anaheim chili, borracho onions, pepperjack cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion & spicy 'machete' aioli\".  the beef was medium rare as requested, and was perfectly juicy and delicious.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> overall wasn't as spicy as i was expecting, but maybe my taste buds were burned out from my spicy bloody mary and the jalepeno pepper appetizer.  either way, it was good good beef.\n\nwe finished with a \"grown up\" milkshake... the campfire s'mores, which i only had a few sips of because i was so full, but those couple tastes were very good.  they will also make it to go for you if you'd like.  overall, we were thrilled with our lunch at holsteins and it may be our new favorite burger place in las vegas.  oh, and it definitely did the job of holding us over until dinner time.  we will definitely be back!", 
            "favorite burger joint on earth.  spiked milkshakes and burgers with top choice cuts of meat.\n\ni always come here at least once when in vegas.  try \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" just phenomenal.  the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> is really good but it is simply too much food with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  don't upgrade on the regular fries... they are the best option.  \n\ninside the cosmopolitan located across from the marquee.  stk is an awesome steak house inside cosmo check that out as well.", 
            "creative burger choices but overpriced. i got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. delicious - you got the sweet, spicy, creamy and crunchy flavors all in one burger but <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself was just not juicy enough. i love a juicy, messy burger. this one was on the dry side. and the fries? soggy. many were burnt. what a disappointment. you can't call yourself a great burger establishment if you can't do fries right. \n\nall in all, this place was good but not worth the price and did not live up to the hype.", 
            "first off, i absolutely give this place 5 stars! their burgers and shakes are awesome!!\n\nthis review goes to the next day, 02/10/14, ( yes we went two days in a row because it was that damn good!).  it was busier than the previous day, which is totally fine.  however, i am giving a couple of the waiters that \"helped\" us 1 star.  the hostess was awesome and sat us down right away.  after sitting there for ten minutes we were ready to order (i recommend <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>).  the waiter, this was around 5 pm, went to each table and assisted them.  our menus were down and closed which is an indication that we were ready.  he did not even introduce himself or asked us if we wanted drinks...nothing.  we waited another 5 minutes assuming that he was going to get back to us after getting drinks for the other table.  still nothing.  only until the 3rd time he came back to our section did he notice us.  we're not those high maintenance couples that need acknowledgement every single time, but he didn't apologize for the wait or even introduce himself.  he just asked if we were ready.  well, we're not in denny's, we're paying $18 per burger plus other things so i do want decent service.   we didn't order, but asked to move to the front of the restaurant (to get better service there).  of course, he said yes, but told us to grab our utensil and napkins....thanks guy for becoming even more of an ass.  i wish i knew his name, but like i said, he never introduced himself.\nmoving to the front was a good choice because the waitress in the front was very kind and got our orders right away.  also, the men in all black who bring out the food and drinks are very nice as well.  our waitress was getting off work and said that wendy will be taking over and that's when it went down hill again! she came over to introduce herself and told us that if we needed anything to ask her.  well, i asked for some refills and she looked shocked at what i asked.  maybe it was my imagination, who knows.  after about 20-30 minutes, we were about done eating.  she helped the new comers around us, but would always pass us.  we assumed that she was busy, so we let that go.  finally she came and asked if we wanted desserts, but after burgers and shakes, it was enough.  we declined and she walked away.  this is where it became highly irritating (along with the first waiter). we declined on the desserts and our plates/glasses were empty, so that's an indication that we were done.  it's pretty common sense that we didn't want more and we would like the check.  we were waiting for about another 20 minutes for nothing.  we saw her just standing there talking to her other coworkers.  i didn't know i had to raise my hand for help or go up to her for the check, which i didn't do.  like i said, we are in an establishment where we were paying close to $80-$100 for two people and i am not going to walk to the register to pay.  she finally came and asked if we wanted the check. (yeah, we wanted our check 20 min ago.) \n\ni love this place and awesome work to the other 2 waitresses who served us well.  the other two just need some improvements.", 
            "after driving 6  1/2 hours vs the usual less than 4 to vegas, we were too tired to drive to bachi, so we decided to try holsteins. besides h, another couple joined us for dinner. \n1. h had the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> (kobe with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>), disappointment. <mark>Foie Gras</mark> was wayyy overcooked and hard, we couldn't taste any of the port onion marmalade nor the truffle mayo that's supposed to be part of it. i will pay $15, not $32 for it.\n2. i had the big fat greek (lamb burger). it was very flavorful, but unfortunately very salty. the olive relish was almost as thick as <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, wtheck!\n3. male friend ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>(kobe with teriyaki glaze) was possibly the highlight of the meal. soo yummy, but i think they forgot the avocado that's suppose to come with it. :\\\n4. my 'will do anything for lobster' female friend possibly made the worst choice. maine lobster roll for $16.50. the two rolls were cold, and they were not rolls, at least not where i came from haha.those were two tiny slices of folded white sandwich bread with grill marks. two bites, that's all it took for finish her 'meal'. wtheck!\n\nour server adam never cracked a smile. i can't say the service was bad, but just very basic. i also didn't like the fact that he took our dessert menus away for the table next to us without asking first. i wasn't done yet! so we didn't order any. i would like to leave a 10% tip but given that we were with another couple (haha), i reluctantly added 15% :p\n\nwon't be back because it's not yummy.",

            "wow, i don't remember the last time i spent $40 for a burger and a shake. that's right, because i never did! granted this was vegas, but it wasn't like i was at a buffet or anything.\n\nthough i was stuffed, and probably in a better way than if i had gone to a buffet, i left wondering how i ended up spending $40 (tax+tip included) on a burger and a shake. oh yeah, it was an alcoholic shake. but why couldn't i taste the whiskey? seriously, i'm not that much of a heavy drinker, either. that $13 pumpkin pie shake, while heavenly delicious, did not have a single trace of alcohol in it.\n\nlike a studious yelper, i did my homework and listened to steph c.'s rec and opted for <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo & tempura avocado). i've never had fried avocado let alone on a burger! the crispy yam was also new for me, but man was that kobe beef patty delicious. medium rare perfection with that sweet and savory terikayi glaze. for those who don't know, nori furikake is a popular japanese condiment which is like seaweed seasoning. it usually has sesame seeds, dried/ground fish, sugar, salt, and you guessed it, msg. while i can't be sure holstein's furikake had msg, it definitely did not deter me from devouring that burger. it was not missing any flavor, and i couldn't be happier with the food in front of me. the fries were also delicious, but that burger was pretty unforgettable. it definitely doesn't come close to the best burger i've had, but props for making me want to return and try other menu items. next time, it might have to be the big fat greek (greek spiced lamb with feta cream, lettuce, tomato, red onion & olive relish, w/tatziki sauce) or the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> (kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, truffle mayo). what can i say, i love a good burger.",

            "love this place! we are local and eat here weekly if we can. the fungi burger and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are killer. the meat on that steakhouse is just unparalleled. these were my staples until i tried <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, which was the best burger i've had in my life. the oreo shake is good. they have really good <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. good for a kid-friendly place on the strip. good service. also, you never have to wait too long.\nif you're debating between burgr and holstein's, burgr has much longer waits, not as good service, and it's harder to get to (if you drive your car). <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are comparable with a little more refinement going to burgr. however, burgr has better fries (truffle) and shakes - omg burgr has good shakes, really more like dessert.\nif you want a quick bite or have kids, holstein's is your best bet.", 
            "i love this place! this is located near the marquee day club, so it's a perfect location to grab a bite to eat after an afternoon out in <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. and if you had a couple drinks already, it makes the food here just that much better.\n\ntheir burger was really really good. i devoured it just like that. we also got the bacon wrapped peppers, and some tacos (i forgot off the top of my head what it was exactly), but i remember it was really tender. super yummy! they also had popcorn for us too. how sweet is that? \n\ni will definitely come back again, and i'll update my review after.", 
            "i was skeptical in trying holsteins because of the mixed reviews, but after eating at gordon ramsay's burgr so much, i wanted a different burger place. originally we came here around midnight fri to try the place, but were told they stopped serving their regular menu at 11pm. they offered a late night menu instead which were basically just appetizers (no burgers/shakes). no biggie, we came back the next day after a fabulous time at marquee's dayclub...spoiler alert: we also came back the next day before we left on the drive back home because it was sooo good!!\n\nthe decor is so cute here w/ the anime pig wall posters and the theme totally matched w/ the cosmopolitan. our server made great recommendations for us & started us off w/ the complimentary small bucket of lightly salt/sweet popcorn. my bf killed that thing, talk about drunk munchies\n\nbamboozled shakes:\n<mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> - i added toasted coconut marshmallow to it and this was one damn good shake! the description/ingredients seemed so minimal, yet the shake tasted so amazing. it was like a cookies n cream reese's <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark>. this was my fav out of all the other shakes. \n\ntiramisu - they had me at mascarpone ice cream. i love mascarpone, but you could barely taste it in this shake. this tasted like a chocolate shake, not much espresso/coffee flavor. \n\nbanana creme pie - my bf go this 'cause he loves bananas and i would say this was my 2nd fav shake. it tastes exactly like a banana cream pie, but in shake form w/ chocolate. i liked that they topped it w/ white chocolate covered bananas.\n\nthe shakes are big enough to share, but trust me you won't want to. i like that you get a full glass shake and the extras are in the metal mixing cup so you can eat it w/ a spoon (yum!) i also like that their shakes all were thick & creamy!\n\napps:\nsurf 'n turf quesadilla - delish my favorite app! this ain't no taco bell quesadilla. it was crunchy and not oily at all. the lobster, steak and manchego cheese inside all just melted in your mouth and is bursting w/ flavor. must order!!\n\nsoft shell crab bruschetta - for a burger place, their presentation of these apps were tapas style and as nice as any fancy steakhouse. the softshell crab was on top of a thick cut brioche bread, the aioli and tomato salad made the app refreshing\n\ncrispy calamari - big enough portion to share, i couldn't stop dunking these rings in the sweet chili sauce. i like that they don't overbread the calamari rings\n\nmaine lobster roll - pricey for this, but there were generous amount of lobster. \n\ncrispy pork belly bun - tasted better than the ones at ramsay's burgr. the steamed buns weren't dry & sauce was spot on\n\nburgers:\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> w/ <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>(normally comes w/ fries, but paid $2 to upgrade) - the best burger ever!! most asian fusion burgers get overpowered by the sauce, but not here. it didn't taste like an ordinary overly sweet typical terriyaki burger. everything was perfect about this burger, that first bite was so orgasmic. this is what a burger should taste like! the whole brioche bun was toasted to perfection. i am not sure how they did it, but the top part of the bun and inside had a nice toast crisp to it. the tempura avocado was nice, added a different texture. you could taste each item in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and they all blended well together. the kobe beef patty was cooked medium, yet it was juicy and had a nice pink to it. <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were the best we've had as well & worth the upgrade! they were thick, fried, fresh, and crispy, no soggy oiliness at all. make sure to ask for buttermilk ranch to dip the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> in!! it tastes so divine\n\nfun-ghi on wheat bun w/ salad ($2 extra) - healthy combo huh? my 2nd fav burger, but my bf preferred this over <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> because he prefers the truffle flavor. again, patty was cooked perfect along w/ toasted wheat bun. i actually prefer the regular bun's flavor although the wheat bun was toasted the same way as the regular brioche bun. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> wasn't smothered in mayo thank god! the gruyere helped accentuate the truffle portabella & caramelized onions. salad was a generous portion of mixed greens & the dressing was tangy yet sweet & light (sort of like a coleslaw dressing w/ lemon). the only negative is that we added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, but there was no runny yolk...the egg was fully cooked :(\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> w/ <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>- everyone kept talkin about this burger, but we thought it paled in comparison to <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were bomb!\n\ni would have to say that holstein's outranks ramsay's burgr. we were so pleased w/ our meal that we sent compliments to the chef. we were lucky that both days we ate here, the executive chef was working. the food comes out fast and you will leave happily stuffed. don't forget to give them your identity player's card for points!\n\nnote: try and get a girl server. the first day we had a girl and she was totally on top of it. the 2nd day, we had a guy and he seemed easily overwhelmed", 
            "very good burgers, a bit pricey...but then again this is las vegas. my friends & i were starving after leaving marquee day club so we went here. has an amazing hooters/rustic ambiance with beautiful waitresses. love the couch service for dining.  i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger: delicious!\n\nthe only bad thing i can say about this place is that even though the waitress are generally nice, they're so busy (or at least ours was) that they're customer service could be a bit better. other than that, i'll be back again.", 
            "came here for or first night's dinner on a bachelorette party weekend. we showed up with 8 girls, and the first person we talked to told us it was a 45 minute wait. then someone else in our party talked to the hostess, and she told us 10 minutes. real time wait came to about 20 minutes. which is pretty good, considering we were a large party with no reservation.\n\n<mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> - big portion was easy to share, was crispy and came with a tasty dipping sauce\n<mark>Ahi Poke Tostadas</mark> - very small portion, and the ahi tuna tasted old and fishy, came with a nice avocado-like dipping sauce\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark> - was fresh, flavorful and delicious\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger - requested this medium-well, but it was served medium. was still really good, came with tasty teriyaki-type sauce, and tempura avocado!\nfries - came out warm, soggy and sad\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger - requested this medium-rare, and it came out medium. added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> for another dollar, was good and had a lot of cheese\nbeef sliders - three sliders that had very little cheese and a lot of bun. they would not let us add <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to these because of size\n<mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark> - this was really good if you like coconut\nbrown cow float - <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with pop rocks! surprisingly good\n\nthe food here was ok to good. nicely decorated with modern cartoon type art. we were sat cramped into a circle table, and we could not scoot our chairs in because the chairs kept hitting each other. there were two large booths that  could seat 8-10, but they chose to seat 3 or 4 people in them instead of us. considering the prices here, the service we received left a lot to be desired. the server took a long time to bring us water, and never checked on us after <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came out, and we ran out of water and drinks. appetizers and salad also took a long time to come out.\n\ni would not come here again. it was ok, but not awe-inspiring.",

            "this is our second visit to helsteins. they don't take reservations on friday and saturday making it harder to plan to eat there before a show but we tried our luck and it was on our side. we were able to get a table without too much wait at about 6-6:!5 on a saturday night. opentable must have gotten an upgrade since i used it last and now it will text you when your table is ready, gotta love technology! \n\nwe of course had an alcoholic milkshake, we had the cereal bowl. yum! \n\nwe got the friend pickles, which were so yummy. i love the spears and i love that the coating did not fall off after the first bit. the sauce they are served with was good as well. i had the <mark>California Turkey</mark> burger, tomato, avocado, pepper jack, russian dressing. it was really good and so big. i could have finished it but i resisted! the bf got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and he said it was good, he finished it all. we also got <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, which can never be wrong. \n\nthe service was good and friendly and attentive. \n\nmy beef with this visit was that they allowed a completely inebriated guy and his friend dine in the restaurant. the manager kept an eye on him from a far but he was literally heaving as if he was going to be sick. not what i want to see while i'm trying to enjoy my meal. they would have gotten 5 stars otherwise.   \n\ni'll be back and this time i will ask for my locals discount, which the hostess could have told me when i checked in and gave her my local phone number.",

            "first of all, i want to start off by saying that the cosmopolitan is starting to irritate me. everything that is the cosmopolitan is now obnoxious and boring. the types of people the property attracts is just garbage -- <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> of the barrel. don't get me wrong. the building and architecture and design of it all is fantastic. lcd screens everywhere, hip little touches here and there make this property great. i just can't stand how un-classically vegas it is. they try so hard to be different, that in the end of it all, they lose themselves. the addition of holsteins shakes and buns to the property is just the cherry on top. i heard ravenous reviews about holsteins and i was excited to try this place. things like, \"the best burgers in vegas,\" and \"i love love love hoslteins\" were some of many glowing reviews. here is my 2 cents.\n\nthe lobster mac and cheese was good, but not great. surprisingly, the dish had a lot of lobster in it. unfortunately, the lobster taste was lacking and the texture was not there as well. lobster usually has a familiarly soft yet firm feeling when you bite it. theirs was rubbery and lacked flavor. the truffle panko crust on top was nice, but the lack of lobster taste really disappointed me. my favorite part of this dish was the one chip on the side. it consisted of this lobster salad that was full of flavor.\n\nupon request, which i thought was complimentary, was popcorn. though it wasn't your ordinary popcorn, this one was flavored in some weird mixture. i read that it was truffle popcorn. excited for some truffle infused popcorn, theirs was definitely not so. it was a mixture of a vinegary, buttery flavor that coated the popcorn. this was a weird mix and though not appetizing, i found myself reaching for the popcorn. i ate it, forgot how it tasted like, and then tried it again. the sting from the popcorn seasoning alone was enough for me not to eat it again. i guess my curiosity superseded my palate.\n\nquite possibly my favorite food, and naturally, the food i am most knit picking about, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is a classic. from the bun to the type of meat, and the almost infinite sauces and toppings you can put on, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is a great vessel to work with. with such an iconic item, at a restaurant that supposedly specializes in this stuff, you can't mess it up.\n\nand now, <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger -- it had kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. their take on a japanese burger sounds good on paper. the fried avocado alone would make me happy. it was fried and crispy, and velvety smooth at the same time. i just didn't have enough of it. that probably was the only thing good about this burger. everything else was a mistake. first of all, what is wrong with this is the kobe. i hate when restaurants advertise as serving kobe when we all know most of that is just an american breed, if not, from australia. second of all, when you cook a \"kobe\" beef burger, it has to be rare. nothing else will do. what i got was all grey inside. the crust was overly marinated and glazed and turned the meat super dry, and the inside wasn't any different. that is one way to kill an almost perfect burger. the teriyaki glaze was much too overwhelming and the crispy yam didn't help with the cloyingly sweet flavors. did i order the wrong burger? maybe, but that still doesn't make up for the overcooked patty.\n\nif anything, the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake may have been the only thing that was considerably good. it had malted banana gelato and peanut butter crunch. the adult version has frangelico, a hazelnut liqueur from italy. i opted out and went with just a regular. \"you are in vegas. live a little!\", you say? in hind sight, maybe i should have made this shake alcoholic. it would have made me feel better about <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>-par meal i just had. still though, the shake was sweet and the use of gelato made the shave quite delicate and smooth.\n\npretentious, and yet casual, the restaurant has no identity. i just can't associate this restaurant with good food. the same food could be served at a restaurant that looks like, maybe johnny rockets, with a lower price, and i still wouldn't think twice about it. i mean, they have red and yellow squeeze bottles for ketchup and mustard. come on! the food really needs an upgrade. how awesome would it be if finally, the las vegas strip had a go-to burger spot that was hip, and of course, delicious? i think that is a home run and a much needed thing on the strip. i guess i just have to wait a couple years for that to happen. for now at the cosmo, i guess secret pizza will have to do.",

            "my boyfriend and i wanted to try this place for a really long time, so we finally visited! when we arrived, the hostess told us we had 3 options, the bar, lounge area or the dining room which was all full service but bar and lounge are open seating. the lounge area looked cozy and comfy so we settled for that. after sitting on the couch, it took about 10 minutes for us to get a hello from a server and the menus, quite ridiculous but forgiving. she was very polite but not very attentive. after we ordered the food, it came out sooner than we thought. we ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> & the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>! both were very tasty, rich and juicy. the food covered the exceptional service. after our meal, we ordered the grasshopper milk shake which was phenomenal, i am not a huge fan of mint but my boyfriend is so i gave in to his liking. i honestly can say i have second thought, about mint flavors because it was delicious! i loved the malt so much better, very sweet and made to perfection. most likely coming back but maybe just not as a first option.",

(thanks yelp!)\n\nbut i wasn't expecting the complimentary popcorn (that our group quickly renamed crack-corn), nor was i expecting the complimentary nitro meringues to finish off the meal. it was clear that the servers, even on a busy saturday night, were eager to make our experience memorable. and from start to finish, that's exactly what it was.", 
            "as far as burgers go, holsteins was very good, but not $18 good.  \n\ni ordered <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger (i love me some sauteed mushrooms and onions and gruyere cheese) and the beef patty was well cooked and flavorful. i really enjoyed the brioche bun, but was kind of underwhelmed by the entire burger....perhaps i should have gone with <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>? fries were mediocre at best. \n\nservice was very friendly, but kinda slow. and we didn't get free popcorn :(\n\nloved the cute little painted cows, and the location in the cosmo is very convenient for hanging out on the strip.\n\nall in all, not bad but not the greatest i've ever had :) 3 solid stars!",

            "we ate here in the bar at about 9 pm on the friday of labor day weekend. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger was amazing. my husband said the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were perfect. note if you order your burger medium it will be quite raw. so go over the cooking level with the waitress when you order.\nalso this place was very crowded and loud. we think if we ever went back we'd go at about 5pm. nightclub loud for dinner is not our thing as we are in our 50s.\ngreat burgers though!", 
            "after hearing so much about holsteins, i had to try it during my first trip to vegas. i waa not disappointed. i made reservations on open table since i'd heard it can get busy. the restaurant even called that morning to confirm my reservation. pretty impressed considering this is a millennial restaurant. my friend and i arrived at 1pm sharp and were promptly seated. the restaurant has a separate bar area but both have a lively atmosphere. our waiter have us some time to look over the menu, and brought a small bucket of their complimentary popcorn which my friend declared was \"addicting.\" we caught a glimpse of a burger going out to a table and they're huge! way too much for me. our waiter asked if it was our first time dining there. when we said yes he gave us a few suggestions. we took his digestion and decided to split a <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and a lobster roll with regular fries. we also ordered the philly <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark>. in case you hadn't heard, holsteins is known for their milkshakes. i ordered a black and whire, and my friend got a creme bruise. both were amazing. the philly <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> were delicious. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was tasty. tempura avocado won me over. the only disappointment was the lobster roll. it was just ok. not worth the price or the calories. \n\nservice was definitely above average. my water glass was never empty and all of my questions were well answered. plus since i asked for a souvenir or waiter gave me a drink koozy. woohoo! any way i can't wait to go back and try another burger and shake.", 
            "very cool place. nice staff. sat at the bar and ordered the \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" made with kobe beef. super yummy. order that one for sure medium rare to get the kobe flavor. they have a great choice of beer. they even have one of my favorite beers franziskaner hefeweizen. a perfect fit for any burger. oh yes that place made <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> indeed medium rare. most joints overcook the meat. the price is alright for what you get. definitely not overpriced.", 
            "delicious, great fun burger combinations. extra rich and super sweet shakes and amply sized. underwhelming sides.\n\nsince it's vegas, there's no point in stressing about the price, since everything is at least 50-100% marked up than what it should be.\n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> was truly an innovative combo: kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado. be warned, the crispy yam is merely just grated fried yams. the tempura avocado is extremely excellent though. but i mean, how do you go wrong with deep-fried fat? (for further reading: fried butter)\n\nthe <mark>Thai Steak Salad</mark> was barely average: grilled steak, tomato, cucumber, red onion, romaine lettuce, green papaya, mint, cilantro, roasted peanuts, tossed in a sweet-chili vinaigrette. the steak strips were substantial, but completely dry and tough, and i usually expect a sweeter sauce with my \"asian\" salads, but the sweet-chili vinaigrette was more vinaigrette than sweet or chili.\n\nthe regular fries & the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were mediocre at best, but the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were crisp, firm, and delicious.\n\nuseful: everything is super salty. everything. water will get you nowhere. my lips continually shriveled up from beginning to end no matter what i was eating. i was re-applying moisturizing lip balm like it was the air i breathe. i may try to ask for \"less salt\" if i ever go back!", 
            "las vegas burger mission part 3 took place just a couple weeks ago, and my travel companion and i decided on holstein's. it did not disappoint one bit.\n\nright out of the gate, things were looking good....we found the place in the cosmopolitan hotel easily, we were seated without a wait (it was a late tuesday afternoon), and our waiter looked like jared leto. i like jared leto. sweet. \n\ni decided to go with a black and white shake (like jerry seinfeld's black and white cookie, but in milkshake form, and it didn't make me puke) and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger. if i ever go back to holstein's, i might have to get the same thing...i loved both. i particularly got into the tempura avocado on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. my pal got <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake shake, which had cake flavored vodka in it. let me just say this....the person who invented cake flavored vodka deserves some sort of a nobel prize, and my friend who decided her life's problems could be washed away with a combination of ice cream and booze deserves some sort of a prize as well....because that's just awesome. and surely explains in part why we have been pals since 1975. anyway, she enjoyed her burger and shake as much as i enjoyed mine. \n\nburgers come with fries....nice that you don't have to order them (and pay for them) separately. we were both disappointed in the fries at burgr, so the fry test here was paramount....alas, great fries. big sigh of relief. \n\nto top it off, jared leto was the perfect server and took good care of us. oh hell, give him a prize, too...maybe an oscar.\n\nif you're looking to try one of the many burger places on the strip, be sure to consider holstein's. and say hi to jared for me.", 
            "another great meal at holsteins. we love this place. my husband stuck to his usual the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>- i tried another one (so many to try why not?) <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. i opted out of the mayo ( i tend to not like to much sauce) and didn't miss it! the tempura avocado was ok- kind of through me off so didn't eat it but the rest of it was amazing. better than the last one i tried which was the bbq one. an 8/10 and my husband says 10/10 again. i did have cold <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and when i mentioned it to my server he brought me fresh instantly. these burgers are always worth the price.", 
            "great experiences.  service provide by jade was awesome.   the place was packed, but the service was nice and quick.  very knowledgable about the menu and gave us some great suggestions.  i ordered the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> to start off.  they where delicious and complimented well with the caper mayo.  for my main course i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was pretty tasty,  but my fries where a little cold and soggy.  i also had the maple bacon shake, which was pretty good.  great vibe in the restaurant.  overall experience was great.  the only reason i gave this place 4 stars is because when we walked in the smell was pretty bad, like the tables where wiped down with dirty rags. other than that i would recommend trying this place out!", 
            "as suggested by the name, shakes and burgers are the specialty. there are fun and interesting array of shakes to choose from. we tried <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> shake that has a combination of cookies n' cream, sprinkles, butterfinger. it was good! we ordered the truffle lobster mac n' cheese to start out...it was good but not the best we've had. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was very good; we ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger. it has a good combo of sauce to onions and a juicy kobe beef. our medium request came out more like medium well, but still surprisingly very juicy nonetheless. overall, it is a great lunch spot with fun cow decor and designs. good with a group and fairly family friendly.", 
            "this place sucks so hard, you're better off going anywhere else for a burger.  the wait was super long not because they were busy but because service is extremely slow and inattentive.  our waitress was no where to be found after she took our order and then our burgers took forever and a day.  the only thing i liked about this place was the cute wall art.  i got the urth burger and it was bland and dry.  took a bite of <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and the patty was tasteless and dry also.  the tempura avocado did nothing texturally.  the fries were the worst fries i've ever had at a sit down burger restaurant.  i'm seriously confused about the 5-star reviews but chacun a son gout.", 
            "i got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger and it was bomb. teriyaki meat with avocado. it had a crunch with fried potato (?). the meat was a tad bit on the saltier side but overall <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was one of the best burgers i have consumed. this place is quite expensive so expect to be spending aroun $20+ burger afer tips and tax. nevertheless, it lived up to the hype.", 
            "let me start of by saying this is probably one of the best burgers i've tasted so far! \nlocated at the cosmopolitan hotel it was very easy for my boyfriend and i to walk downstairs to this place. the atmosphere was fun and lively. it had a bit of a kidish environment with all the painting of cartoonish cows on the wall (personally i think it was so cute and adorable). friendly staffed. my boyfriend ordered the funghi burger and i had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. i'm not a huge fan of truffle oil so i stuck with my <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> which was a version of a teriyaki burger of some sort. both were good. in the beginning of our meal they brought us some cheddar popcorn it was really good complimentary of course. last but not least we had to order one of their famous milkshakes boozed it up vegas style duh! \nwe had <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>. haha it was pretty fatty. \ncan't wait to go back next time!",

            "i was really excited to try holsteins because the menu looked great, there are a lot of highly rated reviews, and the restaurant has a fun vibe inside. while the other yelp reviews give the place 4 stars, my experience didn't live up to this expectation. this was mostly due to the lousy service that we received. our service wasn't terrible and our server was nice, but we had to ask for the complimentary popcorn to be brought to our table and ask on multiple occasions for our water to be refilled. in general, our waiter wasn't rude, but didn't seem to care about our experience here. \n\nthe menu is very unique though and the food that we tried was good. i wasn't in the mood for drinking, but the adult shake menu looks amazing. i was eyeing the <mark>Pecan Turtle Cheesecake</mark> shake, because who doesn't want to just drink a cheesecake with booze in it? my boyfriend and i were just in the mood for burgers so we ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, which had kobe beef with yam, teriyaki sauce, and tempura avocado and the longhorn burger with brisket, bbq sauce, and cole slaw. i was actually slightly disappointed with <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, but the longhorn one was delicious. we got regular fries and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and these were good, but not amazing. we had good burgers here, but unfortunately the high expectations that i had were not met. i'd give this place another try and i'd definitely come back for one of those shakes!", 
            "i love <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> here! coming from all the amazing burger joints in la, i would say holstein's has my second favorite burgers ever. it beats umami burger for sure, is on par with bachi burger, but father's office still wins. nothing could beat father's office.\n\nanyway, holstein's is fabulous in it's own respect. the restaurant is casual and comfy; decorated with cute little cows. prices are on the more expensive side at ~$15-20 per burger with a side of fries but it is located in cosmopolitan so i think it's pretty fair for vegas prices. service is only mediocre to me since the waiters check in too slow at times so that's why i'm giving it 4 stars.\n\ni've tried the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burgers.  whenever i have these, oh man i am in burger heaven. <mark>Gold Standard</mark> has bacon, aioli, arugula, and aged goat cheddar cheese on top of a sirloin burger. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> has a teriyaki glaze with kobe beef and tempura avocado!! the avocado seriously is amazinggg. i definitely recommend these two burgers. \n\nnot only are <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> but the alcoholic milkshakes are too!  you can also ask them to be non-alcoholic if you really want that. they have a variety of flavors that they rotate around. you really can't go wrong with any of them. i've had the frozen grasshopper, banana creme pie, and red velvet before and they were all yummy.  \n\noverall a fun restaurant with delicious burgers and milkshakes perfect for your vegas gluttony!", 
            "my friend  and i were craving burgers and staying at the cosmopolitan- the rating on yelp seemed good and the menu was just my style. however the food ( wish i took pics) was rather disgusting. well at least mine was. i ordered the turkey burger, comes with sprouts and avocado. but it came with a smear of guacamole that was absorbed into <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> and top of the bun bun like butter would be; caramelized onions that were mon existent and more like translucent relish and sprouts that were mushed and all cooked into the gross concoction. just the thought of it makes me sick because <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> dry,  salty, grainy( like knuckle pieces)of a thick turkey patty kept me up all night burping it up. even into the next day did i taste the awful burger. i was super duper sick. sweating nauseous x10 and just wanted to die kinda sick.\ndo not order the turkey burger.\nunfortunately we had gross food. this is bound to happen at a lot of places ; but it literally made me sick. i have used yelp for years but never gave my two cents. \nsince i lost two days in vegas due to this restaurant ....i had to share:(", 
            "great place! \n\ni love the atmosphere of this restaurant. it's fun, vibrant, and full of energy. the artwork is pretty fun to look at, and the service was good. \n\ni came here for my 23rd birthday with some friends. they definitely need to organize their waiting lines better though. the was some confusion because the menu was right in front of the hostess desk,and people were crowding around it. i waited for 15 min behind these people, thinking it was a line, but no, they were just crowding and didn't bother to say anything though they all saw us standing there. \n\nanyway, food was great! i ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger and <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake bamboozle shake. i'm not a big fan of bacon on my burgers, but damn, that burger was /amazing/. it was juicy and cooked to by perfection. the buns were soft, warm, and buttered generously. my friend ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. he doesn't even like burgers much (and came for the alcoholic shakes haha), but he just ate everything and proclaimed it all delicious. \n\nthe shake actually tasted like birthday cake and gave me a mild buzz. they also give you the shaker it was made in, so it's pretty much two shakes for the price of one. friends ordered maple bacon shake and smores shake. the maple bacon had pieces of chocolate-covered bacon in it, which was strangely delicious. smores tasted exactly like smores. i wish i had the stomach for dessert because everything they had on menu looked great. i'm definitely coming back here, so i'll make sure to order some next time. \n\nconclusion: definitely try this place out! prices are reasonable for what you get, and food is delicious!", 
            "wooooooooow this place is so good. probably the best gourmet burger i've ever had! got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> bc it just sounded amazing and man, it was so good. \n\ni also had the campfire milkshake and holy shit, i love alcoholic milkshakes. it sounds so wrong but tastes so good. it's a must guys. gotta do the milkshakes. and they give you a lot so you're bound to take it to go and bring all <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> to the yard.", 
            "to start off, i am not at all a fan of burgers mainly because it's hard to find one that tastes good. holsteins is the end-all-be-all of burger restaurants. first, their service is top notch. our server (dean?) was knowledgeable & personable. he provided great recommendations for burgers. their milkshakes are just as delicious. i had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger and <mark>Pecan Turtle Cheesecake</mark> milkshake. if you have a big appetite, you'll be able to consume both but the milkshake is more than big enough to share with another person. i'm definitely adding this place to my list of restaurant-musts whenever i'm in vegas.", 
            "came here for lunch the last time i visited vegas. i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger and holy balls was it glorious. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> comes with a kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and the best part: tempura avocado! i added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to mine which tied the all the flavors together with its gooey albeit messy goodness. at close to $20 for a burger, this thing was definitely on the pricey side but i would definitely be back to try more of their delectable offerings. i also tried some of the tiramisu alcoholic shake. these things are huge, and can easily be split amongst 2 or even 3 people. the only other gripe i have is that we were seated in a lounge type area, probably because we had a large party, but it made it difficult to handle a messy burger cause the table was more of a lower coffee table than a dining one. i found myself having to lean my back awkwardly far forward so my burger didn't get all over the place.",

            "i'm not sure i've ever had worse service.  can i give .25 stars?  made a reservation 3 weeks ahead of super bowl and they called same day today of <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> bowl and told us if we want a seat in front of the tv it's a $150 minimum. we complained that we were never advised of this when we made the reservation and at that hour we'd be scrambling for a viewing party.   the agreed to make it $100 for us.  when we got there the hostess made us wait because she said many tables have been booked for months so she wasn't sure which one we could have.  when we were finally sat we ordered red sangria. they said they were out. we then ordered bud light drafts and they were out of bud light on super bowl sunday.  service was slow, the food was cold, and the drinks were weak.   when we complained to the manager he said he had been complained to all day about the cover and if the customers were just mad that their team lost. i wasn't even wearing a jersey!!!  instead of apologizing when i explained in a repeat customer who had poor service he said he would take the gratuity off the bill. i had to wait 40 minutes for an adjusted bill. i came to find i had already been charged the full amount instead of \"authing\" the card like the waitress indicated. so then i had to wait 4 days for the voided charges to come off. my advice to the owner is get a manager that respects customers and be better organized and shut off open table on days when you have events. not only will i never come back, but i will also spread the word to friends, family and clients that frequent vegas to stay away. disappointing as we have been coming to holsteins for years.", 
            "holsteins really does not need my review but i need to talk about my affinity for holsteins. my family and i got there at around 11:45 am. not exactly lunch time yet so it was pretty spacious and not packed. holsteins has complimentary popcorn but our server was a bit tardy compared to other servers & their tables. so at first, we saw popcorn on nearly every other table and were wondering what's so special about the popcorn that got so many people to order it as their appetizer? then we realized it's complimentary when our server brought it out pretty late. not a huge complaint but just saying.\n\ni got <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and i was pretty satisfied. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are said to be 6 oz, which i find is just right. there are some people on this yelp page who say the size isn't that great and it was not big. but i mean what more do you want? it's 6 oz. i mean yeah sure 8 oz burger is bigger but for a burger, 6 oz was just right. after consuming a 6 oz burger, you don't feel disgustingly full. it's not too much beef and not too much unhealthy food. 6 oz is just right. any more is just not necessary. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were good. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is pepper-crusted and comes with a tomato confit. excellent burger. i loved it but i wouldn't recommend it. let me clarify. i do not regret getting it. i do not think it was a bad burger. but it wouldn't be one i would recommend to others. i didn't personally feel it was indicative of holsteins' caliber. so although i enjoyed it and it tasted great, i just wouldn't get it again. \n\nmy sister got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger and i thought the tempura avocado and the teriyaki glaze was fantastic. they really made the entire thing a masterpiece. the tempura avocado was unique and just burst on your taste buds. teriyaki glaze gave it a nice taste. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> we ordered were all juicy, not dry. we had high praise for holsteins. \n\nholsteins has a lot more on its menu than burgr. i love gordon ramsay but his menu pales in comparison to here. also, my god, the shake was fantastic. we got the <mark>Pecan Turtle Cheesecake</mark> or whatever it was. it was absolutely magnificent. not overly sweet. it just really was an explosion of several layers of flavor that fit together really well. i definitely recommend this shake. just absolutely tasty and i want another shake from holsteins. we looked around and a myriad of other tables ordered shakes too. they're a very great aspect of the restaurant. so, get a shake along with a burger! \n\nservice was okay. not too impressive. not friendly enough. the place is pricy. i don't deny that but hey it's vegas. did you expect to get cheap burgers? tbh, i'm pretty content with paying the price for my <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> though. it's a bit pricy but they deliver on flavor. \n\ni'll definitely be back, holsteins!", 
            "i very seldom ever write reviews but i felt that i absolutely had to after having dinner at holsteins.\n\nto begin with, the hostesses were very polite and we only had to wait for about ten minutes and they had the option to send a text when the table was ready, allowing us to take a look around the shops located nearby.\n\nonce we were seated, we ordered the truffle lobster mac n cheese and it was incredible. my girlfriend and i fought over the last few bites.\n\ni ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, cooked medium and i added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark>. my girlfriend had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> cooked the same with a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> as well. suffice to say, she had major food envy, and after trying hers i could understand. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> was in the top 5 greatest burgers i've ever had. \n\nthe service was great, the atmosphere was very cool, and it wasn't too loud like other restaurants like it. i highly recommend",

            "i actually enjoyed my time here last night so thats why im giving this place a 4 star even though its really 3.5 stars. the place is very nice and theres alot of places to sit. the art hanging on the wall has a great playful feel to the place.\n\nlets get to the food. as far as burger establishments once again i will say that when you charge $20 a burger it better be awesome. i will say that im a little upset that i spent $70 for 2 burgers and 2 beverages and that was including tip. but spending time with my cousin who was staying here at the cosmo made it worth it.\n\nfun-ghi burger (3/5)- by itself it would have probably been too much but i added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> and it made the powerful truffle flavor balance out. without the egg i wouldnt have enjoyed <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> as much but i did like it. \n\nturkey burger (4/5)- my wife had this and she really enjoyed it and said it was well put together.i dont have anything specific to say about it because i didnt try it.\n\nthe only way we'll be back is if we go with friends or family it is a great place to socialize and very laidback. service was great our server really took care of us and for i will be back to enjoy some more burgers. looking forward to trying <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>.\n\n<mark>French Fries</mark> are nothing special. but my wife did enjoy her <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> probably because it was different.",

            "first let me say, this review might have scored differently had it been 7pm instead of 10:30pm, but i will also say this would have gone a lot different if sam didn't save the night.\n\nwe had a couple of drinks at the chandelier bar directly across the way.  it was our wedding anniversary and we were out with a couple of friends.  we decided to go with holsteins instead of china poblano based on yelp reviews.  as we left the bar the music in the area went from background dance music for the night club on the other side of the room, to deafening.  we were greeted by the hostess who offered to seat us once we finished our drinks from the other bar.  that didn't sit so well with members of our group.  we walked around and debated skipping and going across the road to any of the dozens of places to eat, but my lazy kicked in and we decided to give it ago.\n\nback to holsteins, sans our cocktails, greeted by the same hostess.  i mentioned it was a bummer of a policy, to which she stated don't shoot the messenger.  again, almost sent my friends into a tailspin, but we trudged on!\n\nonce seated, the music got louder. so loud we had to literally yell across the table to each other.  at this point we were all ready to leave, until sam greeted us.  he was so genuine and polite, i felt bad for him having to work right then!    we expressed the fact we were deciding to stay or go.  he completely understood and even offered to mention it to his manager, knowing full well nothing could be done.\n\nwe stuck it out.... the food was average.  we got 4 different full sized burgers and fries; classic, <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, <mark>El Caliente</mark>, and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (mine).  i'm on a burger mission this year, obviously, and i love teriyaki.  the meat was cooked properly and the bun wasn't soggy (all bonuses) but with all the other options out there, this place was underwhelming, especially with the other outside influences.  i'd say skip it.", 
            "in my opinion this is the best burger place in las vegas. every time i visit i always have a fantastic time and the food is delicious! <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger topped with tempura avocado and teriyaki sauce is my absolute favorite, and the chicken wing dip appetizer is to die for! amanda was my server when i stopped in last week and she didn't skip a beat through the entire meal, very attentive and pleasant. i will definitely be back again, and i'll most certainly be requesting to sit in amanda's section when i return. :)",

            "i am obsessed with burgers, so whenever i travel, i always am on the look out for the best burger in town.  based on many recommendations, i decided to try holstein's.  sadly, holstein's was another over hyped place for me.  i got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> - <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with avocado tempura, sweet potato shavings, and a teriyaki-like sauce. i tend to stay away from asian fusion stuff, but this burger seemed to be quite popular per my friends and yelp.  \n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was decent, but i had a few problems with it.  1) the avocado tempura was tiny - it only covered about half of the patty, so i only was able to taste avocado with half of my burger.  2) the patty is pretty flimsy.  not meaty enough for me.  definitely overcooked for medium rare.  3) the bun was nothing to write home about.  in a perfect burger, the bun adds texture, balance, and cohesion.  but, in this burger, it  didn't add any of that for me.  i wish that the bun were warmer or better toasted.  4) the fries were not good.  they came with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, so i'm glad that i didn't need to pay extra or else i would have been more disappointed.  they were not crisp enough, so i actually left some of them behind.  anyone who knows me knows that i never leave fries behind.  \n\nall in all, the taste of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was fine, but definitely overpriced for what you get.  this is to be expected as we are talking about a meal on the strip.  i have had far more delicious burgers in la.  i was definitely not impressed with the service either.  a little too pretentious for  my taste.", 
            "have gone to this place for my last 2 vegas trips & i'm not going to lie, i'll probably come again on my next vegas trip.\n\ni've only gone to holstein's during lunch time and both times i got seated right away with a party of 4 & 5.\n\nthey always give you a bucket of popcorn that is nicely seasoned (& just a tad addicting)! for milkshakes, i have tried their birthday cake, smores, nutella crunch & they are all super delicious. you don't taste any alcohol at all in the smores & nutella crunch and only just a little bit in <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake milkshake. out of all the milkshakes i've tried, the smores is one of my top faves as it has graham crackers blended in, a generous amount of chocolate drizzle, and whipped cream with a lot roasted, glazed marshmallow. one thing to also mention about the milkshakes is that the portions are pretty big so i would def recommend sharing it!\n\nfor burgers, i've tried the funghi and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>- both burgers being medium rare. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> can be pretty big in portion as well; for example, the patty for my last burger was bigger than the bun and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was filling enough that i was able to split it in half and eat it the next day. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> is my personal fave since it has tempura <mark>Avocado</mark> in it and crispy yams!\n\noverall, this is a def a place to check out in vegas... esp if you are a burger and shakes fan!", 
            "<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> that changed my life... it's here. its here!!!\n\nit wasn't enough that i had the best burger of my life here, it had to change my whole thought process on burgers. i mean how gourmet can you make a burger? you can only do so much to elevate a burger, what can you possibly do? \n\nwell let me introduce you to the \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\"\n-kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furiki, crispy yam, and a tempura avocado and don't forgot the egg, its part of of every perfect burger. \nthe kobe beef has so much flavor. the beef is delicious and sweet, but not overpowering. \ni loved the touch with tempura avocado because i've never seen nor heard of it, but its good! \nthe crispy yam makes a play with the avocado to give your burger the crispy texture along with the nori.\nthen the egg to top it off to make a monster burger even more messy.\nall these components together create a sweet and savory party in your mouth.\nhow can i enjoy a burger so much and not cry that bacon isn't apart of it? \ni'm beyond impressed at this point. the day before i was at ramsays burger thinking i had a good burger. there is no competition for this burger heaven, hands down. \n\neveryone one knows the perfect combo with a burger and fry is a shake!\nand we're in vegas so why not some alcohol!?\ncan i get a \"<mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> shake\"?\nthis shake is on point and a great way to cool off and get turnt!(drunk) and ready for marquee!\nvodka is hard to pair with desserts, if its too strong it just destroys. \nwell it isn't strong but you'll know it was there later. the shake finishes off nicely with a mini whoopie pie on top. \n\nthe prices are good too, gourmet burgers with the gourmet price! excellent service!\n\nif you're on the strip and you want a good ass burger, then get to the cosmo! it's just necessary to have a perfect trip to vegas.", 
            "holy cow!!! this place freaking rocks! <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger was one of the most delicious things that i have ever put in my mouth. the tempura avocado, the teriyaki glaze, the yam crunchy bits, the spicy mayo all combine to make a flavor delight in my mouth. the had bites of the nom nom and <mark>Gold Standard</mark> too. both were quite good but not quite as amazing. the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were crispy and <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> shakes were to die for. the coffee and doughnuts was oh so amazing! the caramel cheesecake was also delicious. this was one of my top meals in vegas. no one should even consider the other big name burger joints. this place blew them away.", 
            "yeah it's vegas but the price for a burger doesn't fit the service or vibe of this place. i got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger which was good but it was close to $20. really? even gourmet burgers shouldn't be this much especially with the lackluster fries. \n\njordan, our waiter, was kind of a tool. he greeted us with a smile and then basically told my date and i that we looked like we went out partying last night. i thought we looked damn fresh in my humble opinion.  he subsequently asked us how we were and our unenthusiastic, one word answers responses seemed to offend him. he was rude and very slow in retrieving my credit card after the bill. (he was too busy getting chummy with other tables that were in the mood for small talk). left wishing i tried the place next door instead.", 
            "during my stay at cosmo, i decided to try holstein's shakes & buns. \n\ni decided on <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> ($18): kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. i also had a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. this burger blew my mind! it was crazy delicious. i really liked the tempura avocado in my burger.\n\nmy boyfriend had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> ($18.50): dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli. this was just as good, but i still think my burger won!", 
            "in the spirit of trying new places while also being confined to the perimeter area of cosmopolitan, i decided to give holstein's a try. luckily on a monday late afternoon, there was enough availability to book a reservation on open table at 5:45 pm, just one hour prior. i was able to walk right on down to the second floor and check in within 5 minutes flat.\n\nthere was a baseball game and football game going on, so the bar/lounge area (which is right up front) was loud and rowdy. even with seating in the wayy back away from the bar, it would still be noisy. i opted instead to order to go, charge the cost to my room, and enjoy <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger from the comfort of my hotel room with the tv show of my choice.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself was filling, which made me happy since it cost $18! it better fill me up at that price! <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> has a kobe beef patty, tempura avocado (love it!), nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and teriyaki glaze. it also comes with a side of fries. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was good, but the teriyaki sauce was rather salty, which really takes away from an otherwise yummy choice. it didn't help that the fries were salty too. i really needed the ketchup not because i needed more flavor, but to use the taste to balance the saltiness. i was so full that 1/4 of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> remained, which i snacked on and finished two hours later. \n\nnot a bad substitute for secret pizza or wicked spoon if you want to stay around the cosmo area and grab a low-key meal without the three or four dollar signs from the other more fine dining options.", 
            "best burger of my life! <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>: love beef, teriyaki glaze, tempura avocado slice and spicy mayo. served with crispy fried. i was so full after this meal, it was worth the $18 price tag. outstanding service and fun vibe. \nalso had the vegan coconut raspberry milkshake, out of this world and huge portion!", 
            "so good! party of six, we tried lots of different meals and everyone loved there food. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> got rave reviews, urth burger with beef patty, longhorn, fun-ghi, cuban street tacos. it was all delish!!! and the shakes were bomb!!!", 
            "so i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> based on recommendations and it just sounded delicious on paper, but it was more like a sodium explosion in my mouth. i think it was the furikake seasoning took the salt over the top. other than that, everything else was incredible: lobster mac and cheese, alcoholic milkshakes and my friend's burgers. a++ service, too. definitely great food minus that burger, so 2 stars off for the sodium bukakke in my mouth.", 
            "amazing!! service and food was awesome! my husband and i shared <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, and the red velvet shake. holy smokes it was all delicious. i would go again tonight if my husband didn't want to go to the wicked spoon. the shake was one of the best i have ever had. never heard of adding vodka to a shake, but it added an amazing dimension. the beef in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was also juicy and cooked to perfection. we had are ally great service too even though it was a really busy night. do yourself a favor and eat her. you won't regret it.", 
            "burger fit for a king or queen!\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is one of the staples of american popular cuisine. the simple recipe allows for considerable creativity from the chef who's making it, and there are thousands of variations, from one end of the country to the other. and when done properly, there are few foods more delicious. \n\nholsteins freshly made bad-ass burgers are made from the choicest cows (kobe), organic toppings and freshest buns. \n\nthis restaurant is located in the cosmopolitan on the 2nd floor near the escalators. the interior reminds of a new age diner with eager guests wanting to try these delicious alcoholic shakes and fancy exotic burgers. the restaurant seem very energetic and it was a full house. the waiters and waitress wore uniforms and all looked in sync. our waitress abigail payed close attention to us and we felt that her she went above and beyond for us. i had a yelp checking promo for a free beer and she took care of me right way. nothing better then free beer. with service like that i can now see why that this place is always buzzing.\n\nwe started with an appetizer of buffalo chicken wings smothered in bright orange sauce. with each bite i could taste the strong flavor of the cayenne pepper and garlic. i don't prefer really hot wings but these were so good we couldn't stop until they were gone. \n\nfor the main course, i decided to go with <mark>Gold Standard</mark> dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli for $18.50.  i order it medium rare and it came out looking and tasting amazing. the sirloin was melt in your mouth good. with each and every bite getting the hints of the goat cheese and the sweet organic greens <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> really was a work of art. my wife ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado for $18. this dish was made perfect. such an intense flavor from the very expensive high quality kobe beef and the teriyaki glaze. it was mild and not to sweet like most american teriyaki but just wow! my wife made me try a little bite and after that one tiny little bite my tongue firing all the wonderful deep flavors to my brain. it was like i was mesmerized by that one bite. i wanted her burger so bad!!!  \n\nit is true chef anthony meidenbauer really knows how to build a burger fit for a king or a queen.  we felt like king and queen that night we had those fantastic exotic burger. i noticed on the menu they have whats called a <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> which consists of kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, truffle mayo. doesn't that just sound like amazing. i am imagining the wonderful flavor combos of my two favorite dishes combined into one. i didn't have the nerve to spend $35 but on my next visit i will for sure.\n\noverall its a great new burger concept and probably in the top 10 best burger restaurants. i will be returning soon and i will have my eye on that <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>!\n\nthanks for reading.\nmatthew y.", 
            "<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were just okay. i tried <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, which was recommended by our server. i believe he said it won a few awards, but i wasn't really impressed by <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> at all. \n\ni would recommend the milkshakes. they have a special set of milkshakes on the menu that come with alcohol for about $13. if you choose to not include any alcohol in your shake, it will cost you a mere $9 like the other standard non-alcoholic shakes. \n\nservice was friendly."

            "the hamburger. oh, you poor, misunderstood sandwich. so many people treat you like a fall-back. when people say, \"eh... you just want to grab a burger?\" it causes tears in my eyes, and great gnashing of teeth. and i can only handle so much gnashing.\n\nhowever, there is a place out there, a place that adores and cherishes you, you faithful friend, you. holstein's, located in the cosmopolitan of las vegas, is a gourmet burger joint that mixes classic with funky. that's pretty obvious when you sit in their leather-adorned lounge area complete with a pink-and-white cow. (by the way, we've named her \"holly holstein.\" run with it.)\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> did not disappoint. my friend had a \"hen house,\" a classic hamburger topped off with a <mark>Fried Egg</mark>. never had egg on your burger? you'd be surprised. i had the longhorn burger, a bbq burger topped with brisket. fantastic. no stale burgers here; each bite was succulent, as if a little miniature chef was on our table crafting every bite just at the time we ate it.\n\nholstein's has about 34 million beers on tap. ok, maybe not 34 million, but a lot. we didn't have any alcohol, as it was only noon and neither of us were in the mood to drink yet. (in vegas? no! yes, you have to detox sometime.) that would be my only complaint about the place, they really try hard to force the alcohol on you. we were asked about six different times if we wanted a drink or if we had looked over the bar menu. the first three times we said no should have been an indication; by the sixth time i wanted to say \"yeah, if you're comping it.\"\n\ni've heard the shakes are killer; it's definitely on my to-do list next time i come. and there will be a next time. oh holstein's... shut up. just shut up... you had me at \"hamburger.\"\n\n(by the way, when you go, find the painting of the robot in the lounge, and tell me he's not being a little obscene. just saying.)\n\nps: full disclosure here: i work at the cosmopolitan of las vegas, where holstein's is located. however, as the hotel encourages honesty from its employees, i have been honest in this review. i am also not affiliated with the f&b department.", 
            "just tried out this place as a buddy and i were checking out the new cosmopolitan. win!\n\ncreative food and a great twist on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> joint idea. my buddy had the regular burger and raved that is was the tastiest he's had and i had the lobster sandwich which was also quite tasty. everything is presented well and taste is big!\n\ndesserts are creative too. i grabbed the coffee and donuts which sounds awfully normal. however, it was presented on a platter as a chocolate infused coffee with marshmallows served with gourmet donut holes filled with different flavored pastry cremes (like cardamom and cinnamon). super tasty.\n\ngreat joint, great music too. they must have a resident dj who does some creative transitions between classic 80s.\n\ndefinitely going back!", 
            "i went here for lunch on the opening week at cosmopolitan.  it's on the same floor as some other restaurants but seems to get more business than the others; we had a 20 minute wait.  once we were seated, we noticed that there were a lot of empty tables in the restaurant; i'm guessing that they're a little understaffed.\n\ni had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> cheeseburger, which comes with sirloin beef, bacon, sliced goat cheese, arugula, tomato confit, and a garlic aioli.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was quite good.  the ingredients tasted fresh and the meat was cooked perfectly.  unlike a lot of gourmet cheeseburgers i've had, the grill taste isn't overly aggressive here.  the bacon definitely made an impact and the arugula, while mostly dominated by the other ingredients, added a nice crunch to cut the grease.\n\ni upgraded my fries order to the duck fat fries.  it was my first time trying duck fat fries, but i wasn't impressed.  i was hoping to taste some duck in there!  they were definitely crunchier than the standard fry, but the steak fries here are very tasty as well and i would recommend those instead.  i also had the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> spiked milkshake, which was delicious.  very creamy and chocolatey, but for a spiked milkshake it was perhaps too smooth.\n\nin conclusion: this is one of the better gourmet cheeseburgers i've had in las vegas so far.  stick with the steak fries unless you're curious about the duck fat or really like your fries crunchy.", 
            "hit holstein's for lunch today.  sat at the bar.  since i had to go back to work - no drinkie - had some <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> called rat bastard ( $5 ) - ok \n\norder kettle chips ( $6 ) \n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger ( $17 - add $2 more for <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> ) \n\ncool looking place, in the mall area of the cosmo - place was hopping today.\n\nguy next to me seated 3-4 minutes after me - he gets his malt and sliders before i get my chips and/or burger....in fact, i never get my chips - the bartender didn't  hear me .....okaaay.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> - asked for it medium - it was juicy but no hint of pink at all ...none ... since <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was juicy i can live with it.  my guess a quarter pounder, but not sure - overall, i liked it - the goat cheddar complimented the meat, lil micro greens were a nice touch and  bacon was all good  but $17 .... not sure about the pricing.  \n\n<mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were also decent but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nwill i try again ?  yeaaah - i want to try some of the sausages they apparently make in house.\n\na pet peeve - they make mention of everything made in house yet what do they bring me when i get the plate of food - bottled catsup and mustard ( i believe heinz and french's ) - geez guys, can't you make it yourself ?  or at least put the stuff in a fancy container ?   at least they didn't pull a kgb and when i ask for mayo they throw me a few \"to go\" tear open mayo containers .\n\npics will be posted later today", 
            "popped into holsteins on x-mas eve to grab some dinner after the cosmopolitans, wicked spoon buffet was way to crowded. \n\ni checked in at the hostess stand and was offered a bar seat or table. i'm not huge on dinning at the bar so i asked for a table. i was given a pager and told would be about 5-10 minutes. no problem, i'll go check out their gift shop. 5 minutes later the pager went off and i was seated in a near empty restaurant. next to a romantic couple. nice! they couldn't have sat me next to ummm well let's see? nobody else.\n\nchaz was my server. the restaurant has a dj spinning in the front and the music blasts through the restaurant. he was mixing christmas songs with popular songs. very interesting. i was sitting low and back to the music. and chaz was standing tall. i could not hear him. chaz was adequate though. brought me an ice water while i looked over the menu.\n\nchaz showed me the extensive beer list but i did not want a beer tonight. good selection though. they have about a dozen adult milkshakes on the menu. i chose the grasshopper made with vanilla ice cream, mint and chocolate vodka. it was just ok. they give you the excess shake in the metal mixer. the food menu is extensive for a burger place. a few salads, some mini burgers, and some starters. the stars are <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, done with different ingredients and combinations. \n\ni wanted to try so many of the appetizers. but dining solo i only chose one. the chicken and waffles. it was lame. one tiny little waffle. it was dry. and 3 chicken fingers. the chicken fingers were good. hot and crispy. some ranch dressing and some maple syrup on the side. i'll try something different next time for sure.\n\nfor my burger, i tried the longhorn. it came out medium like the way i asked. toppings on it were cole slaw, beef brisket, and bbq sauce. very tasty but messy. i ate it with a knife and fork. i beef in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was lean and flavorful. the bun was getting stale. it comes with shoestring or steak fries and for $2 extra you can get duck fat fries. these were possibly the biggest let down. mine were cold and dry. the flavor on them was ok but i was expecting them to be tastier and more seasoned. i think i will just go with the steak fries next time.\n\nholsteins is not in-n-out burger. expect to spend a few extra dollars here. a $10 shake and app and a $15(+$2) burger, it is not cheap. the quality of the food is very good and i can only see this place getting better over the next few weeks.", 
            "this restaurant was located on the 2nd floor of the new cosmopolitan.  it was my first time in the casino and although the place was packed, the bartender was courteous and let me know she would be right with me.  after i ordered a corona (22oz!!) i found a chair and order <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger.  i love this place. kobe beef, house glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado!!! i'm done...  good food and big drinks, perfect for a quick stop in las vegas, they've re-made <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> joint another favorite destination for my vacations here.", 
            "this is going to sound like a farce, but i daydream about my meal at holsteins on a nearly daily basis - <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were that good.  i was a little, um, rough from 2 consecutive nights of partying, and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> here dazzled my taste buds and satiated my poor stomach.\n\nwe started with radicchio salad which was large enough for two to share as a starter and was perfectly tossed and loaded with fresh parmesan.  we split a korean bullgogi burger and a <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, and trying to pick the better of the two would be like trying to pick the more obnoxious twin between mary-kate and ashley.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was a glorious pastiche of meat and cheese, vegetable and fruit, starch and sauce.  and then the bullgogi, with the glaze, the egg, the trite kim-chi whatever-it's-going-to-be to make the dish \"korean\" (in this case, kim-chi slaw) worked equally well together to create a fabulous burger.  i would urge anyone to order either of these but all of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> looked appetizing on the menu.\n\nmy only regret (due to an impending drive back to la) was not being able to try one of the alcoholic shakes.  \n\noh! and since they mistakenly brought out the salad with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> (i asked for it before <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, naturally), they offered us a complimentary whimsical dessert sampler (i think it's \"the candy store\" on the menu) that was great; save the mini-drumstick cones for last!", 
            "holsteins is a great spot - it has a cool vibe, reasonable prices, and delicious food.  i think its a great fit within the cosmopolitan hotel, and definitely a spot we will be back to soon.  \n\nwe popped in around 6pm to grab an appetizer and a drink.  the bar was pretty full, but we were led to a spot with 2 chairs.  good looking staff and some good energy was my first impression.  \n\nwow what a beer list, i think there were over 75 bottled beers, and another 20 on tap. i settled on a winter seasonal ale recommended by the bartender, it was smooth and balanced and nice to try something i hadn't had before. my fiancee ordered the blood orange cosmo, which she said was very tasty and i can attest went down smoothly because she ordered another one in no time.  \n\nwe ordered the 'street tacos' as an appetizer.  i love duck, and this didn't disappoint.  the flavors of duck confit, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, truffle, and cranberry relish had me smiling from ear to ear.  it was delicious and we ordered another one after just a few bites (i wasn't doing a very good job of sharing with my fiancee, it was just too good).  \n\nits too bad we had to go meet up with friends for dinner at another cosmo restaurant, otherwise we would have tried a bunch of other items.  we will definitely be back, hopefully with a larger group of people so we can order up a bunch of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, which look awesome.  \n\nif you are looking for a fun spot to grab drinks, good food, and not break the bank, holsteins is the place.  i would imagine it would be a great spot for a little hair of the dog after a long night out on the town, or as a good spot to grab some food after a night of clubbing.  we'll definitely be back soon.", 
            "where do i possibly start....  it's pretty unbelievable to me that anyone gave this place a decent review for anything but the shakes, which to be honest... were fantastic.  quite possibly some of the best shakes i ever had.  so why just one star?\n\nwell...  when i go somewhere that specializes in burgers, i'd expect <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> to be great, at least good...  i would have even settled for mediocre...  instead, it was easily the worst burger i have ever had...  i'd take mcdonald's over this (i hate mcdonald's), and for the price i could have had mcdonald's 10 times over.  \n\nso how bad was it?  well...  ever had a burger that was cooked on charcoal before all the butane finished burning off?  well... this was worse.  this was kind of like directly eating that charcoal...  so maybe i just got unlucky with that one burger?  no such luck, because the waitress took it back, exchanged it for another, different burger, and it was almost as bad.  at this point, i am not sending it back again because i certainly don't want them to spit in it.\n\ni really wanted to like this burger.  hell, i wanted to love it.  the descriptions and promised flavors were so enticing...  but all i could taste was burnt charcoal.\n\nthe waitress said that some people are extra sensitive to the charcoal flavor, but my friend had the same bad experience.  besides... this is the first and only time i have ever experienced a burger like that. \n\nif i ever go back to cosmo, i might have a shake there, but never another burger.  what a waste.", 
            "came here for drinks and something to eat when we stayed at the cosmo. im so glad that they have some decent places to eat, because now i can eat at the place and not stay there! holsteins has great service, we were seated right away and ordered within 10 minutes. great atmosphere, there was a dj playing hip hop and classic rock mixes.  our food was brought out by the manager who was working the floor that night too. the lobster mac and cheese was amazing, and i saw some of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> on the next table, which looked too pretty to eat! great beer list as well. only con i could come up with were the douchey guys sitting at the bar trying to pick up on the waitresses. but hey, you'll find them everywhere in vegas.", 
            "let's start out with the service. i can be very judgmental with a restaurant on how you are greeted. when we approached the restaurant, the hostess' were smiling and friendly. we had a party of 10 and put down our name. the hostess told us it would be a 30-45 minute wait so we decided to wait and help ourselves to chinaplobano right next door just to eat something to carry us over so we don't get grumpy because of low blood sugar levels. i put in my order and literally 5 minutes later, our table was ready. i was like \"wth...i thought you said it's gonna be a 30-45 min wait, so now i'm stuck with dim sum and what i'm going to order off the menu.\" the waitress was very friendly but kinda slow at times. she never came back to offer anyone another drink/shake or refill my water.\n\nas far as food goes...i agree with mike h...<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are waaaaaaay expensive for how small they are, but then again...what do you expect...it's a restaurant in los vegas. i had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and wasn't very impressed. the menu consisted of some random burgers....i feel that if you wanna burger...\"the more basic the better\" the \"tiny bites\" are literally tiny bites. some of them cost almost as much as a regular size burger....if you want more bang for your buck....get a regular size. as far as the \"adult milkshakes,\" i don't drink usually but damn....the <mark>Virgil's Orange Cream</mark>....was absolutely amazing!!!!!!! if anything that was the only thing that i would go back for. \n\ni'd give the service a 2 and the food a 3. like i said...i'd only go back for an \"adult milkshake.\"", 
            "yes, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> at this place are pricey. however, you get what you pay for and in my opinion, the food here is worth the price!  i had the longhorn and it was one of the best burgers i have ever tasted.  friends of mine had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and the duck duck goose and they all said that their burgers were delicious!  combine the excellent burgers with the unique alcoholic shakes and trendy vibe and you get a great restaurant!", 
            "i went to hs&b christmas night. the cosmopolitan was extremely busy, and the atmosphere was electric. i was looking forward to a well made gourmet burger all day. hs&b did not disappoint. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> joint is located on the 2nd level, just take the escalator up and go left. we arrived for dinner @ 7 pm,  and were greeted by an attractive receptionist. she said their was no wait, to our surprise, and promptly led us to our table. our waiter (heavy eastern european accent), took our drink orders. i tried a microbrew of some sort (nondescript pale ale). boris explained the menu, and i settled on the hen burger. it was a burger with a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> and bacon. incredible! loved the meat and egg combination. i was told that the restaurant has an onsite butcher. fries were shoestring type and very tasty. we didn't order one of the alcoholic shakes, but the couple sitting next to us did, and it looked good. they even provide the extra shake in the metal container it is made in. i noticed that the manager was smart enough to hire young, pretty ladies and outfit them in short red dresses... well done good sir! nice touch! the tab for two w/o desert was $48 plus tip.  great night, great food, will definitely return.", 
            "this place is great! i wanted to review in 4.5 stars because i wish they would make the atmosphere a little more upscale (we're in cosmopolitan and i want a cosmopolitan-esque atmosphere) but then i suppose it wouldn't match the causal food they serve here. the waitress we had was super friendly, attentive, and very helpful when i was unsure what sort of drink i would like. we ended up having the bartender make a martini special for me and i liked it so much that i had two! the drinks here are great, food is phenomenal, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is possibly the best burger i have ever had. my husband enjoyed his meal also. we'll be back and we'll bring friends. they have huge ice cream (alcoholic) drinks that looks amazing. i couldn't see trying one after all that i had to eat here but another time i'd love to splurge and have one.", 
            "holsteins goes in my book for recommendations in las vegas.\ni stayed at the cosmo last weekend and decided to try this place out with a friend.  \nwe were seated very quickly even though they said the wait was around 10-15 minutes.  \ni ordered the korean \"bull\" gogi burger and was a little skeptical because it said it had a poached egg, and kimchi in it.  i actually don't like either of those but i thought this weekend was a good time to try something different.  \nit turned out delicious! it was a perfect/strange combination that really worked!  the spiciness of the kimchi is very mild but hits you at the end.  and the poached egg (i think it was poached?? or maybe it was sunnyside up? i don't know, i don't know eggs very well...lol) just went really well with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  i recommend everyone try that one!  \nit came with shoestring fries which was also perfect.\n\ni tried my friends duck fat fries but i didn't see anything special in them. \nbut i also tried her strawberry milkshake and that was so good! i don't think any other shakes will taste as good as that one.  \n\nmy only concern was their service.  when our waitress took our order, we must have waited 45 minutes before we even got our shake... our waitress even asked us like 30 minutes in if we ordered the shake.  when we said yes, she said it was coming right out.  liar. \ni was just a little irked because the people who sat next to us, came in after us and got their food before us! wtf? \n\nbut whatever, the food totally made up for it. =)\n\nall in all, great place! just needs to get their service upgraded.\n\n4 stars!", 
            "it all started with the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> which pretty much should be my tribal name from now on. hands down the best milkshake i have ever tasted in my life!!! it's malted banana gelato, peanut butter crisps, frangelico and priced at $11. whoever decided to start making alcoholic milkshakes should get a medal. genius. it is the perfect marriage of flavor without being to overpowered by <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>. \n\non to the grub. \nstarters: \nphilly cheez steak spring rolls with udder sauce $11 \nthey were alright, but could have used more seasoning. the meat was tender and the rolls were crisp. i did not enjoy the utter sauce which bares similarities to ketchup, but with more vinegar. \n\nfor the beef and fake beef selections we had: \n<mark>The Classic</mark> with two dollar cheddar (ridiculous) $15 \nurth burger with one dollar swiss $14 \nnew delhi chicken $14 \nall served with shoestring fries and that gross utter sauce. i ordered ranch, of course, and they turned out to be the winner of best potato in a supporting role to compliment the monkey shake. as far as <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> go my burger was ordered medium and came to me very well done. i ate one third of it. the bun was buttery and toasted to perfection and that two dollar cheddar was worth it. the veggie burger was probably my favorite of the three with a strong mushroom taste. pretty good. the chicken burger could have been executed better. the chicken lacked taste and the only saving grace was the apricot-date chutney on top. \n\noverall i will absolutely be back because the cosmopolitan is a good time and that shake has my heart and waistline captive. the menu has tons of creative options that intrigue me such as bull's balls, crispy pork belly bun and duck confit street tacos. i will get the tribe together and give it another go at it!", 
            "pleasantly surprised. i really liked this place... it was turning me on before the food just because its in the cosmopolitan and the hot pink menus. \n\nthe service was very friendly... creepy at times??? but they were awesome, prompt, and quick to everything. they kept us super satisfied. \n\nfor <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, i got the korean bull gogi... fun to say and fun to eat. it has a delicious, juicy patty, egg, kimchi, and a spicy mayo. disclaimer.... not a first date food. only for those who are in love and have no problem getting a little messy for your partner.... or if you're just going out with friends. besides the mess... wow its a good burger. the egg is left a little runny (i spilled it all over the table:[). the kim chi and the spicy mayo blended perfectly together. i ate the whole thing without regret. \n\nmy boy got <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with brisket on it.. i forget what it was called, but we didn't talk much during our meal because we were busy stuffing our faces. i looked up once after finishing my half, and his was gone! \n\nwe opted out on the shake, but we did get the \"candy store\" plate. it was pretty fun, but i prefer a bigger, more unified dessert. it had a mini dessert, and allowed your mouth to sample a variety of sweets. pineapple/coconut tapioca (mmm), custard donut with coffee/chocolate syrup for dipping, mystery fruit jellies, chocolate custard push-pop, a mini chocolate dipped ice cream cone with banana ice cream, and the most exciting nitrogen infused meringues. the waitress was sure to let us know you could blow smoke at your nose while eating them, \n\nthe dessert was fun and different, but i'm not sure i would recommend it for the price. \n\nmy experience at holstein's leaves me with the impression of being able to return... but only on occasion as it is kinda pricey.", 
            "<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were ok, not that great.\n\nthe service was horrible!!!! it was by far the worst service i have ever experienced! first, we got there and i had to ask twice for a water...ok no biggy, but the worsssst was when i got my burger and i kindly asked the waiter for an extra side of pickles- big mistake, he rolled his eyes at me!!! \n\nneedless to say, i love the cosmopolitan, but i will not be returning to holsteins again.", 
            "loved the pina colada shake, and korean bull gogi burger.\n\nhated the sweet potato and duck fat fries. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were too salty. the duck fat fries tasted like regular fries. i'd rather save my $4. it is quite pricy for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> already and $2 to upgrade for nasty fries is a no thanks for me. it is cute how the fries come in that small bin, but it suffocates all the fries and makes it soggy.\n\nalso, hated the service... maybe because we got there 30 mins before closing but w/e!", 
            "pretty cool restaurant that serves burgers and alcoholic milkshakes! the service was eh... the music they played was hiphop- clubbing type of music.\n\ni got the salmon burger which was pretty good. it had a slice of lox on top of the cooked salmon patty which made <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>! i upgraded to the duck fat fries which was a big mistake. their duck fat fries pretty much taste like regular fries. i think i would've been better off saving $2 and eating regular fries made by normal oil.", 
            "<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were good, but crazy over priced. your talking around $15 for just your burger. want cheese? that's extra. fries? those are extra, too. also, $8 milkshakes? seriously? not worth it, considering you can mosey on down to the buffet and get all you can eat shrimp and braised short ribs. plus, the place was trying way to hard to be hip.", 
            "i had high hopes for holsteins. i love a good burger, and shakes with booze...yes please!! \n\ni was there with a party of 12, and we were early for our 6pm reservation, but we were told we couldn't be seated until our entire party was there. not a problem, that's not unusual. by the time the majority of our party was there, they seated us. we were all ridiculously hungry, so were excited with the quick appearance of our servers. because of the size of our party, they split our table in half. they attempted to split the bill as well, but we asked it to be kept on one. we quickly ordered some appetizers and waited in anticipation. \n\nlobster corn dogs: good, but not great \n<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>: extremely tasty! \nlobster mac n cheese: i only had a small bite of this, but could have easily eaten a whole plateful! \nphilly steak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> (i think): ehhh \n\nso far so good...i was pleased with the appetizers, and ready for my burger! i kept it simple and ordered a classic cheeseburger, and it was great. i can't complain. i had it with steak fries which were also good. the overall consensus of the group was that the food was good. \n\nso why the 2 stars? while the food was good, maybe even great, the service was terrible. wait, i have to clarify, half of the table's service was terrible. while pete's side of the table got their food right away and with no problems, nicole's side of the table had several problems... \n\n1. <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> girl ordered a classic burger with cheddar cheese, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, bacon, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark> and no tomatoes. what she got was a cheeseburger with tomatoes, no onions, bacon or mushrooms. while i acknowledge this was not nicole's fault, because she read back the order correctly, so someone messed up in the kitchen...what upset me was that by the time she got the right order, the rest of us were almost done eating! and throughout the whole time nicole never came back to give us any kind of updates. \n\n2. someone else ordered a burger (i honestly can't remember which one) with brie and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>. when she got her burger and opened it up, the brie was mostly rind and barely any cheese, so she asked it to be sent back and just asked for cheddar instead. this also took a ridiculous amount of time. \n\n3. someone ordered a beer that never came \n\nduring this time another one of our party decided to say something to the manager, steve. as soon as we said something to him, he brought <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> out. he was very helpful and apologetic, but he messed up too. the second burger was supposed to have <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> and it didn't, we noticed this immediately so the one who ordered it let steve now, he immediately said \"oh no, there are <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> on there, i saw them put them on\" then in what seemed like a scene out of a movie or a cooking competition, she slowly lifted the bun to expose raw onions on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. obviously steve was left a little red in the face. to his credit, he did comp us those two meals, but the ordeal left the majority of us disappointed and upset. <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> girl couldn't even finish half of her burger because she had been so hungry she was left feeling sick and unable to eat. \n\nthe duck fat fries were disappointing, but the shoestring and steak fries were yummy, and i also enjoyed the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. \n\noh and the server (who's name i didn't catch) who was pouring drinks, then \"tying his shoes\" while we talked to the manager...you're not slick dude.  we know you were listening, probably hoping it wasn't you we were complaining about.\n\nwhat is most disappointing, is that the food is good enough for a return visit, but the service alone makes me not want to set foot in the place ever again.", 
            "strike 1: the hostess looked me up and down judgmentally the second i walked up, which felt really welcoming, except the exact opposite. strike 2: i accidentally ordered a bottled beer that turned out to be $16.50 each. my fault for assuming that we don't live in a world where any human pays that much for a bottle of beer. the beer in question costs $9.99 a six pack at whole foods. strike 3: although hubs and i ordered the same thing with no weird substitutions, one of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came with garlic aioli on the side and we had to cut into <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> to discern which was well done and which was medium.  for a $120 dinner i didnt expect to be so annoyed.  the quality of burger was all right; we both had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>. the steak fries were actually seasoned potato wedges. and they were...all right. hated the philly cheese steak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> (not a fan of anything involving cheez whiz). all in all,  i left bummed and whats even sadder, unsurprised. the cosmopolitan needs to hire capable people that care about their jobs, not these vapid robots that look great but can't even get a burger right.",

(i'll be the judge of that myself sir, lol).  well this burger was seriously a masterpiece in of itself.  kobe beef patty with a teri glaze, brought me back to punahou carnival days (if your from hawaii and know what im talking about), and on top of that you get the little shredded yam crispies adding color and a little bit of sweetness to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, nori furikake inside, with a generous piece of fried avocado, again giving another element of texture and creaminess to your bite.  then for the finale, the spicy mayo spread on the bun (like the kine you get with spicy tuna sushi), is like a ninja just hiding there as you gaze at all the other elements of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, waiting to make its presence known.  this my friend gives you that zing of heat (without being overpowering) that really brings all these flavors together, and for me this spicy mayo was the winnaz.  quite honestly one (if not the) best burger i've had the honor to come across in my life.  you also get your choice of bun (white or wheat).  both of which are quite tasty, as i got the white and the gf got the wheat, really can't go wrong with either.  they come with your choice of fries: shoestring or steak-cut.  i didn't want to copy the gf as i wanted the shoestring, so i convinced her to ask to upgrade to <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  they come in little mock fry-baskets which is a thumbs up for presentation.  for the taste of each of the fries, both were very good, would definitely recommend either in a heartbeat.  also they give you a nice amount of fries which is always great!\n\nprice:  ok so this is always <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> side of a vegas story, but honestly people it is vegas and yes $16-17 bucks for a designer burger is on the steep side for most people, but it is in my honest opinion worth it.\n\nverdict:  holsteins presents itself as a hip, modern burger/diner type joint in the heart of the new cosmopolitan hotel.  it's decor and atmosphere really mesh well with the feel of the hotel itself and the food it presents.  you really get what you pay for in my opinion, a great designer burger, one that you quite honestly could not find anywhere else.  in comparison, for $16-17 i would take it over blt's wagyu beef burger & max brenner's kobe burger any day for the same price range.  it's definitely a place to check out if you're in the moooood for some good burgers!\n\n(they are known for their shakes too, but we didnt get to try them as the idea of a shake first thing in the morning after a long night clubbing didn't quite fit the agenda, if you know what i mean)", 
            "it's hard to resist a restaurant that offers spiked shakes and gourmet burgers.  my friend june had been to holsteins on an earlier vegas trip and come back raving that it was the one restaurant she'd hit that she wanted to revisit.  i can't tell you how many times i stared drooling at the menu before we went for dinner.\n\nholsteins is in the new and beautiful cosmopolitan hotel, and it's right across from marquee.  we went and got stamped for the marquee before we checked in for dinner, and we ended up missing our reservation (held for fifteen minutes).  the staff was nice about it, though, and it turned out that seating, even for a party of seven, was not a problem.  holsteins is a swanky place, with comfortable booths and a giant pink cow on display.  we had a waiter named chaz, and he was friendly and on his game.\n\nthe drinks were everything i wanted and more.  the spiked milkshakes were absolutely delicious.  the frozen grasshopper came with peppermint meringue, chocolate crunchies, creme de menthe, and van gogh dutch chocolate vodka.  i can't imagine it was terribly boozy, but it was a fabulous milkshake, with full mint chocolate flavor and the perfect thickness.  the little meringue was delightful, and the crunchy chocolate bits added texture to every sip.  the brown cow was also fantastic, an adult <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float made with <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, vanilla ice cream, pop rocks, and charbay tahitian vanilla rum.  it had all the kid-pleasing taste of a great <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, and i can't overstate the fun of pop rocks.  i also tried the bloody mary, without ice cream, but with smirnoff infused with pepper and cilantro, combined with bloody mary mix and garnished with a toothpick bearing an olive and a cocktail shrimp.  i love a good bloody mary, and this was a good one.  it had a heavy spicy flavor but a thin clean texture, and i appreciate food in my drink when appropriate.\n\nour table split three appetizers, and that felt like the right amount.  the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> were easily my favorite, breaded and deep-fried dill spears, olives, and caper berries, served with small sides of prosciutto and salami and an herb-caper mayo for dipping.  these were magical.  the breading was flavorful, crispy, and light, and the pickles oozed their pickly flavor.  i would also recommend the bucket of <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark>, which came with a bleu cheese dip.  nothing fancy, but delicious.  i was disappointed, though, by the truffle lobster mac' n cheese.  the creamy tallegio-mascarpone sauce was more creamy than it was cheesy, making the appetizer more like a macaroni salad.  the maine lobster was barely there, and the black truffle didn't come through.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were very good, though i suspect that the strength may lie in the toppings.  <mark>The Classic</mark> - with just lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, ketchup, and pickles - was the most boring of the bunch, and that doesn't hold true with a remarkable patty.  the patties were definitely tasty, though, with plenty of juice, and they held up well to some fun accompaniments.  my favorite was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>.  with a kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado, it was definitely a loaded gimmick of a fusion burger - but damn if i didn't gobble it down.  the teriyaki was sweet but not cloying, and the salt of the speckles of dried seaweed was great.  the crispy yam gave a welcome crunch, and that strip of avocado tempura was creamy and beautiful.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was also good, a dry-aged beef sirloin burger topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli.  it was less of a stand-out, though, and the tomato confit did not bring on the umami parade i'd hoped for.  if you like lamb burgers, the big fat greek is a good choice.  with greek spiced lamb, feta cream, lettuce, tomato, tzatziki sauce, and red onion and olive relish, it's a little like a greek menu threw up on a burger.  the result, though, is hearty and pretty well done.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> all come with a side of fries, and you have a choice of shoestring, sweet potato, and steak cut.  i prefer my thin fries, and the shoestring and sweet potato were both superb.  holsteins knows its way around a potato - even the steak cut fries were well seasoned and not at all mushy.\n\nwhen we left for marquee we were all stuffed to the brim.  the meal was not cheap - burgers started at $13 and shakes were $11 - but it was a satisfying feast that hardly qualified as a splurge in vegas.  i've had better burgers, but i was impressed by <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, and i doubt i've had better milkshakes.  if you're in vegas hankering for a fattening meal, check holsteins out.", 
            "it's almost hard to believe that holstein's is run by the same people responsible for lbs at the red rock. i guess if i had to make an analogy, this place is like michael jackson (in terms of talent, not behavior or affinity for boys) whereas lbs is latoya (or maybe even janet) and the lbs patty wagon is tito.\n\nwhat that means, is this place rocks. the menu is more diverse and creative than it's sibling establishments with it's spiked milkshakes, apps, burgers, alternative dishes for non-burger folks, and an extensive beer list.\n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> ($16.50) is an amazing burger made out of a sizable kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake (yeah, i had to look up furikake to know what it was... i'm not ashamed to admit it), crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. the ingredients gave it a rich, sweet, unique flavor and the crispy yam bits a crunchy texture. if i have any complaint about this burger it's the height of it. the thick patty and huge slices of avocado make it difficult to get the whole thing in your mouth (didn't macauley culkin say the same thing to mj?).\n\nmy wife got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> ($17.50) - dry aged beef sirloin with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli. she loved it and only let me have one bite. if you want a more traditional burger, go for this. but, i still thought <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> was better.\n\neach burger came with an order of fries. so she got the regular fries and i got he steak cut fries. both were very good -- crispy exterior, light and soft interior.\n\nour son got the kid's chicken fingers and fries. that's always a winner with him. it came with 3 big tenders and some carrots and celery.\n\neven after those big burgers we still had room for dessert. our choice... lollipops. the chocolate brownie and strawberry were excellent. the lemon meringue and <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> were largely forgettable and uninspired and the blondie was bland and didn't come close to reminding me of a blondie brownie.\n\ndespite the lackluster dessert, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were so good i can overlook that misstep. we didn't have any issues with the service, especially the kitchen, which sent out the food surprisingly fast. i'm not sure if i'd say this is my favorite burger place, but it's definitely one of the top and one that shouldn't be missed.", 
            "stopped in twice on a recent 6 day vegas stay.  i was staying at aria, so the short walk to the cosmo was well worth it after happening upon this gem.  the first drop-in was for drinks and game 5, mavs v. heat.  the bar area was crowded and had a festive vibe.  bartenders were attentive and gave generous pours.  prices are in line w/ other joints on the strip.  second visit was for lunch with the wife.  our server stole the show.  as a local, he gave us a few tips and can't miss, under-the-radar places we might enjoy.  after perusing the beer menu and failing to make a selection, the server brought out a hard to find ne microbrew i'd never heard of.  it was a great recommendation.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was above average, but not the best i've eaten, but would order again.  i shall definitely return for the beer", 
            "so i had rad about this place on yelp and after reading the reviews i decided i would try it out. the food was good for the most part it was a party of seven and everyone had something different. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> where all just ok nothing special but i can say u do get a good size portion for what you pay for. ordered some appz. and they where ok the best out of the where the steak and cheese spring rolls will be going back for some more of those. next the chicken and waffles where bland at best and only came with one mini waffle. all the milk shakes where beeter than advertised although i didn't ft a chance to have one of my own all in all the place was jus ok nothing spectacular but i would go again for desserts and milk shakes. food is hit or miss depending on what u order. oh also turkey burger was on point for sure", 
            "i had a friend in town from reno and really wanted to take him out to somewhere \"vegas-y\" for dinner. i immediately thought that going to any of the places in the cosmopolitan would be a winner as i really like the casino.\n\nso, we arrived here on a sunday night and sat at the bar. after the bartender scrutinized my very real nevada driver's license for far too long, making me feel quite uncomfortable, we ordered two iced teas. i get the need to make sure you're serving people who are 21, and yes, i do realize i look young, but her examination of my dl made me feel awkward, especially considering we were at a hamburger joint... it's not like we were sitting down at the chandelier bar. \n\ni didn't feel like drinking at all because i just wanted to eat something tasty. i thought about getting one of the spiked milkshakes, but then after looking at the menu realized if i got a milkshake and a burger, my bill alone would be over $20. ugh. maybe i'm just a cheap-ass, i don't know, but these places in vegas with their ridiculous prices for things like hamburgers and milkshakes are just irritating to me.\n\nanyway - i had the hen house. i thought it was good. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is good quality. my friend had the new dehli chicken. he said it was good. but honestly we weren't raving over them or anything. i really expected to be awed or something and i really wasn't.\n\ni think there are better places for the \"better burger\"/expensive burger in las vegas. burger bar is one of them. i guess i'm just not impressed with their overly-creative burgers that come out on a plate looking minuscule and not worth how much you're paying for them. maybe i'm just over this fad in vegas where everything has to be totally different and weird. maybe i just want a burger and fries and that's it. maybe i'm just never going to be the person who thinks it is okay to charge $17 for a burger (no matter what is on it or what kind of beef it is made with).\n\noverall, i would go back if someone wanted to go there. i wouldn't vote against the place, but if i had the choice - i don't think i'd think about coming here because i absolutely loved the place and the food.",

            "holsteins is a place that we went to on a whim. all i knew was that i really wanted a burger so i couldn't think of better place to go than a place that specializes in burgers. the best part about this being a whim is that i went in having no expectations beforehand which is always great when experiencing something for the first time. \n\nat first impressions, the restaurant is nothing particularly special. in fact, i found the images of the animals labeled by their \"food parts\" a bit disturbing. the service was average. nothing to write home about. \n\ni ordered the fries and burger, nothing outrageous. as i mentioned previously, i just wanted a burger. \n\nthey started off by giving out a little bucket of popcorn. i loved that popcorn and i'm not a popcorn eater. it had an odd taste to it, but odd in a good way. also, it was buttery and i love popcorn that has a lot of butter. that's the problem with popcorn now-a-days...they don't put enough butter on it. \n\nshortly after that, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fries came out. someone else mentioned how the fries taste like the fries one can buy in a bag at <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and that is true. however, they taste like the good, expensive bag of fries that one can buy at <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> so i wasn't complaining. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was not bad. it was just okay. i've had better burgers.\n\nsomething cool though: apparently, the guy who played the brother on seinfeld was sitting at the table next to mine.  it wasn't a big deal to me since i don't watch the show, but my mother, who i was with at the time, was starstruck.",

            "so close but so far is all i can say of this new restaurant.  i went with a friend on opening night and everything was perfect; the meat was cooked to order, the toppings were flavorful and well proportioned, the bun was great, and i walked out of there claiming that it might have unseated burger bar as one of my favorites (more on burger bar in a future article).  the bacon, cheese, and garlic aioli all had great flavor, and didn't compete with each other.  i went back a second time a week later with the always negative writer of our sister site, <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> burger blog, and the meat was very overcooked.  again the toppings and bun were excellent, but the overcooked meat greatly took away from our experience and flavor.  we both agreed that if the meat was cooked medium-rare as ordered, it would have earned several more points.  being a restaurant that has a burger and shake theme, this is something that really should be right every time.\n\nbut as you know, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> isn't the only factor taken into consideration.  the fries need work.  the first time i ate there our waiter explained that we needed to get the shoestring fries because they were a clone of mcdonalds' fries, and they were.  they were really good, and maybe lacked some of the greasiness that coincide with the big chain's version.  the second time they seemed to be a bit different, and almost seemed to stray towards the lackluster fries of burger king after the great change.  the duck fat fries also seemed a bit better the first time than the second.  another great item were the 'loaded' shakes; mostly classic flavors and mixes with a good amount of alcohol in each one.  while they are a bit expensive, the few that i've tried have all been quite tasty.\n\ni managed to squeeze a third visit here in the midst of my busy schedule, and this time there were more problems.  first of all, we had a horrible wait for food; people sat after us, ate and left before any of our food arrived to our table.  the restaurant was severely understaffed for some convention that was in town that week.  while i understand that rushes do occur, some careful planning and a bit of coordination with the hotel management to see what kind of occupancies you'll have from week to week would be a good idea.  on top of our wait, i got steak fries instead of shoestring, which isn't a deal breaker, but when i'm supposed to be finding anything wrong with my meal this makes it easy.  like my first visit, the meat was cooked perfectly so this gives me hope that they might be back to their original form, even with a packed house. my asian themed burger had great flavor overall, and a little bit of a bite which was welcome.  it came topped with an over-easy egg that was cooked perfectly, and a glaze that had good flavor.\n\nall things considered, this restaurant has already brought me in for three separate visits so there is some merit to that.  but the inconsistencies from meal to meal, combined with the not-so-great service prevent me from bumping this burger to the next level.  it's definitely worth a first time visit, if not just to experience the cosmopolitan property and take in extreme vegas opulence.", 
            "we stayed at the cosmoplitan hotel and were pretty excited to have a this in our hotel.  the night we went, we placed a to--go order to take back to our room.  bad mistake!!!  we had about 5 of us, that ordered a variety of food... probably totalling over $200.  not only did it take about 40-minutes to get our order but most of the order was wrong.  i ordered potato chips w/ onion dip, a salad and a burger.  the potato chip order was sad... i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.  the salad, never happened... it was an order of pita chips and guacamole when i got back to my room.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>... i got the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.  i couldn't stomach the flavor and had to stop eating it after a few bites.  i seriously would have called to complain but i didnt have another 30-40 minutes for them to figure out a solution.  probably wouldn't ever come back here because the service was horrible this night and the food was not worth the money.",

(eyes rolling up a storm) there is a long waiting list, but because you just made a reservation i will put your name at the top of the list. but just to let you know, it might take 20 minutes or more to get you a table.\" i honestly have never encountered a more snotty, hostile, and unaccommodating hostess anywhere. it would serve holsteins well to hire hostesses with temperaments more appropriate for the position.\n\nhere is what we ordered:\n\nbam-boozled \"shakes\" all $11.00\n\n<mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>\nfrozen grasshopper\ncereal bowl\nblack cow\n\nthey were all fine...nothing special and not very boozey. fyi, the black cow is a float not a shake, despite the fact it is not marked as such.\n\nburgers:\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> $17.50 - \nlonghorn $16.00\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> $16.50\n\nall <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were cooked perfectly and they were tasty, but the toppings were very skimpy. i have indeed \"experienced better.\" they are served with fries...two of us chose shoestring fries and one upgraded to <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. sadly, both types of fries were mediocre at best. additionally we ordered the fried green tomatoes which were also mediocre.\n\nour server was fine, but not fantastic. the music was so loud we could barely hear the waitress or carry on a conversation. overall our experience was a less than stellar one. the experience with the snotty hostess put a taint on the evening and there was nothing that happened during the rest of our dinner that made up for it. there are way too many other restaurants in las vegas with bigger, better burgers and better service. i will not be returning, unless it is to punch the snotty hostess in the face (i kid! i kid!)",

            "found holsteins on yelp--and gave it a go for lunch!  i love burgers--and this place was pretty good. \n\nthe cosmopolitan hotel is an upscale establishment located in the new city center development.  we were staying at the belllagio, and the cosmpolitan was right next door.\n\nthe restaurant is located on the second floor.  it was a bit loud and chaotic when we got there--which is probably to be expected on a busy friday in vegas.\n\ni started with the cereal bowl--an incredible vanilla milkshake with vanilla vodka and captain crunch mixed in--awesome--though not super potent from an alcohol standpoint.\n\ni had the hen house burger--which is a burger with bacon and <mark>Fried Egg</mark> on top, and i added american cheese.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was fantastic, cooked to order, and served with seasoned steak fries which were a bit dull compared with the rest of the food (you can order shoestring fries instead).  as said in another review--the juiciness of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> definitely soaked <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> bun making it a bit unappetizing.\n\nfrom a service standpoint we were seated immediately, and then there was some confusion as one server took our drink order--which took about 10 minutes to fill, and another server then took over.   after that the server was quite attentive despite being very busy.\n\nthough not a cheap restaurant--holsteins was reasonably priced for this part of the strip.  the ambience was fun and bright, and i would definitely return for the shake!", 
            "i'm trying to be a fair reviewer but to be honest i came into here with high expectations due to two coworkers telling me it was great. i thought it was standard good burger. the meat was flavorful and moist and cooked medium rare like i asked, but the rest of my classic burger was unremarkable. i thought <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was a fair size but the delicious fries that came as a side disappeared so fast! it comes in a tiny cup that is around 4 oz. the service was really fast but almost too fast - we couldn't get anyone's attention when we wanted an extra plate and our salad was whisked away before we finished it. overall, a little disappointed but probably the best place for a burger in las vegas.", 
            "no wait for a table! hoooray!! the korean bull-gogi burger was pretty damn tasty! the bff and i split this burger and the waitress was kind enough to bring an extra plate without us even asking for one. we requested <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> be cooked medium and that's exactly what we got. the over easy egg was fried to perfection. as for the kimchee slaw... it wasn't spicy enough! maybe because the kalbi glaze overpowered the spices. the shoestring fries were sooooo yummy!!! all in all, we were both stuffed. thank goodness we didn't each order a dish. i'd def come back to try the other items on the menu.",

            "i make it a point to try all the fancy burger places that pop up in vegas.   \n\nholsteins is definitely one of the best.   i'd say <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are probably better then burger bar @ mandalay bay.  and i'd probably end up frequenting holsteins more then burger bar due to the cosmo being in a much better location on the strip.\n\ni got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> which is the sirloin burger with all the trimings.   i knew <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> wasn't going to disappoint after the first bite of the nicely toasted bun.  you cannot believe how many burger places fail to toast the buns correctly.  \n\nthe aged goat cheddar was a little too much though i think.   halfway into <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and the taste of the cheese was getting old.  it might have been better with just regular aged cheddar.    i did find that adding some horseradish to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was a nice compliment to the goat cheese.\n\nyou'd think a good burger would be easy to make but a lot of places fail.  you want to be able to taste <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> patty, the cheese, the bacon, and whatever else is on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> both distinctly and as a combination.  a lot of places make their burgers so you can only taste one or two of the ingredients.   holsteins does a good job of creating a \"complete\" burger experience  :)\n\nthe other main attraction of holsteins is the alcoholic shakes.  they were ok i guess,  none of the shakes really have much alcohol in them so to me these are basically just regular shakes.",

(no problem).  he chose shoestring fries for the side.  \n   i asked the waitress if the \"top chef\" happened to be there on a monday night?  (surely he would not be?)  she said she didn't know but would check.  next thing i know he's not only there but coming out of the kitchen to meet us!  what a delightful friendly guy!  and he informed us that he had hired craig from the same top chef series.  yep.  a little while later carlos came out with craig!  husband took my picture with both of them!  oh my gosh, i'm such a geek, but geez these guys worked their tails off on that show and i so respected them and appreciated them for it.  and now i was not only meeting them but eating their food!  this burger was the best burger i've ever had (sorry bobby flay, you've finally been surpassed).  and fortunately husband's shake made him so full he couldn't finish his half of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> so i got it.  (waitress later told us that it had five scoops of ice cream in it).\n    so, full, dessert was mentioned.  i said we were full but had heard about the donuts.  no they didn't serve them any more except with a particular drink.  i expressed sadness to not be able to try it.  next thing i know, here comes two donut holes, one for each of us, with a cream filling...maple and bacon.  yum yum yum.\n    thank you holsteins for our favorite dining experience on this trip to vegas!  excellent waitress (sorry i can't remember your name), thank you too and carlos and craig, please know you made our trip to vegas this time!",

            "i am debating between giving this place a 3 or a 4 star, but i am feeling generous given the outstanding service we received. \n\nthe food is just ok. i guess i was expecting an amazing hamburger and it was just very regular. i didn't enjoy the bun at all and felt the toppings were a bit lacking. i ordered the \"bull-gogi burger\" and was expecting a flavor explosion, but it just wasn't. just a little blander than i was expecting. still a pretty tasty burger cooked well, but nothing i'm dying to go back and try again. my black cow alcoholic float was pretty good, but honestly i think i would have preferred it without alcohol. the fries were so-so. i got the steak fries, but they were really more like wedges and i wasn't really a fan of the seasoning. i tried my fella's skinny fries and preferred them. \n\nit was my friend ryan b's birthday, so we received a free round of jell-o shots and a plethora of outrageous desserts that none of us had room to eat. i tried the carrot cake and the funnel cake and they left a lot to be desired. they just didn't pack the punch i had been hoping. there were interesting, but if you're going to be interesting at least try to make them tasty. the carrot cake was shaped like a carrot and was a super cute concept albeit somewhat phallic. it was paired with carrot ice cream, but i really wasn't feeling it. the funnel cakes were topped with ground up cereal, but i would have preferred a fruit or creamy topping.\n\nall in all, the service was amazing. our servers were friendly and very helpful. that alone raised their star-rating. as for the food, it's pretty standard. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was pretty good, maybe if i tried different toppings, it would be better.", 
            "burgers are played out.\n\nthere, i said it...  it seems like no matter what major city you are in, there's some strong competition on who has the best burger.  it isn't as if we see the same thing with who has the best beshbarmak (go ahead and look it up, edu-ma-cate yourselves), right?\n\nbut with that said, i must admit, i'm a bit of a burger fiend.  i do love me a good burger.  always medium rare, and i also tend to look for interesting topping combinations to see how creative the kitchen is.\n\nthis is where i've been going wrong all this time.\n\nyou see, something needs to be said and credit needs to be given to the places that honor <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> for what it is supposed to be.  a patty made of ground beef served between two slices of bread, usually in bun form.  toppings are typically added to compliment the meat and bread combination.  that's it.\n\nit is with that in mind that i have to say holstein's does a pretty mean burger.\n\ntheir meat is spectacular.  maybe the best beef patty out there.  assuming they use their namesake breed, i can tell you that the beef is very flavorful, and yet holds up in its patty form without being too greasy.\n\nwe split two orders with the notion of being able to taste a couple of their burgers.  both were quite nice, and had pretty simple toppings.  the bun is notable since it has a lovely glaze on it and holds up well to all the juices that come off the patty and toppings.  the meat, as noted before, is the star.  toppings, at least in our case, were more like condiments that complimented the beef rather than over powering the flavors.\n\nin a way, very simple, but done correctly.\n\nit also needs to be said that the frozen grasshopper is amazing.  imagine a shamrock shake with booze in it, except it still just tastes like a better version of the shamrock shake.  got it?  yep- it's really good...\n\nbeer selection is a'ight.  prices are a bit steep compared to many \"gourmet\" burger joints, but please remember where the hell you are.  does anything come at a \"reasonable\" price on the strip?  when you consider that fact, i'd say holstein's actually is a very reasonable place to grab a meal.", 
            "as a burger lover i was really excited to try this place out after having read all the great reviews.  we came a little after noon and were seated promptly, though it started filling up quite a bit after that.  i ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> burger with cheddar cheese and bacon and split the campfire s'mores milkshake with my dining companion.  the shake was delicious and the alcohol taste was very subtle which i did not mind.  it comes with some extra in a tin container and was more than enough for the two of us to share.  i was disappointed though that some of the other shakes i wanted to try were only seasonal.   \n\nas we were waiting i noticed popcorn being brought out to another table twice.  i had to ask for some after seeing that and our server acted surprised that none had been brought out.  hmm, wasn't it his job to do it or at least see to it that we got some and didn't he look at our table and see that we had none?  by the time our popcorn was brought out our burgers came out a minute later, so we didn't get to enjoy too much of the popcorn. \n\nwe were debating as to whether we should split a burger or get our own and in the end we each got our own because from what we could see they looked pretty small.  turned out we actually could have split one and it would have been enough for the two of us.  personally that would have been fine for me because i wasn't too thrilled with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and have definitely had better.  i usually do not mind pickles in my burger but theirs just did not taste good and i had to pick them out.  the other greens in my burger did not taste good either.  to top it all off i asked for my burger to be cooked well done and it came out pink inside.  my burger came with shoestring fries which were ok.  they were super skinny so at the end of the meal it looked like i hadn't even touched them.  \n\nif you are looking for a good burger and fries at the cosmopolitan i highly recommend <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> at commes ca, truly some of the best burgers and fries i've had and for about the same price as what you'd get at holstein's.  come to holstein's for the shakes, but just make sure they currently have the flavor you've been wanting to try.", 
            "yes, this place is located in one of the hottest hotels on the strip, and yes, holsteins atmosphere is equally as  hip. from the creatively named menu items, to the overly fake-eyelashed waitresses, holsteins really tries to grab your attention.\n\nas for the food and service at this place... meh. i had ordered the turkey burger and a side salad with dressing on the side. when i started eating my burger, i noticed that there was a small white square on my lettuce. the little white square was an expiration sticker that the chef had forgotten to take-off my lettuce leaf before sending the food out. the waitress was unapologetic, but the manager did come over to say he was sorry. once the food was re-prepared and delivered to my table, the chef had drenched my salad in dressing. i hate being 'one of those customers', but i had to send my salad back to the kitchen. again, no apology from the waitress.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself was just okay. there was nothing to write home about on the flavor of the meat, bun, or side salad. i've had better elsewhere.\n\nwhile i don't expect my meal to be comped, i did expect something more once i informed the waitress that there was a sticker on my food. nope, i paid full price for my disappointing meal.\n\nbeing a local in vegas, i have my pick of the litter when it comes to burger joints. holsteins is a place i don't believe i would visit again.",

            "aligned with what other yelpers have said the service was below par... the waitress sent out crappy vibes to us the entire night. our meal started off with her spilling water on one of our friends. mistakes happen, but what really pist me off was she didn't say sorry right away. her face had no remorse about the situation and she went to get towels to clean up. bah. then later she forgot to get our tables napkins and when she gave us waters she clanked the glass on the table real loud with attitude. talk about a debbie downer. i do not know what this chick's problem was but if i'm going to pay $20 for a burger i expect more. i will say that the manager handled the situation well after my friend spoke to him. he took off his burger and milkshake off our tab. \n\nwowee! the black pepper was so bomb and the meat was perfectly cooked. i love how the pepper gave <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> a kick to it. i also love that the bun was toasted and not soggy. the bun was also really fluffy in consistency. the shoestring fries were perfect. i stole some sips of milkshakes from my friends and the \"birthday cake\" was amazing. i would recommend sharing these milkshakes with a friend or you may get diabetes on the spot. \n\ni give this place a 4, but -1 * for the waitress with the bad 'tude.",

            "finally found a legit burger place in las vegas.\n\nthis past weekend was a early birfday celebratory weekend for my 23rd. for lunch, i decided to try out holsteins, which is located right outside marquee of cosmopolitan.  \n\nthe restaurant atmosphere and decor was wonderful. there is a bar area. lounge area with big chairs and couches. inside were tables and booths.\n\nfood: \nall <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> looked good. i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. fried avocado, a south asian sesame dressing with julienne carrots, spicy mayo, burger cooked medium. comes with steak wedges or shoestring fries but instead, $2 for sweet potato. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was great! perfect portion, and fried avocado did it for me. \n\nservice:\nservices could have been better with more attention on guests, quicker refill on water, and corrected orders. my friend's burger was cooked too well however, the server took it back and brought over a new one.  \n\noverall, i loved the atmosphere. i loved the food. and i loved the company. the price is a little pricey though. 15+", 
            "we came here as we were staying at the cosmopolitan.  this is a gourmet burger place.  i like their idea of selling shakes with alcohol. the wife had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> & turf mini burgers and i had a burger with kobe beef, potato chips and cheddar cheese (can't remember the name of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>). we also had the oreo shake with baileys and kettle chips with blue cheese and french onion dipping sauce.  <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> & turf wasn't very good as it had this tiny piece of lobster with beef tenderloin.  the kobe burger was good with a nice crunch from the potato chips but it feel short compared to other gourmet burgers i've had.  the oreo shake was good but had very little alcohol.  a beer would've been better with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> rather than the milk shake.  the potato chips were a good starter for our meal.  i'm glad we tried this place but not sure if we would come back.",

            "we dropped into this las vegas hot spot prior to going to a show to grab a quick bite and catch up on the sports news for the day.  for the latter you'll need to sit at the bar which is exactly what we did.  their beer and wine list is extensive as are the number of tap options at the bar.  i went for a bottled brew instead selecting one of my favorite tangerine ales instead of trying something new.\n\ntheir menu features appetizers, tiny buns which come two per order, big buns and milkshakes galore including a long list of boozed-up ones.  i was feeling a bit shaky, but my short supply of lactose intolerance tablets on myself made me put aside that idea of having the shakes for the night.  i stuck with my lost coast ale.\n\npork belly buns, mini lobster rolls and tiny chicago dogs seemed like popular picks in the tiny buns section, but i wanted something more substantial so i picked out the korean \"bull\"gogi burger from the big buns section.  this was a burger glazed in a sweet soy sauce, topped with kimchee slaw, slathered with chili mayo and topped off with a <mark>Fried Egg</mark>.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> come with seasoned skinny fries or steak fries.\n\ntheir kitchen works fast here as a short wait later we were already chowing down.  my burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p7pxqfqr7ybkmmi2j51udw?select=fbxxyjmoalx3nvotkqld-a) sat in a pool of glaze and it appeared the yolk on my <mark>Fried Egg</mark> was runny.  for a split second i considered picking up the knife and fork, but who doesn't eat with their hands while sitting at the bar?  on my first bite the yolk burst out of its egg white home and coated my face and fingers in hot yolky heaven.  there was no turning back at that point; i was going to finish this burger using my hands even if the entire thing fell apart.  it didn't by the way as the soft bun was one of the sturdiest i've ever held in my hand even soaked in with burger juices, sweet glaze and egg yolk.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself i'm thinking maybe a half pound of quality beef was cooked to a perfect medium and bursting with juice.  considering how many ingredients were added to this burger the beef really stood out as that was the main component i kept tasting.  the kimchee slaw was nice and crunchy, but the chili mayo really provided no kick to the overall flavor of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.\n\nmy seasoned steak fries while generous in portion size were a bit too salty for me.  i loved my burger though just as my friends loved their mini pork belly buns and mini hot dogs.", 
            "my bff and i recently stayed at the cosmo and visited holsteins twice. here's how it went for us:\n\nday one - bff had just finished running the las vegas rock 'n' roll marathon, so we were in no mood to be messing around. vegas was crazy-crowded, and we had no reservations, so we expected to wait quite some time. i was pleasantly surprised when our beeper went off after only 15 minutes.  i started with an absolut dirty martini (the best way to judge a decent bar), and it was very good!    then i ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> with blue cheese, and had no idea what type of fries to order. i panicked and went with steakcut.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was excellent; big, thick and juicy, with a bun that was just the right size and a good amount of cheese. the fries were good, but nothing spectacular.\n\nday two - bff and i both had some things on the menu that we wanted to try, so back we went.  absolut dirty martini? yes, and though it was a different bartender, it was again excellent. this time we were prepared for an appetizer, and agreed on the pizza twinkies out of sheer curiosity (and a mutual lifelong love of pizza).  they were a revelation; crispy bread surrounding melty cheese with a delicious tomato relish-type dip.  truly great.  then we both ordered a burger. i can't remember the name, but it was a thick burger between a layer of kettle chips and thousand island dressing. it was awesome. we ordered the shoestring fries and were again underwhelmed, so we ordered a side of <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. those. were. excellent.\n\nto summarize, i would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the vicinity. the only thing keeping me from awarding it 5 stars is that i found the service to be rather slow and indifferent. on both nights it took them quite awhile to check in with us once we were seated, and even longer to make sure we were ok once we had our food.", 
            "i loved <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> here.  yeah, it's a little pricey for a burger but it's on the strip.  with that in mind it is definitely a good place to grab a burger.  i had <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with chips on it because, who doesn't want chips on a burger?  the fries were great and i'm glad there are multiple choices.  this place has tons of beers, both on tap and in bottles, which is a plus.  i like choices.  we went here with about 8 other people and not one of them had anything bad to say about their burger.",

(the turkey burger sliders are also a snooze, skip 'em.)\n\nmy other beef (no pun intended) with this place is the volume. i appreciate that it's vegas and that people are there to par-tay, etc, but i'd like to eat my dinner without having to scream across the table. and this is in the dining room, not even in the lounge area, where it's seriously hearing-damage territory and the bass rumbles under your ass while you're trying to enjoy your sliders. it's just not my jam, so to speak.\n\ni can highly recommend the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, both of which are delectable and worth every penny. i like their wedge-cut fries, as well.  two of my friends have told me the <mark>Captain Hook</mark> salmon burger is also really good.  \n\nother high points: the decor is interesting and creative, and aside from this one lackluster server and the occasional snooty hostess, the staff is warm and welcoming. they menu has expanded as well and they've got a lot of interesting choices. they're great at their social media, too. love that.  \n\noverall, i do really like holstein's and am rather bummed to review it this way.a year ago, it would've been at least 4.",

            "wow.  one of the best burgers i've had in a very long time, and the overall meal was exceptional and reasonably priced.  went with a buddy of mine for a late lunch, expecting to pop in and out, but this was a meal worth savoring.  i got the lobster truffled mac & cheese to start, which was slightly runnier than i would have liked, due to what the waiter referred to as \"copious amounts of tellagio and mascarp<mark>One <mark>Two Dollar Cheese</mark></mark>\", but the dish was flavorful and solid.\n\nthe real treat however was <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  my friend and i both had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, his without the goat cheddar in favor of regular cheddar, and mine with.  they were both cooked perfectly, which is hard to do when you get an order for \"extremely rare, and i mean mooing\", but they nailed it.  they nailed my medium rare as well, and the combination of the tomato confit in place of standard tomato (simply brilliant idea, why have i not seen that done before?) and the strong cheese combined with a thick, juicy, perfectly prepared piece of bacon and garlic-chive aoili made it the first burger i haven't put ketchup on in i can't even remember how long, and i'm so glad i did.  ketchup would have destroyed this exquisitely crafted creation.\n\ndespite the raving, i considered giving this review 4 starts rather than 5 due to the consistency of the appetizer and the over-saltiness of the steak fries that came with my burger, but ultimately, those trivial details pale in comparison to the awesome that was that burger.  if you're in vegas, and you're looking for a meal that won't break your budget and will give you plenty to talk about, try out holsteins.  you will not be sorry.  also, if waitresses that are easy on the eyes are your thing, i suggest sitting at the bar and ordering from there.", 
            "this place was pretty, but our waitress was pretty rude. she barely came over to check on us and the place wasn't even that busy. whenever she spoke to us she wouldn't even look at us and that really pissed me off. but yeah <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were really good. \n\nwhat i didn't like was their advertised alcoholic shakes. me and my friend ordered two of those and we didn't taste any alcohol in it, i really don't think they had any. but i got the breakfast shake with capt'n crunch inside. was a good shake but wish it had any alcohol in it. \n\ni'd probably come back here in the future just for their burgers though.",

            "i have previously professed my vegas burger love for stripburger, but holstein's come in a very respectable second to my favorite burger spot on the strip, if only for the price.  holstein's is a fairly new face on the strip, but it has already far exceeded burger bar and blt burger, among the plethora of other mediocre upscale burger joints on the strip.  \n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are obviously top notch, and the creativity on some of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is really refreshing; more importantly, it's executed perfectly.  there isn't really much else that needs to be said about <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> at holstein's, aside from try as many as possible, because they are all good.  what separates holstein's from the ever growing crowd of burger spots is their appetizers.  the kimchi quesadillas, the philly cheese steak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark>, the incredible pork buns - there is no way to properly describe how good some of these appetizers are.  and the kicker, at least for me, is that they are different.  how many places, especially burger joints, serve kimchi quesadillas? as far as i can tell, not too many.  the incredible creativity that is seen in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> menu is also seen in the appetizers and the rest of the menu - and again, it's all executed flawlessly.  i personally am not a big drinker, but i have tried one of their alcohol infused shakes, and it was delicious as well.  \n\nthe service here is always great, but this place can get slammed in the evenings and the bar can get rather loud, especially if there is a big game on the tvs, so i would definitely recommend this as a lunch destination if possible.  \n\nbottom line: if you're looking to spend a bit of money for a good burger, holstein's should be your go to spot from here on out.", 
            "i've been looking forward to trying holstein's since reading an article on their unique and exceptional desserts. i finally got there last night, and boy was i excited. i'd read positive reviews and food suggestions earlier in the day so i knew exactly what i wanted. to my surprise, it was dinnertime on friday and we got seated right away. there were several open tables, but the hostess seated us at one of the smallest tables in the restaurant...and the top of it wobbled when we moved our arms. my husband ordered a $6 <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> and i got the $11 cereal bowl shake. my husband's glass was dirty and he asked to exchange it with a clean one...no apology, but at least the 2nd glass was clean. my shake was good, but i couldn't taste the flavored vodka at all. i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger medium-well and my husband got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> medium-rare, both with steakfries. when <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> arrived, they looked delicious, but not nearly as \"pretty\" as in the photos in the gallery on their website. i tried a crispy fry first and burned the roof of my mouth...those little metal pails must really hold in the heat!? both of our burgers were tasty, but came overcooked. and my beef patty was a lot thinner than i anticipated. i think <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are called \"big buns\" because the bun's bigger than <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fixin's! the waitress brought our bill without asking if we wanted dessert...the main reason why i wanted to try the place! i told her we wanted to order the candy store, and she said, \"oh, since you ordered the shake, i just figured you wouldn't want dessert too. most people don't get both.\" it might've been all the cool piggy artwork surrounding me, but that was a bit offensive and made me feel like a lil' piggy! the dessert was the best part of the meal...especially the shooters on <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>. it was fun eating cotton candy in a restaurant! it was adorable! but i wouldn't say their handmade candies are worth $15. i probably won't return to holstein's after dropping $81 at the mediocre burger joint with fun desserts. atmosphere was fun and artwork was amazing!

            "every time i try to come here, the wait is always ridiculous.  i never remember to make reservations either cause, well, it's a burger place!  finally, this past weekend around 2pm, after a somewhat \"short\" wait of 40 minutes, i got to try holsteins.\n\nit actually took the 4 of us awhile to look through the menu, and in the end, i went with the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, which is a burger with dry aged beef sirloin burger, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli.  i ordered it medium rare and came with a nice pink middle.  what really caught my attention about the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was the dry aged beef, since dry aging beef condenses the beef flavor, and wow that burger was juicy.  out of all 4 burgers, mine was the only one that had juices dripping down my fingers, even versus the kobe beef burgers!\n\nthe toppings were all great, especially the aged goat cheddar.  you can tell it's a little different than your normal cheddar.  the garlic-chive aioli has a mellow garlic taste.  besides hoping the bacon was a little bit crispier, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> is really a burger that's up there in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> world.  it's just a very tasty burger and i can see why it is so popular!\n\ni also tried a bit of <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, as well as the korean bull-gogi.  <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> is more of an asian fusion burger, with teriyaki glaze and a tempura avocado that sits on top of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  it also has a kobe beef patty, so the whole burger had this velvety smooth texture thanks to the fatty patty and the smooth creamy avocado!  i would like a bit more teriyaki sauce though.\n\nas for the korean bull-gogi burger, the patty is marinated to give it extra flavor.  the best part is definitely the <mark>Fried Egg</mark> that sits on top.  who can resist the egg yolk just running all over the kimchi slaw and the beef patty??\n\nout of all the fries, i liked the steak cut fries the most.  crunchy exterior with a creamy potato center.  <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were great as well.  the shoestring fries were a little stale to me.\n\nnow, with shakes as part of its name, we knew we had to try a few of their shakes and ended up getting the black cow float and the frozen grasshopper.  black cow float is a fun and somewhat nostalgic shake since it is more like a coke flat with the ice cream rather than a true shake.  it even comes with pop rocks!  the frozen grasshopper is a must for any mint chocolate fans.  smooth creamy minty frozen goodness.  for both shakes, we could taste the alcohol but it was pretty well masked!\n\nthey also have a bunch of beers on draft.  <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> triple karmeliet is a good one!\n\nprice-wise, it is pricey.  our burgers were around $18, with shakes at $11.  the price should reflect great service but i found the service a bit lacking.  our waitress only came to check on us twice and it took awhile to get her attention for the check as well.\n\nafter our meal, i can see why so many people like <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> at holsteins.  can't wait till the next time to try our other burgers!", 
            "yummy! came here on a sunday afternoon before driving back to the oc and waited for half an hour - which is definitely a loooong time when you're hung over! we ordered the lobster mac and cheese, <mark>Ahi Sliders</mark>, and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> side up egg. everything was delicious!!!!\n\nif we weren't hung over, we would have tried the shakes with alcohol in them. next time...", 
            "kinda on the fence, but for now i will give 3 stars. came here on a saturday afternoon and the second floor was packed with people waiting to get in marquee dayclub. so right away i was put off by the drunk and obnoxious, fist pumpers. now i know that has nothing to do with the restaurant but i think the commotion rubbed off on our hostess because she had a slight attitude. we were seated fairly quickly, and i was hoping that it wouldn't be so loud inside the restaurant.....i was wrong. it was so loud i truly couldn't talk to people sitting next to me. frustrating. onto the food....for starters we ordered the lobster mac & cheese, pretty tasty, would order again, perfect amount of flavor and not too salty. <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>, i liked the pickles themselves, but wasn't a fan of the herb-caper mayo, would've been better with ranch. i split the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, ordered medium well, they actually got the medium well perfect which i appreciate, i couldn't decide if i loved <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. i don't like meat on meat (i.e bacon on my burger) but the description of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> sounded delicious, so i don't know if it was the goat cheese or the aioli dressing that threw me off. i was too full to try the milk shakes, unfortunately. \n\ndon't know if i would come back, i am still a bachi burger fan.", 
            "loved it!  i had the long horn burger, steak cut fries, and a shake for dinner.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was cooked perfectly (medium).  burger had sliced bbq smoked brisket, and coleslaw on it.... ridiculous!  no complaints on service either.  definitely going back.", 
            "update 8/20: here's a message i received from ashley r., who i suspect to be an employee of holsteins. i've censored the expletive from the note.\n\n\"it's cause ur asian and u won't tip good even if u got good service, so f--- off\"\n\nsomething management and potential customers should be well aware of and perhaps provide miss ashley with an english course. cause = a person or thing that gives rise to an action, phenomenon, or condition\n\n\n\n\nhorrible horrible horrible service!!\n\ni had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger which was excellent even though overpriced but i can not give this place more than 1 star due to the horrible service.\n\nafter sitting down our server took about 5 minutes to come greet us, which is understandable being it was busy. in a rush, we had our order ready and she walked away with our order. 10 minutes go by and we are not yet served our drinks. finally our drinks come and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> hits the table. but, we didn't have our silverware yet! so the food runner brought us silverware since our waitress was no where to be found. during our meal the waitress never came to check if our burger was good. not once! \n\nafter we were finished eating we sat around for about 10-15 minutes waiting with empty water glasses to ask for the check. our waitress was no where to be found!  we asked the host to grab our waitress for the check and we saw him walk over to the center of the restaurant to look for her. another 10 minutes go by and he couldn't find her. at this point, i walked up to the bar and asked if i could pay my bill there but unfortunately i couldn't. \n\nanother 10 minutes go by and we see the host finally find our waitress. she drops the check off after 5 minutes and i hand it right back to her with a card. we watch her go take a drink order from another table and come back with the drinks for that table.. but, she didn't have our check ready! another 5 minutes go by and the waitress is no where to be seen. at this point we are extremely frustrated and demand to see a manager. after speaking with the manager, she brings us the check and does not even apologize. \n\nall in all the experience took over an hour and we only saw our server twice. once to take our order and another after we requested our check through the host. will never visit this place again.", 
            "holsteins was on my list during my last trip to vegas and we didn't end up going, so this was at the top of my list this time around. we had a party of 8 during friday night at around 10 p.m., and ended up splitting into two tables of 4 because it was packed. the two musts here are their burgers and shakes. the bf and i split <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger, which was really good. i also had a bite of <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> which was great as well (think burger with an asian twist). their patty is really juicy and most importantly, cooked to a perfect medium rare. since we were sharing <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, we decided to get the truffled mac n cheese with lobster, which was piping hot and delicious. i wasn't sure about the lone potato chip on the side though.\n\nwe ordered a couple of milkshakes: brown cow float, oreo, <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>, and <mark>Campfire Smores</mark>. my favorite was the oreo. the brown cow had chocolate pop rocks which made it very unique. it's pricey at ~$11 but they do give you a cup and a half, which makes it feel like a little better deal. \n\nholsteins ranks right under father's office in la in my book.", 
            "this place is basically a burger club inside the cosmo, and i convinced my friends to stop by here after a recommendation from monica c. i think i didn't enjoy it as much because i was pretty full from my fat tuesday, but it was a pretty cool experience. the ambiance is great, although it is pretty loud inside. \n\nthe wait was about 20 minutes on a friday night. i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, which was a teriyaki burger with avocado and i think fried onions. it was pretty good, but i didn't get a \"burgasm.\" i liked the shoestring fries. i only ate about half <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, which was reasonably sized but still not worth 20 bucks. shakes are around $13 but looked pretty good. for the most expensive burger i have ever had in my life, i don't think it was worth it but for some people i guess its a value deal in vegas!", 
            "**** 4.5 stars ****\n\none of the great miracles of las vegas is that you can eat like a fatty fat fat all day every day and still go to pools surrounded by gorgeous plastic-pumped women and sing nonsense like \"sexy and i know it\", regardless of any absence of truth to that assertion. holsteins provides the perfect venue for stuffing your face on delicious patties of top quality beef while also getting an eye full of the local ladies. unbeknownst to me at the time, the same chef is behind this as public house, where i had dined the night before, and his love of squeezing his employees into clothing that might be mistaken for a table cloth was much more prominent here than there. the d\\u00e9cor here is also just dope. i love the slightly sick toons on the walls, and there are homage to pigs and cows all around. if you look at most of the complaints here it's from people who didn't actually order a burger, so i suggest you take those reviews for what they are, and don't make the same mistake.\n\nbut, since it's vegas, you will still stuff your face to the maximum in front of this beautiful bevy, knowing that you're helping to pay for their salary so that they can go to the pool tomorrow and pretend guys like you don't exist (until you buy them a pitcher of margaritas, then you're superstar hero of the next couple minutes, congrats). brian and i both took the luxury route on the menu here, although i passed on the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> with kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo, because i've already had half a dozen burgers like this across america and they all taste roughly the same...rich and oily. it was honestly more difficult passing up <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, a truly unique combination of kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado...super intriguing, and if i had been dining with someone i was dating i likely would have tried to persuade them in that direction. somehow i managed to also resist ordering a decadent milkshake, perhaps because we were eating dinner just 4 hours after we had managed to roll out of bed for lunch.\n\ni finally wound up deciding on the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, a dry aged beef sirloin patty topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and a garlic-chive aioli...nothing too crazy, but lots of big, bold, wonderful flavors, and at $18 the most expensive burger not topped with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>. the result was pretty fantastic, definitely one of the better burgers i've had lately, and came with a monstrous basket of nicely done <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (for a supplemental charge). my biggest complaint, which is kind of random, is that they skewer <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with their own stupid little logo stick to keep the bun on for presentation, which has the resulting effect of causing huge gobs of mayo or sauce to squirt from the hole in the top every time you take a bite. eating these burgers is a mess, to be sure, especially when you add on a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> as i do, but if you're like me you've already realized you're not taking one of the voluptuous vixens home (although my reason is probably different than yours) so you've resigned your face to more indulgent pleasures, like egg yolk, garlic aioli, and hamburger grease.\n\njust make sure to thoroughly wash your beard, or your own lady might catch on...and get jealous.", 
            "located on the 2nd floor of the cosmopolitan, i brought a friend from out of town to check out this joint known for high end burgers and boozy milkshakes.  the restaurant space has a good mix of seats at the bar, low tables with comfy couches, and standard booths/chairs.  music is pumping and artwork on the walls definitely add a cool vibe, but it's not overwhelming where one can't enjoy good conversation amongst close friends.\n\nas for the menu, there is quite the impressive beverage selection including a wide array of international/domestic beers, wines, cocktails, and unique sodas.  my friend and i were definitely in the mood to pair some burgers with their signature shakes and i got the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> (with reese's, banana, malt, and frangelico) whereas my friend ordered the creamsicle float (whipped cream smirnoff,  orange sherbet, ibc cream soda, and orange bubble sugar).  my biggest fear was that the alcohol component would actually distract one's enjoyment of the milkshake, but unexpectedly the problem ended up being the complete opposite in that neither of us tasted nor felt any effects of any trace of alcohol in our shakes (i.e. neither one of us had our trademark asian flush go into effect).  perhaps the holstein's staff has figured out some magic ratio/technique to eliminate both the taste and effect of alcohol in their shakes, but a little of both would serve to go a long way especially if one is paying double digit dollars.\n\nas for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, we opted to split the crowd favorite <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> consists of dry aged sirloin with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli, but my taste buds felt like they were in charlie brown's classroom in that all the ingredients were rendered a slur of incomprehensibility by the overpowering goat cheese.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, on the other hand, did a much better job showcasing its melange of ingredients consisting of pepper-crusted beef, housemade creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>,  and swiss cheese.  taste buds were dancing their way upstairs to marquee on this one.  for every burger, one has the choice of shoestring fries or the thick steak fries (which resemble seasoned potato wedges) so one will not go wrong depending on personal preference.  \n\noverall, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>  do not come cheap (ranging from $14-28) nor do the milkshakes ($11) but to paraphrase vincent vega from pulp fiction,  \"that's a pretty f*cking good milkshake/burger. i don't know if it's worth (insert some double digit number) dollars but it's pretty f*cking good.\"", 
            "this place is now my must-go place for burgers. it's very reasonably priced for a delicious burger. very comfortable booths with cute cartoon cows all around the restaurant. \n\ni love love love their shoestring fries! they're so fresh and crispy, slightly salted, not too oily! okay, i might be a bit biased, since i'm not a fan of wedge fries, but seriously, try the shoestring fries once, please!\n\nso far i've tried their <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (kobe beef with tangy teriyaki sauce) and their big fat greek (lamb with feta). i was extremely happy with every bite of <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. i was too full to finish <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> in one sitting. but i think that's just because i stuffed my stomach with like 2 long islands and a beer. very juicy patty, i asked for medium rare, it came out medium rare. sauce was a bit overwhelming. their sauce is very strong in taste, i guess i should have ordered it light on the sauce. but hey, that was my first time. big fat greek wasn't too impressive, i should have stayed with the beef patties. it's not too gamey, so if lamb is not your thing because of that aroma, maybe give this one a try, it's not as strong (which is why i didn't like it as much, i love that aroma). it may not look like a giant burger, but all that feta cheese and yummy meat and other stuff inside kept me very full. i was so close in not finishing my plate again.\n\nif you check in here on foursquare, you can get a free house beer or house margarita. i prefer their beer. it's not the best, but their hef is tolerable. i tried their house margarita, and all i tasted was syrup. i can't complain too much, it was free. my server offered a to-go cup for my beer when i had half a burger and 3/4 pint of beer left. so nice of her :) only in vegas where you can take your beer to go.", 
            "<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was great. the sweet potatoe fries good could have used something else to stand out. great selection of draft beers along with a list of bottled beers. and the shakes awesome. must do if your in vegas", 
            "okay so once again i'm going to disagree with my fellow yelp reviewers and say that i was not wowed by my meal at holsteins shakes and buns, and i think there are better burger places in vegas. holsteins is located at the cosmopolitan hotel and casino directly across the entrance to the marquee pool and day club. because of the location you will need to have a reservation or be prepared to wait with the diva's and meat sticks that frequent the place.  we did have a reservation and were seated on time. the decor at holsteins is eighties cool. cartoon artwork dots the walls, boom boxes are painted in bright colors and a huge pink cow welcomes you in the bar area. after looking over the menu, my wife simone ordered the meatball parm sliders and i ordered the nom-<mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> topped with melted cheese, potato chips and house made thousand island dressing. the food came out fairly quickly, and on the side i had some tasty crunchy potato stick thin <mark>French Fries</mark>. my burger however was overcooked ( ordered medium and got well done). an overcooked burger made with fresh ground meat ends up tasting like sawdust, and this was the case. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> could have been saved by the dressing, but there was very little of the dressing on it. the chips on top were the best part of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. medium thin hand cut and fried perfectly, they stayed crispy on the sandwich and gave a nice contrast to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, but overall this burger sounded better then it tasted. simone's sliders were the exact opposite of my burger. the meatballs had great garlicky flavor, they were moist, tender and tasted fresh. they were topped with a mixture of sweet marinara and basil pesto and lots of melted creamy mozzarella. i so wanted to steal them from her and i had total meat envy.  we finished off the meal with a reese pb adult shake spiked with frangelico called the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>.  any monkey that could get drunk off this would have to be a lightweight because i could taste no alcohol in it whatsoever. it was still good, once again just not as good as advertised.  so in the end i would have given holsteins a 2 star rating for my food however simone's sliders choice saved the day...so overall holsteins gets a three stars from me.", 
            "so after all the hype about how great this place is, i finally tried it.\n\nthese type of restaurants are usually my favorite.  i love great burgers, and anything spun off in the form of an upscale burger joint.\n\nthe appetizer, which was chicken queso with chips that was pretty nice.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> i ordered was perfectly cooked and the beef was great, but the bun was a really weird consistency, not crispy/toasted, and not soft.  it was kinda like a soft bagel.  too tough for a burger with a lot of toppings, and everything wanted to slide out of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  \n\nthe lettuce on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was like butter lettuce or something really soft and not crisp, and had a bitterness not adding to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.\n\nalso the steak fries are a misnomer, they are actually wedges, there is a big difference.\n\nnot a remarkable restaurant of this type, i would much rather go to le burger brasserie in the paris, blt burgers in the mirage, or <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> bar in the mandalay shops.\n\nthe ambience was nothing special either.\n\ngo to the hidden/secret pizza place upstairs from this for a better meal in a cooler place.",

            "i'm a bit of a burger connoisseur, and as i've written several times on yelp: i don't consider a burger to be great because of the toppings -- that is icing on the cake -- but because of the quality of the meat and the charbroiled taste. if it doesn't taste like a burger off of backyard charcoal grill, i am not going to rate <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> too highly.\n\nthis burger delivered. i had <mark>The Classic</mark>, though i wish i had chosen the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> for the toppings. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was large in portion, served on a perfect bun, and tasted like a charcoal grilled burger with excellent meat quality. \n\ni chose the shoe string fries to accompany my burger. they were ok, but next time i'd choose the other fries. they appeared more fresh and well seasoned. \n\nthe beer selection, both bottle and draft, includes some of the best regional and craft beers from around the country. any restaurant or bar with a cider is impressive to me, and i enjoyed the sin cider here. \n\nthe atmosphere is trendy, the service was friendly, the prices were reasonable ($14.99 for burger and fries), and the quality was just right.",

            "this swanky burger joint is located right across the nightclub marquee's entrance inside the cosmopolitan hotel. from the artwork on the wall that reminds me of oldskool 90's taggers to the loud hip music blaring through the speakers, holstein 's is hard to miss. we made it there around 7:30pm on a saturday night and the wait was no more than 20 minutes for our party of four. when your pager starts buzzing and you report to the host at the door, you're ushered to the next host in the middle of place, which that person will walk you over to your table. the place is vibrant, loud, and hip. just like in a nyc subway train, you have everything from skirts to suits to shorts & flip flops occupying this restaurant.\n \nmany items on the menu sound appealing including their numerous $11 alcoholic shakes. we ordered the frozen grasshopper: peppermint, chocolate, cr\\u00e8me de menthe, van gogh chocolate vodka. if you love them little minty & crunchy chocolate balls, then this shake is right up your alley. there's plenty of it, a bit overwhelming actually but some people like it that way. that distinct alcohol taste is barely noticed. we also got the oreo with bailey's irish cream. this is what i considered a \"safe\" shake to order. if you enjoy oreos (who doesn't?) then this is a solid route to go. again, the taste of alcohol isn't really prevalent. warning, if you have issues with dairy then you may want to stay away from the shakes here. i really don't but it did activate.... uhh nevermind.\n \nseems like <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> $17 is quite popular from many of the reviews and sure enough someone on our table ordered it. kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake not to be mistaken by bukake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado. seriously, what is there not to like about that set up? if it was truly an asian inspired burger, then a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> would finish the job. you can add it though for a buck more. i was a little sad that i didn't order this burger for myself but my buddy was kind enough to give me a slice of heaven.\n \ni ended up with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> $17.5: beef patty crusted with black pepper, holstein's creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>, swiss cheese. oh you fancy huh? because it sure did sound fancy. although <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was good, my mind was set on <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> as the unanimous winner this night. the pepper was probably what i remember most about this burger. i did finish it but i most likely wouldn't care to order it again.\n \nthe maine lobster roll $16.5: fresh cooked lobster tossed in chive aioli in a grilled mini hot dog bun with cole slaw. the price is steep, the portion is crazy bite sized, but the taste landed a mike tyson uppercut. why oh why do you tease us like that holstein 's? gimme more!\n \nthe steak cut fries and the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were decent but can be better.\n \noverall, holstein 's should be visited at least once and from there you can determine if you want to be a regular. the meal was quite enjoyable but i'm not sure if it left an uber lasting effect on my appetite glands. i can probably live with or without it. for sure, give it a shot. on fridays, saturdays, and mondays, they are opened beyond their normal hours, midnight to 2am. however, their full menu isn't available but rather a separate and shorter late night menu. check out the art work on the walls, i want one for my place!",

(i highly recommend doing this, especially at a place like holsteins where their menus are endless) \n\nfor milkshakes, we were able to try the basic strawberry and the alcohol infused grasshopper.  i would definitely recommend trying at least one of the specialty alcohol milkshake.  the grasshopper was definitely a hit among my friends.  unfortunately for those who love tasting the danger in drinks, the alcohol amount is very light and you'll enjoy the unique mixture of sweet tastes rather than the intoxication.  \n\nlike how the past reviewers mentioned, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are a bit on the expensive side.  each burger meal does come with a pint size-like bucket of fries but it's not worth puffing your stomach if you're planning to squeeze into a dress 2 hours later.   i ordered the crispy pork belly bun under their \"tiny buns\" section.  loved it.  go for any appetizer items for your meal.  the size was more than enough.  my friends were eyeing my meal the most and i was the only one without a burger.  \n\nwith burgers, the \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" is a must.  kobe beef drizzled with nori furikake and crispy yam in between? yeah you want that.", 
            "who would have thought i could really crave for a burger? i had been wanting to try this new burger place in the cosmopolitan for some time. i didn't get a chance to the weekend before but this past week, i did. after marquee day club, my friends and i headed over and waited about 25 minutes. when we got seated the server quickly came and took our order for drinks. for all you light weight alcoholic girls, this is the place to drink. the milkshakes are alcoholic but only contains 1 oz of alcohol. for many, that's way too less. but for me, give me my peaches n' creme! i'll be trying all the flavors, don't you worry. tasted no alcohol at all. but i love the fact of knowing i'm drinking in vegas, still. :) \n\ni got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger. it was a huge patty with some tempura pieces and avocado. avocado always makes <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> better. they gave options for shoestring fries or steak cut fries. uhh.. shoestrings fries of course. i absolutely love shoestrings fries of all fries. on top of that, i also ordered the holsteins cobb salad. i have to make sure to keep my food light if i'm going to all these pool parties, you know. i like the cobb. i'm not sure why people don't think it's worth it. i did note that the avocado slices were not ripe. \n\nwe had decent service. could have been better because they don't come around and check up on you much. we actually waved down our waitress a couple times. but, it was a busy afternoon. the food was good and convenient being right across from marquee on the 2nd floor. it's pricey but gourmet burgers are always double digits so it was expected.",

            "went to cosmo to watch polica rock out at <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> pool last night (buy their album! review w/in a review).   i always like to try out a new restaurant in whatever casino i'm seeing a concert in (or in the case of the cosmo i include aria's options).   since i splurged a little with julian serrano a few weeks back, i thought we should take it easier on our bank accounts with holsteins.  this wasn't seen as a downgrade in my eyes too much because i'd been wanting to try their <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger ever since i'd read john curtas praise it as (one of?) the best in las vegas.\n\ngiven the fact that one of their signature milkshakes would probably cause me death due to my lactose intolerance (and not a quick, lethal injection/firing squad death which might make it worth it, but more of a slow, chinese water torture/buried alive death) i passed on those, though they sure sounded delicious.  i instead opted for my usual jack and coke which was an acceptable version, but not as strong as i normally prefer.\n\nfor food we skipped appetizers because the majority seemed fried or slathered with cheese and or some sort of ranch dressing (i know, it's a burger joint) and i just didn't feel like i needed any of that before i gorged on a giant burger and fries along with the whole slow death sentence thing.  i ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> with no altering of the standard fixings cooked medium, and shoestring fries on the side.\n\nshortly thereafter <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> arrived and looked delectable and consisted of a dry aged sirloin patty, nice <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese (goat cheese tends to sit easier with my intolerance in case nosy minds were inquiring), tomato confit (i had to google confit to remind myself what it was.   i already forgot.  roasted?), and arugula and some garlic aioli.   <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was perfectly cooked, and i really enjoyed every bite of it.   i do think that there might have been too many flavors going on which took away from the quality of the beef.  i'm not sure it really needs the aioli or maybe it needs less, and the cheese tasted really nice, but i felt like it may have overpowered the whole thing a little.  i'm being very nitpicky as it was a tasty burger as sam jackson would say, but all in all i still prefer almost any i've had at bachi or fuku burger and they are more reasonably priced.   the fries were very average and had zero qualities worth mentioning here which was a bit of a disappointment.   service was friendly and responsive for the entire meal, if not a little robotic seeming at times.  i can live with that for an $80 dinner and drinks for 2 at the casino where the table minimums are my monthly salary.",

(mind you i had the pager held up to the hostess desk... and my beer in my other hand) the first words out of her mouth, so directly were, \"i'm sorry! no outside drinks in here\". that tripped me out and i told her about the pager chirping... \"well, it will light up when it's ready\". i was like, ya i knew that i decided she can go f herself, i'll just wait a bit more. \n\nso ok. we were paged, checked in, asked to meet the hostess down in the middle... she was a little more personable. so we sat, and sat... well it was longer than it should have been. got our popcorn :d, my beer, her coke, waitress was pretty nice... told me <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger i just placed my order for was the house favorite (thanks yelp!). it wasn't until she checked in on us, and at which i inquired about the plate i ordered when she got all defensive. i'm sorry, but i just couldn't recall if my burger had a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> on it or not. thanks to all the photos on yelp! excuse me if i got confused. she proceeded to say things like, \"well did you order one?\", \"did you want one?\" as i explained this to her, she just kind of gave me the stink eye and walked away. that is why you didn't receive a tip missy. sorry if that ruined your day.\n\nbut with that said, the hostesses walking around acting like they were directing air traffic with their little radios and smug looks on their face... holsteins, food maybe be packed full of flavor, possibly a little under portioned, you need to give your staff a lesson in attitude... \n\nwhen we visit vegas, we drop money, lots of it. i don't care if your trendy or haute... service is what bring the clients back.",

            "holsteins is a fun place to feed your face. everything about it is whimsical and brash -- the food, the decor, the service -- but in a good way.\n\ni had the korean bull-golgi burger, which is made with soy marinated beef and is topped with kimchee slaw, chili mayo, and a kalbi glaze. it's a mix of sweet, salty, and spicy, but what brings it all together is the runny <mark>Fried Egg</mark>. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is a knockout -- like a taekwondo kick to your tastebuds!\n\nnot one to skip the opportunity to get liquored up, i also had the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> shake. i couldn't really taste the vodka (a good thing perhaps) but the shake was really delicious. it made me feel like a kid again ... an alcoholic kid.", 
            "i want to give this place a better review since it's at my favorite spot on the trip - the cosmopolitan.  the thing is...<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was not very good.  my wife and i split the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> (kobe beef, potato chips, thousand island dressing) thinking it would be something we couldn't find somewhere else.  the beef patty was overcooked and did not seem to be seasoned.  the potato chips were a nice touch and appeared to be made in house.  the hamburger was simply lacking flavor.  i'll say that we enjoyed the <mark>French Fries</mark> that came with the hamburger (and all hamburgers at holsteins.)  the beer selection was admirable and allowed me to an ipa that i've not had before.  too bad for you that i can't remember the name.  overall, i think that i'd go back because i got the feeling that they could do better.  casual, relatively affordable and average from most angles.  a safe bet if you are already in the cosmopolitan, but not worth a special trip.", 
            "i am giving this place 3.5 stars. the service was weird from the start. we had a party of five, and they made us wait 10 minutes when the restaurant only had about 5 tables full. we sat down, were handed menus, and our waiter never came by for another 10 minutes. one of us had to ask someone for water, and ask for a waiter. the waiter also took forever to come back to take our orders.\n\nfrom there, it seemed like he tried to redeem himself the entire time. we finally ordered. i had the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> for $28. it was a kobe beef patty with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, onions, frisee, and truffle mayo. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was really good and filling. i only ate half. it came with a  side of fries and i mistakenly chose the shoestring fries. the steak fries were much better. oh yea, the waiter bought us buckets of fries while we waited for our food to try to suck up to us. it came with a house made ketchup that was really good. \n\nmy friend's burger was sent back to the kitchen twice. he asked for a well done patty, and it came out super rare that it bled all over the plate. second, they forgot the <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>.\n\nlastly, the waiter called the manager over to give us free dessert of liquid nitrogen meringues. \n\noverall, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fries were fine, but the service was weird.", 
            "well, just a few days ago i learned that holsteins prepares a damn fine burger--and a superior chocolate shake!  after being escorted to a comfortable corner booth, we began with complimentary freshly popped popcorn.  it was unnecessary but good.  \n\nnext came juicy <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> with a really good caper mayo dressing.  a hot and crisp outer shell encased a scorching hot but very tasty pickle interior that truly satisfied after the breaded spears were dipped in the mellow mayo.  meanwhile, i had a hard time deciding whether i preferred the delicious chocolate milk shake with chocolate syrup or the thick and sweet whipped cream that took up one-fourth of the drink's height.  i even lamented to diane that it was too bad that there wasn't more liquid in the shake until she reminded me that the silver canister set down on the table with the shake contained still more chocolatey fluid (about a quarter of a tall glassful).  and, so it did!    \n\nthen <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fries arrived.  for me, a classic with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, onions, and ketchup was medium rare as ordered, and happily contained no visible char.  there was an excellent grilled taste to the meat, and although the plain bun and solid sheet of green lettuce were not my favorites, there was no question that this was a top-tier burger, and i had no problem finishing off the ample half-pounder, along with the tasty shoestring fries that accompanied it.\n\nmeanwhile, diane clearly enjoyed her medium-rare <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> with kobe beef and cheddar cheese, as well as fulfilling fat fries.  our server was slow in executing what he promised, but was busy with a mostly full house and eventually came through with water refills, extra ketchup, and a salt shaker as hard driving music enveloped the cow-adorned dining room. \n\nit was a nice, filling, and satisfying dinner, which i expect to repeat despite the next day's uptick on the home scale.", 
            "admittedly, i would have given this place four stars due to the sheer exorbitant prices if it weren't for the amazing, if not the best, burgers i have had in my 26 years of life. and believe me, i've had my fair share of burgers. okay - enough about the rave and onto the food:  i must start with the free starter popcorn, which was perfectly salted and just the right amount of butter so good that i had to ask for second!\n\nfor appetizer, we ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and turf quesadillas, which has a combination of broiled steak and lobster that complements surprisingly well topped off with manchego cheese to give it a rich texture to go along with avocado cream that leaves a rather refreshing after taste\n\nfor main course, i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger (a must have based on other yelpers' validations) and the steak fries as a side. the juicy kobe beef spread with the teriyaki glaze just burst with flavor, but not too salty as it is matched with a slightly sweet addition from the cripsy yam. at the same time, the spicy mayo and tempura avocada adds a tantalizing kick to the already delicious burger all on its own. i also added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> which just kicks it up another notch. the steak fries that came with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> just left me speechless as i could not even taste the grease but had so much crisp and flavor that left me licking the seasoning off of my thumbs \n\nall in all, what more can you ask for than a perfect burger and a beer in a chilling afternoon at vegas? i would have liked to try truffle lobster mac n cheese but there just was not enough stomach to fit it all or time on the agenda to come back for round 2. definitely a 5 star unforgettable experience - super winning!", 
            "i hate to compare any burger i've ever eaten in my life to my all time favorite umami burger, but given the price you pay at holsteins i figured it'd at least come close to it. unfortunately, my first experience here was quite disappointing. i yelped holstein's shakes and buns & decided to give it a try after seeing it was given 4 stars. \n\nwe came here on <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> of halloween weekend & were glad that the wait wasn't that long. our waitress kindly informed us about their \"special\" shakes (which i thought was unique to their establishment). i ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, which our waitress said they were most famous for. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> looked really good, but as i bit into <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, i quickly realized that the patty was very bland. they had cooked it the way i wanted, but there was just no flavor whatsoever in the patty. my appetite disappeared soon after as i found it hard to even eat the <mark>French Fries</mark>. our waitress seemed to have disappeared for a while as well. \n\nperhaps my taste buds were off that day from all the drinking the two nights before, but my meal just wasn't appetizing to me. based on my first try here at holsteins, i don't believe that they deserve the 4 stars. i am, however willing to give them another try & order something that would better appeal to my taste. i'm hoping after that, i could also consider this fine establishment a 4 star restaurant.", 
            "ok so to start of the place is nicely designed and very hip. this is the only reason i even chose to give it a star.  the menu is sharp and creative.  holstein's is a burger bar and restaurant but are best known for their extensive list of alcoholic milkshakes which at $15+ each are tasty but a little hard to swallow.\n\nwe had 4 people for dinner, the total was $160 and it was to say the least, one of the worse burgers i have ever eaten...ever.\n\ni started off and had a milk shake which was good, a little hard to swallow at $12 but at least it tasted good. we ordered the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> $28 kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, truffle mayo and the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger   $17.5 dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli.\ni told our slightly slow server several time make sure <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are meidum-rare.  \n\nafter a 40 minute wait time, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> arrived, and they looked amazing.   i took my first bite and was unpleasantly surprised by the rapid sizzle of the skin on the roof of my mouth. slightly alarmed by the burning feeling i removed the bun to see what was going on.  the entire roof of my mouth was burned on a quarter size piece of foie-gras in my burger.  apparently no one bothered to consider learning how to prepare foie-gras before apply for a job at holsteins and instead fried the hell out of it in a pan.  my rather nicely sized $30 burger had a piece of foie-gras on it that was the size of a quarter and burned.  \n\nwhat i received was far from a medium-rare burger.  the greasy, oily and hard to swallow burger was far from delicious and even further away from edible.  i asked the server if this was a joke and showed him the inside of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> i had taken one bite of.   confused and surprised, he apologized and said he will be back. after waiting for 10 minutes he returned and apologized mentioning that the \"size of fie-gras varies in each burger\"  ....the question is by how much?  \n\nin an effort to make the most out of this horrible ordeal, i ordered a piece of foie-gras to place on my burger and requested they don't fry the hell out of it.  the server told me that it would be $20 extra which i told him was clearly not a problem. it arrived 20 minutes later once <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was cold.  once again it arrived burned to a brown color and tasted almost as bad as my now cold and tasteless $30 burger. \n\nto be fair the place is very cute and well designed, the staff is polite but slow and poorly trained. \n\n the service is sub fast-food quality.  our server was slow and didn't take orders very well.   \n\noverall, i would never go back and have holstein's again unless it was for a $15 milk shake which was good but sadly not good enough.", 
            "one of the best burgers i've ever tried.  first of all, this restaurant is usually packed, so prepare for a wait.  second, the decor is adorable!  the cartoon cow graces their windows and in the wall paintings, which creates a fun and relaxed environment.  they have interesting gourmet burgers and sliders and spiked milkshakes!  \n\nmy favorite was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger - kobe beef with tempura avocado, teriyaki glaze, and sprinkles of furikake.  so many different flavors and textures that worked together.  i also tried <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark>, with portabello mushrooms, aioli, and truffle oil, but it was too much goodness in one that it was overwhelming.  the flavors were too similar and heavy, especially the two thick pieces of gruyere cheese.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> come with a side of either skinny or steak fries.  i recommend the steak fries because their skinny fries are too crispy and almost chip-like.  \n\ndon't forget to try their shakes and malts!  i wanted to try their spiked shakes, but got grossed out thinking about alcohol from the night before, so i got a simple vanilla malt, which was thick, creamy and fatty.  yum!", 
            "i was looking for something open late at night around 11:30 and this was one of the only places open that looked decent.  i ordered <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> here which was a little hard to eat because it was messy the way they made it, but it was good.  the shake here was average.", 
            "worth it for the billion dollar burger!  \n\nmy yelp friend nelson f. recommended this place to me for the foie burger, and man, it did not disappoint!  my date is a massive foie lover so of course he opted for extra foie.  it made a delicious creamy compliment to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is usually $28 and was $40 with the extra foie.  \n\ni had the korean hot dogs and we split an order of the maine lobster roll.  neither was particularly impressive - the lobster roll was the salad kind, which i don't like.  the korean hot dogs were adorable but nothing spectacular.  \n\nwith that being said, however, the foie burger was amazing, the service was attentive and friendly, and i loved the adorable vibe inside.  i'll definitely return next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "love the atmosphere. a little cartoony but definitely not anime. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were rich and juicy and the malt shake was a meal in itself. i definitely will be coming back for sure. located right in the cosmopolitan.",

            "what's not to like about great burgers and even better shakes (especially when you can get them with alcohol in them). holsteins is located in the cosmopolitan hotel and just like the hotel has quite the vibe to it. there is open seating in the bar area but if you get there early enough you can get a seat in the dining area. \n\ntypically when i have friends in town, we seem to end up at holsteins (either because they want to try it or they are staying at the cosmopolitan hotel). either way, it's a great way to enjoy some pretty good burgers (but be prepared to spend a bit of money as the prices are definitely not that inexpensive).\n\nthere is definitely a large selection of alcoholic beverages that you can choose from, but i definitely recommend the adult shakes that they have. between my friends and i we tried the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>, oreo, and cereal bowl (tastes just like captain crunch). for burgers, we've tried quite a few of the different burgers - <mark>The Classic</mark>, the longhorn (with beef brisket as well), <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (asian flavors with teriyaki sauce), <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> (with assorted mushrooms), the el machete (with an anaheim chili - sounds spicy, but it really is not, it's good, but it could use some more spice), and of course, the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> (kobe beef patty with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>). the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> is what a lot of people like to try (especially those from california that can't get their <mark>Foie Gras</mark> anymore. you can also add a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to your burger (which i recommend) - just to make it even more tasty with another layer of flavor.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> also come with either shoestring or steak cut fries. i have ordered a side salad (to try and be a little healthier - although not by much since we were indulging in a burger), and was disappointed that they charged $2 extra dollars for <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> of a side salad over the fries (and it wasn't even a large salad). i guess next time i'll just indulge in the fries.\n\noverall, a great place to hang out with your friends, get some good burgers and have a lot of drinks. i'd definitely recommend enjoying the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> at least once.", 
            "i've been in la too long. i've missed gambling and people who smoke indoors. so, during a much-needed trip to las vegas, i decided to stop in to holsteins to see how these alcohol-infused milkshakes and gourmet burgers compare to the ones in the city of angels.\n\nafter winding my way through the cosmopolitan hotel past the chandelier bar, i spotted the decorative pink-and-white plastic cow emblazoned with the holsteins logo. at the restaurant, you have the option of sitting at the bar, in the dining area or in the lounge up front, which is composed of some low-riding couches and decorative cartoon tables. i opted to sit in the more traditional dining room because i felt like the seriousness with which i was ready to eat could not be done in a reclining position.\n\nthe cocktail menu is awfully impressive, but i knew that i wanted to try one of the alcoholic milkshakes because, obviously. i chose the tiramisu milkshake, and, my goodness, it was good. the milkshakes are all $11, but at least they give you the fancy glass as well as the tin container filled with the remaining shake. the tiramisu shake is made with mascarpone ice cream, ladyfinger cookie crumbs, patron caf\\u00e9, chocolate syrup, cocoa powder and espresso beans. the shake was thick, chocolatey, liquory and delicious. it was the perfect dessert.\n\ni also ordered a <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger ($17.50), which is a burger topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic-chive aioli. my main complaint about the menu is that half of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> listed aren't really burgers -- they're fish, fowl or veggie patties, which is totally uninteresting to me. so, as for actual beef patties, there aren't too many to choose from.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> i ordered was still great. it was cooked medium-rare when i requested medium, but i really don't care too much unless i catch salmonella and die. the patty was flavorful. the toppings were pretty good (especially the aioli and cheese), but were not anything that would be my first choice in burger toppers. i was delighted that <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was so sizable and filling, and it even came with a side of delicious, crunchy, salty shoestring fries.\n\nthe waitress was fantastic. she helped us navigate the menu and was patient with our indecision, and she was also very friendly and stayed to shoot the breeze with us for a while, which made the whole experience a lot more fun and personable. both the shakes and burgers were brought out quickly, which i appreciated very much because i could not wait another moment to dive into this restaurant's offerings.\n\nthe meal was expensive, but everything was delectable. you won't be hungry again for a good long while after dining at holsteins.\n\nthey even let us take our alcohol in to-go cups so we could finish drinking while we walked around. i could have cried. oh, how i've missed nevada, the land free from open container laws.",

            "i came here on a saturday morning. the service was excellent. i sat at the bar by myself, and the brunette-long-hair bartender seemed to know how tough it is for a girl to sit by herself. so she was extremely sweet and helpful to me. she was chilled, but you know that she is very serious about customer service. yes, in addition, anybody who calls me sweetie is automatically considered to give good service in my book!\n        however, the food and the drinks were not on par with the good service. i ordered two cocktails: upside down pineapple birthday cake and tropical splash. the drinks were beautiful but weak. i know that it was in the morning and kind of early to get buzzed, but i am in vegas so what? \n         for food, i ordered the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>. i really love...the name of this burger. yes, paying $28.00 to supposedly eat like a billionaire. why not? another reason is that it kind of feeds my delusion of wealth. i love every single ingredient listed for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>: kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, truffle mayo, caramelized onion, but i do not love <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> together. it felt as it needs some kind of sauce to bring it together, just a suggestion. \n         overall, i would come back here for the atmosphere and the service. but the drinks and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were absolutely not the best.",

(i would bet that the other choices on the menu are just as good!)  i asked for mine as rare as they could make it and they did that to perfection. \nwe didn't have room for dessert, so we ordered it anyway!  the 'cow pie', recommended by our server, was actually a small chocolate cake sitting on marshmallow and a crisp graham cracker, sort of like a super-s'more.  easily shared by two people, it satisfied the chocolate craving i had, at least for that day!\non top of the good food, the service was friendly and helpful, the bar is cool and you are surrounded by the beautiful cosmopolitan hotel, so what's not to like?  \ntip: if you are parking in the garage take the east side garage elevator to the top and you are right there!",

            "we stopped by holsteins for dinner hoping that it would be a more casual and faster dining experience than some of the other options in the area. maybe i haven't looked hard enough, but there are very few fast casual dining options near the city center that don't involve sandwiches or hot dogs. \n\nanyway, it was a tuesday night. even though place was pretty dead, service was spotty. our server wasn't super friendly, but she got the job done. our food came out pretty quickly. \n\ni ordered the urth burger, which is their vegan burger. it was fine. the patty was thick and moist. my only complaint is that <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself was a bit dry. it was supposed to come with avocado, but there was only a light green schmear on one of the buns. \n\n<mark>The Fat Boy</mark> ordered the traditional burger. he seemed to love it. he pretty much devoured the whole thing. \n\nboth the orders came with fries. he got the natural cut fries and i ordered the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. when the fries first came out, there were cold and soggy. we sent them back to the kitchen and got a new batch. \n\nhis natural cut fries were way better than the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. my <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were cut too thin, so most of the fries were overcooked and burnt. \n\nprices are typical of places in vegas. for our two burgers and a shake, we spent nearly $40, not including tip. \n\nif this place were back in austin, i'd probably never go again, but since it's vegas, i guess it gets a pass.", 
            "i have passed this place so many times and had read all the great reviews and was super excited when i finally made it on my last vegas trip!!! however, i was kind of disappointed. my friend who doesn't write reviews however is a hugeeeee foodie was disappointed too.\n\nwe tried the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>, <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, truffle lobster mac n cheese, <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> and the complimentary seasoned popcorn. at the end of the meal the only items we enjoyed most was the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, fries and the popcorn. the seasoning on the popcorn is really good. we wanted to asked for more. hehe. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> aren't worth the price and i've had better in la (i.e. fathers office). \n\nsorry holsteins, you were worth a try.", 
            "looks to be just your standard restaurant, but inside are things that make you go mmm. \n\nhen house burger is phenomenal. simple concept of adding an egg to a burger, we've seen it before but holstein's does it right. expect to make a mess with this one.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with a peppered patty, steak sauce - and other perfectly combined ingredients - was mind-blowing too.  i couldn't make a decision to which burger was best. each time i had one bite of one and then the other, i said \"this one is best!\".  they were both that good. and the fries were equally as good - some crispy, some soft - great flavor. <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> and i agree this place is on our list of top 5 burgers (probably top 3 for me!).  \n\ncaptain crunch shake with vodka ... if you like captain crunch you'll love this! i wanted to try it based on the waitress's recommendation. no regrets, but i'll go with something that has chocolate in it next time - and there will be a next time.\n\nalcoholic beverages are stiff, service was quick (but also, i went pretty late), and the waitress was down to earth.", 
            "my primary goal in going to this restaurant was to have a place to take my four kids that they would enjoy and that also served great food. \n\nmy kids were happy but at the end i was wanting more.  when you are first seated you are given a bucket of popcorn.  the seasoning on it was amazing, full of flavor.  the corn they delivered us that night was a little on the burnt side.  \n\nthe meal arrived and while <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was good, the fries were just ordinary.  i know you can upgrade your fries, i would suggest this if you go.  i ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, no complaints, but i have had better.    my kids ordered the chicken fingers and mini burgers off of the kids menu.  they were all overcooked, chicken fingers were burnt on the ends, hard and dark brown.  mimi burger was too over done for my 6 year old.  \n\nthe most amazing part of the meal was the shake which is the only reason this restaurant got three stars instead of two.  we ordered the s'mores shake without alcohol.  the marshmallow on top of the shake was worth the trip alone.  the whipped cream on the shake was equally amazing. \n\nif you were anywhere except las vegas this would be way too expensive a meal for a hamburger and shake.  however, the high cost is just paying the rent at the trendy cosmopolitan hotel.\n\ni would most definitely go back for a shake, but would pass on the rest of the meal.",

            "with the caveat that i didn't have a burger the two times i was here (but tried a number of apps and shakes), this place is typical for an eatery at a big vegas hotel - adequate, never a bad meal, but you will never be blown away in any fashion (my humble person opinion - every meal in vegas at a high end hotel is basically just a facsimile of the better version you can get at the restaurant's socal or ny location).\n\ni came here twice on a recent bachelor party.  once for milkshakes, and once for apps before our flight home.  the (boozy) milkshakes were very good.  i had the \"<mark>The Fat Boy</mark>\" (uv candy bar vodka, reese's, pretzels, sprinkles, chocolate-caramel popcorn).  a friend had the vegan maple pecan shake (almond milk 'ice cream', jack daniel's, spiced pecans, maple caramel sauce).  both were delicious, although if you are really in the mood for something sweet and creamy, the <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark> probably won't hit the spot (the sort of \"earthy\" taste of the maple and almonds doesn't give you the same satisfaction as real ice cream).  <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> was barely detectable, however (i would've liked at least just a little taste, to know i was drinking something alcoholic).\n\nthe next day we came back for <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, chicken fingers, <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark>, and surf and turf quesadillas.  i had a bloody mary, which was good, but after three days of drinking, the shrimp on top was not appetizing.  the apps were all meh - not bad, but not great.  i was expecting something more from the \"southern fried\" chicken fingers, but they basically tasted like something i could get from roy rogers.  dip was good, but again, didn't really taste fresh made or have that \"pop\" i was expecting when i read the menu description.\n\nwe sat in the front every time we came here, so i can't comment on the rear seating area, but i will say this - there is incredibly loud music with a heavy bass beat that is just not palatable.  \n\nall told, try the shakes.  maybe try <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> (can't comment directly, but i wouldn't be optimistic based on the other food).  apps are basically tgi friday's quality.",

            "pretty good place located in the cosmopolitan for a great tasting burger. while i don't believe it's at the same level as burgr by gordon ramsey in planet hollywood, they still offer delicious burgers and shakes, nonetheless, and should definitely be given a shot!\n\nthe place -\nas i mentioned, holstein's is located in the cosmopolitan and is centrally located with everything else. it's fairly easy to find and doesn't require a great deal of navigation. casino's in vegas can tend to be very large and trying to find a restaurant within one is a challenge within itself, but holstein's wasn't too hard to spot. at first glance, the place itself looks like a glorified cafe as the restaurant is very open in terms of people on the outside of the restaurant being able to look in. the decor is pretty modern, the bar is a pretty good size, and there's also, what seemed to be an impromptu, lounge area right in front of the bar for people to come in, sit on couches and socialize while still being able to enjoy the menu and the drinks. the lounge being right in front of the bar didn't look all that comfortable and appealing; however, with the right group of people and the right amount of drinks, i'm sure it would be fine for most haha. because i sat at the bar, i didn't get a chance to see the rest of the restaurant; however, the kitchen looks to be exposed so that people can look in on the action going on at the back of the house and, as a customer, that's always interesting and nice to see. not too bad, holstein's.\n**** 4/5 stars ****\n\nthe service -\ni was in vegas for a conference and i came to holstein's right after the last session ended, which was around 5:00pm or so on a thursday. there, unfortunately, was no hostess to greet me; however, i chalk that up to them being particularly busy and probably running around. no biggie on my end as i was gonna end up sitting at the bar anyways, which i did; however, if i was a party hoping to get a table, having no hostess at the front would certainly make me question. i found an open seat at the bar and immediately by one of the most friendliest faces i've seen during my visit in vegas. she was entertaining, down to earth, willing to talk with everyone at the bar, and wasn't afraid to razzle folks to try and get them to smile, which i didn't mind at all. the great service continued throughout with her making sure i was taken care of and when she had to leave for the day she made every effort to make sure i was ok and gave the next bartender updates on all her guests, which is always nice to see rather than someone leaving the next person in the dark. great service, holstein's and shout out to bridgot for making my trip to holstein's wonderful!!\n***** 5/5 stars *****\n\nthe food -\njust like any other of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> joints located in vegas, there are many different options to choose from. each burger has its own signature ingredient and level of appeal for everyone. with that being said, it'll be pretty difficult for someone to not find a burger that sounds delicious as there are many different burgers to indulge in. i settled for the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> (see picture) and decided to have that served with some <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> instead of fries. first, the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. definitely not the best <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> i've had in my life as you can probably tell they just came from a bag in the freezer; however, it got the job done and satisfied my craving for them. the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>, which is kobe beef, cheddar cheese, 1000 island dressing, and potato chips (yes...potato chips....don't lie and say you never put potato chips in your cold cut sandwiches as a kid....i don't care who you are, everyone did that and you would swear it was the best thing ever! haha). <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was perfectly cooked, the cheddar cheese and 1000 island dressing gave it that zest and creaminess it needed and then finally, the homemade potato chips, as it did in cold cut sandwiches, gave that textural difference and crunchiness that we always desire in our food. the only gripe i have about the potato chips is that there was no flavor to them, it was literally just there for the crunch, i wish they would've seasoned them with something to make it pop more. other than that, i was fairly satisfied with my selection. good job, holstein's.\n**** 4/5 stars ****\n\noverall -\nlike i said, after comparing <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> that i've had from burgr to holstein's, i would definitely choose burgr; however, if you happen to be in the cosmo and the mood for having a burger strikes you, this place can definitely deliver. i look forward to coming back and trying out the other options like the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, but all in all, not too shabby holstein's! thanks!", 
            "i was impressed with my dinner and experience at holsteins. first, our server \"chaz\" was very good at his job. when he first came to greet us he simply introduced himself and said he would be back with some water - it annoys me when you are barely sat down when the server asks if there is anything to get started...uh, yeah, some time to look at the menu perhaps.\nfor burgers they offer tiny buns (sliders) and big buns (a much more substantial burger). <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is quite large - i would probably order the slider style on a return visit - keep your hunger level in mind when ordering. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself (memphis burger)was very tasty and prepared perfectly. the fries were also perfectly prepared and they do give you a pretty large quantity. i did not try one of their \"adult\" shakes\nthe atmosphere is open and modern with plenty of tv's around if you want to watch a game.", 
            "first of all, this is a great place to eat at while in vegas! service was fast and patient since we wanted time to look at the menu. i ended up getting <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger with a <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> shake. oh man!! <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was good and would definitely recommend it, but the shake was great!", 
            "i'm honestly not even sure where to start with this one. \n\nthe highest quality ingredients, matched together impeccably, and served in a gorgeous restaurant at a luxe spot on the las vegas strip with art by a fantastic local artist. perfection!\n\ni got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> - to think of what i experienced with each bite brings tears to my eyes, it was beautiful! i also experienced the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> (a must have), country fried bacon and the pork buns. bring friends, split the appetizers and spring for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. you won't regret it. \n\nfinish things off with one of their amazing shakes - i had the tira misu, and i will absolutely be back for another. \n\nthe staff are uber friendly and definitely knowledgeable. the prices aren't in n out burger, but they aren't strip steak, either. right in the middle where they should be. the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger was $17.95 and worth double that. \n\nwe'll be back, holsteins. oh yes, we will be back.", 
            "came here on a whim because my friends wanted drinks and food. \nwe must of been really lucky because there was no wait and we were seated right away. \nmy girlfriend and i each ordered a lemon drop, my boyfriend ordered a light ale which he really enjoyed. we also got the holstein burger and a side of <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was less than average (dry and flavorless)  but the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> stole the show. they were a little but salty but in our drunken state, they were perfect! \n\nnext time i'm at cosmopolitan, i would love to come back and try some of their shakes and gourmet burgers out.", 
            "best burger i've ever had, and i've had a lot of burgers.  i had a kobe beef burger with potato chips (on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>) and thousand island on a perfect bun.  cannot wait to go back.", 
            "i love that amongst all the hoity toity spots at the cosmo, there's a laidback burger joint.  don't get me wrong, my dirty martini still cost $20, but it's a nice casual spot to grab a bite if you don't feel like having a waiter set the napkin on your lap and you want to be able to watch sports at the bar without feeling like a jerk towards your date.\n\nour group of 7 showed up on a saturday night, expecting a crazy house and a long wait because they don't take resos on the weekends, but surprisingly we were sat right away at a great table in the middle of the restaurant.  \n\nmy date and i split a classic burger with bacon and cheddar (lame, i know, but neither of us were that hungry),  as well as the calamari and some <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  everything was really good.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and calamari were good but nothing special.  the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, on the other hand, were delicious!  nothing fancy about them, just simple <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> that were perfectly crunchy on the outside and hot and yummy on the inside with a hint of saltiness to compliment it's natural sweet flavor.  mmmmmm!\n\nthis is a very fun and casual spot and you still feel like you're in the middle of all the excitement at cosmo.  \n\nand though this is to be expected because it is the cosmo, our bill was was a lot for what we ordered: $46 each, and we shared a burger. wooo!", 
            "i opted for the el machete b/c i wanted a little kick to my burger. what i didn't expect was the monstrosity of a burger i was about to get. lucky for me, i was hungry but even then i barely polished it off. i made absolutely no dent in the fries but i don't normally care for them anyway.\n\nas for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>- big, juicy, perfectly cooked. the toppings were really a bonus at that time. imho, this is something you probably want to split with someone especially if you're considering a shake to go with it. it's massive!", 
            "after looking at the great reviews holsteins has, i definitely wanted to check it out to see what the hype was all about it. i was debating between checking out holsteins and burgr, but i decided to try holsteins since the cosmo is my fave hotel! too bad holsteins isn't as great as the rest of the hotel..\n\ni ordered the golden standard and of course i had to add an egg. with all the unique ingredients, i thought this burger was going to be awesome; but surprisingly it lacked the flavor i was looking for. i honestly think they need to season their meat a little more because i ordered the meat medium rare and it was dry. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> just didn't \"wow\" me. \n\ni also up charged for the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, and those weren't impressive at all. they taste like regular <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> that you would get at a typical burger place. i unfortunately didn't have room to order their famous alcoholic shakes. \n\nalthough my meal wasn't stellar, i definitely enjoyed how friendly the bartenders were. they were full of personality, and kept their guests entertained. i would return to holsteins for their ice cold beer and alcoholic shakes, but i definitely would skip on the food..", 
            "i've been to vegas my fair share since i turned 21 and never even knew about holsteins! i gave it a try and it was beyond delicious!\n\ni got the truffle lobster mac and cheese and half of the salmon burger. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are so big and filling even though they don't look that big. my friend also got the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> which has <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and kobe beef with truffle mayo!!! the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> piece was a good size considering <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was fairly expensive. they said it was really good as well.\n\nservice was good and prompt. although the waiter at the table next to mine kept dropping water glasses causing loud noises throughout the dinner... hopefully he didn't get fired :/ \n\nthe only bad thing was that they didn't allow one of my friends to bring in his fat tuesday which i can understand, but still somewhat of an annoyance!", 
            "alcoholic milkshakes? i mean, whaaaaaat? when i first heard about it i thought it was absurd to mix milk and alcohol but after trying it... it was actually pretty good! i did not end up getting a buzz or anything but hayy youre in sin city so why not treat yourself?\n\ni ordered the hen house burger with steak cut fries and the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake. i was more than satisfied and it was more than enough food. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are big so be prepared to open wide! they are also extremely large so *clap clap* if you finish it all. the shake was delicious too! im happy the waitress suggested the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> to me or else i would have fallen back on a classic oreo shake.... which i wouldnt have minded either :)", 
            "came to holsteins on my last vegas trip on reccomendation from my brother. i'm glad we did!\n\non the previous trip i had tried burgr across the street and this place is definitely a better burger restaurant.\nit was a sunday on a holiday weekend so it was fairly busy, we put our name in and they take your phone number so they can send a text when your table is ready. went and played some slots for a half hour and boom, got a text, awesome.\n\ni ordered a pretty simple burger, bacon cheese and a very good garlic sauce. i love that their burgers come with fries, so much easier to pay the \"burger bar\" prices when it comes with a side. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was very good, perfectly cooked and great accompaniments.\nwe also ordered one of the adult milkshakes, candy bar vodka and chocolate peanut butter flavorings, delicious. \nserving was very good, fairly quick ticket times, no problems there.\n\ni will definitely be back ot holsteins for my burger fix in vegas.", 
            "great atmosphere and location inside the cosmopolitan. hip and casual! i sat at the bar and anna took great care of me. great selection of beers and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is a must! fries were crisp and delicious! didn't have a chance to try a shake but i will be back to give one a try.", 
            "this place is located in aria across from marquee. i was told this was one of the top burger spots on the strip and they weren't lying. i would not recommend ordering appetizers if you're going for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> because <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> themselves are really filling.\n\ni got <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> which omg, the meat patty melts in your mouth. -drool- my party each got different things but everyone said it was pretty amazing. the fries could be a little better but other than that i was not disappointed. the wait is also significantly less than burgr across the way.", 
            "great atmosphere, great burgers, and awesome drinks! the service was friendly and helpful!\nwe ordered the lobster mac n cheese which was good, <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger with a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> (ahhhhmazing), <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> which was okay, and as far as drinks we got <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake, oreo, and cereal bowl. all the drinks were delish. i ordered <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake twice =d", 
            "we came here with friends and overall was good but not great.  pretty cool atmosphere and artwork - kinda reminded me of toki doki. service was attentive but nothing special. \n\nwe ordered:\n\n1) wife ordered the lobster roll which came with a side of cole slaw. she also ordered the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. \n2) i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> that came with a side of regular fries. i also ordered a \"bam-boozled\" tiramisu shake. \n3) we also had a chance to try the truffle lobster mac n cheese along with <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> n turf quesadilla.\n\nthe lobster roll was good along with the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger was slightly on the salty side and the regular fries were just okay - kinda soggy. the bam-boozled tiramisu shake was delicious along with the truffle lobster mac n cheese. overall an ok spot to eat but <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> i had was just so-so. maybe we'll give them another shot when we're in vegas and try something else other than <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>.", 
            "the shakes and appetizers are delicious! we didn't try <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> because of previous reviews, but we would definitely return to holsteins again and would recommend it to those who are looking for a casual meal.", 
            "<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> here are really good!  they have such a variety of them.  the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> was rich in flavor and was very satiating.  their bam-boozled shakes (milkshake for adults) are really good.  they paired the alcohol so well with the shakes.  my favorite is the tiramisu shake which was so decadent it was like drinking a dessert.  i will be back to try the other shakes and burgers!", 
            "i came here on a sunday for lunch and there was no wait at all. the place is so adorable you just want to snap pictures all around the restaurant. the shakes are nothing special...even with alcohol you won't get any sort of buzz. as for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>...there is something special in their sauce that makes their burgers extraordinary. \n\n<mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>: i wanted to try this because of the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> which mind you does not cover the whole burger. it is just a couple of bites before it's all gone with over half <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> left. the sauce is good but i don't think <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is worth the price \n\nthe fries are average  \n\nlobster mac n' cheese: i'd say this dish is poorly executed given that i could not taste the lobster  \n\nthe <mark>Gold Standard</mark> is delicious...if you're going to order a burger that's the one. the flavors meld together perfectly. this is how a burger should be done. \n\nthere is a free beer when you check in on four square but it's not good at all. i'd pass on it even though it's free.",

            "updating once again based on experiencing the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>.\n\nmy friend and i ended up eating here because we came to cosmopolitan to eat at comme ca, unfortunately sema was in town and comme ca was hosting an event in their dining room. being that we did not want to sit and eat at the overly crowded bar at comme ca, we walked over to holsteins. we had to wait for a seat here too so i was really freakin hungry when we sat down. \n\none bummer about this experience was they did not bring out any complimentary popcorn. *womp womp*\n\nother than that our server was very nice and helpful. he knew the menu well. but. my friend and i knew we were getting the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> because we had to have a burger with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> in it. yep. this burger comes with a big chunk of grilled <mark>Foie Gras</mark> right in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. it has kobe beef with frisee, port-onion marmalade and truffle mayonnaise. dang. if you don't feel like hitting the high-roller tables after this burger something is wrong with you. i also added some cheese to mine. \n\nwe also split the \"snickers, please!\" dessert, which was decent, but i would suggest going with one of their bomboozled milkshakes and have it with your burger instead.\n\nholstein's does it right in the world of fancy burgers in vegas.", 
            "really good but really pricey. this place is located on the 2nd floor of the cosmopolitan  and is always busy. the noise level is super loud so don't expect a quiet place for lunch or dinner. the staff is friendly and paid a decent amount of us despite the lunch rush. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> we got were both medium rare and perfect! i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and my boyfriend ordered the golden standard. if you get the chance try the shakes!", 
            "<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are fantastic (though pricey)! i ordered the red velvet shake and it was also pretty good. however, one of the people i was with ordered <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> shake, which is listed on the menu as a caramel popcorn and pretzel combination. it came out with captain crunch and tasted like butterfinger. we complained to the waiter who informed us we were mistaken for wanting something else. it was escalated to the manager who also informed us that we were the ones in the wrong. <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> was designed to be a surprise mix of ingredients (which makes sense considering the title). change the menu to provide an accurate description! the service obviously left a lot to be desired.", 
            "first time here, had \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" and it wasn't spectacular at all. was hoping for a better burger. nothing too special.. just a gourmet burger place with a whole bag of salt. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was way too salty.. i thought they were trying to overdose me with salt... it was to the point where i could not stop drinking water after the meal. a good casual place to eat.", 
            "upon hearing more bad than good reviews regarding this eatery, i decided that it wasn't worth the risk of a potentially bad meal. however, since a large group of us were already on property tonight, it was the best choice for a relatively inexpensive dinner. \n\ni attempted to make a reservation via opentable, but it stated that there were no reservations remaining for the evening. then i called. the hostess explained that they are no longer taking reservations for the evening, but she would be happy to get us a table when we arrived and that there was a \"short\" wait for less than 30 minutes. since we were not physically at the restaurant, we could not put our name on the list. humph. anyway, we get to the restaurant and are given a 30-35 minute wait for our group of nine. a bit longer than i enjoy waiting, but it worked out well - we received our table within 10 minutes (and via text message; very convenient)!\n\nmost of us decided on selections from the \"big buns\" category (good ol' burgers and fries). i had a hard time choosing between a couple of their burgers, but i'm very pleased that our server directed me to their most popular selection - the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" ($17.50). dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli. holy tastebuds. that first bite was euphoric. i can't even describe it, but i'll always remember how i felt - amazing. i was raving to everyone at the table and the two people that tasted my burger affirmed my praise, as well as stating that it was much better than <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> they were eating (memphis burger - very tasty - and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> - shrug). i've had other goat cheese-arugula-tomato burgers and this one does it much better. because the goat cheese is blended with cheddar (haven't quite wrapped my head around this yet lol), it isn't too pungent and all the other flavors were so well balanced. get the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>; medium rare, of course. really, really good.\n\nwith your \"big buns\" order, you have a choice of regular fries, side salad, or a $2 upgrade for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> or thick cut <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. i got their regular fries and they were really tasty and well cooked. i also tried the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> ($9) - perfect dill spears with good crispy exterior, served with an herb-caper mayo - and a strawberry milkshake ($8) - really creamy, delicious strawberry flavor. overall, all the food was great!\n\nour server was really nice and very helpful, however, we received only one visit between receiving our food and finishing our meal, so most of our water glasses weren't refilled. then we found ourselves having to wave our arms for attention. i figured the servers must be overwhelmed, but it seems that the restaurant is always busy and it's as if no one has figured out how to properly handle the capacity of customers.\n\ni'm curious as to why people have been so unhappy with holsteins, but i can guess. based on our experience prior to and during our dinner, i'm sure they have their off days or the service may be even less attentive than it was today. hopefully i won't have to experience any of those things during future visits or even better, that it'll improve!",

            "first thoughts: is that a paper-mache cow in the middle of the room? \n\nholsteins really has out done themselves with the funky street art hung up all around their restaurant. it keeps the space looking fresh and not dated. the food selection looked great! though my bf and i didn't order any entr\\u00e9e food items, i noticed some of the other diners eating burgers and fries. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> looked big and juicy and would be something i'd be interested in ordering the next time i'm back at holsteins.\n\nmy bf and i came to holsteins specifically for dessert and we ordered a black and white milkshake to split ($8). while waiting for our dessert, our server brought a bucket of popcorn to the table. the complimentary popcorn may have looked unassuming in the little pail but once we started nibbling on it, we couldn't stop! it was warm, buttery and some pieces had a slight sour bite to it. it was crack popcorn!\n\nthe milkshake was rich and oh-so delicious. i'm not particularly fond of sweets but i found myself taking large gulps of it. the whipped cream on top was just enough and truly the perfect compliment to the vanilla and chocolate. there were also little chocolate wafer balls on top of the milkshake that added the perfect crunch.\n\nbottom line: word of advice: order one of the milkshakes; you won't regret it.", 
            "i want to start off saying that i am not a fan of burgers or milkshake...with that said, this place is pretty solid, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> good and the shakes are quite creative, my husband tells me that this is the best burger place he has been to, so i guess ill take his words for it. sam's burger in sf is my fav, but this place aint bad =)",

            "went to holsteins on our last trip to vegas. when we ate here it was packed. tables are also close together so the seating was a bit cramped for my liking. our server however was excellent. he was friendly and knew the menu well. i decided to go with the kobe burger. it had chips on it which added a interesting flavor to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. i also went with one of the loaded shakes. the shake was great and by far my favorite part of the meal. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was good however a bit on the dry side. it was a good size just not on par with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> bar or ramsey burger. one nice thing here though is the fries were included with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> unlike ramsey burger (they are included at <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> bar also). as one of the more popular places to eat at the cosmopolitan holsteins could use a bigger dinning room. over all <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> here is good but i like <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> bar and ramsey's if you are looking for a gourmet burger. don't miss out on the loaded milkshakes though!!!", 
            "the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger with an egg added was really really good. i thought the patty had just the right amount of bite and flavor. the bun was also superb-- just the right texture. i'm pretty easily impressed when it comes to gourmet burgers though. \n\nmy husband got <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with the chips in it.. nom nom. it was a little plain and not so nom nom. he wanted mine.\n\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are way worth the $1 upgrade. they were perfection on my tongue. nice and crispy and chewy.\n\nwe also split the autumn house salad... it was so good. lots of fresh greens and fruit tossed with a sweet but tart apple vinaigrette.\n\nwe split the tiramisu adult shake and it was delicious with little chocolate and espresso bean shavings. wanted to try others but we were way too full.\n\ngreat draft beer selection too.\n\nbut the 5 stars really goes to the outstanding waitstaff. my husband was in a wheelchair and barely up on crutches during our visit. he needed to use the restroom and when he asked where it was, our waitress was like \"wait, there's a line right now\" and actually offered to keep checking to see if the line cleared and let us know. i can't remember her name but she was a sweetheart!", 
            "i had <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fries and i couldn't stop eating them. it was really good! the restaurant is loud but that doesn't bother me and our waitress was nice. next vegas trip we'll be going again!", 
            "overpriced for mediocre food and service. we were recommended to come here by some friends and since we were already staying at the cosmo, we decided to come here for dinner one night. it's located right across from marquee. we were promptly seated upon arriving around 9pm on a tuesday night, no wait. i ordered a caesar's salad with chicken and my friend ordered a memphis burger. the service here was horrible. they never come by to check up on you nor seem to care. all the servers seem to have this haughty attitude to them. my salad came out without the chicken i requested. once i told them it took forever for them to bring out the chicken. the food is just as bad. chicken was way too dry and looks gross. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> lacked flavors and the patty was also super dry. we had to flag them down for them to bring us condiments. who doesn't need ketchup or mustard at a burger joint?!\n\nmaybe one of these days i will muster up the courage to give them a second chance but for now, pass!", 
            "hands down the best burger place i have been to. the quality of the meats is very good, and the serving size will leave you completely full and going home with a doggy bag. i've tried half <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> on the list, and they have all been great, although the million dollar burger was the least impressionable and totally not worth it. when in doubt, keep it simple and get the nom nom or get the flavorful <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> with a side salad or the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. also, try the lobster mac and cheese! it comes with lobster chunks and sprinkled with bread crumbs. you're tongue an stomach will be please, and even as a midnight snack or leftovers, it will still taste good!", 
            "i guess we were expecting too much but overall it was just average.  i've had better burgers at a much less price.  again it was bad, but for the price i was expecting greatness.  last word of advice, definitely get <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and say no to the sliders.", 
            "definitely one of the best burger and shake restaurants i've ever been to. service was excellent! loved everything my waiter recommended.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and lobster roll was delicious. but what made this place a 5 star for me personally was the alcoholic shake, sooooooo gooooootttttt.\n\nif you love pumpkin flavor, you must get the pumpkin pie shake. i would trade my first born child for it. haha jk. but no really, it's out-of-this-world delicious.", 
            "if i had a sixth sense, it would be recognizing great beef. holsteins burgers definitely hit the mark in the beef category. i would give it the nod over <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> bar. opted for the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and it was a great choice. pair it with one of their shakes (had the oreo) and you have something that is \"last meal\" worthy.\n\nit helped as during the commercial break from the game, the attractive lady behind the bar had my attention. ooowee", 
            "def one of my fave burger places - maybe because it's located in one of my fave places to stay in vegas: the cosmopolitan. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are delicious and cooked to perfection. the only downside is a burger and fries cost around $20. love the vibe. service is good. it's definitely worth checking out.", 
            "both julia d and myself loved holsteins. we wandered along around 11 am in search of a hearty meal that would cover both breakfast and lunch so after much deliberation and indecisiveness (from me) we decided to go for hamburgers.\n\nto my delight they were showing the nfl games in a bar area and had a screen in a quieter area which i ended up following. the server was incredibly helpful, i liked the way the menu was explained especially how every burger option on the menu can be customized. as someone who doesn't go for a huge amount of toppings on a burger this was much appreciated. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> themselves were great, really good quality beef which tasted great. holsteins really hit the spot and provided one of the best meals i ate in las vegas", 
            "good burgers are easy enough to find. but great burgers are treasures that you sometimes have to look for. if you want a great burger in vegas, then look no further, because holsteins is it! \n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are made with the finest ingredients, are thick and juicy and are cooked to perfection. they're also a bit eclectic. while you can get a basic cheeseburger is you're a boring guy who has given up on life, i highly recommend that you try one of the more unique selections. my wife and i split a \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" and a \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" burger. both were excellent. the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were also amazing. they were giant and the breading was nothing short of spectacular. if you're looking for an adult (i.e. alcoholic) milkshake, try the \"<mark>The Fat Boy</mark>,\" which contains pretzels, chocolate/carmel popcorn, reese's, and vodka. it was'nt too strong, but it was delicious! \n\nthe only downside is that this place is expensive, but when you're eating at good restaurants in vegas, what place isn't expensive? i suppose the best way to spin it is that you get what you pay for. \n\nhighly recommended! two thumbs up (and some toes too... it's that good!).", 
            "on our recent visit to las vegas, we were looking for a substantial lunch that would hold us over through the afternoon, past a show, to a late night dinner.  our friends had recommended holsteins, and as fans of burger bar and other fancy shmancy burger joints, we were eager to try out the menu.  located on the second floor of the cosmopolitan, we arrived around 11:30 and were promptly seated at a nice corner table in the middle of the restaurant.  i started off with a spicy bloody mary, which was made with jalepeno and cilantro infused vodka, served with a big old shrimp on top.  spicy and delicious!  our waiter (who was very good) brought us a bag of complimentary popcorn as we perused the menu\n\nthis place is really known for their burgers, as they well should be, but don't ignore the appetizers!  we wanted to try so many of them, but we settled on the \"sausage and peppers\" potsickers and the mexican car bombs (jalapenos stuffed with cheese, corn, and black beans, then wrapped in bacon).  the potstickers were unique and delicious, but the car bombs... o.m.g.  sooooooo spicy, but so flavorful and delicious.  these things are no joke, they are very hot, so if you are a wimp when it comes to spice, these are not for you.  but we absolutely loved them.\n\nfor our main course, we decided to split a burger and another appetizer (i know i know, but we had to last 9 hours until our next meal!)  i had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and turf quesadilla, which contained steak, lobster, manchego cheese, and bacon lardons, served with an aioli sauce.  very yummy.  for our burger, we had such a hard time choosing, but we decided on the el machete, described on the menu as \"beef patty, fire roasted anaheim chili, borracho onions, pepperjack cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion & spicy 'machete' aioli\".  the beef was medium rare as requested, and was perfectly juicy and delicious.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> overall wasn't as spicy as i was expecting, but maybe my taste buds were burned out from my spicy bloody mary and the jalepeno pepper appetizer.  either way, it was good good beef.\n\nwe finished with a \"grown up\" milkshake... the campfire s'mores, which i only had a few sips of because i was so full, but those couple tastes were very good.  they will also make it to go for you if you'd like.  overall, we were thrilled with our lunch at holsteins and it may be our new favorite burger place in las vegas.  oh, and it definitely did the job of holding us over until dinner time.  we will definitely be back!", 
            "amoozing!! i had the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> with teriyaki sauce instead of 1000 island dressing! wow, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was cooked to perfection! i definitely highly recommend!",

            "i was skeptical in trying holsteins because of the mixed reviews, but after eating at gordon ramsay's burgr so much, i wanted a different burger place. originally we came here around midnight fri to try the place, but were told they stopped serving their regular menu at 11pm. they offered a late night menu instead which were basically just appetizers (no burgers/shakes). no biggie, we came back the next day after a fabulous time at marquee's dayclub...spoiler alert: we also came back the next day before we left on the drive back home because it was sooo good!!\n\nthe decor is so cute here w/ the anime pig wall posters and the theme totally matched w/ the cosmopolitan. our server made great recommendations for us & started us off w/ the complimentary small bucket of lightly salt/sweet popcorn. my bf killed that thing, talk about drunk munchies\n\nbamboozled shakes:\n<mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> - i added toasted coconut marshmallow to it and this was one damn good shake! the description/ingredients seemed so minimal, yet the shake tasted so amazing. it was like a cookies n cream reese's <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark>. this was my fav out of all the other shakes. \n\ntiramisu - they had me at mascarpone ice cream. i love mascarpone, but you could barely taste it in this shake. this tasted like a chocolate shake, not much espresso/coffee flavor. \n\nbanana creme pie - my bf go this 'cause he loves bananas and i would say this was my 2nd fav shake. it tastes exactly like a banana cream pie, but in shake form w/ chocolate. i liked that they topped it w/ white chocolate covered bananas.\n\nthe shakes are big enough to share, but trust me you won't want to. i like that you get a full glass shake and the extras are in the metal mixing cup so you can eat it w/ a spoon (yum!) i also like that their shakes all were thick & creamy!\n\napps:\nsurf 'n turf quesadilla - delish my favorite app! this ain't no taco bell quesadilla. it was crunchy and not oily at all. the lobster, steak and manchego cheese inside all just melted in your mouth and is bursting w/ flavor. must order!!\n\nsoft shell crab bruschetta - for a burger place, their presentation of these apps were tapas style and as nice as any fancy steakhouse. the softshell crab was on top of a thick cut brioche bread, the aioli and tomato salad made the app refreshing\n\ncrispy calamari - big enough portion to share, i couldn't stop dunking these rings in the sweet chili sauce. i like that they don't overbread the calamari rings\n\nmaine lobster roll - pricey for this, but there were generous amount of lobster. \n\ncrispy pork belly bun - tasted better than the ones at ramsay's burgr. the steamed buns weren't dry & sauce was spot on\n\nburgers:\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> w/ <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>(normally comes w/ fries, but paid $2 to upgrade) - the best burger ever!! most asian fusion burgers get overpowered by the sauce, but not here. it didn't taste like an ordinary overly sweet typical terriyaki burger. everything was perfect about this burger, that first bite was so orgasmic. this is what a burger should taste like! the whole brioche bun was toasted to perfection. i am not sure how they did it, but the top part of the bun and inside had a nice toast crisp to it. the tempura avocado was nice, added a different texture. you could taste each item in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and they all blended well together. the kobe beef patty was cooked medium, yet it was juicy and had a nice pink to it. <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were the best we've had as well & worth the upgrade! they were thick, fried, fresh, and crispy, no soggy oiliness at all. make sure to ask for buttermilk ranch to dip the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> in!! it tastes so divine\n\nfun-ghi on wheat bun w/ salad ($2 extra) - healthy combo huh? my 2nd fav burger, but my bf preferred this over <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> because he prefers the truffle flavor. again, patty was cooked perfect along w/ toasted wheat bun. i actually prefer the regular bun's flavor although the wheat bun was toasted the same way as the regular brioche bun. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> wasn't smothered in mayo thank god! the gruyere helped accentuate the truffle portabella & caramelized onions. salad was a generous portion of mixed greens & the dressing was tangy yet sweet & light (sort of like a coleslaw dressing w/ lemon). the only negative is that we added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, but there was no runny yolk...the egg was fully cooked :(\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> w/ <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>- everyone kept talkin about this burger, but we thought it paled in comparison to <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were bomb!\n\ni would have to say that holstein's outranks ramsay's burgr. we were so pleased w/ our meal that we sent compliments to the chef. we were lucky that both days we ate here, the executive chef was working. the food comes out fast and you will leave happily stuffed. don't forget to give them your identity player's card for points!\n\nnote: try and get a girl server. the first day we had a girl and she was totally on top of it. the 2nd day, we had a guy and he seemed easily overwhelmed", 
            "as a vegas local, i love trying new places... i took stars away mainly for service. i booked a reservation for 2 at 8:15.. showed up a bit earlier and they quickly seated us. i asked for a water with lemon and a few moments to look over the menu. water came back with no lemon. i got a very weird vibe from our waitress, like we annoyed her. i ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> medium rare with american cheese and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. my burger came back and when i cut <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> in half.. blood came out of the patty.. definitely not medium rare, this was rare beyond belief. since i was starving i did not want to make a commotion and send it back. despite the patty being undercooked, the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were delicious. my date had <mark>French Fries</mark> and those were so good. if this review was strictly based on food i would give it 4 stars, minus one for the undercooked beef patty. the portions are enough to fill you up, and it had a casual atmosphere. i will go back, probably just ask for a medium cooked hamburger instead.\n\n**reading other reviews, we did not get the complimentary popcorn either, that's a little disappointing.", 
            "holsteins is right across from marquee inside the cosmpolitan so it's the perfect place to grab a bite to eat after day club. i ended up getting the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> which was delicious. it is a little pricey but the patty is so big and juicy that it makes sense to pay $$ for the good quality. plus it is super filling. i actually shared this with a friend and we were both so full off of just half <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. moreover the fries were also good, not too thick or too thin but just right. i liked the crispiness of them and how they weren't too salty.\n\nmy friends and i actually got our orders to go and i was the first one to order. however, everyone's food came out first and when my meal still didn't come out i mentioned this to the cashier. i jokingly asked if we could get some extra fries and not only did she throw in a box of fries but she also told me to choose a milkshake on the house. i got the red velvet milkshake which was to die for. i loved the texture (had a slight crunch) and how sweet and creamy it was. i'm so glad i got to experience their shakes since i heard that they were pretty good. however, they are originally around $14 which is pretty expensive. i would recommend sharing one between friends so you can at least get a taste for it. \n\ni think everyone should go here at least once on their trip to vegas! you won't regret it :)", 
            "great burger. \n\nwent on memorial day and surprisingly it was crowded but not overwhelmingly. we were able to grab two seats at the bar.  i wanted to split a boozy milkshake but he was in the mood for a cocktail. i got the brown cow float. it was lighter and he still had to help me with it! it was so good. i love a good <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float. i could taste <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>.\n\nwe both ordered burgers. he added an egg to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. i got the funghi. both cooked perfectly. they were delicious. generous portions. the fries were ok but <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was so big. truffle flavor was there and the gruyere was perfectly melted. it was a more refined mushroom and swiss burger. in a good way. the fries were just ok. a place like this should have perfectly executed fries there is no reason for anything less. however props to including them in the price of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.\n\nwe got good service from the bartenders but the shakes and burgers were slow coming. bf said the cocktail he has was well executed. \n\nwe will be back and next time i will ask them to make sure my fries are crispy.",

            "i must first state that i was a solid 3 on this; however, what happened once we left really soured my mood along with my stomach. \n\ni must also be clear that this was my first - and subsequently, only - meal of the day. \n\nfirst, the food: my trusty companion and i each had a burger. i had the flagship \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" and she had the \"el machete\". \n\nthe <mark>Gold Standard</mark> is made with dry aged beef, which is a good choice, and topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar and arugula. this should be delicious, and i assume if seasoned properly it is. unfortunately, there was too much salt seasoning - and believe me... i love salt - which left the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> feeling merely standard. \n\nmy tardis companion had the \"el machete\" which is a spicy aoli and pepper based burger. this was actually delicious from the two bites i had. if there was any seasoning issue with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself it was covered by the delicious peppers and aoli!\n\nalong with that we had regular fries and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. the fresh cut fries were tasty, albeit again heavily bathed in salt. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were on the soggy side but fresh and not overly salted. \n\nwe also had milkshakes. hers being some fruit compote fourth of july special concoction and mine being chocolate strawberry. mine was very sweet but it was strawberry with chocolate sauce, so of course that was unsurprising.

            "usually when i visit a restaurant, i have some apprehension because i'm a vegetarian and usualy my options are limited. i was happy to see that any burger on the menu could be convered to a veggie form. there are dozens of options and customizations to make <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> all your own. it's a hip and trendy place that i would definitely visit again.\n\nnow on to the shakes. i had a hard time deciding because they all looked so good, but i chose the \"<mark>The Fat Boy</mark>,\" which was amazing. sweet and salty never tasted so good! the \"urth burger\" was also a good choice, and didn't feel guilty after eating it. \n\nthis is an overall fantastic place to eat.", 
            "first of all, i want to start off by saying that the cosmopolitan is starting to irritate me. everything that is the cosmopolitan is now obnoxious and boring. the types of people the property attracts is just garbage -- <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> of the barrel. don't get me wrong. the building and architecture and design of it all is fantastic. lcd screens everywhere, hip little touches here and there make this property great. i just can't stand how un-classically vegas it is. they try so hard to be different, that in the end of it all, they lose themselves. the addition of holsteins shakes and buns to the property is just the cherry on top. i heard ravenous reviews about holsteins and i was excited to try this place. things like, \"the best burgers in vegas,\" and \"i love love love hoslteins\" were some of many glowing reviews. here is my 2 cents.\n\nthe lobster mac and cheese was good, but not great. surprisingly, the dish had a lot of lobster in it. unfortunately, the lobster taste was lacking and the texture was not there as well. lobster usually has a familiarly soft yet firm feeling when you bite it. theirs was rubbery and lacked flavor. the truffle panko crust on top was nice, but the lack of lobster taste really disappointed me. my favorite part of this dish was the one chip on the side. it consisted of this lobster salad that was full of flavor.\n\nupon request, which i thought was complimentary, was popcorn. though it wasn't your ordinary popcorn, this one was flavored in some weird mixture. i read that it was truffle popcorn. excited for some truffle infused popcorn, theirs was definitely not so. it was a mixture of a vinegary, buttery flavor that coated the popcorn. this was a weird mix and though not appetizing, i found myself reaching for the popcorn. i ate it, forgot how it tasted like, and then tried it again. the sting from the popcorn seasoning alone was enough for me not to eat it again. i guess my curiosity superseded my palate.\n\nquite possibly my favorite food, and naturally, the food i am most knit picking about, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is a classic. from the bun to the type of meat, and the almost infinite sauces and toppings you can put on, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is a great vessel to work with. with such an iconic item, at a restaurant that supposedly specializes in this stuff, you can't mess it up.\n\nand now, <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger -- it had kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. their take on a japanese burger sounds good on paper. the fried avocado alone would make me happy. it was fried and crispy, and velvety smooth at the same time. i just didn't have enough of it. that probably was the only thing good about this burger. everything else was a mistake. first of all, what is wrong with this is the kobe. i hate when restaurants advertise as serving kobe when we all know most of that is just an american breed, if not, from australia. second of all, when you cook a \"kobe\" beef burger, it has to be rare. nothing else will do. what i got was all grey inside. the crust was overly marinated and glazed and turned the meat super dry, and the inside wasn't any different. that is one way to kill an almost perfect burger. the teriyaki glaze was much too overwhelming and the crispy yam didn't help with the cloyingly sweet flavors. did i order the wrong burger? maybe, but that still doesn't make up for the overcooked patty.\n\nif anything, the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake may have been the only thing that was considerably good. it had malted banana gelato and peanut butter crunch. the adult version has frangelico, a hazelnut liqueur from italy. i opted out and went with just a regular. \"you are in vegas. live a little!\", you say? in hind sight, maybe i should have made this shake alcoholic. it would have made me feel better about <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>-par meal i just had. still though, the shake was sweet and the use of gelato made the shave quite delicate and smooth.\n\npretentious, and yet casual, the restaurant has no identity. i just can't associate this restaurant with good food. the same food could be served at a restaurant that looks like, maybe johnny rockets, with a lower price, and i still wouldn't think twice about it. i mean, they have red and yellow squeeze bottles for ketchup and mustard. come on! the food really needs an upgrade. how awesome would it be if finally, the las vegas strip had a go-to burger spot that was hip, and of course, delicious? i think that is a home run and a much needed thing on the strip. i guess i just have to wait a couple years for that to happen. for now at the cosmo, i guess secret pizza will have to do.", 
            "top 3 burger i've had which isn't even fair because i can't name the other 2... had <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger. incredible. don't need to write you a book to say how great <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are here. get off yelp and go!", 
            "this place is terrible. the only redeeming thing on the menu are the shakes. we ordered the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> which was nice but too watery for my taste. i prefer a thick shake.\n\n <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were overdone and the meat did not taste like quality meat. we asked for medium but they were beyond medium- dry and tough. the fries were also overdone. i ordered the funghi burger. wouldn't recommended it. their \"best seller\" the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> wasn't great either. neither of us ate even half of our burgers and neither did most of the people at the table next to ours. \n\nthey bring you a spicy zesty mini bucket of popcorn which tasted better than any of the other things we ordered. \n\nthe service was friendly and helpful but the food just isn't good. it boggles my mind that this place has a 4-star average rating. it just doesn't make any sense.\n\nmaybe it was just an off night for the food but i wouldn't go back.", 
            "very loud atmosphere, across from marquee. burgers are hit or miss, depending on personal preference and type of burger ordered. hubs loved his <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>, which had a good chunk of <mark>Foie Gras</mark>. i found my <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> a bit salty. the tomato confit, sauteed mushrooms, and marmalade onions were tasty additions to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself, though. \n\nburgers are large, and <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> bun is a bit too thick for my liking, although it stands up well to the toppings and creamy sauces. fries were similarly salty. no option to sub a salad for the bun, which is rather disappointing. you can, however, pay more to sub a salad for the fries. for a heavy meal and a satisfying piece of cow, this won't disappoint.", 
            "we enjoy visiting holstein's at cosmo when we are in town. sure, you can eat at the hoity toity spots if you want. we enjoy sharing a burger and <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. yea, don't be afraid to share. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are plentiful. service is friendly and efficient. the only complaint i would say are the low seated booths and awkwardly uncomfortable chairs.", 
            "was craving for some burgers and came across this place inside of the cosmopolitan on the 2nd floor. my husband and i shared an appetizer (cuban' street taco) which the bartender recommended and it was delicious, nothing i had ever had b4. pulled pork with smoked ham in a tiny hard taco shell with beans and pickles on the side. we also shared the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger. the sirloin patty was amazing but as a whole i think <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself could have been more flavorful. adding ketchup and mustard didn't quite set  it off by giving it more \"flavor\" but overall i did enjoy <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. the only downside to this was the fries! i'm a fries kinda girl when having a burger and the fries was such a disappointment. it was soggy so obviously they gave us old fries that have been sitting for awhile. although <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> lacked a bit of flavor if the fries would have been fresh and hot i would have given this place a 5 star.", 
            "a little late (!) review, as i went in january this year! but backtracking on some places i haven't reviewed that i went to while in the vegas. another one of my researched spots i insisted on dragging my girlfriend to! <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> (the urth burger) was pretty squishy/sloppy, so that wasn't great in my humble opinion. but the milkshake was really great (i think i had a vanilla shake made vegan) and we don't get many in the uk that are suitable for vegans, so i had a sensory overload. very good! shame about the food and portion size being average!", 
            "<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> here are good, but you're going to have to pay a premium price just for the fact that it's inside the cosmo. here's why you will pony up: you get what you pay for. \n\nthe buns were soft on the outside and toasted on the inside. when you ask for a medium or medium-rare burger, they don't overcook it. lastly, the seasoning is on point without having a heavy hand with the salt. \n\ni went with <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger with roasted portobello, gruyere, and truffle oil. each bite had the perfect amount of flavor without one ingredient overwhelming the next. i tried a bite of my friend's <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, which had tempura avocado, crispy yam, nori, spicy mayo and a patty with a teriyaki glaze. it was even more amazing. i liked that <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> had flavor without sacrificing the texture. the beef patty wasn't soft like umami.\n\nservice was quick. they do automatically tack on 18% gratuity for parties of 6.", 
            "<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are to die for. not to mention the adult shakes make you fee like a kid while still giving you that awesome buzz only 21+ people get. appetizers are alright but definately definately definately get a\nburger",

            "not only is the dj amazing on a friday night but <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was amazing! i loved the sweet potatoe fries much more than regular fries. the cosmopolitan has the best eateries and i really enjoyed my meal. \n \n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> i had is the best burger in vegas 2 years in a row. \n\naged blue cheese, the cheese was the highlight of my burger and i truly enjoyed my meal. i said i would only go to vegas once but next time i come here i'll eat my heart out at this restaurant!", 
            "so this place was friendly and open. in the sense that it feel like a sophisticated friends house. the servers were helpful and honest. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were tricked up with all kinds if toppings. we have <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. i thought <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was just good, but not wow.  i was impressed with the toppings i just like bigger patties.  however, the wow moment did happen for me with the banana cream milkshake. that shake just made me want to cuddle up with a blanket it was yum.  i had to go back the next day just for the shake. the ingredients are spot on and the flavor is not overpowering. anytime i go to vegas i will stop by for one of these shakes they make you think other shakes are child's play.  we also ordered fries they were fine.  so go for the shakes. if you don't drink alcohol they will nix the alcohol for you.", 
            "i've been wanting to try this place forever, because <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and shakes look incredible.  however, i go there and what do i get?!  the soft shell crab bruschetta and a maui coconut porter beer.  however, i do not regret my choices.  both were absolutely incredible!  my dad had sliders, fries, and the <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float and he said it was great.  and my sister had the urth sliders (vegan patties) with the s'mores milkshake.  and she loved hers.  and the service might have been the absolute best i've ever had anywhere!  our server's name was robin, and she was spectacular!  very friendly, very good at her job.  i definitely will be going back there soon for a buger and fries and i will be asking for robin again!  great place!", 
            "went here with a friend tonight. first of all, the setting was very nice with a animation-esque theme. the hostess told us that we could sit at the bar or the dining area, both of which have tvs. i had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger ($18.50) and my friend had the big fat greek burger($18) with $2 sub <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. we also shared the tiramisu shake ($13). when the shake came out, our waiter gave us a steel mixing cup and a glass cup with the shake. i was wondering what that steel cup was and when i looked inside it was more of the shake. i guess they made extra and they were courteous enough to give the rest of it to us. the shake was pretty good and less sweet (thank god) than the shakes at gordon ramsay's burgr. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came out pretty quick (maybe in 10-15 minutes). it wasn't that busy so that helped. the fries come out in a small, aluminum bucket which is kinda unique. the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger was great. i liked especially the arugula and the tomato confit. those veges balanced the heavy flavors of the bacon, cheese, and burger. unfortunately, i noticed the fries at the middle and bottom of my bucket were a little soggy and oily. i tried my friend's greek burger which had greek spiced lamb. she had the tsaziki sauce on the side and i thought that was a good decision especially for this burger. the sauce had mint in it and my friend didn't like it. i, on the other hand, thought it worked bc i've hand lamb with mint jelly before. my friend told the waiter she didn't like the tsaziki sauce and the waiter was kind enough to bring out a cajun remoulade sauce instead. that cajun remoulade sauce was pretty good and tasted like thousand island with some cajun seasoning. my friend's <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were great as they were crispy and did not taste oily at all. the service was great and attentive. even though <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were on the pricey side (most were $16-$18), i would come back again bc of the casual setting, fast service, and the yummy tasting burgers and shakes.",

            "it's both a blessing and a curse that that vegas is so far away, otherwise i'd be visiting holsteins on a far more frequent basis.\n\nin contrast to the sharp trendiness of the cosmopolitan hotel itself is holsteins, a lighthearted, family-friendly (relatively speaking of course!) burger-n-fries type of place that offers many interpretations of the word \"indulgence.\" \n\nour wait to be seated took about a minute or two at most, but this was during a monday lunchtime visit - so i wouldn't be surprised to know that this place becomes quite packed over the weekends.\n\naccording to the restaurant's website, holsteins no longer offers its crispy calamari appetizer - what a bummer!. the calamari itself has a wonderfully crunchy texture and the grilled lemon wedges provided on the side provided a tangy flavor as well as a subtle hint of charred smokiness. the tabasco-honey dipping sauce was also fantastic, creating a welcome balance between sweetness and a slightly spicy kick. i hope that this dish somehow finds it way back on to the menu soon, as it was one of the best iterations of calamari that i've had in recent memory!\n\nfor our burger selection, we shared a \"fun-ghi\" burger, which was packed to the brim with many of my favorite things. indeed, there were mushrooms aplenty (check), caramelized onions (check), gruyere (check), and even a truffle mayo that gave <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> an earthy aroma and that signature truffle flavor. the patty itself was juicy and flavorful; it was also cooked to a perfect medium-rare.\n\nwe also split an order of truffle lobster mac-n-cheese (might as well go all in if you're indulging like this!), which had nice contrasts of creaminess and crisp crunch (thanks to the breaded topping, of course). in contrast to some macaroni & cheese dishes found at other establishments, this version wasn't overly rich or oily. its stronger, more pronounced cheese flavor complemented <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> quite well. \n\nin sharing this appetizer, a burger, and a side, my girlfriend and i were pretty much stuffed. the portion sizes were bigger than what we're accustomed to getting for the price (cough, umami, cough). this being said, expect somewhat of a price markup...it is sin city after all.\n\nwe didn't get a chance to try any of the famed holstein's \"adult\" shakes (in large part because we had already gotten drunk earlier that morning), but some of the combinations listed on the menu looked pretty interesting. in particular, the \"<mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> shake\" really jumps off of the page!\n\nwhile the whole \"high-end burger\" scene seems to be flourishing into quite the business these days, places like holsteins prove that there are ways to excel at both image and execution. i'll certainly be back.",

            "wow... this establishment turned out to be a home run!\n\nwe were in las vegas attending a tradeshow and ventured out to holsteins on a recommendation of a friend. holstein is located on the second floor of the cosmopolitan. just go up the escalator near the entrance of casino/hotel adjacent to las vegas blvd. and you'll see it.\n\nfirst off, don't let the prices discourage you. it is very much worth it. it can be a little out of the way, but the trip is definitely worth it as well. for a burger entree, expect to pay $16-20 depending on which burger  you get.\n\nwe came in for lunch around 2pm on a friday. there wasn't any wait and we were seated immediately. the waitress was extremely nice and accommodating. i did catch her name, but my receipt says her name is tiffany.\n\nthere's a lot of good burger options and it was kind of difficult to find the one that i wanted to try. i ended up with the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was really good. more like amazing! the <mark>French Fries</mark> that came with the meal wasn't bad either. there wasn't anything really special about the <mark>French Fries</mark>.\n\nmy two colleagues both ordered classic burgers. i think they were a little more old school and wanted something less fancy smancy. totally a preference thing. both of them are usually pretty talkative, but once the food came out and they bit into their burgers, the table pretty much became silent. that's usually a sign that the food was really good. they thoroughly enjoyed their burgers and definitely agreed that it was worth the money.\n\ni rate holsteins 5 stars out of 5. great food. great service. burgers are amazing. service is quick. there's not a whole lot to complain about. it was definitely a solid experience. if there was something to complain about, it would be the price, but given that it was las vegas it was ball park. we have had more expensive food that was drastically less tasty.\n\ntips: if you aren't near the cosmo, holsteins might be a little out of the way, definitely make an effort to go.\n\nholstein charges $3.95 for iced tea. might be the case with other establishments in the area as well.\n\nprepare to be very lost with burger options... so many good signature burgers... maybe review the menu before hand?? i was torn between 3 or 4 burgers but ended up choosing the nom nom (kobe beef, potato chips, island dressing). no idea why... :p\n\ndon't be afraid to ask for directions... i think all the casinos are designed to be death traps and mazes.", 
            "as suggested by the name, shakes and burgers are the specialty. there are fun and interesting array of shakes to choose from. we tried <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> shake that has a combination of cookies n' cream, sprinkles, butterfinger. it was good! we ordered the truffle lobster mac n' cheese to start out...it was good but not the best we've had. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was very good; we ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger. it has a good combo of sauce to onions and a juicy kobe beef. our medium request came out more like medium well, but still surprisingly very juicy nonetheless. overall, it is a great lunch spot with fun cow decor and designs. good with a group and fairly family friendly.", 
            "came here last month while i was in las vegas and i'm a definite fan! probably one of the best burgers i've had in a while. it was one of those kind of messy but sooo tasty burgers that you just can't not eat in one sitting. \n\nwe came in early for lunch on a sunday before leaving vegas and it was basically empty. we were sat immediately and within minutes i had eyed one of their seasonal milkshakes (with some booze of course!) a pumpkin pie milkshake. literally so good. it had pumpkin pie vodka in it with with pumpkin pie filling, pepitas, and graham cracker crumble. i was literally drinking a pumpkin pie spiked with vodka and it was heaven! ordered the the \"fun ghi\" burger to eat because i'm a big fan of mushrooms and truffle mayo and it was delicious! the meat was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the gruyere cheese complimented <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> really well. the fries it came with were seasoned and crispy as well! \n\nthere are a ton of burger joints in vegas and they are all over priced but i'd rate holsteins up there as one of the best. i love the cute decor and the trendy atmosphere with its location right in the heart of the cosmopolitan.", 
            "while <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and other menu items are good, the shakes with alcohol are the unique touch for here. last time i ate there i tried the cuban \"street\" taco and was a little disappointed: the taco was so thin and crispy that it shattered with each bite and left me with a handful of filling;about that, the mixture of shredded pork and ham ( although it wasn't really mixed, the ham was a slice under the pork) was under seasoned and dry. good flavor otherwise. in past visits i was much more satisfied,so i still consider this a very good spot ( especially those spiked shakes !! )", 
            "sixty four dollars!  for a shake, slider, burger and fries. admittedly this is vegas....but $64.00...really!  the alcohol infused shakes are the draw.  we split a donut shake, infused with kahl\\u00faa, and it was good....though a little on the weak alcohol content.  the shake brought back childhood memories of the old shake shops where you get not only a large glass shake, but half a metal shake container full of extra as well! more than enough to share.  i ordered <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> that came with fries.  it was topped with mushrooms and swiss cheese.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself was kind of devoid of taste...but did have a spicy kick of peppercorns.  my wife ordered the sliders and topped it with blue cheese, caramelized onions....and those three little burgers were the prize.  very tasty.  service was good, seating was fine...but overall, (and especially for the price)...meh!",

            "i've been here a few times and feel like this place deserves a 4 because they continue to have good food and good service. we enjoyed our medium-well  burgers but next time we'll probably go with medium being that the patty could've been juicer.  but still, not bad. we split two burgers between the two of us since we both had mentioned we wanted to try them. <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger was absolutely delicious! you can taste the truffle in every bite. truffle and gruyere cheese in the same burger? perfection! the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> is their most popular burger and i can see why. they took the all-classic cheeseburger and deconstructed it. first, the cheese isn't just your typical cheddar, it's an aged goat cheddar. second, instead of adding a thick slice of tomato, that usually creates a mess and ends up sliding out anyway, they added a tomato confit! lettuce was replaced with arugula which gave <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> a lot of flavor. bacon, bacon, bacon! and for the best part instead of plain mayo this burger had a garlic chive aioli. ah-maze-ing! this changed the whole dynamic of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>! honestly, i don't even remember what the buns were like because i was too busy enjoying all the unique flavors inside. the only downside to our meal was that i was so excited to have the \"unndon\" cake for dessert that i skipped on the raved about shakes. i came to find that it was a seasonal item that is no longer on the menu. seriously?! until they bring that back i am not returning. take a look at the pictures others posted of it and tell me that does not look amazing? if you don't think so, then there's something definitely wrong with you. sorry. we ended up getting the dulce de leche cheesecake because #1 i love anything ddl and #2 it said it had frosted flakes cereal in/on. normally, i wouldn't even eat cheesecake unless it's the godiva or s'mores ones from the cheesecake factory but the description made this one hard to skip. it had the perfect consistency, too! the densely moist cracker crust underneath tasted like a combination of crushed <mark>Reed's Ginger Brew</mark> man and snicker doodle cookies. salivating much? for the perfect bite you have to start at the top, taking a bit of the whipped cream, ff cereal, cheesecake and then sweep it all up with the trail of oozing caramel sitting next to it. yummmmm-meee!! now remember, their desserts are seasonal so hurry in!",

            "i love <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> here! coming from all the amazing burger joints in la, i would say holstein's has my second favorite burgers ever. it beats umami burger for sure, is on par with bachi burger, but father's office still wins. nothing could beat father's office.\n\nanyway, holstein's is fabulous in it's own respect. the restaurant is casual and comfy; decorated with cute little cows. prices are on the more expensive side at ~$15-20 per burger with a side of fries but it is located in cosmopolitan so i think it's pretty fair for vegas prices. service is only mediocre to me since the waiters check in too slow at times so that's why i'm giving it 4 stars.\n\ni've tried the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burgers.  whenever i have these, oh man i am in burger heaven. <mark>Gold Standard</mark> has bacon, aioli, arugula, and aged goat cheddar cheese on top of a sirloin burger. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> has a teriyaki glaze with kobe beef and tempura avocado!! the avocado seriously is amazinggg. i definitely recommend these two burgers. \n\nnot only are <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> but the alcoholic milkshakes are too!  you can also ask them to be non-alcoholic if you really want that. they have a variety of flavors that they rotate around. you really can't go wrong with any of them. i've had the frozen grasshopper, banana creme pie, and red velvet before and they were all yummy.  \n\noverall a fun restaurant with delicious burgers and milkshakes perfect for your vegas gluttony!", 
            "meating time.\n\nthere are burgers, and then there are burgers.  holsteins serves one of the best burgers i've ever eaten. and overall i had a positive first time experience enjoying good food with great company.\n\nlocation:  second floor of the cosmopolitan hotel.\n\non my recent trip, i visited holsteins for lunch with two friends, one of whom had previously dined last year.  we decided to meet when they opened, and its a lucky thing as we did since a small line had already formed before their 11am opening.  thank goodness for being early.  in this case, the early diner gets <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.\n\nfood:  there were three of us and collectively we ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, the <mark>California Turkey</mark>, and the big fat greek.  all burgers/sandwiches were served with fries.  i was initially unsure on what to order, but thanks to a glowing recommendation from our server, i decided on their award winning <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger.  \n\nthe <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger is aptly named, and worth its weight in gold for that matter.  this has to be one of the best burgers i have ever had.  this dry aged beef sirloin (<mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic aioli) was prepared well, while the goat cheese didn't bother me that much, though other reviewers have stated otherwise.  i thought all the condiments served complemented <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> well.  my taste buds were quite happy indeed.  the fries, sadly, were just ok in my humble opinion.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was the true shining (gold) star at lunch.\n\nas for my two friends, i believe they enjoyed their burgers too, as evidenced by the nearly spotless plates at the end of the meal.    overall, we all enjoyed our meal/food.\n\nservice:  the hostess was quite friendly and promptly showed us to our table.  the server was a friendly and polite young woman.  she greeted us and took our drink orders.  she also recommended some appetizers and milk shakes, but we all decided to order just burgers and fries.  as previously mentioned, the server made such an enthusiastic endorsement regarding the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, and i thanked her more than once for her recommendation.  she  provided extra napkins, provided drink refills, checked on us periodically throughout the meal.  \n\nbottom line:  great food and great company.  i strongly recommend the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger.", 
            "they should rename this place holsteins beers and buns. the beer selection was amazing and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable in all 132 beers! \n\nafter ordering our beers, it was time to pick a burger. i had the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>. this was kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chops and 1,000 island dressing. i wasn't impressed with my burger, it was just okay. i asked for medium and it came out well done so my burger was pretty dry and lacking juices. \n\nmy boyfriend got <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> (beef patty crusted with black pepper, holsteins creamy steakhouse sauce, tomato confit, marmalade onions, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>, and swiss cheese). this was much better than my burger! however, he ordered medium rare and it was more cooked than he wanted. \n\nwe both got fries with our burgers and they were just okay. we like our fries more crispy. our favorite part of our meals were our beers. we are interested in coming back for another drink sometime!", 
            "i will give them credit on the fact the food did taste good. however, the portions size for a burger joint is pretty sad. they give you a small bucket with <mark>French Fries</mark> to make <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> seem much larger than it actually is, but once you pick it up it's about the size of something off the dollar menu at mcdonald's. the decor was a mix of nice restaurant and tacky paintings of cows during the final bookaki scene. it was quite disturbing. i also found it odd the hostess was wearing a nice black dress and the waiters wore button downs and black ties but the female bartenders were dressed for a pedophiles paradise, with hot pink short, knee high socks, sneakers and blue v-neck t-shirts. their only redemption is the their decent vegan burgers and large milk shakes. i wouldn't suggest this place", 
            "located in the cosmopolitan hotel. the things to get is located in their title: shakes and bun. \nit's not a bad place but i do however think i rather spend my money at bachi than here. considering that their milkshake(booze or no booze) it's $9 and $13 if it is, that's just way too expensive even if it does taste good. obviously recommend the cookies and cream and they even serve you the rest in an other cup since it doesn't fit the whole cup. \n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are okay. i got the longhorn burger and it was too heavy. the sauce was kinda drench making the buns a bit too drench. i had a bite of the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>, i would recommend that a lot more. still, bachi's burgers are a lot better and more fresh imo.",

            "i'm just going to call a spade a spade and if you're looking for burgers there are better places.  people often get hung up on the new trend of gourmet burgers, and they can be great, but one thing you have to remember is that it has to be knock you off your feet good if you're going to charge more than the average burger.  i think there is a special place burger fans keep in their heart for a good burger.  maybe it's because we love them so much we're always searching for a better burger experience.  i just want a burger that scratches that itch and is savory, juicy, and good.  i've had upscale burgers that do that for me and i am no stranger to a good in-n-out.  it just has to be good, it doesn't have to be expensive.  i honestly love burgers so much i would eat one out of the back of somebodies trunk if it was damn good.  holsteins has disappointing me twice with different burgers, and each time has giving me the weirdest stomach pains.  i'm just not a fan of this place.  each time i leave i just wish i went to one of the other great burger places in vegas.  maybe i'm not who they are trying to get with their brand of food, because i do like some of their other items that aren't burgers.  do you come to a place that touts burgers and shakes for their side dishes though?  no you come for that slab of meat in between two buns.  i don't care how much kitschy items you pile on to it it still has to be good at its core.  so hold the aioli sauce, take off the shiitake mushrooms, and 86 the truffles or whatever you want to try to spruce up <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  make your burgers something i crave and i'll be back in, meanwhile you can find me at one of the great burger  food trucks or in-n-out with grease all over my fingers.",

            "holstein's is a little overpriced for what it is, but the food, ambiance and service create a positive experience despite the pain to the wallet.  they give you spiced popcorn instead of bread with the meal; i got refills both times i went since it was so tasty! \n\ni highly recommend the shakes.  i had the nutella crunch shake and it was amazing. super thick and chocolaty, and the crunchy bits made it even more memorable.  you can add extra shots of alcohol too ;)  although the shakes are pricey, they give you a large glass for the shake, plus the extras.  the first time i got the shake the extras were almost enough to refill the entire glass again!  although <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are good, it's the shakes that made me want to go out of my way to go back to holstein's.   \n\nthanks to my fellow yelpers, i decided to try the lobster mac & cheese.  it's a small portion, but since it is so rich i would not have wanted any more.  it's worth trying if you're a fan of lobster, mac & cheese, and truffle.  however, it wasn't amazing so you're not missing out if you give it a pass.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are good as well.  again, i thought they were overpriced but it was very enjoyable.  the black pepper crusted burger was very peppery and <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> flavors were unique.  i think the choice of burgers comes down to a personal preference. \n\nholstein's is located inside the cosmopolitan, and has a bar, lounge seated area, and normal restaurant tables.  it has a casual vibe.",

(4/5)\n\n2. <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>: go big or go home! there are so many great burger choices on the menu, but how often can one eat <mark>Foie Gras</mark>? this burger comes with kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, truffle mayo and onions. overall, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was very delicious and juicy. the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> was obviously the best part. let me just tell you that this burger is huge! my bf added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to his, but i didn't add anything else to mine. your burger order also comes with fries, which were great too. (5/5)\n\n3. chocolate malt shake: my bf was kind of disappointed with this one. it was decent for me, but i don't normally drink malted shakes. for him, it tasted more of a milkshake even though he ordered malt. if you don't finish it, you can request for plastic cups to take them to go.

            "the last few years of kicking my foodie habit into overdrive has probably made me a bit snobby, but i'm truly surprised that many here are saying that holstein's dished up the best burger that some have ever had. my burger was fine, but it certainly wasn't anything that went above and beyond a-ok. \n\nstar 1: how were the service and atmosphere?\n\nthe highlight of my visit to holstein's was without a doubt the service and atmosphere, which complimented the obviously excellent location. i rolled in on the later side of a thursday evening and walked by several times over the course of the weekend: while crowded, there was rarely a wait, which was refreshing. from there my bartender doubling as my server was excellent, and i left feeling good about the experience even though the food didn't blow me away. star granted. \n\nstar 2: how were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nwhile my $15 threshold for a sit-down burger of any kind is often a pretty hard ceiling, i'm going to have to relent when it comes to vegas prices on the strip. my <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and side of fries came to $18.00, and while that would normally be enough for me to take a good critical look at this star, i have no choice but to chalk that cost up to the vegas premium. star granted. \n\nstars 3 and 4: how was the food?\n\nhonestly my <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was just okay, which was a bit of a letdown given the impressive laundry list of ingredients and peripherals. the black pepper crusted patty had some very good flavor, but it was simply too small given the size and quantity of other toppings and the lofty bun. the mixed greens went well with the proprietary steak sauce, but the marmalade onions were overpowering to the point where i didn't really even realize that the <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark> and swiss cheese were in the mix. \n\nprobably the low point of the meal was the <mark>French Fries</mark>, which, soft, limp and tasting as though they came out of a frozen bag, didn't add anything to the equation. single star granted. \n\nstar 5: would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nholstein's is probably worth a visit, but i can't recommend it over some of the other options in town. no star granted.",

            "in the spirit of trying new places while also being confined to the perimeter area of cosmopolitan, i decided to give holstein's a try. luckily on a monday late afternoon, there was enough availability to book a reservation on open table at 5:45 pm, just one hour prior. i was able to walk right on down to the second floor and check in within 5 minutes flat.\n\nthere was a baseball game and football game going on, so the bar/lounge area (which is right up front) was loud and rowdy. even with seating in the wayy back away from the bar, it would still be noisy. i opted instead to order to go, charge the cost to my room, and enjoy <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger from the comfort of my hotel room with the tv show of my choice.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself was filling, which made me happy since it cost $18! it better fill me up at that price! <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> has a kobe beef patty, tempura avocado (love it!), nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and teriyaki glaze. it also comes with a side of fries. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was good, but the teriyaki sauce was rather salty, which really takes away from an otherwise yummy choice. it didn't help that the fries were salty too. i really needed the ketchup not because i needed more flavor, but to use the taste to balance the saltiness. i was so full that 1/4 of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> remained, which i snacked on and finished two hours later. \n\nnot a bad substitute for secret pizza or wicked spoon if you want to stay around the cosmo area and grab a low-key meal without the three or four dollar signs from the other more fine dining options.", 
            "i'm giving this 3 stars for the popcorn and birthday cake shake (booze n a shake ah yeah) the service wasn't very good (and it was dead in there for lunch - our server just didn't seem to want to be there and wasn't friendly and that is disappointing for a vegas restaurant.) <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were tasty but not worth the price imo. i'd go for a boozy shake and popcorn anytime :)",

            "with some great milk shakes, holstein's is a nice place to chill with friends but the sides are just okay.\n\nleaving somewhat unfulfilled from our day at the marquee dayclub, my friends and i decided to roll over to holstein's for some shakes.  in all honesty, the trip was mainly to satisfy our munchies and i am glad that the milkshakes, at least, were good.  it seems like a lot of other reviews rave about <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> which may be a reason why i was underwhelmed.  here are some of the things that we tried:\n\n<mark>Ahi Poke Tostadas</mark>- although beautifully presented, these bite size tostada pieces were just okay and i would not recommend.  sure there is some avocado aioli that goes well with the ahi but for me it was on the bland side.  the only source of heat came from the piece of jalapeno which was a little too strong of a flavor profile to enjoy the meat.\n\n<mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> - i can handle my spice, but it was slightly spicier than i would like and definitely required the dip to help with the heat.  if you are looking for something spicy, this would be it.\n\nnatural cut fries/<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> - these were cooked well but were nothing special.\n\n<mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> - their <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were probably one of the best i have had.  the coating was nice and crispy and inside was a hot well cooked piece of onion in the middle.  of all the sides, i would recommend these.\n\nmilkshakes - if there was another thing that i really enjoyed were the milkshakes  i had the black and white which was rich and creamy with a nice balance of chocolate and vanilla.  what i was surprised was that that they not only have the nicely presented milkshake in one glass and another cup with the leftover.  my friend also got the alcoholic ones and they are deceptive!  he got a major hangover afterwards so beware!\n\nanother plus here was the service.  my pretty big group of friends were seated pretty quickly and the waitress we had was super friendly and attentive even on a fairly busy day.  holstein's is located on the floor with most of the restaurant.\n\noverall, holstein's has okay food but has nice milkshakes that are worth trying if that's what you are in the mood for.  however, i am willing to come back to try their burgers.", 
            "he <mark>Bananas Foster</mark> shake was great .  the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were great as well .  i was disappointed with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> as the kitchen forgot the cheese, so when it came back from the kitchen it was well done.  next time i'm at cosmopolitan i'll give it another chance and update.", 
            "<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are bomb af and the shakes are even better! get the red velvet alcohol shake. they're so filling and so good! definitely a place i recommend to try. just be aware <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are like $15-20 but they're so good.", 
            "finally tried this place. been wanting to try their burgers and shakes for awhile. one opened up nearby in ca too. \n\nthey start you off with some popcorn. they're crazy addicting. i almost spoiled my appetite cause of them. \n\ni got their jalape\\u00f1o margarita? i forgot the name, but it was really good. the slight spicy flavor went well with the margarita. <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> got their coffee &donut adult milkshake. i super liked it. wasn't crazy sweet and perfect amount of booze. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger and lobster mac&cheese. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was delicious. beef was nice and moist and their bacon inside was slightly glazed i think. the mac&cheese was also yummy. they give you a good chunks of lobster and it's super creamy. we ended up eating the rest back at the hotel later that night. used jalape\\u00f1o kettle chips as scoops because we didn't have forks. the combo is amazing. \n\nhopefully, i'll try the longhorn or <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> next time.", 
            "the food here was good. i really enjoyed the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, i couldn't stop eating them. the shakes were also amazing but not impressed by <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. the bun could be softer i think but other then that everything else was great", 
            "this place is rated for burgers, but i think it is alright. i can imagine how delicious and amazing these unique burgers are when you're drunk, but when you're sober, the patties aren't cooked to the right texture... and the patty is a bit plain. the sauces and ingredients definitely make up for the patty, but... still, im here for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. \n\ni'd say just get the appetizers! they're a lot yummier (but mad expensive) and just as unique as <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. \n\ncute place to hang with your friends. amazing waitresses and waiters here! fun cocktails!", 
            "where do burgers like to dance? at a meat ball!\n\nwhere do i even begin with this place? from the atmosphere to the appetizer to the meals themselves, the experience was wonderful. \n\nfrom the moment that we arrived at the restaurant, we were very impressed with the atmosphere that it gave off. being that the majority of the cosmopolitan is very dark and sleek looking, there was a bit of juxtaposition that takes place with having a place like holstein's in there. the lighting inside of the restaurant gives off a very warm and inviting vibe, and there's all sorts of cool (cow-related) artwork filling the inside of the restaurant. it's very fun!\n\non a friday night, we were seated immediately, which kind of surprised me, being that holstein's is in a very popular hotel on the strip, and on a night where people are usually out and about. i probably helped that we got there before the clubbing crowd hit, though, so there's that. either way, it was fast, and i like that! then, as soon as we were seated, we were brought our complimentary popcorn appetizer, which, i must say, was quite the tasty start to our meal. i actually had to make an effort to not fill up on the popcorn too much before the we got our actual burgers.\n\nbefore we even got our burgers, though, i made sure to check in on yelp! and boy am i glad that i did, because we were able to snag a free beer through a promotion that they have going on with yelp, wherein you get a free beer with your first check-in to the restaurant. i didn't finish it because of how tasty and filling <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fries were, but it was really nice! i got a tiny bit of 'tude from the waiter when asking about the promotion, but i can look past that.\n\nwhen we finally got our food (which didn't take very long at all), it looked so delicious that i had a hard time stopping to take some pictures of it to accompany my review. i ordered the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>, which consisted of kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips, and thousand island dressing, and the empress, miss joyce w. ordered the urth burger, a vegetarian burger consisting of a house made vegan patty with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sprouts, and avocado. \n\nas soon as i took a bite of my burger, i knew instantly that it was without a doubt the best burger i've ever had. i don't know if it was some sort of placebo effect caused by my knowing that <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was made with kobe beef, or that <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was just plain delicious, but man was it good. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was cooked to a perfect medium and the cheese was melted evenly all over <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, and in a generous amount. there was also a generous amount of potato chips on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, which gave it such a nice crunch with every bite. i don't think that i had a bite of that burger that didn't have a bit of potato chip in it. the thousand island dressing on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was also delicious. the entire burger was just so good, right down to the bun. with just one bite, even the empress could taste the deliciousness. even her own vegetarian burger was delicious, which in itself is not something you'd expect to eat at a place like holstein's where it's all about the beef.\n\neven the fries and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> that we shared were awesomely done. both of the sides were nice and thick, and in, yet again, generous portions, which i can really appreciate. we couldn't even finish all of it because <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were so good and filling, and there was just so much in general.\n\noverall, holstein's provided a 5/5 experience for us through and through. i only wish we'd had enough time to go back there to try more of their wonderful creations. i know there wasn't one burger on that menu that i didn't want to try. \n\nif ever you find yourself in vegas, i would say to make a point to try out holstein's."

            "as soon as i got to vegas, the gf and i were starving so we met up with my friend (fellow yelper!) and went down to holsteins as per his recommendation! we went there around 3-4ish during a football game so it was relatively busy. we had to wait a short time and were immediately seated. the first thing is that we were sitting there for about 15-20 minutes of absolutely no service. i flagged down one waitress to address the issue which she said she would resolve. another 10 minutes pass and i had to flag down another bus boy which he actually went to our waiter and had him take our order. i understand that the restaurant was busy but 30 minutes without any attention to a table is quite absurd, especially for vegas status!\n\nwhen the waiter finally arrived, we ordered the smoking passion float and a artichoke guac to start. holsteins is known to have their spiked shakes and we had to try one. the smoking passion float came with 2 mango meringues that were made in front of us with liquid nitrogen hence the name \"smoking\" passion float. the shake itself was so sweet that the taste of any alcohol was absent from our taste buds. the artichoke guac was a meaty starter with some nice spiced pita chips. it was a great way to start off our meal with some sweetness from the shake and some savoriness from the dip.\n\nfor our entree, the gf and i split a <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> with a side of steak fries. the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> was cooked to perfection (medium) and the steak fries were great. although the steak fries did remind of a better quality version of potato wedges from kfc. \n\noverall my eating experience was great, the initial waiting experience did turn me off about this place and my friend assured me that this was the first time that this kind of service happened. i'm sure i will come here again but i'm hoping that this waiting game doesn't having again.", 
            "the lobster mac and cheese is to die for, the <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark> & the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> are amazing...and that's just the appetizer menu... my favorite burgers are the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> along with their steak cut fries...omg. the shakes.... really... by far \"the campfire s'mores\"...best atmosphere and customer service in vegas...there's no way i'd go to to the cosmopolitan and not check out this place.....", 
            "very disappointing.\n\nour group came here starving and we were all very excited. not only did everything look good on the menu, but it was highly rated on yelp, and our waitress spoke highly of several dishes. \n\nwe ordered a bunch of things: calamari, lobster truffle mac & cheese, fried pickle, and several burgers. the majority of the group ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, because it was the most popular and it won \"best burger in vegas\" 2 years and i ordered the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>.\n\nunfortunately, only the calamari was good amongst the starters. the lobster truffle mac & cheese was not cheesy at all and lacking in flavor, the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> were okay and i've definitely had better. i did enjoy the calamari though. it was fried perfectly so it was crispy and i loved the spicy kick in the tomato sauce.\n\nnow, for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. wow. what a major disappointment. we all ordered our burgers medium rare and medium, but they were all overcooked to well done and it was so burnt that all you could taste was the smoky flavors of the charcoal. definite plus that the patties are grilled over charcoal and has a smoky flavor, but the whole thing is not supposed to taste overly smoky! the taste was so overpowering that we couldn't taste anything else on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and all of us were poking at our patties and extremely annoyed.\n\ni definitely do not recommend dining here especially since it's overpriced and not very tasty.", 
            "after objectively evaluating this place in my head, i gotta stick ya with a three... maybe i'm a burger snob... maybe i'm too spoiled by the absolute majesty that is lunchbox laboratory here in seattle... but when it comes down to it... <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was just good. nothing to really write home about and pretty pricey when it all comes down to it. i ordered the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>, a kobe beef patty with cheese and potato chips... it was good... but i'd rather call it the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>... definitely not deserving of the double nom and far from the omnomnoms majesty that is lunchbox laboratory.\n\ntheir spiked milkshakes were super good. but that really wasn't enough to push the score higher.\n\nthe ambiance is fantastic though, a great vibe, excellent service, but then again... i come to expect that in vegas... so this ends up being a wash... it's all about perspective ya dig?\n\ni don't believe i'd go again... but thanks for the treat and really... it wasn't bad... i'm just spoiled.\n\n3 one-nom-...-just-one stars out of 5",

            "okay so once again i'm going to disagree with my fellow yelp reviewers and say that i was not wowed by my meal at holsteins shakes and buns, and i think there are better burger places in vegas. holsteins is located at the cosmopolitan hotel and casino directly across the entrance to the marquee pool and day club. because of the location you will need to have a reservation or be prepared to wait with the diva's and meat sticks that frequent the place.  we did have a reservation and were seated on time. the decor at holsteins is eighties cool. cartoon artwork dots the walls, boom boxes are painted in bright colors and a huge pink cow welcomes you in the bar area. after looking over the menu, my wife simone ordered the meatball parm sliders and i ordered the nom-<mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> topped with melted cheese, potato chips and house made thousand island dressing. the food came out fairly quickly, and on the side i had some tasty crunchy potato stick thin <mark>French Fries</mark>. my burger however was overcooked ( ordered medium and got well done). an overcooked burger made with fresh ground meat ends up tasting like sawdust, and this was the case. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> could have been saved by the dressing, but there was very little of the dressing on it. the chips on top were the best part of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. medium thin hand cut and fried perfectly, they stayed crispy on the sandwich and gave a nice contrast to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, but overall this burger sounded better then it tasted. simone's sliders were the exact opposite of my burger. the meatballs had great garlicky flavor, they were moist, tender and tasted fresh. they were topped with a mixture of sweet marinara and basil pesto and lots of melted creamy mozzarella. i so wanted to steal them from her and i had total meat envy.  we finished off the meal with a reese pb adult shake spiked with frangelico called the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>.  any monkey that could get drunk off this would have to be a lightweight because i could taste no alcohol in it whatsoever. it was still good, once again just not as good as advertised.  so in the end i would have given holsteins a 2 star rating for my food however simone's sliders choice saved the day...so overall holsteins gets a three stars from me.",

            "holsteins was bustling with activity when i went on a recent sunday afternoon.  the restaurant was brightly lit and loud.  there was a game on the televisions in the bar, and as a result, the bar was packed.  after waiting ten minutes for a table, we were seated at a comfortable table.  our server was attentive and friendly.  she acknowledged us promptly and took our drink orders.  she provided several suggestions, and when i asked about the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>, she informed me that it was done as a charity promotion but was so popular, they kept it on the menu.  \n\nafter serving us drinks, she provided us with a small bucket of popcorn.  cute. and tasty.  i am sort of a popcorn kind of guy.  you probably didn't know that about me, and probably didn't want to know that about me. there are more things i can share, but i won't.  the popcorn was fresh and warm.  it also had a distinct flavor that was hard to place.  i thought it could have been a pickle flavor seasoning.  hey, i am at a burger place, right?  it was salt and vinegar.  tasty.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came out quickly, and cooked to specification.  i asked for a little bit of pink, and that is what i got.  i had the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>.  it was tasty.  it could have been better.  the menu billed it as kobe beef.  at $16.50 for an 8 ounce burger, i can assure you this is not authentic kobe beef.  the first kobe beef in the last two years in vegas is at city center.  they are charging $35 an ounce.  so, maybe they are billing the wagyu as kobe beef.  or maybe it is the kobe style beef.  who knows.  i just know it wasn't what was billed.  \n\nwe skipped <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> because we were trying to eat on the cheap.  a diet coke, an iced tea, and two sandwiches came out to $42.  a little pricey in my opinion.  but, considering where i am, i don't mind paying for it.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, as i mentioned was cooked perfectly.  the bun was firm, but a little on the plain and boring side.  the fries, i got the shoe string, my companion got the thick fries, were hot, salted and well seasoned.  i preferred the shoe string fries over the thick fries.  so did my friend.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was topped with white cheddar, potato chips and thousand island.  there was barely any sauce.  the chips covered the perfectly melted cheese.  i was surprised that there was no additional garnish present.  no pickle, tomato, onion or lettuce on the plate.  not even a sprig of parsley.  at these prices, surely they could toss something in.  applebee's even garnishes their plates with a sprig of inedible, icky kale.\n\ni didn't get a chance to sample the liquor malts, but rest assured, next time i go, i won't be driving, so i will definitely take a taste.", 
            "i want to give this place a better review since it's at my favorite spot on the trip - the cosmopolitan.  the thing is...<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was not very good.  my wife and i split the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> (kobe beef, potato chips, thousand island dressing) thinking it would be something we couldn't find somewhere else.  the beef patty was overcooked and did not seem to be seasoned.  the potato chips were a nice touch and appeared to be made in house.  the hamburger was simply lacking flavor.  i'll say that we enjoyed the <mark>French Fries</mark> that came with the hamburger (and all hamburgers at holsteins.)  the beer selection was admirable and allowed me to an ipa that i've not had before.  too bad for you that i can't remember the name.  overall, i think that i'd go back because i got the feeling that they could do better.  casual, relatively affordable and average from most angles.  a safe bet if you are already in the cosmopolitan, but not worth a special trip.", 
            "well, just a few days ago i learned that holsteins prepares a damn fine burger--and a superior chocolate shake!  after being escorted to a comfortable corner booth, we began with complimentary freshly popped popcorn.  it was unnecessary but good.  \n\nnext came juicy <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> with a really good caper mayo dressing.  a hot and crisp outer shell encased a scorching hot but very tasty pickle interior that truly satisfied after the breaded spears were dipped in the mellow mayo.  meanwhile, i had a hard time deciding whether i preferred the delicious chocolate milk shake with chocolate syrup or the thick and sweet whipped cream that took up one-fourth of the drink's height.  i even lamented to diane that it was too bad that there wasn't more liquid in the shake until she reminded me that the silver canister set down on the table with the shake contained still more chocolatey fluid (about a quarter of a tall glassful).  and, so it did!    \n\nthen <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fries arrived.  for me, a classic with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, onions, and ketchup was medium rare as ordered, and happily contained no visible char.  there was an excellent grilled taste to the meat, and although the plain bun and solid sheet of green lettuce were not my favorites, there was no question that this was a top-tier burger, and i had no problem finishing off the ample half-pounder, along with the tasty shoestring fries that accompanied it.\n\nmeanwhile, diane clearly enjoyed her medium-rare <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> with kobe beef and cheddar cheese, as well as fulfilling fat fries.  our server was slow in executing what he promised, but was busy with a mostly full house and eventually came through with water refills, extra ketchup, and a salt shaker as hard driving music enveloped the cow-adorned dining room. \n\nit was a nice, filling, and satisfying dinner, which i expect to repeat despite the next day's uptick on the home scale.", 
            "when i had to make my way across the \"skywalk\" to work on the other side of the street, i always took a \"short cut\" through the cosmo upstairs.  after our dinner at china poblano, i learned to pay more attention to what else was up there, which was the reason why i zeroed in on holstein's.  and hey - any restaurant serving burgers that even utilizes the cow's freakin' name, had better be ready to 'bring it', as far as i'm concerned.  so when bear and i selected it for our burger fix, we were prepared for - at the very least - a 'transformative experience.'\n\nso was it that kind of deal? nope, not really.  but you could do so much worse.\n\nfirst of all - as promised - i have to give a shout-out to our server, amanda.  just that right, attractive combination of smiles, sass and 'savoir faire'' (note to managers: get this woman a raise, stat!) i've always loved that in the better restaurants in town, the staff always have an 'inside/out' knowledge of the menu and the daily specials, and in this particular area, amanda did not disappoint. (which is why holstein's gets an extra star.)  with so many different styles of burger to choose from, it could have been an all-day task to select just one, but with her help, i chose the nom-<mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> ($16.50), while bear went \"classic\" and got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> ($17.50). \n\npricey? well, duh! what does anybody expect when they're using kobe and dry- aged sirloin to craft the frickin' burgers? (and don't forget - this is a 'strip' joint we're talking about here, people!) and while we waited - but not for long - we got to check out the unique decor that included anime-style artwork of the holstein's \"mascot\".  cute...especially considering that he's on the menu as well as the wall!\n\nfor our 'intro', we had the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> ($12.00) a cluckin'-good twist on chili con queso served with warm tortilla chips, and bear's 'de rigeur' item to try, the cuban street tacos ($13.00) a delicious menage-a-trois of roast pork, ham and swiss lovingly drizzled with pickle and spicy mustard aioli. the bite i had of one of them made me wonder if i should've gotten a separate appetizer as well....\n\nand then came the burgs.  bear liked his standard just fine, and i added some 'meat candy' (aka bacon!) to my nom-nom for about two bucks more. i didn't know if i expected a burger with barbecue potato chips and 1000 island dressing to actually work, but damn if didn't, and in quite a tasty way, too. (but then again...name one thing that doesn't taste better with bacon on it.)  it was quite the stunning companion to my frozen grasshopper shake ($11.00).  and the fries served with were just the way i like them: crispy, spicy shoestrings, with none of the greasiness you get from other burger joints.\n\nso, sure, holstein's is giving up burgers, but not at jack-in-the-box prices, so it's always best to keep that in mind.  and as repeat visits go, i think we can file this one under \"special occasions\" mostly.  and we will always ask to be seated in amanda's section...", 
            "after the less than underwhelming lunch we had the day before at bobby flays mesa grill, i was reluctant to do burgers again but i'm so very glad i did. holsteins does right everything that bobby flay's does wrong. the service was attentive, upbeat, got our order correct and the food was spot on!\ni enjoyed the candy cane boozy shake which was very yummy and almost a meal in itself...but the winner was <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. i had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger and it definitely lived up to its name. perfectly cooked to medium; bacon had a good bite to it, not too much lettuce and tomato so that it complimented instead of overwhelmed <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. the aioli was super yum too. the seasoning on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> enhanced the meat but the star was the meat itself. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was tender, juicy, and was as it should be if you were making it on your own grill at home. i had the shoestring fries which were clearly hand cut and cooked to order. they were crunchy on the outside but fluffy on the inside.\nmy husband had the nom-<mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>. he initially took the chips off <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> but put them back on when he saw how much they complimented his burger and added the perfect crunch. he orders his burgers well done and the waitress didn't even flinch as some often do. it was done perfectly...and still had that juiciness that a good burger should have without the redness.\nwe will absolutely be back to try more yummy goodness at holsteins. thank you for renewing my confidence that there can be upscale burgers that are truly done right.", 
            "five stars.  \n\nthey rocked it like a good burger should be done.  \n\nminor annoyance: do not settle for the table in the dining room that is closes to the bar side entrance.  way too much foot traffic coming by all the time...felt like maybe 1000 people walked behind my during our quick dinner.\n\nburger taste:  off the hook.  the nom-<mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> was amazing.  well worth a repeat visit!!", 
            "i really enjoyed my meal at holstein's when we visited las vegas last week.  it is one of those places that executes both substance and style very well.  i loved the theme and all of the art and design elements here.  i also really liked the food too.  it was just a good all around dining experience.\n\nmy order consisted of the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> (kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips, 1000 island dressing) and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  both were good, and i was very happy with what i chose to order.  the only thing that was not good was the complementary can of popcorn that was brought to our table while waiting for our food.  it had an excessive amount of sauce on it that tasted like butter mixed with vinegar.  otherwise, i was very satisfied. \n\nthere are lots of choices of places to eat when on the strip in las vegas, but i was glad that we came across holstein's.  i was pleasantly surprised with my lunch, and i would love to eat here again the next time i am in las vegas.",

            "first thing, that catches your eye while wondering around the fabulous cosmopolitan hotel is this restaurant. at first look, it might be just another trendy bar with cute graffiti d\\u00e9cor (happy looking cows and chickens with smiles on their faces) but step in and look a little closer and you will realize that yes, this is a bar/lounge in the front but in the back it is a full fledged running restaurant with tables and table-booths! \n\nwe decided to stop by and try this place out before we left vegas (le sigh it is always hard to part with such an awesome city). the hostess were very sweet and little ditsy but heck they made us laugh! \nwe were seated right away which was impressive at almost 5:30pm on a weekday. the lounge/bar area was busy and so was the restaurant. \nwe settled into our table-booth, which was comfortable even though we were sandwich in-between, two other parties, we were handed our menus. this place has almost everything you could ask for:\n\nshakes (bam -boozled shakes)\nipa's\nbeer\nwine\none of a kind cocktails\n\nbut what i liked most was the free tin of freshly popped popcorn they bring to your table along with large ketchup and mustard bottles. who knew that ketchup or mustard would taste so good on popcorn!\n\nall their burgers are made to order and are fresh, natural with organic ingredients!\n\nwith so many options on their menu, it was hard to choose just one burger. \n\ni decided on the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>- no bun, kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips, 1000 island dressing\n\ni have to admit i was never the kind if girl to put potato chips or even fries on my burgers. i use to watch my friends do it and think it probably tastes weird! but screw that though i told myself i'm going in!\n\nafter ordering, it does take awhile and patience is a total virtue, that is when people watching takes place! and believe me it is a fun place to watch all the out of water tourists!  one guy was seated at a table next to us and was told he could not have his large hurricane glass at the table. you would have thought he was told that there was no strip clubs in vegas! he tried to tell the hostess that he was not going to drink it, not believing him she told him that she would hold it up at the front for him. still the look on his face was priceless!\n\nour burgers came out larger than life (or maybe that was my hunger talking) i had to try some of minh's <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> (which were delicious) i could have ate them all except i was given the \"eye\" so i swiped two more and went back to my burger! \n\nit was the perfect burger, cheesy with just the right amount of dressing and chips! <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was wonderful, full of flavor not a dry bite at all!\n\nbe warned their burgers do fill you up fast, even though i opted not to have the bun i got full half way through! i forced myself to finish this epic burger, which i am 50/50 that i did. 50% happy because it was yummy, the other 50% was left being uncomfortable for a while as my burger settled in my tummy! \n\nservice was great, and the prices were decent for being on the strip!", 
            "i had the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>- it was okay, that's about it.  i think i might have enjoyed a quarter pounder with cheese slightly more.  i had the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>- they tasted pretty good, but i was immediately ill after eating them.  no one else i was dining with got sick and i was the only one to eat <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>- maybe the batter was bad, but i had an immediate date with the bathroom.\n\notherwise, the service was slightly less than what i expect in vegas and the restaurant was incredibly loud.  i know, this makes me sound old and cranky, but the noise factor made the dining experience less than pleasurable.  i probably wouldn't go back.", 
            "hostess: friendly and prompt, she took down my info and told me they would text when a table was ready. that's an awesome feature. who wants to stand in front of holsteins for 30 min when you can grab a drink and sit in the sports book?! i received the text, although we snagged a spot at the bar before it came. \n\nfood:\ntruffle lobster mac n cheese ($16.50 - creamy tallegio-marscapone sauce w/ maine lobster and black truffle) was a fail. two bartenders told us is was their fave dish on the menu. unfortunately, the joy only lasted for two bites. it tasted like a good mac n cheese that got drowned in truffle oil before it was sent out. that first bite is so rich and then you get that thick oil aftertaste. boo. we left half of it there and i refuse to have anything with truffle oil for the next month {---- not true\n\n<mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> ($16.50 - kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips, 1000 island) is a hard item to review. on one hand, the beef was realllllly good. flavorful, moist, cooked to a perfect medium. on the other hand, the toppings added 0. my theory is they need to triple what they put on top <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. when you serve a thick burger you need equally thick toppings, otherwise you get one bite toppings and then three bites beef....repeat. conceptually awesome, it failed to execute.\n\ndrinks:\nginger julie ($13 - muddled mint & lemon, canadian whiskey, ginger ale) had no bite.\n \nrhubarb pie bam-boozled shake ($11 - absolut hibiscus, rhubarb compote, cornmeal crumble) was delicious...but again, lacked any bite. should you be getting drunk off of milkshakes? probably not, but it's a hella good way to go out, no?!\n\nwould i come back here? yep. would i order differently? yep. will i finally end this review? sure.",

            "pretty good place located in the cosmopolitan for a great tasting burger. while i don't believe it's at the same level as burgr by gordon ramsey in planet hollywood, they still offer delicious burgers and shakes, nonetheless, and should definitely be given a shot!\n\nthe place -\nas i mentioned, holstein's is located in the cosmopolitan and is centrally located with everything else. it's fairly easy to find and doesn't require a great deal of navigation. casino's in vegas can tend to be very large and trying to find a restaurant within one is a challenge within itself, but holstein's wasn't too hard to spot. at first glance, the place itself looks like a glorified cafe as the restaurant is very open in terms of people on the outside of the restaurant being able to look in. the decor is pretty modern, the bar is a pretty good size, and there's also, what seemed to be an impromptu, lounge area right in front of the bar for people to come in, sit on couches and socialize while still being able to enjoy the menu and the drinks. the lounge being right in front of the bar didn't look all that comfortable and appealing; however, with the right group of people and the right amount of drinks, i'm sure it would be fine for most haha. because i sat at the bar, i didn't get a chance to see the rest of the restaurant; however, the kitchen looks to be exposed so that people can look in on the action going on at the back of the house and, as a customer, that's always interesting and nice to see. not too bad, holstein's.\n**** 4/5 stars ****\n\nthe service -\ni was in vegas for a conference and i came to holstein's right after the last session ended, which was around 5:00pm or so on a thursday. there, unfortunately, was no hostess to greet me; however, i chalk that up to them being particularly busy and probably running around. no biggie on my end as i was gonna end up sitting at the bar anyways, which i did; however, if i was a party hoping to get a table, having no hostess at the front would certainly make me question. i found an open seat at the bar and immediately by one of the most friendliest faces i've seen during my visit in vegas. she was entertaining, down to earth, willing to talk with everyone at the bar, and wasn't afraid to razzle folks to try and get them to smile, which i didn't mind at all. the great service continued throughout with her making sure i was taken care of and when she had to leave for the day she made every effort to make sure i was ok and gave the next bartender updates on all her guests, which is always nice to see rather than someone leaving the next person in the dark. great service, holstein's and shout out to bridgot for making my trip to holstein's wonderful!!\n***** 5/5 stars *****\n\nthe food -\njust like any other of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> joints located in vegas, there are many different options to choose from. each burger has its own signature ingredient and level of appeal for everyone. with that being said, it'll be pretty difficult for someone to not find a burger that sounds delicious as there are many different burgers to indulge in. i settled for the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> (see picture) and decided to have that served with some <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> instead of fries. first, the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. definitely not the best <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> i've had in my life as you can probably tell they just came from a bag in the freezer; however, it got the job done and satisfied my craving for them. the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>, which is kobe beef, cheddar cheese, 1000 island dressing, and potato chips (yes...potato chips....don't lie and say you never put potato chips in your cold cut sandwiches as a kid....i don't care who you are, everyone did that and you would swear it was the best thing ever! haha). <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was perfectly cooked, the cheddar cheese and 1000 island dressing gave it that zest and creaminess it needed and then finally, the homemade potato chips, as it did in cold cut sandwiches, gave that textural difference and crunchiness that we always desire in our food. the only gripe i have about the potato chips is that there was no flavor to them, it was literally just there for the crunch, i wish they would've seasoned them with something to make it pop more. other than that, i was fairly satisfied with my selection. good job, holstein's.\n**** 4/5 stars ****\n\noverall -\nlike i said, after comparing <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> that i've had from burgr to holstein's, i would definitely choose burgr; however, if you happen to be in the cosmo and the mood for having a burger strikes you, this place can definitely deliver. i look forward to coming back and trying out the other options like the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, but all in all, not too shabby holstein's! thanks!", 
            "this is an ok place.  i probably would have rated it 4 stars based on my first visit but my second visit was disappointing so it evens out to 3 stars.   a word of caution, if you get a hamburger, (i got the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>) be careful as they are hot.  hot enough to burn your mouth.  it's a good burger, the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> are really good but the shakes are just standard - at least my chocolate shake was.   that was my first visit and i would have said it was a 4 star experience.   the second time i got the truffle lobster mac and cheese (almost $17) and the philly <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> ($13).  while the food was good, especially the <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> i felt taken.  the amount of food for almost $30 that you receive was pathetic.  i was completely blown away.  i wish i would have gone elsewhere and had it not been for my first experience here i would have rated this place a 1 star joint.  i would recommend this place if you don't order anything from the nosh menu, unless of course you're just rolling it and don't care to be ripped off.",

            "i've stayed at the cosmo several times and i always stop by here, it can get pretty crowded around peak times, but anything worth doing in vegas is the same. \n\nthe food:\nthe last time i was here i had the philly eggroll and the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>. the philly eggroll was actually really tasty and flavorful and i would definitely get it again. the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> (burger with chips and cheese inside) was on the salty side for me.\n\nthe highlight:\nthe highlight of this place every single time is the milkshakes. whether you get them alcoholic or non-alcoholic, they are absolutely delicious. i tried the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>, the banana cream pie, and <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>, and they are all soooooo good. i only wish they were only 24/7 so i can grab one after leaving the club. thumbs up!", 
            "extremely attractive burger joint at the cosmo....but why are these places so noisy? guess i'm not the youthful demographic these places covet. nothing wrong with holsteins. the food and the service are just fine..its just always loud  and seemingly always crowded. my son and i each had the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>...kobe beef with cheddar cheese, potato chips and 1000 island dressing. it was delicious. my wife had the <mark>California Turkey</mark> and gave it a thumbs up. my daughter had <mark>The Classic</mark> burger and enjoyed it as well. fries come free with big bun burgers like we ordered. prices are what you'd expect from a high end casino. we all enjoyed ourselves..just please turn down the volume!", 
            "<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are by far the best i've had in a long time. they are pricy for burgers and shakes, buts it's well worth it. you will leave the restaurant full and satisfied. i had the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>, which had pepper jack cheese and potato chips inside  my honey had the caliente burger, which was very flavorful, but not too spicy. we had \"grown up\" (contained alcohol) shakes. if you're like me and have a sweet tooth you will be in shake heaven!!!! if you're in vegas this is a must have!!! it's too bad there isn't one in cali. 5 stars and a !", 
            "wow... this establishment turned out to be a home run!\n\nwe were in las vegas attending a tradeshow and ventured out to holsteins on a recommendation of a friend. holstein is located on the second floor of the cosmopolitan. just go up the escalator near the entrance of casino/hotel adjacent to las vegas blvd. and you'll see it.\n\nfirst off, don't let the prices discourage you. it is very much worth it. it can be a little out of the way, but the trip is definitely worth it as well. for a burger entree, expect to pay $16-20 depending on which burger  you get.\n\nwe came in for lunch around 2pm on a friday. there wasn't any wait and we were seated immediately. the waitress was extremely nice and accommodating. i did catch her name, but my receipt says her name is tiffany.\n\nthere's a lot of good burger options and it was kind of difficult to find the one that i wanted to try. i ended up with the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was really good. more like amazing! the <mark>French Fries</mark> that came with the meal wasn't bad either. there wasn't anything really special about the <mark>French Fries</mark>.\n\nmy two colleagues both ordered classic burgers. i think they were a little more old school and wanted something less fancy smancy. totally a preference thing. both of them are usually pretty talkative, but once the food came out and they bit into their burgers, the table pretty much became silent. that's usually a sign that the food was really good. they thoroughly enjoyed their burgers and definitely agreed that it was worth the money.\n\ni rate holsteins 5 stars out of 5. great food. great service. burgers are amazing. service is quick. there's not a whole lot to complain about. it was definitely a solid experience. if there was something to complain about, it would be the price, but given that it was las vegas it was ball park. we have had more expensive food that was drastically less tasty.\n\ntips: if you aren't near the cosmo, holsteins might be a little out of the way, definitely make an effort to go.\n\nholstein charges $3.95 for iced tea. might be the case with other establishments in the area as well.\n\nprepare to be very lost with burger options... so many good signature burgers... maybe review the menu before hand?? i was torn between 3 or 4 burgers but ended up choosing the nom nom (kobe beef, potato chips, island dressing). no idea why... :p\n\ndon't be afraid to ask for directions... i think all the casinos are designed to be death traps and mazes.", 
            "realllly good burgers here. like, in the top 5 of of the best burgers i've ever had kind of good.  i had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> dry-aged sirloin burger with cheddar goat cheese and bacon.  the texture was of a ridiculous melt in your mouth quality.  my husband had the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> with chips, which he also said was one of the best he's had (and he almost always orders a burger when out to eat). we split a chocolate malt, which was off the charts delicious and fresh-tasting. seriously have never had a malt so good. i wish i'd had more room to try a different shake, but we walked out with leftovers so i wasn't up for dessert. \n\non the service side of things, we were given our choice of sitting in couches at low tables by the bar or a table. we chose a table and were seated immediately. atmosphere is on the loud side, especially for a week-day, but it wasn't bothersome. they didn't have the beer i originally wanted, but the waiter immediately offered me another one from the same brewery, which was helpful.  our waiter walked the balance between attentive and giving us enough space to enjoy our food. \n\nwe stayed at the cosmopolitan, but this was the only restaurant we tried, aside from secret pizza and room service. i would probably choose to go back here over trying one of the other restaurants, simply because the food was so good and there were so many other items i wanted to try (shakes with booze, for starters!).",

            "they should rename this place holsteins beers and buns. the beer selection was amazing and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable in all 132 beers! \n\nafter ordering our beers, it was time to pick a burger. i had the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>. this was kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chops and 1,000 island dressing. i wasn't impressed with my burger, it was just okay. i asked for medium and it came out well done so my burger was pretty dry and lacking juices. \n\nmy boyfriend got <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> (beef patty crusted with black pepper, holsteins creamy steakhouse sauce, tomato confit, marmalade onions, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>, and swiss cheese). this was much better than my burger! however, he ordered medium rare and it was more cooked than he wanted. \n\nwe both got fries with our burgers and they were just okay. we like our fries more crispy. our favorite part of our meals were our beers. we are interested in coming back for another drink sometime!", 
            "located in the cosmopolitan hotel. the things to get is located in their title: shakes and bun. \nit's not a bad place but i do however think i rather spend my money at bachi than here. considering that their milkshake(booze or no booze) it's $9 and $13 if it is, that's just way too expensive even if it does taste good. obviously recommend the cookies and cream and they even serve you the rest in an other cup since it doesn't fit the whole cup. \n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are okay. i got the longhorn burger and it was too heavy. the sauce was kinda drench making the buns a bit too drench. i had a bite of the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>, i would recommend that a lot more. still, bachi's burgers are a lot better and more fresh imo.", 
            "got here around 6pm on a thursday and was told our wait was around 25 mins. the hostess told us we can wait or leave our number just in case we decide to walk around. i left my number with her and decided to just wait there as well. after 25 mins, i decided to go up to the host stand and ask how much longer seeing people after us were being seated. the guy told me they put down the wrong number and that our table had been ready but didn't bother to walk 5 ft outside or ask for my name.\n\nservice 3/5 - service was okay. although the waiter did recommend things to go with our burger when we were ordering, we rarely saw him. he came by to refill my water once and then back again when we needed the check. i understand it gets busy here but he seemed all over the place and the busboy ended up helping us more.\n\nfood 5/5 - my bf got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and coffee & donuts shake while i got the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> and cookies & cream shake. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were cooked really well but i felt like the chips on my <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> tasted stale and just took them off. the fries that came with them were good but after that i was so full i could barely finish my shake. the shakes we got supposedly have alcohol in them but you don't taste any, however they did taste good for regular shakes. \n\nthe atmosphere was fun and modern with cartoon cows all over the place. there's also a bar if you wanted to grab drinks and i liked that they offer smaller tables near the front for drinks. \n\noverall, i would come back for the food and hope they work on their service.", 
            "i got the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> and loved it. perfect portion size of a large burger, but not too big to finish. it was actually pretty loud in this restaurant so be weary and the seats were kind of uncomfortable. but other than stuff that doesn't really matter, it was great. only big thing was that the shakes are massively overpriced. sometimes $15 for a single shake, but then again they did have alcohol in them so that makes it more worth it. i didn't end up getting a shake because of the price unfortunately, but the people next to us that had them looked quite satisfied with the shakes.", 
            "i was long over due to try this place out. we had stayed here several times and ate at other locations many times.\n\nwe came in to grab a late lunch. to start things off we ordered the korean 'bulgogi' quesadilla. we certainly did not need an appetizer, but it sounded to good to pass up. it comes stuffed with marinated steak, kimchi, asadero cheese, chili aioli & kalbi glaze. luckily it tastes as good as it sounds. it is good for 2 to 4 people. the flavors are great. you can taste each of the ingredients and they all bring something good it.\n\nfor my meal i chose the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>. it comes with kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips and 1000 island dressing. that list tells you everything you need to know about why i ordered it. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is large and filling. i was unable to finish it off. that being said, it was quite tasty. you get all the great flavors from the ingredients plus the added texture of the potato chips. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> also come with fries. the fries are good. they have good flavor and are the right amount of crisp.\n\nwe had to try the bam-boozled shakes as well. neither of us needed the additional food, but they sounded so good. i ordered the <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> shake. it comes mixed with zing red velvet vodka, <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark>, cream cheese mousse and a mini whoopee pie. yep, it was good. you get all the great flavor of red velvet with a little booze mixed in. the portion is large. it is a meal unto its self.\n\nthis is a good lunch or casual dinner spot. you could also stop in for a shake at any time. it is worth it.",

(hard to mess up anything deep fried lol) we swapped out the caper dressing for ranch. but there were other options available. \n\ni ordered the urth burger- the patty itself wasn't the greatest. it was okay as far veggie patties go, but seasoning wise...meh. the toppings were amazing though. the urtha burger came with avocado, sprouts, two slices of tomato, lettuce and cucumber. i added proval<mark>One <mark>Two Dollar Cheese</mark></mark>, but the list if options was pretty good (read: egg, salmon,  brisket, cheeses etc). \n\nmy husband ordered the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> medium, seemed slightly rarer than medium, so order up of your usual. he added and over easy egg toping and found it quite delicious. \n\nservice was good! everyone was friendly and nice about switching menu items (ie gluten free buns for white, cheddar for american etc)",

            "where do burgers like to dance? at a meat ball!\n\nwhere do i even begin with this place? from the atmosphere to the appetizer to the meals themselves, the experience was wonderful. \n\nfrom the moment that we arrived at the restaurant, we were very impressed with the atmosphere that it gave off. being that the majority of the cosmopolitan is very dark and sleek looking, there was a bit of juxtaposition that takes place with having a place like holstein's in there. the lighting inside of the restaurant gives off a very warm and inviting vibe, and there's all sorts of cool (cow-related) artwork filling the inside of the restaurant. it's very fun!\n\non a friday night, we were seated immediately, which kind of surprised me, being that holstein's is in a very popular hotel on the strip, and on a night where people are usually out and about. i probably helped that we got there before the clubbing crowd hit, though, so there's that. either way, it was fast, and i like that! then, as soon as we were seated, we were brought our complimentary popcorn appetizer, which, i must say, was quite the tasty start to our meal. i actually had to make an effort to not fill up on the popcorn too much before the we got our actual burgers.\n\nbefore we even got our burgers, though, i made sure to check in on yelp! and boy am i glad that i did, because we were able to snag a free beer through a promotion that they have going on with yelp, wherein you get a free beer with your first check-in to the restaurant. i didn't finish it because of how tasty and filling <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fries were, but it was really nice! i got a tiny bit of 'tude from the waiter when asking about the promotion, but i can look past that.\n\nwhen we finally got our food (which didn't take very long at all), it looked so delicious that i had a hard time stopping to take some pictures of it to accompany my review. i ordered the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>, which consisted of kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips, and thousand island dressing, and the empress, miss joyce w. ordered the urth burger, a vegetarian burger consisting of a house made vegan patty with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sprouts, and avocado. \n\nas soon as i took a bite of my burger, i knew instantly that it was without a doubt the best burger i've ever had. i don't know if it was some sort of placebo effect caused by my knowing that <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was made with kobe beef, or that <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was just plain delicious, but man was it good. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was cooked to a perfect medium and the cheese was melted evenly all over <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, and in a generous amount. there was also a generous amount of potato chips on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, which gave it such a nice crunch with every bite. i don't think that i had a bite of that burger that didn't have a bit of potato chip in it. the thousand island dressing on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was also delicious. the entire burger was just so good, right down to the bun. with just one bite, even the empress could taste the deliciousness. even her own vegetarian burger was delicious, which in itself is not something you'd expect to eat at a place like holstein's where it's all about the beef.\n\neven the fries and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> that we shared were awesomely done. both of the sides were nice and thick, and in, yet again, generous portions, which i can really appreciate. we couldn't even finish all of it because <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were so good and filling, and there was just so much in general.\n\noverall, holstein's provided a 5/5 experience for us through and through. i only wish we'd had enough time to go back there to try more of their wonderful creations. i know there wasn't one burger on that menu that i didn't want to try. \n\nif ever you find yourself in vegas, i would say to make a point to try out holstein's."

            "after spending an hour at louis vuitton at crystals, i came here for dinner.  the place was not busy at 6:30 on a thursday night.  i was seated quickly and looked over the menu.  my server, kayla, brought me iced tea quickly and then i ordered.\n\ni got the <mark>El Caliente</mark> burger.  the menu describes it this way:  beef patty topped w/ pepper jack cheese, pickled jalapeno, avocado, pork chicharrones & tequila-cilantro mayo.  i asked for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> to be cooked rare and it came out just that way.  score.\n\nthere's a lot going on with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  while there is some spiciness from the jalape\\u00f1o, que no es real caliente.  this is something that anyone can eat unless they have no tolerance at all for anything that has the slightest spiciness.\n\nthe chicharrones with the cheese and soft meat was a nice combination of textures. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was very juicy and i had to use my napkin several times to keep from getting juices from fingers to clothes.  the fries were good.  they didn't need salt which was good because there were no salt nor pepper shakers in sight.\n\ni passed on dessert because it was more of a share kind of thing and i didn't want four brownies, two dips of ice cream and all the other accouterments that went with the dessert i was thinking of ordering.\n\nservice was good.  i felt sorry for kayla because access to the table i was at was partially blocked by a stroller from the family at the next table./  their kids were very good and it was <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> of one of them and the staff brought him a milkshake with a candle.  a note to the parents--leave the damn webster's elementary dictionary in the room.  you don't have to look up words and discuss with your kids at dinner.\n\na pleasant meal.", 
            "after seeing the place on the food network,we decided it was someplace we wanted to visit while we were in vegas.  \n\nmade a reservation on open table while at the mgm for a show, and took a stroll down the strip and made it in plenty of time before our reservation. situated in the cosmo it's pretty easy to find if you just follow your nose.   they were happy to seat us early even though it was a little busy.  \n\nthe menu is a bit to take in as there is so much that looks so good... how do you decide.  i opted for the holstein beef sliders and my companion went for something a little more spicy the <mark>El Caliente</mark>.  \n\nmy sliders were really good.  not over cooked, and a great size for the buns they were served on.  and as everyone else has stated, the homemade ketchup rocked!  \n\ni'm not really into the spicy stuff, but i did have a small taste and it was pretty good.  i could also tell by the lack of conversation and the amount of time it took him to eat it.. was later reported to be very good and a decent size for a large appetite.   i was able to snake a few of his fries and could really only finish 2 of the 3 sliders so they worked out well.  \n\nit's always fun to explore new places when you are out of town.  stop in and explore this place for sure.", 
            "wow, one of my favorite spots we tried during our weekend visit.  great burgers and awesome milkshakes, what more do you need?  how about <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> (amazing) or bulgogi quesidillas (yum).  i tried the <mark>El Caliente</mark>*  burger - \nbeef patty topped w/ pepper jack cheese, pickled jalapeno, avocado, pork chicharrones & tequila-cilantro mayo.  yes chicharrones, never thought about mixing the 2 but man this was a memorable experience.  very cool concept and will return next time in vegas.", 
            "i had <mark>The Classic</mark> burger which was only a 3 out of 5.  my burger was cold when i got it and the fries were ok.  the other diner in my party had the <mark>El Caliente</mark> burger which was spicy and good- a 4 out of 5 stars.  one problem with this restaurant is that it smells like cigarette smoke from the casino below.  our server was very nice.", 
            "perfect example of customer service overcoming inconvenience; this was a great example of how a smile and forming a comfortable relationship with clientele can save a marginal experience. \n\nthis was a later night during this trip, and as such, it was after ten p.m. when we rolled in here for an impromptu meal. because it was late, they had turned the music up significantly and had a dj spinning the beats, and let's say it was loud. not that you're walking in not knowing that but by this time our choices were limited. after only a few moments, our waiter sam greeted us, and we explained the music level was loud enough we were not even sure we'd be staying. sam offered an inviting and also understanding smile and offered to check in with us again in a few more minutes. i have to admit, the humor, the charm, and charisma helped; plus another look at the menu. \n\nwe found ourselves able to ignore the volumes and all of us found items suitable to our tastes for dining. nice menu selection, keeping in mind it is of course a burger and shake kind of place, but at the same time  it didn't overwhelm the senses. several appetizers, smaller and larger variations of the shakes, desserts, and burgers for everyone. i went with the <mark>El Caliente</mark>; once served hardly a word was spoken. good quality meat, nicely balanced seasoning, delicious bun. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were underwhelming, not bad just okay. i enjoyed the presentation, it was appropriately fun for the style of place. \n\ni wish i'd had room for a desert but that wasn't happening. again with our waiter, what a difference a warm, humorous person with an understanding smile makes. sam made good conversation, was funny, and made what seemed like it would be a marginal or questionable experience very pleasant.", 
            "first let me say, this review might have scored differently had it been 7pm instead of 10:30pm, but i will also say this would have gone a lot different if sam didn't save the night.\n\nwe had a couple of drinks at the chandelier bar directly across the way.  it was our wedding anniversary and we were out with a couple of friends.  we decided to go with holsteins instead of china poblano based on yelp reviews.  as we left the bar the music in the area went from background dance music for the night club on the other side of the room, to deafening.  we were greeted by the hostess who offered to seat us once we finished our drinks from the other bar.  that didn't sit so well with members of our group.  we walked around and debated skipping and going across the road to any of the dozens of places to eat, but my lazy kicked in and we decided to give it ago.\n\nback to holsteins, sans our cocktails, greeted by the same hostess.  i mentioned it was a bummer of a policy, to which she stated don't shoot the messenger.  again, almost sent my friends into a tailspin, but we trudged on!\n\nonce seated, the music got louder. so loud we had to literally yell across the table to each other.  at this point we were all ready to leave, until sam greeted us.  he was so genuine and polite, i felt bad for him having to work right then!    we expressed the fact we were deciding to stay or go.  he completely understood and even offered to mention it to his manager, knowing full well nothing could be done.\n\nwe stuck it out.... the food was average.  we got 4 different full sized burgers and fries; classic, <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, <mark>El Caliente</mark>, and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (mine).  i'm on a burger mission this year, obviously, and i love teriyaki.  the meat was cooked properly and the bun wasn't soggy (all bonuses) but with all the other options out there, this place was underwhelming, especially with the other outside influences.  i'd say skip it.", 
            "holsteins is a good time, no alcohol required. you'll most likely be drunk though.\n\nthe place is nice, right across from marquee so the spot is perfect.\n\nthe food was pretty good too. the <mark>El Caliente</mark> burger was decent. you couldn't really taste much of the spice or the jalape\\u00f1o bits but overall it was passable. the lobster mac was cheesetastic.\n\ntheir shakes looked amazing, but we didn't try any :/\n\ndefinitely give it a shot.", 
            "have been wanting to try this place as a local hearing great things. amazing. from <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> to the beer selection to the shakes and awesome service. the <mark>El Caliente</mark> burger was perfect as was the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, which might be one of the better burgers i've had. highly recommended", 
            "on my prom night it was my first time attending this restaurant. i was looking for something fun, not super expensive. i ordered the coffee and donuts milkshake without the alcohol. i loved it! i have been craving it lol. i also order the <mark>El Caliente</mark> burger, the bun was super soft, and the burgar was just sooo good. also the fries. i loved the atmosphere, i also enjoyed the dj, he was fun. i am definitely going back again and ordering the same thing!", 
            "been here a couple times and i order the <mark>El Caliente</mark> burger which is quite good.  there are a wide variety of burgers to choose from and they are well crafted.  the shakes are a bit pricey because people really like them.  we were given a liquid nitrogen desert which was really cool.  you pop it in your mouth and then u start exhaling smoke.  that was fun.\n\nanyways, i would rate this as an upper tier burger joint and i will be back.", 
            "if the prices were lower i would give it 4 stars. i give it 3 because of the price compared to the quality of the food. the food wasn't bad, it was average. as such, i don't expect an average burger to be $15-$17. \nas for the ambiance- very cute and trendy. front half is loud and smokey, back half is quiet and intimate. take your pick. \n\nthey also serve a popcorn at your table. i knew it tasted familiar but couldn't put my finger on it...it was pizza flavored popcorn. interesting. \nwe ordered the following: \n1. <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark>- it was ok. we ordered some ranch to go with it and it made it much better. i would recommend that. \n2. <mark>El Caliente</mark> burger- i didn't have it, but i was told it was excellent by my dinner companion. no real feedback to offer. \n3. fun-ghi burger- it lacked all of the flavor i was expecting it to have. that was a bummer. it wasn't bad, it was just basic. for $18 i expect better than basic and a lot more flavor. the beef was a good selection, it was cooked perfectly at medium, it just lacked flavor.\n4. fries were ok\n5. <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> with panko break crumbs were good but also lacked flavor\n\n\nlike i said if it weren't pricey i'd give it 4 but i expect an $18 burger to be much more favorable. with all of the options for good food in vegas i wouldn't go back.", 
            "this restaurant is spacious with plenty of seating.\n\nfood\ngolden standard (4/5) - it's definitely a good old burger with bacon and good meat patty. \n<mark>El Caliente</mark> (5/5) - omg, from the crispy pork skin to the avocado cilantro mayo sauce...wow!\nlobster mac and cheese (2/5) - tasted bland. \nphilly <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> (3.5/5) - this was pleasantly tasty.",

            "picked holstein's for my birthday dinner over the weekend after reading the yelp reviews. delicious, split a bottle of bubbly with my friend, and we each ordered different burgers to share (<mark>Gold Standard</mark> & <mark>El Caliente</mark>), and had the fried pickle appetizers. \n\nvery rarely would i think dishes should be bigger, but i do think these burgers are so delicious, on top of their price that they could stand to be a little larger.\n\nupon flashing my id for my bday, another server appeared at our table, and made a couple of delicious dry-ice desserts for us. it was very cool to see, and the treats were delicious. i would eat here again and complete recommend washing down your burger with champagne."

            "i came here to have a good time and have great food, if i wanted to save my money; i would have gone to mc donald's.   holsteins has \"the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>\" you have pan seared <mark>Foie Gras</mark> ( huge 2 oz portion that you can defiantly see) and kobe beef ( grilled to perfection ) together with some port onions and truffle mayo!!!!  i was able to wash it down with a frosty brew ( over 100 different types ).   if you are, a huge fan of beer and burgers, then this is the palce for you!!  just remember to add bacon to whatever you choose, bacon makes everything better.  \n\n***remember*** \nvegas = money \nthat means you have to spend the money to make money.", 
            "i think i've decided that <mark>Foie Gras</mark> on a burge might sound good, but for some reason doesn't taste as delicious as i fantasize it would.  for my first holsteins experience i had the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> with the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was good.  it was juicy and flavorful, but i kinda wish i didn't have the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> as the expectation was way too high.  it was still pretty good though.\n\nthe shake was amazing.  i could taste all the bananas and reeses in it...sooo good!!!\n\nso my first experience was pretty good, and i will come back for more...althought it is no umami burger.",

            "so, when read on the menu that you can pay $28 for a <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>, you get the impression that you are in for a one hell of a burger. ok, so i didn't spend the $28, but instead opted for the $16.5 peppered burger. still expectations are a bit high.\n\ni order medium rare and i end up with a medium done burger and my wife gets the medium rare burger when she wanted medium. obviously, they don't pay too much attention to the fine details and got the orders swapped.the wedge cut fries did turn out pretty good, but the string cut fries were way too overcooked. \n\nas a appetizer, we ordered the ipswitch clams and they pretty horrible. the batter was hard and it took some serious chomping just to bite through it. geez, where these yesterday's leftovers and re-cooked today?\n\none of the best things is that i received a free draft lager with a foursquare checkin.\n\none of the reasons we were there was because of a groupon deal.\n\nbottom line, this place is not a destination place for a great burger, but rather a place to eat while your at a chic hotel. \n\n$6.50 for a sierra nevada pale ale...really!!!", 
            "**** 4.5 stars ****\n\none of the great miracles of las vegas is that you can eat like a fatty fat fat all day every day and still go to pools surrounded by gorgeous plastic-pumped women and sing nonsense like \"sexy and i know it\", regardless of any absence of truth to that assertion. holsteins provides the perfect venue for stuffing your face on delicious patties of top quality beef while also getting an eye full of the local ladies. unbeknownst to me at the time, the same chef is behind this as public house, where i had dined the night before, and his love of squeezing his employees into clothing that might be mistaken for a table cloth was much more prominent here than there. the d\\u00e9cor here is also just dope. i love the slightly sick toons on the walls, and there are homage to pigs and cows all around. if you look at most of the complaints here it's from people who didn't actually order a burger, so i suggest you take those reviews for what they are, and don't make the same mistake.\n\nbut, since it's vegas, you will still stuff your face to the maximum in front of this beautiful bevy, knowing that you're helping to pay for their salary so that they can go to the pool tomorrow and pretend guys like you don't exist (until you buy them a pitcher of margaritas, then you're superstar hero of the next couple minutes, congrats). brian and i both took the luxury route on the menu here, although i passed on the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> with kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo, because i've already had half a dozen burgers like this across america and they all taste roughly the same...rich and oily. it was honestly more difficult passing up <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, a truly unique combination of kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado...super intriguing, and if i had been dining with someone i was dating i likely would have tried to persuade them in that direction. somehow i managed to also resist ordering a decadent milkshake, perhaps because we were eating dinner just 4 hours after we had managed to roll out of bed for lunch.\n\ni finally wound up deciding on the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, a dry aged beef sirloin patty topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and a garlic-chive aioli...nothing too crazy, but lots of big, bold, wonderful flavors, and at $18 the most expensive burger not topped with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>. the result was pretty fantastic, definitely one of the better burgers i've had lately, and came with a monstrous basket of nicely done <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (for a supplemental charge). my biggest complaint, which is kind of random, is that they skewer <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with their own stupid little logo stick to keep the bun on for presentation, which has the resulting effect of causing huge gobs of mayo or sauce to squirt from the hole in the top every time you take a bite. eating these burgers is a mess, to be sure, especially when you add on a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> as i do, but if you're like me you've already realized you're not taking one of the voluptuous vixens home (although my reason is probably different than yours) so you've resigned your face to more indulgent pleasures, like egg yolk, garlic aioli, and hamburger grease.\n\njust make sure to thoroughly wash your beard, or your own lady might catch on...and get jealous.", 
            "my girl friends and i kicked off our vegas weekend with a late and light lunch at holsteins.  i was salivating when i saw <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> ($28) on the menu with kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, and truffle mayo, but i decided that the hen house burger ($14) was good enough for half the price with its <mark>Fried Egg</mark> and bacon.  that is, until our server highly recommended the award winning <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger ($17.50) with dry aged beef, bacon, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic chive aioli.  it was done--i would eat the winner.\n\nalthough complex and tasty, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> didn't make me shake my buns or roll my eyes backwards.  i didn't care for the fancy stuff like goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, or baby arugula.  for a gourmet burger, umami burger (multiple locations in la and one in sf) is my <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and it's about 2/3 of the prices here.  i did, however, enjoy the shoestring fries at holsteins.  they're skinny, crisp, wonderful, and plentiful.  \n\nif you have a car in vegas, you should make the trek to bachi burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bachi-burger-las-vegas).  now there's a burger joint worthy of being called the best burger in sin city.", 
            "first thing to remember about holstein's is their menu is reflected by the time of day (a very important tip to avoid frustration). i went late night and expected a full menu, but was told instead it was their late night menu so that was a nice segway to drink and have \"finger food\" as i called it. that would've been nice to know over the phone prior to making the trek over there.\n\ni decided to drain my frustrations in a spicy bloody mary and i'll be damned if it wasn't as advertised. clamato with jock itch is more like it, but either way it did tickle the taste buds quite well and i hate spicy! we also had ordered the lobster mac n cheese (2 by accident) and it was hit or miss. the first one was beyond salty and the 2nd one was spot on and the bread crumb crust was a delight down the pipes! we also did try <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> n turf quesadilla which was small, but delectable!\n\ndisappointed with things we decided to go the day after for lunch. as a \"preflight\" meal, they gave us salt and vinegar popcorn which i wolfed down! i really thought to myself gross, but upon chomping away all i could say was yes yes yes! i felt rockafeller so i dove into the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> and that was by far the best burger i have ever had. i ordered it medium rare after watching the food channel and from bun to bun the taste was nothing but fun! it was juicy, the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and truffle mayo was a true jackpot! \n\nto top it off you must must get an alcoholic milkshake as well to wash down the meal. i had the campfire smore and it's one of the many things in life that make you go hmm. if you don't make this a stop on your vegas outing you forever will be square and not there!", 
            "the best burgers anywhere!!  my son told us about it, and my brother went and told us about it so we had to try it.  \n\ni had the mojito and it was so refreshing!!  my husband ordered the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake and he really enjoyed it.  \n\nwe were to share our orders since we wanted to try the various burgers.  i ordered the ahi tuna sliders and my husband ordered the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> with the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and truffle mayo.  well, when our burgers were delivered i only had 3 small bites of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>....i was in heaven.  my tuna sliders were okay, because the buns were a little hard and dry.  i was in heaven when i bit into <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> though!!  the <mark>French Fries</mark> were fantastic as well.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was expensive, but well worth it.\n\nwe sat on the couches in the lounge for lunch, because we didn't want to wait 15 minutes for a table.  it was like having lunch in our living room.\n\nwe will be back!!", 
            "the first of many yelp reviews to come :)\n\nholsteins is located right smack in the middle of the cosmopolitan. there's really no signs leading to this place, so keep your eyes peeled for a dim little restaurant in the corner of the floor. it was around dinner time on a saturday night when i went with my lover and the wait was only 15 minutes. when our name was called we were told by the hostess to walk down to the dining room to be seated. i found this a bit strange considering there were so many servers walking around- i didn't know which one would be seating us. after a few awkward eye contacts, we were greeted by a nice young lady and shown to our table. \n\nfood ordered:\n<mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> (kobe beef and <mark>Foie Gras</mark>) - i didn't like how the kobe beef masked the flavor of the <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, but it was still delicious. the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> was truly something special. i would pay $28 for the piece alone (yes, this burger was $28).\nurth burger (house made veggie patty) - the veggie patty was a bit too mushy for my liking. i wanted a bit of a crunch, at least on the outer part of the patty. nope. the avocado didn't help the mushy theme either. the texture  wasn't pleasant at all. don't get be wrong though, the flavors were definitely there. this burger went for $12-$15, i forgot. not worth it.\nshoestring fries - so good. i love crispy, semi-burnt things, so these fries were perfect for me. not that i'm saying it was burnt... but it was very crunchy. these fries were very, very thinly sliced. for those who want to taste to potato, go for the steak cut fries.\nsteak cut fries - nothing too special about these fries. very mediocre. too much potato in my mouth!\n\nthe service was good. dining was casual. place is a bit dark, but it gives this place a nice vibe for a burger joint. in all, it was a good experience. will come here again for the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>, nothing else. :)\n\ntip: don't walk too fast after the hostess tells you to walk to the dining room to be seated... you'll be standing there like a lost child :/", 
            "i am giving this place 3.5 stars. the service was weird from the start. we had a party of five, and they made us wait 10 minutes when the restaurant only had about 5 tables full. we sat down, were handed menus, and our waiter never came by for another 10 minutes. one of us had to ask someone for water, and ask for a waiter. the waiter also took forever to come back to take our orders.\n\nfrom there, it seemed like he tried to redeem himself the entire time. we finally ordered. i had the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> for $28. it was a kobe beef patty with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, onions, frisee, and truffle mayo. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was really good and filling. i only ate half. it came with a  side of fries and i mistakenly chose the shoestring fries. the steak fries were much better. oh yea, the waiter bought us buckets of fries while we waited for our food to try to suck up to us. it came with a house made ketchup that was really good. \n\nmy friend's burger was sent back to the kitchen twice. he asked for a well done patty, and it came out super rare that it bled all over the plate. second, they forgot the <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>.\n\nlastly, the waiter called the manager over to give us free dessert of liquid nitrogen meringues. \n\noverall, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fries were fine, but the service was weird.", 
            "ok so to start of the place is nicely designed and very hip. this is the only reason i even chose to give it a star.  the menu is sharp and creative.  holstein's is a burger bar and restaurant but are best known for their extensive list of alcoholic milkshakes which at $15+ each are tasty but a little hard to swallow.\n\nwe had 4 people for dinner, the total was $160 and it was to say the least, one of the worse burgers i have ever eaten...ever.\n\ni started off and had a milk shake which was good, a little hard to swallow at $12 but at least it tasted good. we ordered the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> $28 kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, truffle mayo and the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger   $17.5 dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli.\ni told our slightly slow server several time make sure <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are meidum-rare.  \n\nafter a 40 minute wait time, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> arrived, and they looked amazing.   i took my first bite and was unpleasantly surprised by the rapid sizzle of the skin on the roof of my mouth. slightly alarmed by the burning feeling i removed the bun to see what was going on.  the entire roof of my mouth was burned on a quarter size piece of foie-gras in my burger.  apparently no one bothered to consider learning how to prepare foie-gras before apply for a job at holsteins and instead fried the hell out of it in a pan.  my rather nicely sized $30 burger had a piece of foie-gras on it that was the size of a quarter and burned.  \n\nwhat i received was far from a medium-rare burger.  the greasy, oily and hard to swallow burger was far from delicious and even further away from edible.  i asked the server if this was a joke and showed him the inside of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> i had taken one bite of.   confused and surprised, he apologized and said he will be back. after waiting for 10 minutes he returned and apologized mentioning that the \"size of fie-gras varies in each burger\"  ....the question is by how much?  \n\nin an effort to make the most out of this horrible ordeal, i ordered a piece of foie-gras to place on my burger and requested they don't fry the hell out of it.  the server told me that it would be $20 extra which i told him was clearly not a problem. it arrived 20 minutes later once <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was cold.  once again it arrived burned to a brown color and tasted almost as bad as my now cold and tasteless $30 burger. \n\nto be fair the place is very cute and well designed, the staff is polite but slow and poorly trained. \n\n the service is sub fast-food quality.  our server was slow and didn't take orders very well.   \n\noverall, i would never go back and have holstein's again unless it was for a $15 milk shake which was good but sadly not good enough.", 
            "i stayed at the cosmo the last time i was in vegas and decided to try out <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and shakes restaurant. the truffle lobster mac and cheese was tasteful. pork belly buns were soo crispy and mouthwatering. very flavorful. the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> is made for a king. sooo spectacular especially with the <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, melts in ur mouth like butter! i will definitely come here every time i am in town.", 
            "5 stars for the food, minus 1 star for the service. \n\nmy fellow yelpers, you did not disappoint. my friend and i came here after reading reviews on yelp. we always like to try new things, so this was a perfect opportunity. \n\ni had the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>, and yes, it is definitely worth the $28!! after california banned <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, i was heart broken. i didn't know when i will be able to eat it again, so when i saw the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> on the menu, i had to get it!\n\nthis burger is made with kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, and truffle mayo. this burger is packed with a punch of flavor and textures that all mesh so well together. i usually get cheese on my burgers, but i opted out this time since there's so many flavors going on already. if you absolutely need some cheese, i'd probably recommend a mild cheese like provolone or gruyere. \n\nwhen <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was set down in front of me, my jaw just about dropped to the floor. there was a huge piece of grilled <mark>Foie Gras</mark> on my burger. i was expecting small pieces or even just a pate version, but no, i was wrong. the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> was so creamy and the truffle mayo was so earthy and packed a punch. there was small pieces of truffle in the mayo! you definitely get the bang for your buck here. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came with a choice of shoestring fries (which i recommend since they are so crunchy) or steak fries. \n\nanother tip. if you check in with foursquare, you get a free house draft beer or margarita. i don't know how long this offer lasts, but give it a try. \n\nfor the service, it was just non existent. our server took so long to take our orders. we sat at the table for about 10 min after she took our order to get our drinks. i think she just wasn't in the mood to be at work, but still, you can't let the customers know that. \n\nall in all, yes, i definitely felt like a billionaire eating that burger, and that burger was probably the best fancy burger i had in my life! i can't wait til i go to vegas again.", 
            "the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>, though pricey, is definitely worth it. the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> compliments <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> so well. the flavor of all its components are exceptional. i wanted more! loved the selection of spiked milkshakes (definitely recommend the tiramasu) and other alcoholic beverages to wash down the beef. we'll be back soon, no doubt.", 
            "best burger i ever ate...... not even, but it is worth a visit.  i went with the \"<mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>\" .  kobe beef patty with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>.....$28.00 with fries.  after the california ban on <mark>Foie Gras</mark> i'm desperate anytime its on the menu i go hard!  decent slice couldn't focus on the fg and that's a bummer!  kobe is illegal in the us so their blowing smoke when it's on the menu!  need to clarify its \"kobe style \" not real kobe!\nanywho.... burger was very good not in the class of the \"black label\" burger at the minetta tavern but flavorful nonetheless.  \noverall skip it and go with <mark>The Classic</mark> unless your a fg freak!",

            "what's not to like about great burgers and even better shakes (especially when you can get them with alcohol in them). holsteins is located in the cosmopolitan hotel and just like the hotel has quite the vibe to it. there is open seating in the bar area but if you get there early enough you can get a seat in the dining area. \n\ntypically when i have friends in town, we seem to end up at holsteins (either because they want to try it or they are staying at the cosmopolitan hotel). either way, it's a great way to enjoy some pretty good burgers (but be prepared to spend a bit of money as the prices are definitely not that inexpensive).\n\nthere is definitely a large selection of alcoholic beverages that you can choose from, but i definitely recommend the adult shakes that they have. between my friends and i we tried the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>, oreo, and cereal bowl (tastes just like captain crunch). for burgers, we've tried quite a few of the different burgers - <mark>The Classic</mark>, the longhorn (with beef brisket as well), <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (asian flavors with teriyaki sauce), <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> (with assorted mushrooms), the el machete (with an anaheim chili - sounds spicy, but it really is not, it's good, but it could use some more spice), and of course, the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> (kobe beef patty with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>). the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> is what a lot of people like to try (especially those from california that can't get their <mark>Foie Gras</mark> anymore. you can also add a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to your burger (which i recommend) - just to make it even more tasty with another layer of flavor.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> also come with either shoestring or steak cut fries. i have ordered a side salad (to try and be a little healthier - although not by much since we were indulging in a burger), and was disappointed that they charged $2 extra dollars for <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> of a side salad over the fries (and it wasn't even a large salad). i guess next time i'll just indulge in the fries.\n\noverall, a great place to hang out with your friends, get some good burgers and have a lot of drinks. i'd definitely recommend enjoying the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> at least once.",

(the menu was pre determined, served as a 4 course meal). it was a pleasure to be hosted by them and i would have not discovered them otherwise.\n\nbut ....\n\nsecond \"chance\" visit (late may) i was in heaven ... even if for a moment.\n\nthe breakdown: it was recovery sunday (from saturday night gallivanting). we all know the best hangover cure it some heavy greasy food ... so i gave it a second try. it was much more casual, with no worries of feeling full after.\n\nthere was a 40 min wait (that tells you its quite popular). but there was room at the bar which also had full service. the way they place the barstools leaves plenty of elbow room to really get down, without throwing 'bows.\n\ni had: the golden standard (because i just couldn't talk myself into paying $28 for one burger \"<mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>\" though i was tempted). and it was delicious. didn't even need to add a thing. no ketchup, salt, nada. it was made to perfection (medium) i chose a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> which were decent, but a little soggy at the end.\nwhile i waited, i washed down a brown cow float, which was basically a turnt up <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with \"pop rocks\" and it brought me back to being a kid with the rocks popping in my mouth. loved it!!\ni tried their bucket of <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark>, and i liked how they didn't drench it with sauce. i enjoyed licking my fingers to that before and during my burger meal. \n\ni guess there is a time and place for everything ... and figuring out the right moment makes a huge difference.\n\nholsteins \"before\" the club no\nholsteins the day \"after\" definitely",

            "after driving 6  1/2 hours vs the usual less than 4 to vegas, we were too tired to drive to bachi, so we decided to try holsteins. besides h, another couple joined us for dinner. \n1. h had the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> (kobe with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>), disappointment. <mark>Foie Gras</mark> was wayyy overcooked and hard, we couldn't taste any of the port onion marmalade nor the truffle mayo that's supposed to be part of it. i will pay $15, not $32 for it.\n2. i had the big fat greek (lamb burger). it was very flavorful, but unfortunately very salty. the olive relish was almost as thick as <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, wtheck!\n3. male friend ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>(kobe with teriyaki glaze) was possibly the highlight of the meal. soo yummy, but i think they forgot the avocado that's suppose to come with it. :\\\n4. my 'will do anything for lobster' female friend possibly made the worst choice. maine lobster roll for $16.50. the two rolls were cold, and they were not rolls, at least not where i came from haha.those were two tiny slices of folded white sandwich bread with grill marks. two bites, that's all it took for finish her 'meal'. wtheck!\n\nour server adam never cracked a smile. i can't say the service was bad, but just very basic. i also didn't like the fact that he took our dessert menus away for the table next to us without asking first. i wasn't done yet! so we didn't order any. i would like to leave a 10% tip but given that we were with another couple (haha), i reluctantly added 15% :p\n\nwon't be back because it's not yummy.", 
            "wow, i don't remember the last time i spent $40 for a burger and a shake. that's right, because i never did! granted this was vegas, but it wasn't like i was at a buffet or anything.\n\nthough i was stuffed, and probably in a better way than if i had gone to a buffet, i left wondering how i ended up spending $40 (tax+tip included) on a burger and a shake. oh yeah, it was an alcoholic shake. but why couldn't i taste the whiskey? seriously, i'm not that much of a heavy drinker, either. that $13 pumpkin pie shake, while heavenly delicious, did not have a single trace of alcohol in it.\n\nlike a studious yelper, i did my homework and listened to steph c.'s rec and opted for <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo & tempura avocado). i've never had fried avocado let alone on a burger! the crispy yam was also new for me, but man was that kobe beef patty delicious. medium rare perfection with that sweet and savory terikayi glaze. for those who don't know, nori furikake is a popular japanese condiment which is like seaweed seasoning. it usually has sesame seeds, dried/ground fish, sugar, salt, and you guessed it, msg. while i can't be sure holstein's furikake had msg, it definitely did not deter me from devouring that burger. it was not missing any flavor, and i couldn't be happier with the food in front of me. the fries were also delicious, but that burger was pretty unforgettable. it definitely doesn't come close to the best burger i've had, but props for making me want to return and try other menu items. next time, it might have to be the big fat greek (greek spiced lamb with feta cream, lettuce, tomato, red onion & olive relish, w/tatziki sauce) or the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> (kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, truffle mayo). what can i say, i love a good burger.",

            "food: a bit overpriced even for gourmet burgers. i had one of their most expensive burgers, the appropriately named <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>. one of the ingredients was <mark>Foie Gras</mark> which made it taste really good. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came with a small bucket of fries. i had an old rasputin to go with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. i would come back to try some of the other burgers on the menu.\n\nservice: i sat at the bar and the bartender provided excellent service. if it were based on service alone, this place would get 5 stars. but keep in mind that i got there right when they opened for lunch. everybody was still fresh. :)\n\nlocation: inside the cosmopolitan on the 2nd floor. it's very easy to locate with signs everywhere. you can't miss it!",

(5/5)\n\n3. chocolate malt shake: my bf was kind of disappointed with this one. it was decent for me, but i don't normally drink malted shakes. for him, it tasted more of a milkshake even though he ordered malt. if you don't finish it, you can request for plastic cups to take them to go. (4/5)\n\nservice is friendly and everything was delicious! definitely a good burger place to try when in vegas! =)", 
            "our first night in vegas after arriving in the afternoon and we just wanted a solid meal in our stomachs before heading out for the rest of the evening.\n\nthey were able to seat our group of 7 right away. here's the breakdown:\n\nservice: great service. attentive. our waiter even treated us to a round of meringues frozen by dry ice. super cool when you open your mouth and can breathe out smoke.\n\nfood: a few of my friends split the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> and said it was rich, but tasty. the fries were pretty solid.\n\ndrinks: they have spiked shakes. awesome.\n\noverall, a bit pricey, but solid fancy burgers nonetheless.", 
            "burger fit for a king or queen!\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is one of the staples of american popular cuisine. the simple recipe allows for considerable creativity from the chef who's making it, and there are thousands of variations, from one end of the country to the other. and when done properly, there are few foods more delicious. \n\nholsteins freshly made bad-ass burgers are made from the choicest cows (kobe), organic toppings and freshest buns. \n\nthis restaurant is located in the cosmopolitan on the 2nd floor near the escalators. the interior reminds of a new age diner with eager guests wanting to try these delicious alcoholic shakes and fancy exotic burgers. the restaurant seem very energetic and it was a full house. the waiters and waitress wore uniforms and all looked in sync. our waitress abigail payed close attention to us and we felt that her she went above and beyond for us. i had a yelp checking promo for a free beer and she took care of me right way. nothing better then free beer. with service like that i can now see why that this place is always buzzing.\n\nwe started with an appetizer of buffalo chicken wings smothered in bright orange sauce. with each bite i could taste the strong flavor of the cayenne pepper and garlic. i don't prefer really hot wings but these were so good we couldn't stop until they were gone. \n\nfor the main course, i decided to go with <mark>Gold Standard</mark> dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli for $18.50.  i order it medium rare and it came out looking and tasting amazing. the sirloin was melt in your mouth good. with each and every bite getting the hints of the goat cheese and the sweet organic greens <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> really was a work of art. my wife ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado for $18. this dish was made perfect. such an intense flavor from the very expensive high quality kobe beef and the teriyaki glaze. it was mild and not to sweet like most american teriyaki but just wow! my wife made me try a little bite and after that one tiny little bite my tongue firing all the wonderful deep flavors to my brain. it was like i was mesmerized by that one bite. i wanted her burger so bad!!!  \n\nit is true chef anthony meidenbauer really knows how to build a burger fit for a king or a queen.  we felt like king and queen that night we had those fantastic exotic burger. i noticed on the menu they have whats called a <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> which consists of kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, truffle mayo. doesn't that just sound like amazing. i am imagining the wonderful flavor combos of my two favorite dishes combined into one. i didn't have the nerve to spend $35 but on my next visit i will for sure.\n\noverall its a great new burger concept and probably in the top 10 best burger restaurants. i will be returning soon and i will have my eye on that <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>!\n\nthanks for reading.\nmatthew y."

            "so a few girlfriends and i came here after a few hours at marquee's day club pool party on 4th of july weekend. our hunger was ridiculous since we were being smart and didnt eat breakfast prior to going to the pool. \n\nour main motivation to go was because it was close, and because after a night of bottle service, we were all craving greasy food (i.e., burgers and fries). \n\nupon being seated - we were given a bucket of popcorn with truffle salt on it \"compliments of the chef\". oh puh-leathe!!! everyone gets em... it's like bread at other restaurants, only here its truffle popcorn. hahah. however, never having had \"truffle\" anything before - it was good. but i was also hella hungry. so you coulda given me stale popcorn and i would probably still enjoyed it.\n\ntwo of us werent feeling adventurous and just ordered the regular burger and shoestring fries. i ordered provol<mark>One <mark>Two Dollar Cheese</mark></mark> on my burger, she ordered cheddar - but when <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came out, both had a white cheese on em. i'm pretty sure both were provolone, bc last i checked, cheddar cheese is orange and nowhere on the menu did it state \"white cheddar\". anyways, whatever, she let it go cuz we were starving. i have to say, though, the meat was really good and you can tell it was \"real meat\" - i mean it was ground beef, but still chunky... if that makes sense. anyways. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are pretty big - served as 2 meals for me (i saved half for dinner) and i love super skinny crunchy shoestring fries. overall - <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was a burger nonetheless, and maybe it's my fault for not being adventurous and getting one of those special burgers, but i was too hungry to risk ordering something i wouldnt like. nothing really to write home about other than the meat was of better quality than other burgers i've had. it's really hard to mess up a burger.\n\nanother item my party ordered was the lobster mac and cheese. i only had a few bites but it was delish. however, for the price of the dish, i would have expected a slightly larger serving than what they gave. \n\nas for service - it could have been better. the girl only came by 4 times. once to take drink orders, once for our real order, once to check up on us, and once to give us our check. mind you, checking up on us once may be okay for some, but i hate \"hunting\" waiters/waitresses down for refills. im a person who largely bases tips on refills because not having to ask for a refill to get one means that the waiter is being attentive and paying attention to you and your party. but maybe thats just me...", 
            "wow.  one of the best burgers i've had in a very long time, and the overall meal was exceptional and reasonably priced.  went with a buddy of mine for a late lunch, expecting to pop in and out, but this was a meal worth savoring.  i got the lobster truffled mac & cheese to start, which was slightly runnier than i would have liked, due to what the waiter referred to as \"copious amounts of tellagio and mascarp<mark>One <mark>Two Dollar Cheese</mark></mark>\", but the dish was flavorful and solid.\n\nthe real treat however was <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  my friend and i both had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, his without the goat cheddar in favor of regular cheddar, and mine with.  they were both cooked perfectly, which is hard to do when you get an order for \"extremely rare, and i mean mooing\", but they nailed it.  they nailed my medium rare as well, and the combination of the tomato confit in place of standard tomato (simply brilliant idea, why have i not seen that done before?) and the strong cheese combined with a thick, juicy, perfectly prepared piece of bacon and garlic-chive aoili made it the first burger i haven't put ketchup on in i can't even remember how long, and i'm so glad i did.  ketchup would have destroyed this exquisitely crafted creation.\n\ndespite the raving, i considered giving this review 4 starts rather than 5 due to the consistency of the appetizer and the over-saltiness of the steak fries that came with my burger, but ultimately, those trivial details pale in comparison to the awesome that was that burger.  if you're in vegas, and you're looking for a meal that won't break your budget and will give you plenty to talk about, try out holsteins.  you will not be sorry.  also, if waitresses that are easy on the eyes are your thing, i suggest sitting at the bar and ordering from there.", 
            "after passing by the restaurant in the cosmopolitan hotel on many trips i finally decided to eat there. i couldn't have been more pleased with my experience. the don't take reservations on weekends but we arrived at 8pm with a group of 5 and were seated immediately. the atmosphere and decor was fun, the restaurant was clean, and the waitress was very friendly. \n\ni ordered the carbonara chicken burger with grilled chicken breast, bacon, mushrooms, sweet pea aioli, <mark>Fried Egg</mark>, and provol<mark>One <mark>Two Dollar Cheese</mark></mark>. this was the juiciest and most flavorful chicken burger that i have ever eaten. they have countless beer choices and my friend ordered the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake and it was also delicious. i highly recommend this restaurant!", 
            "to top off a successfull vegas trip , we came to holsteins hungry and anxious after seeing all the solid reviews. located right across the entrance to marquee, it's an all too familiar location, but unfortunately a location i probably won't return to.\n\nupon walking in, we were asked whether we wanted bar or table seating. the hostess literally stated that if we wanted a table, it would mean she would \"have to\" walk us over. she made it sound like we were causing the biggest inconvenience in the world to her if we didn't sit at the bar. rude. we still went for a table, and she pointed us to another waitress who would take us. a horrible system.\n\nit took 10 minutes to have a waiter even greet us after sitting down. another 35 passed before we became intolerably grumpy and impatient, flagging down our waiter to see what was going on. two burgers, one of which was rare, should not take 40 minutes to make. after a long day, 5 minutes was very agonizing, and our burgers finally came out.\n\n- \"meat ball\" burger ($15): beef, pork, veal, pecorino & provol<mark>One <mark>Two Dollar Cheese</mark></mark>, basil walnut pesto and arugula on herb foccacia roll. the meat concoction was great, but it lacked flavor or marination. of course, i loved all the cheese, but you could barely taste the walnut pesto. it could use some marinara sauce. not the best choice here.\n\n- <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> ($17): beef patty, truffled marinated portabella mushroom, caramelized onion, gruyere, maro & frisee.  this one was much better and was wonderfully crafted. there was plenty of gruyere, you could taste the truffle oil in the mushroom, and all ingredients balanced well with each other. a superb burger indeed. \n\nfries with one burger, <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> with the other. both were good quality. the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> weren't too deeply fried and maintained a nice crunch.\n\n- banana cream pie shake ($13): bananas, vanilla custard, nilla wafers, caramel, creme de banane, licor 43 and white chocolate covered banana. absolutely delicious. although it was technically two servings, a shake should not be worth as much as a burger. also, there was barely any hint of alcohol in here. despite this, i sipped it down to the last delicious drop.\n\nafter finishing our meal, it took another 20 minutes to hunt down a different waiter because ours kept ignoring us. the restaurant was less than half full and there was plenty of staff, so service like this is unacceptable. even the table next to us noted how long our order was taking. \n\noverpriced, extremely slow, but quite a treat if you get the right burger.", 
            "what a fun place! we were looking for a late lunch after spending most of the day at the pool party. our requirements were fairly simple, filling food and lots of air conditioning. we were drawn in because it was right across from marquee and had a huge pink cow. what's not to love?!? \n\nthe food was good. i had the grilled marinated chicken breast, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, provol<mark>One <mark>Two Dollar Cheese</mark></mark>, pesto aioli, arugula, and tomato on a foccacia roll. it was delicious, really  hit the spot! we all shared a milkshake and it was so yummy! i will be back to try more of the shake menu!", 
            "it's pretty tasty! service is quick and easy. it's a tad on the pricer side though with sodas being 6$ and burgers averaging 20$ before adding toppings. \n\nspecifically: we started with <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>. they were tasty and fried. (hard to mess up anything deep fried lol) we swapped out the caper dressing for ranch. but there were other options available. \n\ni ordered the urth burger- the patty itself wasn't the greatest. it was okay as far veggie patties go, but seasoning wise...meh. the toppings were amazing though. the urtha burger came with avocado, sprouts, two slices of tomato, lettuce and cucumber. i added proval<mark>One <mark>Two Dollar Cheese</mark></mark>, but the list if options was pretty good (read: egg, salmon,  brisket, cheeses etc). \n\nmy husband ordered the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> medium, seemed slightly rarer than medium, so order up of your usual. he added and over easy egg toping and found it quite delicious. \n\nservice was good! everyone was friendly and nice about switching menu items (ie gluten free buns for white, cheddar for american etc)"

            "the hamburger. oh, you poor, misunderstood sandwich. so many people treat you like a fall-back. when people say, \"eh... you just want to grab a burger?\" it causes tears in my eyes, and great gnashing of teeth. and i can only handle so much gnashing.\n\nhowever, there is a place out there, a place that adores and cherishes you, you faithful friend, you. holstein's, located in the cosmopolitan of las vegas, is a gourmet burger joint that mixes classic with funky. that's pretty obvious when you sit in their leather-adorned lounge area complete with a pink-and-white cow. (by the way, we've named her \"holly holstein.\" run with it.)\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> did not disappoint. my friend had a \"hen house,\" a classic hamburger topped off with a <mark>Fried Egg</mark>. never had egg on your burger? you'd be surprised. i had the longhorn burger, a bbq burger topped with brisket. fantastic. no stale burgers here; each bite was succulent, as if a little miniature chef was on our table crafting every bite just at the time we ate it.\n\nholstein's has about 34 million beers on tap. ok, maybe not 34 million, but a lot. we didn't have any alcohol, as it was only noon and neither of us were in the mood to drink yet. (in vegas? no! yes, you have to detox sometime.) that would be my only complaint about the place, they really try hard to force the alcohol on you. we were asked about six different times if we wanted a drink or if we had looked over the bar menu. the first three times we said no should have been an indication; by the sixth time i wanted to say \"yeah, if you're comping it.\"\n\ni've heard the shakes are killer; it's definitely on my to-do list next time i come. and there will be a next time. oh holstein's... shut up. just shut up... you had me at \"hamburger.\"\n\n(by the way, when you go, find the painting of the robot in the lounge, and tell me he's not being a little obscene. just saying.)\n\nps: full disclosure here: i work at the cosmopolitan of las vegas, where holstein's is located. however, as the hotel encourages honesty from its employees, i have been honest in this review. i am also not affiliated with the f&b department.", 
            "pros: holsteins is a nice looking burger joint in a very nice hotel (cosmopolitan of las vegas). the prices are reasonable, the service attentive, the drink menu extensive, and the servers attractive. \n\ncons: my burger was not quite what i had expected. i got the korean bulgogi burger that comes with a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> and kim chi. sounds epic right? turns out that the patty was drenched in some type of sweet teriyaki sauce, which i was not particularly fond of. also, the prospect of duck fat fries was presented to us. sounds epic too right? its more or less just a gimmick that resulted in overly hard fries with no extra flavor whatsoever. all in all, a decent filling meal with fresh ingredients and a nice atmosphere, but not the best burger joint i have ever tried. i would go back to sample another burger because my friends did enjoy theirs (they got the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger.)\"", 
            "i went to hs&b christmas night. the cosmopolitan was extremely busy, and the atmosphere was electric. i was looking forward to a well made gourmet burger all day. hs&b did not disappoint. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> joint is located on the 2nd level, just take the escalator up and go left. we arrived for dinner @ 7 pm,  and were greeted by an attractive receptionist. she said their was no wait, to our surprise, and promptly led us to our table. our waiter (heavy eastern european accent), took our drink orders. i tried a microbrew of some sort (nondescript pale ale). boris explained the menu, and i settled on the hen burger. it was a burger with a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> and bacon. incredible! loved the meat and egg combination. i was told that the restaurant has an onsite butcher. fries were shoestring type and very tasty. we didn't order one of the alcoholic shakes, but the couple sitting next to us did, and it looked good. they even provide the extra shake in the metal container it is made in. i noticed that the manager was smart enough to hire young, pretty ladies and outfit them in short red dresses... well done good sir! nice touch! the tab for two w/o desert was $48 plus tip.  great night, great food, will definitely return.", 
            "gourmet burgers that makes your head bounce, literally speaking too! for crying out loud its situated next to a raucous venue (marquee) where streams of pretentious people scurrying to find that vip line.\n\ndecor: contemporary and spacious layout.  modern bar with swanky looking lounges.\n\nvibe: cool and fun.  dj spinning the latest and greatest hits from hip-hop to electronic.\n\nfood: \n\n**korean 'bull' gogi: well flavored, juicy beef patty that came on soft, toasty buns! the kimchee slaw and chili mayo worked nicely with everything.  last, but not least, the oozy <mark>Fried Egg</mark> was the cherry on top! \n\n**fries: i opted for the wedge shaped and it was epic! fluffy, yet crispy.  these are a must get.\n\nappetite: full\n\nservice: not much to complain about, our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu.\n\nconclusion: what makes holsteins a very appealing burger joint is the creativeness in the menu however you might be turned off by the excess noise level coming from the club next door.", 
            "clever. \n\ni really liked this place. to me it was fun. cute and different ideas make this place worth checking out. its not gonna blow your socks off but i think you'll have a good time if you're not too serious about everything. they try  - at being gourmet, hip, boozy, and on-trend - and they do all of that decently.\n\nwe had no issues with service, but it was a monday that we stopped in. so take that for what its worth. nobody was rude to us, our waitress was attentive and everything came out in timely fashion.\n\ndrinks - this is definitely worth 1-2 stars on its own. they make what they call \"adult vitamins\" which are drinks that use vitamin waters as their bases. basically vitamin water plus vodka/gin and some additional fruit juices. i know it sounds like pretty ridiculous but why not?  they were tasty and pleasant drinks after a long day. they were fairly strong. they also offer milk shakes with alcohol...you know you want it!  if i'm ever back at this place, i'll probably try one of these out. \n\nfood - mostly burgers and variations on the concept. they make a good effort at gourmet or fusion-y type burgers - burgers made of duck, lamb, etc. or with various ethinically inspired toppings.  i appreciate the attempt, but i do think that if your place has the name of a type of cow in its name, you should probably offer at least a handful of beef burgers. \n\nanyways, i had the \"classic\" which is a beef patty-based burger with cheese. it was fantastic! perfectly cooked and juicy. the patty itself maybe had a touch more salt than it needed but when eaten with bread, condiments, and toppings its fine.  the bun was nicely toasted and buttery. <mark>The Classic</mark> is your standard burger with lettuce, tomato, mayo, ketchup, and onion.  you can add on varying cheeses or a number of other toppings (<mark>Fried Egg</mark>, bacon, mushrooms, beef brisket, etc). \n\ni like the offerings and variety of flavors and palettes this place can appeal to. the quality of the ingredients is great. the flavors are nice. food and drinks here are made unabashedly. will definitely come back if i'm at the cosmo.",

            "yum-diddly-yum! this hopping little place inside the cosmopolitan hotel in las vegas is delicious. the wait was not terrible (15 minutes) and the staff was attentive and friendly. we started with the fried pickle appetizer  - good breaded crunchy coating and equally crunchy dill pickle spears within. a few fried olives in the mix didn't hurt one bit. hubby ordered the korean bull-gogi burger loaded with a nice soy/kalbi marinade, kimchi, and a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> atop a perfectly cooked burger and incredibly toasty bun. this burger was a nice size and had a good side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> with it. i had the lobster roll sliders in mini-hot dog buns with a nice aioli and cup of cole slaw. great flavor on both entrees. plus... we each had one of their cool milk-shakes. mine was the oreo cookie with bailey's and hubby had the s'mores with rum. goodness gracious, set me up with another! food was pretty reasonably priced for pricey vegas as well. try it!", 
            "kind of a bummer that we had a late buffet lunch before coming here around 7:30 pm.  bad idea!  we were meeting up with our friends at marquee in the evening and were on a quest for a nearby casual place to have dinner.  i'm such a sucker for burgers and puns, so when we stumbled upon this place, i was sold.\n\nthe cheddar popcorn they have on the tables (for you to munch on as you peruse the menu) was so addicting!  do they sell this stuff by the bag??  it's got the crispy texture (like normal popcorn and not the fluffy pirates booty kind).\n\ni was still stuffed from the buffet lunch so i sadly had to opt for the <mark>Greener Pastures</mark> salad =(.  i was really bummed out about this since i love my beef.  boy would i regret it even more later. they were quite stingy on the avocado, but since it was vegas and also not california, i let that one slide. not to imply that the salad was bad!  it was actually very fresh, and organic too!\n\nmy fianc\\u00e9 got the bullgogi burger and it was amazing.  it was perfectly seasoned and tasted exactly how it should (the kimchi flavor really came through -- pretty surprising for an american burger joint!) the <mark>Fried Egg</mark> was still runny too =)  i actually ended up stealing 4 bites of it from him muhahaha.  we really loved the fact that the sauce wasn't overpowering everything, and that you can still enjoy all the flavors in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  i'm definitely going to get my own next time haha.\n\nservice was superb (also gave great burger and beer recommendations) and prompt.  we were out of there by 8:20 pm, without feeling rushed at all.", 
            "deeeeelish! but you may feel too bloated, too sluggish, too lardy to be productive. but you'll feel very satisfied you had a yummy meal. (though, at $76 for lunch, we could have done without a few dishes. more on that later.)\n\nmy husband and i went on a sunday morning at 11:05 after they first opened for the day. we got seated right away at a table near the flat screens to watch the games, but within 10 or 15 minutes, the place was jam packed with diners. \n\nhere's a rundown of what we ordered: all very well executed, though would have benefitted from a few minor changes. fun novelty items too. \n\n1. <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>: loved this preparation, because these <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> are spears, not chips that fall apart and taste nothing like a pickle. this gives each bite a nice tang. flavorful sauce condiment and nice touch to have sliced meats on the side. also came with fried olives ad fried capers...though the capers were kinda dried and tasteless. \n\n2. crispy pork belly bun : steamed mantou type buns (two mini sized) and two large chunks of crispy pork belly and hoisin. very, very good,  i've had variations of this dish many times, and this one is nice. very fatty, very crisp and flavorful. though. i'd appreciate more cilantro, and some acid to cut through the fat. \n\n3. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger: juicy and hot, slathered in sauce, kimchi and a <mark>Fried Egg</mark>...get your napkins! just get is. that's all i have to say about this one. \n\n4. tenderloin rossini: pork tend loin sliders with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> (sp? i dunk, i dot eat enlarged duck liver...is that right, very often!) was good...but as always with tenderloin, desperately needed some fat. came with house made chips, but would have preferred fries or rings. \n\n5. cake lollypop, nitrogen merangues, (sp?) push pop: strawberry cheesecake lollypop was delicious, dipped in white chocolate and had a small strawberry gel disc on top. the nitro meringue (sp?) is bubblegum flavored, and  tiny, but prepared tableside and more for show than anything. blow smoke for 30 seconds and impress your friends! for $2 it's a fun way to end a meal. the push pop...overrated. nice novelty, but the sorbet is hard and makes it difficult to eat. cute concept though. \n\nservice rocked. glasses always full, plates cleared as soon as we were finished. warm environment, creative menu items. would hit up again...and would try the long list of milkshakes!", 
            "try the milkshakes. seriously, if you don't try at least one of their milkshakes, you are doing yourself a disservice as a human being. i tried the hen house burger, with bacon and a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> on it and it was very tasty, that's for sure. i loved the thin-cut <mark>French Fries</mark> and could easily have eaten two servings (probably did anyway). so, then i tried the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> milkshake. holy crap. then i tried another milkshake at the table, the cereal bowl, with cap n' crunch and fruity pebbles, which wasn't as good as the smores one, but i'm sure i could have downed about 4 of them in a sitting. did i mention that the milkshakes have booze in them? ahhhh, yeah.....\nanyway, i tried 2 of the specialty bloody mary martinis; the spicy one was served with a poached shrimp that was as big as paul bunyon's thumb, i swear. but the kicker drink was the savory bloody mary martini, with beef brisket infused vodka and a skewer that had 3 large chunks of perfectly cooked filet mignon- so yum. who thinks this stuff up? brisket-infused vodka? how the hell would a person even make that? \ntry this place out, you won't regret it.", 
            "my friends and i were getting ready to head over to marquee in the cosmopolitan, but had to stop somewhere to get our grub on before we get our freak on. we walked by holsteins and decided to pop in for some burgers and fries.\n\nthe ambiance was nice and the dj was spinning some awesome music. we were quickly seated and the waiter took our order. my sister and i settled on the hen house (has bacon and a <mark>Fried Egg</mark>, bam!) while the others got korean bull'gogi (<mark>Fried Egg</mark> and lots of kimchi) and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (teriyaki). the waiter was super patient and helpful with us when we tried to decided and even allowed for us to cut burgers in half to share. if you decide for smaller portions, they even have sliders which is a great option for those who wanna keep it light before dancing.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came out with either shoestring or steakcut fries and both were delicious. i think i may have been a fan of the shoestring though as it had a great crisp to it while steakcut had a great potato-y inside. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were cooked exactly how we we wanted (in my case it was medium) and was a big-ass burger. i'm glad i opted to share mine with someone because i wouldn't have been able to finish it on my own. \n\ni'd definitely come here in the future to eat if i'm headed to the club since it's right across from holsteins but i gotta go back next time to try their shakes! they looked great, but something about all that milk and alcohol didn't mix for me, so i decided against it this time around. all in all, i much prefer this joint compared to burger bar at mandalay bay.",

            "we dropped into this las vegas hot spot prior to going to a show to grab a quick bite and catch up on the sports news for the day.  for the latter you'll need to sit at the bar which is exactly what we did.  their beer and wine list is extensive as are the number of tap options at the bar.  i went for a bottled brew instead selecting one of my favorite tangerine ales instead of trying something new.\n\ntheir menu features appetizers, tiny buns which come two per order, big buns and milkshakes galore including a long list of boozed-up ones.  i was feeling a bit shaky, but my short supply of lactose intolerance tablets on myself made me put aside that idea of having the shakes for the night.  i stuck with my lost coast ale.\n\npork belly buns, mini lobster rolls and tiny chicago dogs seemed like popular picks in the tiny buns section, but i wanted something more substantial so i picked out the korean \"bull\"gogi burger from the big buns section.  this was a burger glazed in a sweet soy sauce, topped with kimchee slaw, slathered with chili mayo and topped off with a <mark>Fried Egg</mark>.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> come with seasoned skinny fries or steak fries.\n\ntheir kitchen works fast here as a short wait later we were already chowing down.  my burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p7pxqfqr7ybkmmi2j51udw?select=fbxxyjmoalx3nvotkqld-a) sat in a pool of glaze and it appeared the yolk on my <mark>Fried Egg</mark> was runny.  for a split second i considered picking up the knife and fork, but who doesn't eat with their hands while sitting at the bar?  on my first bite the yolk burst out of its egg white home and coated my face and fingers in hot yolky heaven.  there was no turning back at that point; i was going to finish this burger using my hands even if the entire thing fell apart.  it didn't by the way as the soft bun was one of the sturdiest i've ever held in my hand even soaked in with burger juices, sweet glaze and egg yolk.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself i'm thinking maybe a half pound of quality beef was cooked to a perfect medium and bursting with juice.  considering how many ingredients were added to this burger the beef really stood out as that was the main component i kept tasting.  the kimchee slaw was nice and crunchy, but the chili mayo really provided no kick to the overall flavor of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.\n\nmy seasoned steak fries while generous in portion size were a bit too salty for me.  i loved my burger though just as my friends loved their mini pork belly buns and mini hot dogs.",

            "every time i try to come here, the wait is always ridiculous.  i never remember to make reservations either cause, well, it's a burger place!  finally, this past weekend around 2pm, after a somewhat \"short\" wait of 40 minutes, i got to try holsteins.\n\nit actually took the 4 of us awhile to look through the menu, and in the end, i went with the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, which is a burger with dry aged beef sirloin burger, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli.  i ordered it medium rare and came with a nice pink middle.  what really caught my attention about the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was the dry aged beef, since dry aging beef condenses the beef flavor, and wow that burger was juicy.  out of all 4 burgers, mine was the only one that had juices dripping down my fingers, even versus the kobe beef burgers!\n\nthe toppings were all great, especially the aged goat cheddar.  you can tell it's a little different than your normal cheddar.  the garlic-chive aioli has a mellow garlic taste.  besides hoping the bacon was a little bit crispier, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> is really a burger that's up there in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> world.  it's just a very tasty burger and i can see why it is so popular!\n\ni also tried a bit of <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, as well as the korean bull-gogi.  <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> is more of an asian fusion burger, with teriyaki glaze and a tempura avocado that sits on top of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  it also has a kobe beef patty, so the whole burger had this velvety smooth texture thanks to the fatty patty and the smooth creamy avocado!  i would like a bit more teriyaki sauce though.\n\nas for the korean bull-gogi burger, the patty is marinated to give it extra flavor.  the best part is definitely the <mark>Fried Egg</mark> that sits on top.  who can resist the egg yolk just running all over the kimchi slaw and the beef patty??\n\nout of all the fries, i liked the steak cut fries the most.  crunchy exterior with a creamy potato center.  <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were great as well.  the shoestring fries were a little stale to me.\n\nnow, with shakes as part of its name, we knew we had to try a few of their shakes and ended up getting the black cow float and the frozen grasshopper.  black cow float is a fun and somewhat nostalgic shake since it is more like a coke flat with the ice cream rather than a true shake.  it even comes with pop rocks!  the frozen grasshopper is a must for any mint chocolate fans.  smooth creamy minty frozen goodness.  for both shakes, we could taste the alcohol but it was pretty well masked!\n\nthey also have a bunch of beers on draft.  <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> triple karmeliet is a good one!\n\nprice-wise, it is pricey.  our burgers were around $18, with shakes at $11.  the price should reflect great service but i found the service a bit lacking.  our waitress only came to check on us twice and it took awhile to get her attention for the check as well.\n\nafter our meal, i can see why so many people like <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> at holsteins.  can't wait till the next time to try our other burgers!", 
            "**** 4.5 stars ****\n\none of the great miracles of las vegas is that you can eat like a fatty fat fat all day every day and still go to pools surrounded by gorgeous plastic-pumped women and sing nonsense like \"sexy and i know it\", regardless of any absence of truth to that assertion. holsteins provides the perfect venue for stuffing your face on delicious patties of top quality beef while also getting an eye full of the local ladies. unbeknownst to me at the time, the same chef is behind this as public house, where i had dined the night before, and his love of squeezing his employees into clothing that might be mistaken for a table cloth was much more prominent here than there. the d\\u00e9cor here is also just dope. i love the slightly sick toons on the walls, and there are homage to pigs and cows all around. if you look at most of the complaints here it's from people who didn't actually order a burger, so i suggest you take those reviews for what they are, and don't make the same mistake.\n\nbut, since it's vegas, you will still stuff your face to the maximum in front of this beautiful bevy, knowing that you're helping to pay for their salary so that they can go to the pool tomorrow and pretend guys like you don't exist (until you buy them a pitcher of margaritas, then you're superstar hero of the next couple minutes, congrats). brian and i both took the luxury route on the menu here, although i passed on the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> with kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo, because i've already had half a dozen burgers like this across america and they all taste roughly the same...rich and oily. it was honestly more difficult passing up <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, a truly unique combination of kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado...super intriguing, and if i had been dining with someone i was dating i likely would have tried to persuade them in that direction. somehow i managed to also resist ordering a decadent milkshake, perhaps because we were eating dinner just 4 hours after we had managed to roll out of bed for lunch.\n\ni finally wound up deciding on the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, a dry aged beef sirloin patty topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and a garlic-chive aioli...nothing too crazy, but lots of big, bold, wonderful flavors, and at $18 the most expensive burger not topped with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>. the result was pretty fantastic, definitely one of the better burgers i've had lately, and came with a monstrous basket of nicely done <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (for a supplemental charge). my biggest complaint, which is kind of random, is that they skewer <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with their own stupid little logo stick to keep the bun on for presentation, which has the resulting effect of causing huge gobs of mayo or sauce to squirt from the hole in the top every time you take a bite. eating these burgers is a mess, to be sure, especially when you add on a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> as i do, but if you're like me you've already realized you're not taking one of the voluptuous vixens home (although my reason is probably different than yours) so you've resigned your face to more indulgent pleasures, like egg yolk, garlic aioli, and hamburger grease.\n\njust make sure to thoroughly wash your beard, or your own lady might catch on...and get jealous.", 
            "my girl friends and i kicked off our vegas weekend with a late and light lunch at holsteins.  i was salivating when i saw <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> ($28) on the menu with kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, and truffle mayo, but i decided that the hen house burger ($14) was good enough for half the price with its <mark>Fried Egg</mark> and bacon.  that is, until our server highly recommended the award winning <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger ($17.50) with dry aged beef, bacon, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic chive aioli.  it was done--i would eat the winner.\n\nalthough complex and tasty, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> didn't make me shake my buns or roll my eyes backwards.  i didn't care for the fancy stuff like goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, or baby arugula.  for a gourmet burger, umami burger (multiple locations in la and one in sf) is my <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and it's about 2/3 of the prices here.  i did, however, enjoy the shoestring fries at holsteins.  they're skinny, crisp, wonderful, and plentiful.  \n\nif you have a car in vegas, you should make the trek to bachi burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bachi-burger-las-vegas).  now there's a burger joint worthy of being called the best burger in sin city.",

            "came here to eat lunch during my last day in vegas with a friend. we were looking for a place inside the cosmo to eat (besides wicked spoon, which we went to more than once already) and ended up here. i was really disappointed by the food here.\n\ni ordered the <mark>California Turkey</mark> w/ shoestring fries, along with a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> on top. i've had turkey burgers at other places before that were tasty, but this place didn't get it right at all. the meat was dry and there was no flavor to it. what made it even worse was that they stuck the big toothpick right into the <mark>Fried Egg</mark>. the yolk broke and started running before my dish even got to me. it got to the point where i had to use a knife and fork to eat, because <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> of the patty got so soggy that i couldn't even pick up my burger.\n\nservice was okay. the waitress took our orders and brought out the food pretty fast, and checked on us occasionally. when we asked to split the check by a certain amount, the waitress said she could only split it 50/50.\n\ni would be very reluctant to come back and try this place again. i can get better tasting burgers for under $15 (about the average price here). they can't even serve a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> properly.", 
            "this swanky burger joint is located right across the nightclub marquee's entrance inside the cosmopolitan hotel. from the artwork on the wall that reminds me of oldskool 90's taggers to the loud hip music blaring through the speakers, holstein 's is hard to miss. we made it there around 7:30pm on a saturday night and the wait was no more than 20 minutes for our party of four. when your pager starts buzzing and you report to the host at the door, you're ushered to the next host in the middle of place, which that person will walk you over to your table. the place is vibrant, loud, and hip. just like in a nyc subway train, you have everything from skirts to suits to shorts & flip flops occupying this restaurant.\n \nmany items on the menu sound appealing including their numerous $11 alcoholic shakes. we ordered the frozen grasshopper: peppermint, chocolate, cr\\u00e8me de menthe, van gogh chocolate vodka. if you love them little minty & crunchy chocolate balls, then this shake is right up your alley. there's plenty of it, a bit overwhelming actually but some people like it that way. that distinct alcohol taste is barely noticed. we also got the oreo with bailey's irish cream. this is what i considered a \"safe\" shake to order. if you enjoy oreos (who doesn't?) then this is a solid route to go. again, the taste of alcohol isn't really prevalent. warning, if you have issues with dairy then you may want to stay away from the shakes here. i really don't but it did activate.... uhh nevermind.\n \nseems like <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> $17 is quite popular from many of the reviews and sure enough someone on our table ordered it. kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake not to be mistaken by bukake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado. seriously, what is there not to like about that set up? if it was truly an asian inspired burger, then a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> would finish the job. you can add it though for a buck more. i was a little sad that i didn't order this burger for myself but my buddy was kind enough to give me a slice of heaven.\n \ni ended up with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> $17.5: beef patty crusted with black pepper, holstein's creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>, swiss cheese. oh you fancy huh? because it sure did sound fancy. although <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was good, my mind was set on <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> as the unanimous winner this night. the pepper was probably what i remember most about this burger. i did finish it but i most likely wouldn't care to order it again.\n \nthe maine lobster roll $16.5: fresh cooked lobster tossed in chive aioli in a grilled mini hot dog bun with cole slaw. the price is steep, the portion is crazy bite sized, but the taste landed a mike tyson uppercut. why oh why do you tease us like that holstein 's? gimme more!\n \nthe steak cut fries and the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were decent but can be better.\n \noverall, holstein 's should be visited at least once and from there you can determine if you want to be a regular. the meal was quite enjoyable but i'm not sure if it left an uber lasting effect on my appetite glands. i can probably live with or without it. for sure, give it a shot. on fridays, saturdays, and mondays, they are opened beyond their normal hours, midnight to 2am. however, their full menu isn't available but rather a separate and shorter late night menu. check out the art work on the walls, i want one for my place!", 
            "i was sooo in the mood for a burger... beef!!! this place is great, went to the cosmopolitan with my fiance fer shopping and lunch! came across this lil joint... the ambiance is decorated with nice graffiti-ish cow paintings. my love ordered the greek burger - lamb burger with red onions, feta cheese, and thaziki sauce.... she said it was ok, not better than black hogg on sunset blvd! i had the machete burger - beef burger medium rare, bacon, <mark>Fried Egg</mark>, cheese, barracho onions, lettuce, tomato, anihiem chili, and the machete aioli... as you can guess... it was deeelish! the fries on the other hand was a lil to over cooked, we got the sho string fries. i suggest the thick steak cut fries! our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly... must come to again when i'm back in vegas!",

            "we were so looking forward to holsteins for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> fix we had been delaying for weeks before our visit to vegas. so when we arrived at cosmo, we headed up to holsteins on the 2nd floor on a sunday evening and walked to the hostess desk at check in. \n\nfrom the get go i already had a predetermination that we weren't going to get the friendliest girls to check in with. i figure, put your tasks aside, and greet your f'in customer. at least acknowledge them immediately. ok, so maybe it was that bad- she took my name, gave me the pager, and told me it will be just a few with a semi-courteous attitude. so we walked around out front a bit, i went over to the bar across the way and picked up a brew, went back to have a seat outside the restaurant. then i noticed my pager was chirping. this wasn't the typical light up and vibrate situation we're all used to when they are paging us to check in. this was an intermittent chirp, no lights, as if it was possibly telling me the battery was running low. i don't know! so i got up, stopped inside to inquire about, or let the hostess know (she was the same one who helped me just like seven minutes prior) the pager, and she acted like if i was freshly coming in for the first time. (mind you i had the pager held up to the hostess desk... and my beer in my other hand) the first words out of her mouth, so directly were, \"i'm sorry! no outside drinks in here\". that tripped me out and i told her about the pager chirping... \"well, it will light up when it's ready\". i was like, ya i knew that i decided she can go f herself, i'll just wait a bit more. \n\nso ok. we were paged, checked in, asked to meet the hostess down in the middle... she was a little more personable. so we sat, and sat... well it was longer than it should have been. got our popcorn :d, my beer, her coke, waitress was pretty nice... told me <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger i just placed my order for was the house favorite (thanks yelp!). it wasn't until she checked in on us, and at which i inquired about the plate i ordered when she got all defensive. i'm sorry, but i just couldn't recall if my burger had a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> on it or not. thanks to all the photos on yelp! excuse me if i got confused. she proceeded to say things like, \"well did you order one?\", \"did you want one?\" as i explained this to her, she just kind of gave me the stink eye and walked away. that is why you didn't receive a tip missy. sorry if that ruined your day.\n\nbut with that said, the hostesses walking around acting like they were directing air traffic with their little radios and smug looks on their face... holsteins, food maybe be packed full of flavor, possibly a little under portioned, you need to give your staff a lesson in attitude... \n\nwhen we visit vegas, we drop money, lots of it. i don't care if your trendy or haute... service is what bring the clients back.",

            "this is the 3rd time i've been to holstein's and i have to say it's one of my favorite places on the strip! ;) \n\nthe first two times i had a great experience, and so i will tell you about my 3rd. \n\nmy two friends and i got there about 2pm on saturday and the place was pretty jumping. almost every time we have come it's been jumping so expect a 10-15 minute wait to get seated. we left our name with the cute hostess and  they took our phone number. instead <mark>Best Of Las Vegas (7.2%) NV, USA</mark> those little beeper things, they just text someone's phone in the group when your table is ready. i love technology. \n\nwe waited in the chandelier lounge and had a fire-breathing dragon cocktail while we waited. it was a little pricey, but fun none the less. \n\nwe got seated, and boom-got the complimentary salt & vinegar popcorn to start off and some chilled waters as soon as we sat down. \n\nafter perusing the menu, which seems to get new items every few months, i chose the portabello mushroom burger and the cereal shake (made with 3 scoops vanilla ice cream,1 oz. vanilla vodka,  1/2 cup cap'n crunch cereal (dry),milk, as needed to get desired consistency,whipped cream (for garnish) and a shot of whipped cream vodka i think?) which tasted delicious! the shakes come in standard shake glass and make room for the extra they bring out in the silver shaker-bonus! my friends ordered the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> ($28 -ouch!) and the tiramisu shake-and my other friend ordered the gold medallion burger i think it was? \n\nif your on a budget, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and shakes are just big enough meal\nto split between two people or a couple, in addition to the free salt & vinegar popcorn.\n\nshakes came our first, which are almost a meal in themselves. the last two times i ordered the <mark>Campfire Smores</mark> and almondy joy (cause i love chocolate) but decided to try the cereal shake because i love cap'n crunch. i have to say i like the tiramisu over my cereal shake which was super sweet. \n\nwe ordered the lobster mac & cheese which is always good (wish they gave us a larger serving!) and we gobbled that dish down in no time between the 3 of us. \n\nburgers showed up shortly after without a beat. i also ordered a <mark>Fried Egg</mark>  on mine. my meat was moist, the portobello succulent, the avocado delish, and the <mark>Fried Egg</mark> cooked just enough not to run all over the place. this burger is way too big to eat without spilling everywhere so i cut it in half to make it easier. the fries here are not my favorite, but come with meal, the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were pretty good though.\n\nthough my burger was good, i tasted my friends <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> and the aged-kobe beef topped with goose liver (which is why it was expensive) and i have to say her burger was better than mine. don't know if i could justify the extra $12 for it. my other friend who is a big foodie, said his medallion burger was one of the best burgers he's had in a restaurant, and he's a very picky foodie. \n\nall in all another great experience,  i like the hustle and bustle of the place, and all the good looking people in cosmopolitan is never a let down. thought he place is not cheap if your looking for an inexpensive place to eat, it's a fun experience overall and great to get a slight buzz from from a shake!\n\n*note* i went hope and napped after my amazing meal. \n\nhope this helps!\n\ncheers!\n\n~mikeb", 
            "i have mixed feelings about holsteins! i want to love it so badly but i just can't! it's like the friend-zoned \"i love you but i'm not in love with you\" type of feeling. \n\nthe vibe and decor of the restaurant is cute and energetic and the servers are wonderful and attentive. the menu is also creative and has so many unique options for burger toppings such as cole slaw, tempura avocado, and <mark>Fried Egg</mark>. but when it comes down to it the food is just meh. without even including the fact that the prices are a bit steep for burgers that are on the small side. on more than one occasion the shoestring fries came out overcooked and the meat undercooked (though i did ask for medium rare..). the unique ingredients and flavors also don't meld as much as i'd like them to. \n\ni do however recommend <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> burger which is underrepresented on this yelp page (beef patty, grilled portobello, truffle oil, frisee) as well as the steak fries which are seasoned and plump. the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> has very strong flavors which didn't tingle my taste buds as much as i hoped it would. i found myself wanting to slather it in some other type of sauce which is never a good sign. shakes are basic but love the alcoholic options. also if you want to swap out fries for a side salad it's a $2 charge which is ridiculous because who actually wants salad over fries, usually it's an attempt to calm a guilty conscience. overall, not everything here is delicious but there are some great menu items which are worth coming back for :)", 
            "i came here on 2 separate occasions. one was for happy hour, another was for lunch. both times i had great, attentive service. drinks were spot on- and the food was more than i could bear.\n\nduring meal time, they give you a side of popcorn to start with. this is no regular popcorn either.. it's spiked with some kind of seasoning i can't figure out. either way, it's an explosion in your mouth and your taste buds will be a little confused.\n\nburgers are pretty massive. i got the hen house. (beef with <mark>Fried Egg</mark>, bacon, lettuce, tomato and onion with mustard & ketchup) no mustard and no onion for me. but wow, the bacon in this burger was some thick cut bacon. and the egg of course made <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> sooo much better. i got a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and yea.. i couldn't finish my meal. ha. my friend and i split a strawberry milkshake as well. typical american burger meal . it was my last meal in vegas. it certainly hit the spot and sent me home right. \n\nthe restaurant is inside the beautiful cosmpolitan right in front of marquee entry. the ambiance of this place is so cute- almost similar to toki doki. i recommend it for a good happy hour and good bar bites.",

            "i was skeptical in trying holsteins because of the mixed reviews, but after eating at gordon ramsay's burgr so much, i wanted a different burger place. originally we came here around midnight fri to try the place, but were told they stopped serving their regular menu at 11pm. they offered a late night menu instead which were basically just appetizers (no burgers/shakes). no biggie, we came back the next day after a fabulous time at marquee's dayclub...spoiler alert: we also came back the next day before we left on the drive back home because it was sooo good!!\n\nthe decor is so cute here w/ the anime pig wall posters and the theme totally matched w/ the cosmopolitan. our server made great recommendations for us & started us off w/ the complimentary small bucket of lightly salt/sweet popcorn. my bf killed that thing, talk about drunk munchies\n\nbamboozled shakes:\n<mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> - i added toasted coconut marshmallow to it and this was one damn good shake! the description/ingredients seemed so minimal, yet the shake tasted so amazing. it was like a cookies n cream reese's <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark>. this was my fav out of all the other shakes. \n\ntiramisu - they had me at mascarpone ice cream. i love mascarpone, but you could barely taste it in this shake. this tasted like a chocolate shake, not much espresso/coffee flavor. \n\nbanana creme pie - my bf go this 'cause he loves bananas and i would say this was my 2nd fav shake. it tastes exactly like a banana cream pie, but in shake form w/ chocolate. i liked that they topped it w/ white chocolate covered bananas.\n\nthe shakes are big enough to share, but trust me you won't want to. i like that you get a full glass shake and the extras are in the metal mixing cup so you can eat it w/ a spoon (yum!) i also like that their shakes all were thick & creamy!\n\napps:\nsurf 'n turf quesadilla - delish my favorite app! this ain't no taco bell quesadilla. it was crunchy and not oily at all. the lobster, steak and manchego cheese inside all just melted in your mouth and is bursting w/ flavor. must order!!\n\nsoft shell crab bruschetta - for a burger place, their presentation of these apps were tapas style and as nice as any fancy steakhouse. the softshell crab was on top of a thick cut brioche bread, the aioli and tomato salad made the app refreshing\n\ncrispy calamari - big enough portion to share, i couldn't stop dunking these rings in the sweet chili sauce. i like that they don't overbread the calamari rings\n\nmaine lobster roll - pricey for this, but there were generous amount of lobster. \n\ncrispy pork belly bun - tasted better than the ones at ramsay's burgr. the steamed buns weren't dry & sauce was spot on\n\nburgers:\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> w/ <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>(normally comes w/ fries, but paid $2 to upgrade) - the best burger ever!! most asian fusion burgers get overpowered by the sauce, but not here. it didn't taste like an ordinary overly sweet typical terriyaki burger. everything was perfect about this burger, that first bite was so orgasmic. this is what a burger should taste like! the whole brioche bun was toasted to perfection. i am not sure how they did it, but the top part of the bun and inside had a nice toast crisp to it. the tempura avocado was nice, added a different texture. you could taste each item in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and they all blended well together. the kobe beef patty was cooked medium, yet it was juicy and had a nice pink to it. <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were the best we've had as well & worth the upgrade! they were thick, fried, fresh, and crispy, no soggy oiliness at all. make sure to ask for buttermilk ranch to dip the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> in!! it tastes so divine\n\nfun-ghi on wheat bun w/ salad ($2 extra) - healthy combo huh? my 2nd fav burger, but my bf preferred this over <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> because he prefers the truffle flavor. again, patty was cooked perfect along w/ toasted wheat bun. i actually prefer the regular bun's flavor although the wheat bun was toasted the same way as the regular brioche bun. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> wasn't smothered in mayo thank god! the gruyere helped accentuate the truffle portabella & caramelized onions. salad was a generous portion of mixed greens & the dressing was tangy yet sweet & light (sort of like a coleslaw dressing w/ lemon). the only negative is that we added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, but there was no runny yolk...the egg was fully cooked :(\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> w/ <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>- everyone kept talkin about this burger, but we thought it paled in comparison to <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were bomb!\n\ni would have to say that holstein's outranks ramsay's burgr. we were so pleased w/ our meal that we sent compliments to the chef. we were lucky that both days we ate here, the executive chef was working. the food comes out fast and you will leave happily stuffed. don't forget to give them your identity player's card for points!\n\nnote: try and get a girl server. the first day we had a girl and she was totally on top of it. the 2nd day, we had a guy and he seemed easily overwhelmed", 
            "came here for or first night's dinner on a bachelorette party weekend. we showed up with 8 girls, and the first person we talked to told us it was a 45 minute wait. then someone else in our party talked to the hostess, and she told us 10 minutes. real time wait came to about 20 minutes. which is pretty good, considering we were a large party with no reservation.\n\n<mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> - big portion was easy to share, was crispy and came with a tasty dipping sauce\n<mark>Ahi Poke Tostadas</mark> - very small portion, and the ahi tuna tasted old and fishy, came with a nice avocado-like dipping sauce\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark> - was fresh, flavorful and delicious\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger - requested this medium-well, but it was served medium. was still really good, came with tasty teriyaki-type sauce, and tempura avocado!\nfries - came out warm, soggy and sad\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger - requested this medium-rare, and it came out medium. added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> for another dollar, was good and had a lot of cheese\nbeef sliders - three sliders that had very little cheese and a lot of bun. they would not let us add <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to these because of size\n<mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark> - this was really good if you like coconut\nbrown cow float - <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with pop rocks! surprisingly good\n\nthe food here was ok to good. nicely decorated with modern cartoon type art. we were sat cramped into a circle table, and we could not scoot our chairs in because the chairs kept hitting each other. there were two large booths that  could seat 8-10, but they chose to seat 3 or 4 people in them instead of us. considering the prices here, the service we received left a lot to be desired. the server took a long time to bring us water, and never checked on us after <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came out, and we ran out of water and drinks. appetizers and salad also took a long time to come out.\n\ni would not come here again. it was ok, but not awe-inspiring.",

            "came here for lunch the last time i visited vegas. i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger and holy balls was it glorious. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> comes with a kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and the best part: tempura avocado! i added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to mine which tied the all the flavors together with its gooey albeit messy goodness. at close to $20 for a burger, this thing was definitely on the pricey side but i would definitely be back to try more of their delectable offerings. i also tried some of the tiramisu alcoholic shake. these things are huge, and can easily be split amongst 2 or even 3 people. the only other gripe i have is that we were seated in a lounge type area, probably because we had a large party, but it made it difficult to handle a messy burger cause the table was more of a lower coffee table than a dining one. i found myself having to lean my back awkwardly far forward so my burger didn't get all over the place.", 
            "i've heard a lot of good things about this place. i wish i didn't hear it because my expectations were really high, and while <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> here are pretty good, i wouldn't go wild over it. the manager was nice enough to allow a reservation for 19 people at 6 pm on a saturday.  that's definitely a star well earned there.  \n\nthe service was very good.  warren took very good care of us and was so enthusiastic the whole time. i loved his excitement and spirit, and he was just on top of it.  there's another two star there.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> ($18) and added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> ($1) and avocado ($2) and subbed my fries for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> ($2).  i ordered it medium rare because i love my beef mooing and bloody at the same time.  my expectation was that it would come out that way.  20-30 minutes later we got our meals, and to my udder disappointment (or shall i say udder disappointment), my burger came out medium well.  ewww.  ground cardboard.  while <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was still good, having it medium rare could have made it that much better and probably one of the best burgers.  so it was just good, not amazing.  i was not the only one in my group of 19 with this issue.  at least 5 others stated they also ordered their burgers medium rare and it came out medium well to well done, and the one guy who ordered it well got a medium or medium rare burger.  um...that made no sense, but maybe the cooks were having an off day.  for $21 i was hoping for an orgasm in my mouth.      \n\ni didn't have any shakes because i'm not into shakes, but i had a lot of friends there who loved theirs.   \n\ni would rule this place completely out, but i can't give it bragging rights either.  i still prefer red robin  burgers over my experience at holstein's and this was the consensus amongst my group.  good burgers but poor execution.  i would try this place again just because they might have been having an off day, but in general, i'd still with cheeseburger in paradise or red robin.  we'll try again later, holstein's!",

            "3.5 stars. \n\nin fairness, i didn't get a burger because i was stuffed so i probably suffered from a case of ordering the wrong thing. lesson learned: don't order a salad at a burger joint. my boyfriend loved his burger, on the other hand, and had the option to add a <mark>Fried Egg</mark>. i did notice that <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are a little bit on the small side for the price. \n\nthere are tons of beer choices as well. love that they served pizza-flavored popcorn as a free appetizer. the <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> was amazing and a must-order appetizer (ask for extra chips if you need them). \n\nagain, i probably just ended up ordering the wrong thing (salad with ahi tuna) which was really bland... but worth coming here to try <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and shakes."

            "i had high hopes for holsteins. i love a good burger, and shakes with booze...yes please!! \n\ni was there with a party of 12, and we were early for our 6pm reservation, but we were told we couldn't be seated until our entire party was there. not a problem, that's not unusual. by the time the majority of our party was there, they seated us. we were all ridiculously hungry, so were excited with the quick appearance of our servers. because of the size of our party, they split our table in half. they attempted to split the bill as well, but we asked it to be kept on one. we quickly ordered some appetizers and waited in anticipation. \n\nlobster corn dogs: good, but not great \n<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>: extremely tasty! \nlobster mac n cheese: i only had a small bite of this, but could have easily eaten a whole plateful! \nphilly steak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> (i think): ehhh \n\nso far so good...i was pleased with the appetizers, and ready for my burger! i kept it simple and ordered a classic cheeseburger, and it was great. i can't complain. i had it with steak fries which were also good. the overall consensus of the group was that the food was good. \n\nso why the 2 stars? while the food was good, maybe even great, the service was terrible. wait, i have to clarify, half of the table's service was terrible. while pete's side of the table got their food right away and with no problems, nicole's side of the table had several problems... \n\n1. <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> girl ordered a classic burger with cheddar cheese, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, bacon, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark> and no tomatoes. what she got was a cheeseburger with tomatoes, no onions, bacon or mushrooms. while i acknowledge this was not nicole's fault, because she read back the order correctly, so someone messed up in the kitchen...what upset me was that by the time she got the right order, the rest of us were almost done eating! and throughout the whole time nicole never came back to give us any kind of updates. \n\n2. someone else ordered a burger (i honestly can't remember which one) with brie and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>. when she got her burger and opened it up, the brie was mostly rind and barely any cheese, so she asked it to be sent back and just asked for cheddar instead. this also took a ridiculous amount of time. \n\n3. someone ordered a beer that never came \n\nduring this time another one of our party decided to say something to the manager, steve. as soon as we said something to him, he brought <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> out. he was very helpful and apologetic, but he messed up too. the second burger was supposed to have <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> and it didn't, we noticed this immediately so the one who ordered it let steve now, he immediately said \"oh no, there are <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> on there, i saw them put them on\" then in what seemed like a scene out of a movie or a cooking competition, she slowly lifted the bun to expose raw onions on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. obviously steve was left a little red in the face. to his credit, he did comp us those two meals, but the ordeal left the majority of us disappointed and upset. <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> girl couldn't even finish half of her burger because she had been so hungry she was left feeling sick and unable to eat. \n\nthe duck fat fries were disappointing, but the shoestring and steak fries were yummy, and i also enjoyed the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. \n\noh and the server (who's name i didn't catch) who was pouring drinks, then \"tying his shoes\" while we talked to the manager...you're not slick dude.  we know you were listening, probably hoping it wasn't you we were complaining about.\n\nwhat is most disappointing, is that the food is good enough for a return visit, but the service alone makes me not want to set foot in the place ever again.", 
            "what's better than eating a good burger in a cool/hip setting with good music? eating that same burger with a booze filled milk shake!  holsteins was one of the first restaurants i ate at during my recent vegas vacation and i have to say that i would definitely eat here again on my next visit.  the various burger offerings and descriptions made it difficult to choose but i finally settled on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  \n\nmy burger was perfectly cooked/seasoned and was topped off with an obscene amount of <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> and mushrooms.  the steakcut fries were good but nothing to write home about.  i ordered the orange dreamsicle shake which was awesome and not overly rich like the grasshopper shake my buddy ordered.\n\nalthough the restaurant was rather spacious there was only one bathroom for each gender which made waiting in line a common occurrence.  i'm not sure if they have a happy hour or other drink specials (the cheeky bartender stated that every hour was \"happy\") but the drink pricing was reasonable for vegas.", 
            "i am giving this place 3.5 stars. the service was weird from the start. we had a party of five, and they made us wait 10 minutes when the restaurant only had about 5 tables full. we sat down, were handed menus, and our waiter never came by for another 10 minutes. one of us had to ask someone for water, and ask for a waiter. the waiter also took forever to come back to take our orders.\n\nfrom there, it seemed like he tried to redeem himself the entire time. we finally ordered. i had the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> for $28. it was a kobe beef patty with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, onions, frisee, and truffle mayo. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was really good and filling. i only ate half. it came with a  side of fries and i mistakenly chose the shoestring fries. the steak fries were much better. oh yea, the waiter bought us buckets of fries while we waited for our food to try to suck up to us. it came with a house made ketchup that was really good. \n\nmy friend's burger was sent back to the kitchen twice. he asked for a well done patty, and it came out super rare that it bled all over the plate. second, they forgot the <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>.\n\nlastly, the waiter called the manager over to give us free dessert of liquid nitrogen meringues. \n\noverall, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fries were fine, but the service was weird.", 
            "this place is totally overpriced, but what isn't in vegas?  i may be a little biased with my rating as it is located in the cosmopolitan and that is the hotel i stayed in, so it was very convenient.  but this place has great burgers and it is an awesome hangover fix.  i got the hen house burger cooked medium well.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> has an egg, bacon and i paid $1 more for the <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> as opposed to the raw onions.  my burger was more like a medium instead of medium well but it was juicy and delicious none the less.  i recommend this place for sure!", 
            "i like your buns hun\n***************************\n\n\nthis was quite a nice hidden gem at the cosmopolitan that i have discovered.  in contrast to gordon ramsey's burgr, this place is not as crowded.   i felt i had a lot of elbow space.  i sat at the counter, but there were nice comfy looking couches in the restaurant.  \n\ni ordered the \"holstein beef tiny buns\" with american cheese.  basically 3 sliders.  i have had my share of sliders in the past, but these were well above average.  to paraphrase harold and kumar, \" those itty-bitty <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> that just explode in your mouth like flavor crystals every time you bite into one.\"   the fries were nothing special.  \n\ni see myself coming back to this place for a quick meal break after playing blackjack.", 
            "talk about kitsch! this place was adorable! we didn't know what to expect when we stopped in for lunch. we were seated in back and looked over the menu while we marveled at the art on the wall. pickles with boobs kind of amused us greatly. \n\ni wasn't terribly hungry, so i ordered the sliders, and at 13.00, i got three small burgers, topped with brioche buns and pickles, mustard and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>. each about the size of a silver dollar. my friend, a school teacher, ordered the salad with salmon. she said her food was done perfectly, and we got a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. \n\neverything was great, except the -already drunk- douchebros behind us who were so very loud and so very annoying that it made it hard for us to enjoy the rest of our meal. people like that.. *ugh* \n\nover all, i'd love to come back and re-explore the location. i'll have to come back again!"

            "hands down the best burger place in town. i am writing this review after the 2nd time coming here...forgive me...i am a very busy person with 2 crazy monkeys to raise...yelp kinda takes a back seat. \ni was lucky enough to come here a second time with my bestest foodie friend, rob m. (ll cool mack if you're nasty) for a belated birthday dinner (i told you i was a busy girl). it wasn't very crowded and we were seated right away. on our way back to our table i spotted the server we had last time...the lovely noelle. noelle is what every server should aspire to be. she is knowledgeable, genuinely caring about your experience (my monkeys loved her) and an all around cool person. if you are smart you will trust her recommendations (she's batting for 1000 after 2 visits). we had the most amazing food:\n-new belgium hoptober beer\n-lobster truffle mac n' cheese (a must...you will be licking the plate clean)\n-mini sliders with beef tenderloin, fois gras, arugula, truffle mayo and a <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark> demi glaze (they are small but bursting with flavor)\n-the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger (what they are famous for...i can see why)\n-the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> adult milkshake (so tasty, not super boosy...even gave some to the monkeys. they loved it)\n-maple glazed donuts with vanilla cream filling and bacon bits on top (holy cow i died and went to heaven).\n\nnow the downside....this place isn't a fast food restaurant. good food is worth the wait and you will wait a bit here. i appreciated the wait time in between courses so i could digest and really enjoy all my food. if you are in a hurry don't come here...you will be bummed. also...its kinda pricey but well worth it in my mind. you are looking at around $60 per person depending on what you drink. if you can't afford it...don't eat here...simple as that. \n\ni will be back soon and hopefully miss noelle will be our girl again.", 
            "out of all the places we experienced this trip to vegas, this was by far the most memorable, happy and delicious dining experience we had! \n   let me just say i'm a huge top chef fan.  also a huge yelper.  so i had done a lot of research before our trip to vegas, and this was on my top 3 list to experience on this adventure.  having been a fan of carlos on top chef (darn those macaroons that did him in), i really wanted to try his restaurant and husband liked the sounds of burgers and shakes.\n   so, early on a monday night, we stepped into holsteins, was greeted warmly and shown to our table.  waitress was quick and friendly.  service could not have been better.  we were brought some bbq popcorn to start (neat touch)...i ordered a glass of wine (sorry, know it should've been a shake, but i knew i could count on husband for that and he did indeed order <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> cake one).  having eaten at wicked spoon earlier in the day, we opted to share a burger. \n     <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>* / 16.5\nbeef patty crusted with black pepper, \nholsteins creamy steak sauce, marmalade \nonions, tomato confit, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>, swiss cheese.\n\n    i asked that the mushrooms be served on the side for my husband as i don't do mushrooms.  (no problem).  he chose shoestring fries for the side.  \n   i asked the waitress if the \"top chef\" happened to be there on a monday night?  (surely he would not be?)  she said she didn't know but would check.  next thing i know he's not only there but coming out of the kitchen to meet us!  what a delightful friendly guy!  and he informed us that he had hired craig from the same top chef series.  yep.  a little while later carlos came out with craig!  husband took my picture with both of them!  oh my gosh, i'm such a geek, but geez these guys worked their tails off on that show and i so respected them and appreciated them for it.  and now i was not only meeting them but eating their food!  this burger was the best burger i've ever had (sorry bobby flay, you've finally been surpassed).  and fortunately husband's shake made him so full he couldn't finish his half of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> so i got it.  (waitress later told us that it had five scoops of ice cream in it).\n    so, full, dessert was mentioned.  i said we were full but had heard about the donuts.  no they didn't serve them any more except with a particular drink.  i expressed sadness to not be able to try it.  next thing i know, here comes two donut holes, one for each of us, with a cream filling...maple and bacon.  yum yum yum.\n    thank you holsteins for our favorite dining experience on this trip to vegas!  excellent waitress (sorry i can't remember your name), thank you too and carlos and craig, please know you made our trip to vegas this time!", 
            "burgers are probably one of my favorite foods in the whole wide world. i mean....bread, meat, cheese, and stuff - nothing better than that.\ni crave them on a regular basis.\nat least 4 times a day.\n\nso while in vegas, i looked for burgers. and my research was made pretty easy because they are everywhere. food trucks, chains, gourmet (hello hubert!)...you name it. and then i stumbled upon holsteins reviews, and i read a couple of magic words: spiked shakes.\ni was sold.\n\nturns out, that was a pretty good choice. holsteins actually uses the tender meat of its namesake breed of cow/beef and the result is a juicy, flavorful patty of deliciousness.\n******nerdy time: did you know?**********\n\n1. holsteins are little dutch princesses. read: the netherlands are their country of origin. i hear that their mooing is quite harsh to the ears, and they love eating tulips and gouda, but not always together.\n\n2. they are the highest milk producers in the world. hence the milk shakes, duh. they are the lovely black and white \"meu-meu\" of my childhood, and i love 'em.\n\n3. one of them - pauline wayne if you please - was the official pet of president taft and was allowed to graze on the white house lawn, the lucky bitch.\n\n********end of nerdy time***************\n\nthe sad thing? they are only in vegas.\nthe good thing? since you are reading these reviews on yelp, you are most likely in vegas and can enjoy without gilt.\nhurray!\n\nwe shared the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> with dry aged sirloin, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby aregula and garlic-chive aioli (at a whooping $17.40), and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, a patty crusted with black pepper, holsteins own creamy steak sauce, marmelade onions, tomato confit, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark> and swiss cheese. \nand people, that was pretty close to perfection. great combination of flavors, a medium rare meat at its best, crispy fries and a grasshopper milk shake.....aahhhhh....\nleave your calorie counter at home, in the hotel room or in your pocket. just enjoy.", 
            "3.5ish, really, but a few factors kick it up to 4:\n\n-hip environment. we only sat at the bar, as they were packed, but it seemed more fun there anyway.\n-unique/bold ingredients on the menu. i love when a place isn't scared to try new things!\n-clear identity. it's good when you know what a place is about and they don't seem too schizophrenic when you open the menu.\n-tons of drinks to choose from!\n\nwe tried a few things and shared:\n-kalbi beef quesadilla: not bad, but not blown away. bear in mind, i had the filling only, so perhaps with the flavors of the tortilla, it'd be better.\n-shared <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>: crusted in black pepper with holstein's creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>, and swiss cheese. again, just ok. but, i think most burgers are 'just ok' to me now since i don't eat the bun.  the ingredients were good and put together well.  we also got a side of <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, which was nice.\n-jim g had two of the many, many, many beers and i tried their spicy bloody mary with pepper&cilantro infused vodka. pretty good.  \n\ni wanted to try one of their many 'shakes,' full of sweet and alcohol-y goodness. but i felt the carbs were too much. i know one drunken night i'll stumble in there and order one. i'll report back =)\n\nthe food is intriguing and there's plenty more on the menu that i want to try; that factor makes me give a place a little more credit up front, since they've piqued my interest. they try to use organic products, and i'm a fan of that. and, lastly, block 16 management group runs them; they're the same group that does public house, which i really like too.  these people have a sense of style and uniqueness with food and decor.  good for them!", 
            "located on the 2nd floor of the cosmopolitan, i brought a friend from out of town to check out this joint known for high end burgers and boozy milkshakes.  the restaurant space has a good mix of seats at the bar, low tables with comfy couches, and standard booths/chairs.  music is pumping and artwork on the walls definitely add a cool vibe, but it's not overwhelming where one can't enjoy good conversation amongst close friends.\n\nas for the menu, there is quite the impressive beverage selection including a wide array of international/domestic beers, wines, cocktails, and unique sodas.  my friend and i were definitely in the mood to pair some burgers with their signature shakes and i got the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> (with reese's, banana, malt, and frangelico) whereas my friend ordered the creamsicle float (whipped cream smirnoff,  orange sherbet, ibc cream soda, and orange bubble sugar).  my biggest fear was that the alcohol component would actually distract one's enjoyment of the milkshake, but unexpectedly the problem ended up being the complete opposite in that neither of us tasted nor felt any effects of any trace of alcohol in our shakes (i.e. neither one of us had our trademark asian flush go into effect).  perhaps the holstein's staff has figured out some magic ratio/technique to eliminate both the taste and effect of alcohol in their shakes, but a little of both would serve to go a long way especially if one is paying double digit dollars.\n\nas for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, we opted to split the crowd favorite <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> consists of dry aged sirloin with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli, but my taste buds felt like they were in charlie brown's classroom in that all the ingredients were rendered a slur of incomprehensibility by the overpowering goat cheese.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, on the other hand, did a much better job showcasing its melange of ingredients consisting of pepper-crusted beef, housemade creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>,  and swiss cheese.  taste buds were dancing their way upstairs to marquee on this one.  for every burger, one has the choice of shoestring fries or the thick steak fries (which resemble seasoned potato wedges) so one will not go wrong depending on personal preference.  \n\noverall, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>  do not come cheap (ranging from $14-28) nor do the milkshakes ($11) but to paraphrase vincent vega from pulp fiction,  \"that's a pretty f*cking good milkshake/burger. i don't know if it's worth (insert some double digit number) dollars but it's pretty f*cking good.\"", 
            "this swanky burger joint is located right across the nightclub marquee's entrance inside the cosmopolitan hotel. from the artwork on the wall that reminds me of oldskool 90's taggers to the loud hip music blaring through the speakers, holstein 's is hard to miss. we made it there around 7:30pm on a saturday night and the wait was no more than 20 minutes for our party of four. when your pager starts buzzing and you report to the host at the door, you're ushered to the next host in the middle of place, which that person will walk you over to your table. the place is vibrant, loud, and hip. just like in a nyc subway train, you have everything from skirts to suits to shorts & flip flops occupying this restaurant.\n \nmany items on the menu sound appealing including their numerous $11 alcoholic shakes. we ordered the frozen grasshopper: peppermint, chocolate, cr\\u00e8me de menthe, van gogh chocolate vodka. if you love them little minty & crunchy chocolate balls, then this shake is right up your alley. there's plenty of it, a bit overwhelming actually but some people like it that way. that distinct alcohol taste is barely noticed. we also got the oreo with bailey's irish cream. this is what i considered a \"safe\" shake to order. if you enjoy oreos (who doesn't?) then this is a solid route to go. again, the taste of alcohol isn't really prevalent. warning, if you have issues with dairy then you may want to stay away from the shakes here. i really don't but it did activate.... uhh nevermind.\n \nseems like <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> $17 is quite popular from many of the reviews and sure enough someone on our table ordered it. kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake not to be mistaken by bukake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado. seriously, what is there not to like about that set up? if it was truly an asian inspired burger, then a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> would finish the job. you can add it though for a buck more. i was a little sad that i didn't order this burger for myself but my buddy was kind enough to give me a slice of heaven.\n \ni ended up with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> $17.5: beef patty crusted with black pepper, holstein's creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>, swiss cheese. oh you fancy huh? because it sure did sound fancy. although <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was good, my mind was set on <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> as the unanimous winner this night. the pepper was probably what i remember most about this burger. i did finish it but i most likely wouldn't care to order it again.\n \nthe maine lobster roll $16.5: fresh cooked lobster tossed in chive aioli in a grilled mini hot dog bun with cole slaw. the price is steep, the portion is crazy bite sized, but the taste landed a mike tyson uppercut. why oh why do you tease us like that holstein 's? gimme more!\n \nthe steak cut fries and the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were decent but can be better.\n \noverall, holstein 's should be visited at least once and from there you can determine if you want to be a regular. the meal was quite enjoyable but i'm not sure if it left an uber lasting effect on my appetite glands. i can probably live with or without it. for sure, give it a shot. on fridays, saturdays, and mondays, they are opened beyond their normal hours, midnight to 2am. however, their full menu isn't available but rather a separate and shorter late night menu. check out the art work on the walls, i want one for my place!",

            "they should rename this place holsteins beers and buns. the beer selection was amazing and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable in all 132 beers! \n\nafter ordering our beers, it was time to pick a burger. i had the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>. this was kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chops and 1,000 island dressing. i wasn't impressed with my burger, it was just okay. i asked for medium and it came out well done so my burger was pretty dry and lacking juices. \n\nmy boyfriend got <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> (beef patty crusted with black pepper, holsteins creamy steakhouse sauce, tomato confit, marmalade onions, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>, and swiss cheese). this was much better than my burger! however, he ordered medium rare and it was more cooked than he wanted. \n\nwe both got fries with our burgers and they were just okay. we like our fries more crispy. our favorite part of our meals were our beers. we are interested in coming back for another drink sometime!", 
            "all that hype was a let down. i chose this over shake shack and i should have done the opposite. \n\nthe ambiance is cool and laid back with great art work that is quite fitting for what they serve. it is open and airy with plenty of room to sit and hang while you get sloppy with their alcohol infused shakes. \n\nwe were seated immediately and was met with a very friendly and knowledgable host. she was able to steer us in any direction with great suggestions on drinks and appetizers. \n\ni ordered the urth burger adding cheddar and grilled <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark> and chris ordered the standard with avocado. the lobster mac n' cheese and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were also ordered. \n\nthe meals came promptly and was a decent size. chris said it was a burger with nothing special. he said the patty was just a patty with underwhelming flavors.....he did mention that an in n out would have been better. my urth burger was nothing exciting either. the patty was bland and their blend of veggies was of mediocre level. i definitely had better veggie burger at a far more unknown spot. i couldn't bring myself to finish <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. chris ate his but was still hungry. the lobster mac n' cheese was okay. just a bit runny and very little lobster. chris was not a fan. i was left to eat most of it by myself b\n\nwe didn't try their shake which i am sure is the highlight of this location. maybe next time. but as far as burgers go....we were not impressed and probably wouldn't be back for their burgers but maybe for their shakes.", 
            "the last few years of kicking my foodie habit into overdrive has probably made me a bit snobby, but i'm truly surprised that many here are saying that holstein's dished up the best burger that some have ever had. my burger was fine, but it certainly wasn't anything that went above and beyond a-ok. \n\nstar 1: how were the service and atmosphere?\n\nthe highlight of my visit to holstein's was without a doubt the service and atmosphere, which complimented the obviously excellent location. i rolled in on the later side of a thursday evening and walked by several times over the course of the weekend: while crowded, there was rarely a wait, which was refreshing. from there my bartender doubling as my server was excellent, and i left feeling good about the experience even though the food didn't blow me away. star granted. \n\nstar 2: how were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nwhile my $15 threshold for a sit-down burger of any kind is often a pretty hard ceiling, i'm going to have to relent when it comes to vegas prices on the strip. my <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and side of fries came to $18.00, and while that would normally be enough for me to take a good critical look at this star, i have no choice but to chalk that cost up to the vegas premium. star granted. \n\nstars 3 and 4: how was the food?\n\nhonestly my <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was just okay, which was a bit of a letdown given the impressive laundry list of ingredients and peripherals. the black pepper crusted patty had some very good flavor, but it was simply too small given the size and quantity of other toppings and the lofty bun. the mixed greens went well with the proprietary steak sauce, but the marmalade onions were overpowering to the point where i didn't really even realize that the <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark> and swiss cheese were in the mix. \n\nprobably the low point of the meal was the <mark>French Fries</mark>, which, soft, limp and tasting as though they came out of a frozen bag, didn't add anything to the equation. single star granted. \n\nstar 5: would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nholstein's is probably worth a visit, but i can't recommend it over some of the other options in town. no star granted.", 
            "my girlfriend and i spent a whole month in the states exploring some of the best bbq joints that there was to offer along with lots of mexican and any roller coasters we found on our way too. predominantly our trip was based on a bbq pilgrimage to the holy lands of bbq but we had our fair share of burgers along the way.\n\nwe had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger and <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark>. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was outstanding with a medium rare, dry aged sirloin patty, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and chive and garlic aioli but as per the usual, i'll rewrite the menu slightly in adding <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was juicy and cooked perfectly and all the flavours worked well together but only thing that i wasn't impressed with fries weren't crispy which is a big oversight for me and often a comment on a restaurant because i wonder if they can't get fries right, what the standard of other items might be.\n\nit was unfortunate that the <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark> were way too acidic and vinegary for me and the girlfriend declined to eat any more after her first. a little more balance in the sauce and also a little crispier would have made them awesome though.\n\noverall i'd definitely go back for a burger again but i'd make sure that i asked for the chips to be extra crispy.\n\ncheers!\n\ndave."

            "it's hard to resist a restaurant that offers spiked shakes and gourmet burgers.  my friend june had been to holsteins on an earlier vegas trip and come back raving that it was the one restaurant she'd hit that she wanted to revisit.  i can't tell you how many times i stared drooling at the menu before we went for dinner.\n\nholsteins is in the new and beautiful cosmopolitan hotel, and it's right across from marquee.  we went and got stamped for the marquee before we checked in for dinner, and we ended up missing our reservation (held for fifteen minutes).  the staff was nice about it, though, and it turned out that seating, even for a party of seven, was not a problem.  holsteins is a swanky place, with comfortable booths and a giant pink cow on display.  we had a waiter named chaz, and he was friendly and on his game.\n\nthe drinks were everything i wanted and more.  the spiked milkshakes were absolutely delicious.  the frozen grasshopper came with peppermint meringue, chocolate crunchies, creme de menthe, and van gogh dutch chocolate vodka.  i can't imagine it was terribly boozy, but it was a fabulous milkshake, with full mint chocolate flavor and the perfect thickness.  the little meringue was delightful, and the crunchy chocolate bits added texture to every sip.  the brown cow was also fantastic, an adult <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float made with <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, vanilla ice cream, pop rocks, and charbay tahitian vanilla rum.  it had all the kid-pleasing taste of a great <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark>, and i can't overstate the fun of pop rocks.  i also tried the bloody mary, without ice cream, but with smirnoff infused with pepper and cilantro, combined with bloody mary mix and garnished with a toothpick bearing an olive and a cocktail shrimp.  i love a good bloody mary, and this was a good one.  it had a heavy spicy flavor but a thin clean texture, and i appreciate food in my drink when appropriate.\n\nour table split three appetizers, and that felt like the right amount.  the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> were easily my favorite, breaded and deep-fried dill spears, olives, and caper berries, served with small sides of prosciutto and salami and an herb-caper mayo for dipping.  these were magical.  the breading was flavorful, crispy, and light, and the pickles oozed their pickly flavor.  i would also recommend the bucket of <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark>, which came with a bleu cheese dip.  nothing fancy, but delicious.  i was disappointed, though, by the truffle lobster mac' n cheese.  the creamy tallegio-mascarpone sauce was more creamy than it was cheesy, making the appetizer more like a macaroni salad.  the maine lobster was barely there, and the black truffle didn't come through.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were very good, though i suspect that the strength may lie in the toppings.  <mark>The Classic</mark> - with just lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, ketchup, and pickles - was the most boring of the bunch, and that doesn't hold true with a remarkable patty.  the patties were definitely tasty, though, with plenty of juice, and they held up well to some fun accompaniments.  my favorite was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>.  with a kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado, it was definitely a loaded gimmick of a fusion burger - but damn if i didn't gobble it down.  the teriyaki was sweet but not cloying, and the salt of the speckles of dried seaweed was great.  the crispy yam gave a welcome crunch, and that strip of avocado tempura was creamy and beautiful.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was also good, a dry-aged beef sirloin burger topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli.  it was less of a stand-out, though, and the tomato confit did not bring on the umami parade i'd hoped for.  if you like lamb burgers, the big fat greek is a good choice.  with greek spiced lamb, feta cream, lettuce, tomato, tzatziki sauce, and red onion and olive relish, it's a little like a greek menu threw up on a burger.  the result, though, is hearty and pretty well done.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> all come with a side of fries, and you have a choice of shoestring, sweet potato, and steak cut.  i prefer my thin fries, and the shoestring and sweet potato were both superb.  holsteins knows its way around a potato - even the steak cut fries were well seasoned and not at all mushy.\n\nwhen we left for marquee we were all stuffed to the brim.  the meal was not cheap - burgers started at $13 and shakes were $11 - but it was a satisfying feast that hardly qualified as a splurge in vegas.  i've had better burgers, but i was impressed by <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, and i doubt i've had better milkshakes.  if you're in vegas hankering for a fattening meal, check holsteins out.", 
            "it's almost hard to believe that holstein's is run by the same people responsible for lbs at the red rock. i guess if i had to make an analogy, this place is like michael jackson (in terms of talent, not behavior or affinity for boys) whereas lbs is latoya (or maybe even janet) and the lbs patty wagon is tito.\n\nwhat that means, is this place rocks. the menu is more diverse and creative than it's sibling establishments with it's spiked milkshakes, apps, burgers, alternative dishes for non-burger folks, and an extensive beer list.\n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> ($16.50) is an amazing burger made out of a sizable kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake (yeah, i had to look up furikake to know what it was... i'm not ashamed to admit it), crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. the ingredients gave it a rich, sweet, unique flavor and the crispy yam bits a crunchy texture. if i have any complaint about this burger it's the height of it. the thick patty and huge slices of avocado make it difficult to get the whole thing in your mouth (didn't macauley culkin say the same thing to mj?).\n\nmy wife got the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> ($17.50) - dry aged beef sirloin with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli. she loved it and only let me have one bite. if you want a more traditional burger, go for this. but, i still thought <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> was better.\n\neach burger came with an order of fries. so she got the regular fries and i got he steak cut fries. both were very good -- crispy exterior, light and soft interior.\n\nour son got the kid's chicken fingers and fries. that's always a winner with him. it came with 3 big tenders and some carrots and celery.\n\neven after those big burgers we still had room for dessert. our choice... lollipops. the chocolate brownie and strawberry were excellent. the lemon meringue and <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> were largely forgettable and uninspired and the blondie was bland and didn't come close to reminding me of a blondie brownie.\n\ndespite the lackluster dessert, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were so good i can overlook that misstep. we didn't have any issues with the service, especially the kitchen, which sent out the food surprisingly fast. i'm not sure if i'd say this is my favorite burger place, but it's definitely one of the top and one that shouldn't be missed.",

            "3.5ish, really, but a few factors kick it up to 4:\n\n-hip environment. we only sat at the bar, as they were packed, but it seemed more fun there anyway.\n-unique/bold ingredients on the menu. i love when a place isn't scared to try new things!\n-clear identity. it's good when you know what a place is about and they don't seem too schizophrenic when you open the menu.\n-tons of drinks to choose from!\n\nwe tried a few things and shared:\n-kalbi beef quesadilla: not bad, but not blown away. bear in mind, i had the filling only, so perhaps with the flavors of the tortilla, it'd be better.\n-shared <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>: crusted in black pepper with holstein's creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>, and swiss cheese. again, just ok. but, i think most burgers are 'just ok' to me now since i don't eat the bun.  the ingredients were good and put together well.  we also got a side of <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, which was nice.\n-jim g had two of the many, many, many beers and i tried their spicy bloody mary with pepper&cilantro infused vodka. pretty good.  \n\ni wanted to try one of their many 'shakes,' full of sweet and alcohol-y goodness. but i felt the carbs were too much. i know one drunken night i'll stumble in there and order one. i'll report back =)\n\nthe food is intriguing and there's plenty more on the menu that i want to try; that factor makes me give a place a little more credit up front, since they've piqued my interest. they try to use organic products, and i'm a fan of that. and, lastly, block 16 management group runs them; they're the same group that does public house, which i really like too.  these people have a sense of style and uniqueness with food and decor.  good for them!", 
            "so i stayed in the cosmo from march 8-12 and this was the first restaurant that we decided to dine in. honestly wasn't planning on it but some friends from las vegas wanted to meet up here.\n\nfirst impression....ambiance, music, decor were all spectacularly modern. place seemed like the spot to be for a friday night bite. we were seated immediately (arrived at 7ish). the beer list is top notch and that is a huge deal for me when i am getting the evening started. took us a while to all decide on what we should eat. seemed like the server got a bit frustrated with our inability to make decisions.\n\ni went with the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, based on the servers recommendation. i have never had a dry aged burger, but boy am i craving one now holy smokes. dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli....i usually like to dry dog my meat....not one for lubrication as far as condiments and such go. but they did a fantastic job focusing on not slopping up such a delightful cut... er uh grind of beef. pretty close to the best burger i have ever sunk my teeth into. didnt even get around to polishing off the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>....first ones i have ever had that were actually crispy...i understand how dificult it is to crispify a sweet potato fry.\n\nserver really pushed the spiked shakes...but i was so full....he said \"dude i can put it in a to-go cup for you\"....i caved into the raspberry cheesecake shake it was damn good....even after a night in the freezer...vodka shake is good for breakfast boys and girls.\n\n****server cheesed it up by fist bumping me*****\nthought that was kinda lame but whatever\n\neat \nat\nthis\nplace\nwhen\ngoing\non\na\nbender\nin\nlas\nvegas!", 
            "we attended the nab show this year and stopped by holsteins for dinner.  since none have eaten here before, we decided to order three different burgers and share.   so here is how they ranked.  number one was definitely the billionaire's burger: kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, truffle mayo.  to die for!  second was the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>: dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli.  it is their signature burger.  the third was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>.  i think it was our least favorite because we were so full by the time we tried it.  it was good but turned out to be too rich at the moment.  overall, they were all really tasty and i recommend everyone (even if burgers are not your thing) to try this place at least once! i was in burger heaven that night!", 
            "every time i try to come here, the wait is always ridiculous.  i never remember to make reservations either cause, well, it's a burger place!  finally, this past weekend around 2pm, after a somewhat \"short\" wait of 40 minutes, i got to try holsteins.\n\nit actually took the 4 of us awhile to look through the menu, and in the end, i went with the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, which is a burger with dry aged beef sirloin burger, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli.  i ordered it medium rare and came with a nice pink middle.  what really caught my attention about the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was the dry aged beef, since dry aging beef condenses the beef flavor, and wow that burger was juicy.  out of all 4 burgers, mine was the only one that had juices dripping down my fingers, even versus the kobe beef burgers!\n\nthe toppings were all great, especially the aged goat cheddar.  you can tell it's a little different than your normal cheddar.  the garlic-chive aioli has a mellow garlic taste.  besides hoping the bacon was a little bit crispier, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> is really a burger that's up there in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> world.  it's just a very tasty burger and i can see why it is so popular!\n\ni also tried a bit of <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, as well as the korean bull-gogi.  <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> is more of an asian fusion burger, with teriyaki glaze and a tempura avocado that sits on top of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  it also has a kobe beef patty, so the whole burger had this velvety smooth texture thanks to the fatty patty and the smooth creamy avocado!  i would like a bit more teriyaki sauce though.\n\nas for the korean bull-gogi burger, the patty is marinated to give it extra flavor.  the best part is definitely the <mark>Fried Egg</mark> that sits on top.  who can resist the egg yolk just running all over the kimchi slaw and the beef patty??\n\nout of all the fries, i liked the steak cut fries the most.  crunchy exterior with a creamy potato center.  <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were great as well.  the shoestring fries were a little stale to me.\n\nnow, with shakes as part of its name, we knew we had to try a few of their shakes and ended up getting the black cow float and the frozen grasshopper.  black cow float is a fun and somewhat nostalgic shake since it is more like a coke flat with the ice cream rather than a true shake.  it even comes with pop rocks!  the frozen grasshopper is a must for any mint chocolate fans.  smooth creamy minty frozen goodness.  for both shakes, we could taste the alcohol but it was pretty well masked!\n\nthey also have a bunch of beers on draft.  <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> triple karmeliet is a good one!\n\nprice-wise, it is pricey.  our burgers were around $18, with shakes at $11.  the price should reflect great service but i found the service a bit lacking.  our waitress only came to check on us twice and it took awhile to get her attention for the check as well.\n\nafter our meal, i can see why so many people like <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> at holsteins.  can't wait till the next time to try our other burgers!", 
            "**** 4.5 stars ****\n\none of the great miracles of las vegas is that you can eat like a fatty fat fat all day every day and still go to pools surrounded by gorgeous plastic-pumped women and sing nonsense like \"sexy and i know it\", regardless of any absence of truth to that assertion. holsteins provides the perfect venue for stuffing your face on delicious patties of top quality beef while also getting an eye full of the local ladies. unbeknownst to me at the time, the same chef is behind this as public house, where i had dined the night before, and his love of squeezing his employees into clothing that might be mistaken for a table cloth was much more prominent here than there. the d\\u00e9cor here is also just dope. i love the slightly sick toons on the walls, and there are homage to pigs and cows all around. if you look at most of the complaints here it's from people who didn't actually order a burger, so i suggest you take those reviews for what they are, and don't make the same mistake.\n\nbut, since it's vegas, you will still stuff your face to the maximum in front of this beautiful bevy, knowing that you're helping to pay for their salary so that they can go to the pool tomorrow and pretend guys like you don't exist (until you buy them a pitcher of margaritas, then you're superstar hero of the next couple minutes, congrats). brian and i both took the luxury route on the menu here, although i passed on the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> with kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo, because i've already had half a dozen burgers like this across america and they all taste roughly the same...rich and oily. it was honestly more difficult passing up <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, a truly unique combination of kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado...super intriguing, and if i had been dining with someone i was dating i likely would have tried to persuade them in that direction. somehow i managed to also resist ordering a decadent milkshake, perhaps because we were eating dinner just 4 hours after we had managed to roll out of bed for lunch.\n\ni finally wound up deciding on the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, a dry aged beef sirloin patty topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and a garlic-chive aioli...nothing too crazy, but lots of big, bold, wonderful flavors, and at $18 the most expensive burger not topped with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>. the result was pretty fantastic, definitely one of the better burgers i've had lately, and came with a monstrous basket of nicely done <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (for a supplemental charge). my biggest complaint, which is kind of random, is that they skewer <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with their own stupid little logo stick to keep the bun on for presentation, which has the resulting effect of causing huge gobs of mayo or sauce to squirt from the hole in the top every time you take a bite. eating these burgers is a mess, to be sure, especially when you add on a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> as i do, but if you're like me you've already realized you're not taking one of the voluptuous vixens home (although my reason is probably different than yours) so you've resigned your face to more indulgent pleasures, like egg yolk, garlic aioli, and hamburger grease.\n\njust make sure to thoroughly wash your beard, or your own lady might catch on...and get jealous.", 
            "located on the 2nd floor of the cosmopolitan, i brought a friend from out of town to check out this joint known for high end burgers and boozy milkshakes.  the restaurant space has a good mix of seats at the bar, low tables with comfy couches, and standard booths/chairs.  music is pumping and artwork on the walls definitely add a cool vibe, but it's not overwhelming where one can't enjoy good conversation amongst close friends.\n\nas for the menu, there is quite the impressive beverage selection including a wide array of international/domestic beers, wines, cocktails, and unique sodas.  my friend and i were definitely in the mood to pair some burgers with their signature shakes and i got the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> (with reese's, banana, malt, and frangelico) whereas my friend ordered the creamsicle float (whipped cream smirnoff,  orange sherbet, ibc cream soda, and orange bubble sugar).  my biggest fear was that the alcohol component would actually distract one's enjoyment of the milkshake, but unexpectedly the problem ended up being the complete opposite in that neither of us tasted nor felt any effects of any trace of alcohol in our shakes (i.e. neither one of us had our trademark asian flush go into effect).  perhaps the holstein's staff has figured out some magic ratio/technique to eliminate both the taste and effect of alcohol in their shakes, but a little of both would serve to go a long way especially if one is paying double digit dollars.\n\nas for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, we opted to split the crowd favorite <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> consists of dry aged sirloin with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli, but my taste buds felt like they were in charlie brown's classroom in that all the ingredients were rendered a slur of incomprehensibility by the overpowering goat cheese.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, on the other hand, did a much better job showcasing its melange of ingredients consisting of pepper-crusted beef, housemade creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>,  and swiss cheese.  taste buds were dancing their way upstairs to marquee on this one.  for every burger, one has the choice of shoestring fries or the thick steak fries (which resemble seasoned potato wedges) so one will not go wrong depending on personal preference.  \n\noverall, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>  do not come cheap (ranging from $14-28) nor do the milkshakes ($11) but to paraphrase vincent vega from pulp fiction,  \"that's a pretty f*cking good milkshake/burger. i don't know if it's worth (insert some double digit number) dollars but it's pretty f*cking good.\"", 
            "the fellas and i were looking for a quick dinner option before hitting the club this particular night. luckily, after walking to the exit and realizing it was pouring outside, we turned around and noticed holsteins across the hall from the marquee. \n\nfirst and foremost, the service was friendly and the staff did a great job. secondly, the food was well worth it. \n\nto start, they bring out seasoned popcorn that was quickly devoured by us. next i ordered the frozen grasshopper (a bam-boozled shake) that consisted of peppermint, chocolate, cr\\u00e8me de menthe, van gogh chocolate vodka. while it was good, it was definitely a lot (couldn't finish it after <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>). \n\nand lastly, their burger. my, what a burger! after being torn between the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> & fun-ghi big buns, i decided to go with the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>. now this burger is as follows: dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli. i ordered mine medium and it was plated as such. the sirloin was cooked to perfection with a beautiful char outside and juicy inside. the <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark> and aged goat cheddar gave it a great kick, but for me, the magic came in the garlic-chive aioli. i mean, wow, what a burger! \n\nevery bite was tasteful, satisfying, and worth every penny. it was easily one of the best burgers i've ever had. all the ingredients played beautifully with one another, and came together to form a great experience. \n\nwill remain a favorite in vegas and one i must revisit whenever i'm in town. so should you.", 
            "went to cosmo to watch polica rock out at <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> pool last night (buy their album! review w/in a review).   i always like to try out a new restaurant in whatever casino i'm seeing a concert in (or in the case of the cosmo i include aria's options).   since i splurged a little with julian serrano a few weeks back, i thought we should take it easier on our bank accounts with holsteins.  this wasn't seen as a downgrade in my eyes too much because i'd been wanting to try their <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger ever since i'd read john curtas praise it as (one of?) the best in las vegas.\n\ngiven the fact that one of their signature milkshakes would probably cause me death due to my lactose intolerance (and not a quick, lethal injection/firing squad death which might make it worth it, but more of a slow, chinese water torture/buried alive death) i passed on those, though they sure sounded delicious.  i instead opted for my usual jack and coke which was an acceptable version, but not as strong as i normally prefer.\n\nfor food we skipped appetizers because the majority seemed fried or slathered with cheese and or some sort of ranch dressing (i know, it's a burger joint) and i just didn't feel like i needed any of that before i gorged on a giant burger and fries along with the whole slow death sentence thing.  i ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> with no altering of the standard fixings cooked medium, and shoestring fries on the side.\n\nshortly thereafter <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> arrived and looked delectable and consisted of a dry aged sirloin patty, nice <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese (goat cheese tends to sit easier with my intolerance in case nosy minds were inquiring), tomato confit (i had to google confit to remind myself what it was.   i already forgot.  roasted?), and arugula and some garlic aioli.   <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was perfectly cooked, and i really enjoyed every bite of it.   i do think that there might have been too many flavors going on which took away from the quality of the beef.  i'm not sure it really needs the aioli or maybe it needs less, and the cheese tasted really nice, but i felt like it may have overpowered the whole thing a little.  i'm being very nitpicky as it was a tasty burger as sam jackson would say, but all in all i still prefer almost any i've had at bachi or fuku burger and they are more reasonably priced.   the fries were very average and had zero qualities worth mentioning here which was a bit of a disappointment.   service was friendly and responsive for the entire meal, if not a little robotic seeming at times.  i can live with that for an $80 dinner and drinks for 2 at the casino where the table minimums are my monthly salary.", 
            "ok so to start of the place is nicely designed and very hip. this is the only reason i even chose to give it a star.  the menu is sharp and creative.  holstein's is a burger bar and restaurant but are best known for their extensive list of alcoholic milkshakes which at $15+ each are tasty but a little hard to swallow.\n\nwe had 4 people for dinner, the total was $160 and it was to say the least, one of the worse burgers i have ever eaten...ever.\n\ni started off and had a milk shake which was good, a little hard to swallow at $12 but at least it tasted good. we ordered the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> $28 kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, truffle mayo and the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger   $17.5 dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli.\ni told our slightly slow server several time make sure <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are meidum-rare.  \n\nafter a 40 minute wait time, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> arrived, and they looked amazing.   i took my first bite and was unpleasantly surprised by the rapid sizzle of the skin on the roof of my mouth. slightly alarmed by the burning feeling i removed the bun to see what was going on.  the entire roof of my mouth was burned on a quarter size piece of foie-gras in my burger.  apparently no one bothered to consider learning how to prepare foie-gras before apply for a job at holsteins and instead fried the hell out of it in a pan.  my rather nicely sized $30 burger had a piece of foie-gras on it that was the size of a quarter and burned.  \n\nwhat i received was far from a medium-rare burger.  the greasy, oily and hard to swallow burger was far from delicious and even further away from edible.  i asked the server if this was a joke and showed him the inside of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> i had taken one bite of.   confused and surprised, he apologized and said he will be back. after waiting for 10 minutes he returned and apologized mentioning that the \"size of fie-gras varies in each burger\"  ....the question is by how much?  \n\nin an effort to make the most out of this horrible ordeal, i ordered a piece of foie-gras to place on my burger and requested they don't fry the hell out of it.  the server told me that it would be $20 extra which i told him was clearly not a problem. it arrived 20 minutes later once <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was cold.  once again it arrived burned to a brown color and tasted almost as bad as my now cold and tasteless $30 burger. \n\nto be fair the place is very cute and well designed, the staff is polite but slow and poorly trained. \n\n the service is sub fast-food quality.  our server was slow and didn't take orders very well.   \n\noverall, i would never go back and have holstein's again unless it was for a $15 milk shake which was good but sadly not good enough.", 
            "i've been in la too long. i've missed gambling and people who smoke indoors. so, during a much-needed trip to las vegas, i decided to stop in to holsteins to see how these alcohol-infused milkshakes and gourmet burgers compare to the ones in the city of angels.\n\nafter winding my way through the cosmopolitan hotel past the chandelier bar, i spotted the decorative pink-and-white plastic cow emblazoned with the holsteins logo. at the restaurant, you have the option of sitting at the bar, in the dining area or in the lounge up front, which is composed of some low-riding couches and decorative cartoon tables. i opted to sit in the more traditional dining room because i felt like the seriousness with which i was ready to eat could not be done in a reclining position.\n\nthe cocktail menu is awfully impressive, but i knew that i wanted to try one of the alcoholic milkshakes because, obviously. i chose the tiramisu milkshake, and, my goodness, it was good. the milkshakes are all $11, but at least they give you the fancy glass as well as the tin container filled with the remaining shake. the tiramisu shake is made with mascarpone ice cream, ladyfinger cookie crumbs, patron caf\\u00e9, chocolate syrup, cocoa powder and espresso beans. the shake was thick, chocolatey, liquory and delicious. it was the perfect dessert.\n\ni also ordered a <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger ($17.50), which is a burger topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic-chive aioli. my main complaint about the menu is that half of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> listed aren't really burgers -- they're fish, fowl or veggie patties, which is totally uninteresting to me. so, as for actual beef patties, there aren't too many to choose from.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> i ordered was still great. it was cooked medium-rare when i requested medium, but i really don't care too much unless i catch salmonella and die. the patty was flavorful. the toppings were pretty good (especially the aioli and cheese), but were not anything that would be my first choice in burger toppers. i was delighted that <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was so sizable and filling, and it even came with a side of delicious, crunchy, salty shoestring fries.\n\nthe waitress was fantastic. she helped us navigate the menu and was patient with our indecision, and she was also very friendly and stayed to shoot the breeze with us for a while, which made the whole experience a lot more fun and personable. both the shakes and burgers were brought out quickly, which i appreciated very much because i could not wait another moment to dive into this restaurant's offerings.\n\nthe meal was expensive, but everything was delectable. you won't be hungry again for a good long while after dining at holsteins.\n\nthey even let us take our alcohol in to-go cups so we could finish drinking while we walked around. i could have cried. oh, how i've missed nevada, the land free from open container laws.", 
            "great burger.  had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>.  dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli.  omg... so good.  this was actually my second dinner that night... and i still loved it.  this is now now of my top places for a burger.\n\ncame back a couple days later for and had a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with chicken.  i wouldn't really recommend.  too much dressing.. .and chicken was just meh...  stick to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.", 
            "thanks to holsteins yummy bam-boozeled shakes (with the help of many cocktails beforehand), i can hardly remember a thing about my dinner here.\n\nafter polishing off many rounds of happy hour cocktails at comme ca, a group of eight of us found ourselves at holsteins (located inside the gorgeous cosmo hotel) for dinner on a friday evening. \n\nthe first thing i need to tell y'all is that all eight of us were fairly intoxicated before entering holsteins. and after all eight of us ordered a bam-bozzeled shake with extra shots of alcohol to start our meals, the rest of the evening became quite a blur. such a blur, in fact, that even though every single person ordered a different burger from their large menu (we also ordered appetizers), and even though i took a bite of everything ordered, i can't really recall everything i tried and if i even enjoyed it. i'm just glad i took pictures, otherwise i would have been totally guessing on some of the food we ordered. this is just a few of the items i tried that fun night at holsteins; \n\n<mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake- reese's, banana, malt, & frangelico liquor\ncereal bowl shake- cap'n crunch & absolut vanilla vodka\n<mark>Campfire Smores</mark>- smirnoff marshmallow vodka, chocolate, marshmallow & graham crumble\npork belly buns\nsalt & vinegar popcorn (complimentary)\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger (i ordered this)- kobe beef burger, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo & tempura avocado\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger- dry aged beef sirloin burger w/ <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli\nthe longhorn burger- beef patty topped w/ texas smoked beef brisket, whiskey bbq sauce, creamy cole slaw & dill pickles\n\ni do remember that we all thoroughly enjoyed our adult shakes. they were sweet and thick but the bartenders were more than generous with the alcohol because every shake was just as strong or even stronger than the cocktails we had before entering holsteins. \n\ni can honestly say i slightly do remember my burger being damn tasty. i loved the teri glaze on the patty and the tempura avocado was a nice touch. this burger reminded me of something i'd get at umami in la. as for the rest of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and the apps go, i'm assuming i and everyone else enjoyed them because every plate was licked clean. \n\nfrom what i remember the service was great and the atmosphere in the restaurant was fun and upbeat. the prices here are really reasonable.  \n\ni will definitely try holsteins again. next time i'll just make sure to be sober before eating here so i can fully remember my experience. till that day comes i'll give holsteins a solid 4 stars.",

            "upon hearing more bad than good reviews regarding this eatery, i decided that it wasn't worth the risk of a potentially bad meal. however, since a large group of us were already on property tonight, it was the best choice for a relatively inexpensive dinner. \n\ni attempted to make a reservation via opentable, but it stated that there were no reservations remaining for the evening. then i called. the hostess explained that they are no longer taking reservations for the evening, but she would be happy to get us a table when we arrived and that there was a \"short\" wait for less than 30 minutes. since we were not physically at the restaurant, we could not put our name on the list. humph. anyway, we get to the restaurant and are given a 30-35 minute wait for our group of nine. a bit longer than i enjoy waiting, but it worked out well - we received our table within 10 minutes (and via text message; very convenient)!\n\nmost of us decided on selections from the \"big buns\" category (good ol' burgers and fries). i had a hard time choosing between a couple of their burgers, but i'm very pleased that our server directed me to their most popular selection - the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" ($17.50). dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli. holy tastebuds. that first bite was euphoric. i can't even describe it, but i'll always remember how i felt - amazing. i was raving to everyone at the table and the two people that tasted my burger affirmed my praise, as well as stating that it was much better than <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> they were eating (memphis burger - very tasty - and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> - shrug). i've had other goat cheese-arugula-tomato burgers and this one does it much better. because the goat cheese is blended with cheddar (haven't quite wrapped my head around this yet lol), it isn't too pungent and all the other flavors were so well balanced. get the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>; medium rare, of course. really, really good.\n\nwith your \"big buns\" order, you have a choice of regular fries, side salad, or a $2 upgrade for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> or thick cut <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. i got their regular fries and they were really tasty and well cooked. i also tried the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> ($9) - perfect dill spears with good crispy exterior, served with an herb-caper mayo - and a strawberry milkshake ($8) - really creamy, delicious strawberry flavor. overall, all the food was great!\n\nour server was really nice and very helpful, however, we received only one visit between receiving our food and finishing our meal, so most of our water glasses weren't refilled. then we found ourselves having to wave our arms for attention. i figured the servers must be overwhelmed, but it seems that the restaurant is always busy and it's as if no one has figured out how to properly handle the capacity of customers.\n\ni'm curious as to why people have been so unhappy with holsteins, but i can guess. based on our experience prior to and during our dinner, i'm sure they have their off days or the service may be even less attentive than it was today. hopefully i won't have to experience any of those things during future visits or even better, that it'll improve!",

            "the deco of this place is pretty neat - a bit hipster, a bit modern. for the food, we had:\n\n1. for the life of me, i cannot remember the shake that i got. but it was very delicious! it was an alcoholic one, and consisted of some kind of passion fruit alcohol/schnapp, vanilla ice cream, and dry ice. it was very good and refreshing. if you're looking for more of a milkshake, don't get this one, as it wasn't thick and creamy. it was refreshing though, and not too sweet, which was amazing.\n\n2. kimchi quesadillas - as someone who is from la and very used to korean food, i was expecting an exotic quesadilla with spicy kimchi. however, the kimchi tasted a bit sweet, and was not what i was expecting. just a mess of oily goodness, if you ask me.\n\n3. my boyfriend got the \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" burger, and it was pretty good. the best part of it was the tempura avocado, which was something i've never heard of before! it definitely gave <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> a little something special, and with the tender patty, it was a good complement. however, it wasn't that big, and my boyfriend was still starving afterwards.\n\n4. i just got the \"<mark>Greener Pastures</mark>\" salad, which is a basic salad. nothing special about it at all; although they gave me <mark>Avocado</mark>, they were a bit raw.\n\nthe price was about $60 for 2 people, but hey, its vegas, what do you expect? was pretty good comfort food, but definitely can get better elsewhere!",

            "i decided to eat here with the fam because i'd read some reviews about the greatness that is holsteins. burgers, alcoholic shakes (ew!), and fries... sounded perfect since we didn't have a lot of time and it was sorta fast food.\n\nthe place itself was alright. its new and in a new hotel... but loaded with noisy families with tons of kids and bad acoustics. i could not even hear my mom talking to me and she was right next to me.\n\nlike i said we didn't have a lot of time... about 40 minutes. we told the waitress ahead of time and she was very accommodating and made sure we got our food quick. we all had quick bites.... i ordered the street tacos with duck and <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and a side of cranberry garnish/salsa? not sure.. it was pretty good and hit the spot. however... my mom had the beef sliders and boy did they look dry and icky. and she said they were dry and icky. she didn't even eat it..... and i ended up giving her one of my tacos. \n\nwe had the duck fat fries as well, which were not as good as i thought. the ketchup was actually mixed with relish or something so tasted ok but something like an aioli would have been better. we also split a regular strawberry milkshake, no alcohol. it was good but yea...\n\nanyway, i was just unimpressed and kinda mad at this place. how dare they serve such gross sliders! yes i don't eat beef and didn't try em but they looked so bad and my mom confirmed that they were. anyway, maybe i will come back someday and give the full menu a shot. but not likely anytime soon.", 
            "i really reallyyyyy like this place.\n\ncame here before clubbing at marquee just to satisfied that \"i need to put some food in my stomach so, i don't pass out drunk at the club\" needs.\n\nthis is a spot where it's best to come in big groups so, you can pretty much samps everything on the menu. ordered appetizers: lobster corndogs, truffle mac & cheese, street tacos, urth burger, and the kalbi and kim chee quesadillas.\n\nthe street tacos had to be my favorite. there was duck in there (i love duck!). there was <mark>Foie Gras</mark> (who doesn't love <mark>Foie Gras</mark>!?). reminded me a lot of the kogi food truck out in la.\nthe lobster corndogs were interesting. not a seafood kinda gal but, it tasted like butter because of the lobster and yet, kinda weird cuz it's in a corndog kind of batter.\ntruffle mac and cheese was amazing. i think there was shrimp in there cuz it tasted of seafood. a friend ordered it so, i got to samps some. the weird part of this dish was it came with a small sandwich. i'm not sure what kinda of sandwich but, when i say \"small,\" - i mean, small....like, \"one bite and you're done with your sandwich small.\"\nthe kalbi and kim chee quesadillas were pretty good but, seemed too salty. i'm not sure why.\n\nand they have a dj spinning music in there. i'm not sure if that's just a weekend thing..or monday night thing..but, it def adds to the \"good time\" atmosphere and the delish food.", 
            "02/16/11 dinner: \n\nwithout planning in advance we ended up here. didn't have a burger! instead, had drinks, \"appetizers\" (turned out to be plates bigger than appetizers) and desserts. <mark>The Classic</mark> martini was terrific, i got the gin variety (does no one drink gin in this town?), containing a gin of which i had never heard (\"nolet silver\"?) which was floral and smooth, garnished with pickled shallot. (expecting shallot bulbs on a stick, instead it was shaved in <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> of the glass!) another had a\"bloody mary\", which came \"up\", containing pepper/cilantro infused vodka, which was greatly liked, especially the gigantic shrimp that came with it! food was \"<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>\" (fried dill spears, fried olives, caper berries, prosciutto, salami w/ herb-caper mayo), \"street tacos\" (crispy shells filled w/ shreds of duck confit, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, trufle crema & cranberry relish), \"truffle lobster mac n cheese\" (maine lobster, black truffle & mac in a tallegio-marscapone sauce), and \"bull's balls\" (2 risotto rice balls stuffed with veal, topped with \"tomato fondue\" and a slice of lardo). a very rich, decadent collection of dishes, i thought all were very well done, especially the mac (wow!). the \"bulls' balls\" weren't as good as i had hoped, mostly rice with very little filling, and the lardo kinda lost amongst the strength of the \"tomato foudue\", which was genius. (an angel-hair pasta with that fondue would be crazy good.) the \"street tacos\" were really good but really rich. my fave thing on the \"<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>\" were the fried olives (only 2, we had to fight over those!). ended with a \"stout float\" (guinness, ice cream, oatmeal crumble), very good. after food we had a really wacky concoction: \"johnny apple seed\", consisting of knob creek, honey and apple cider. first of all, the very nice server said it was the first time that it had been ordered since it was added to the menu (!) and second, they had no idea what \"hard cider\" was! we had to explain, there are alcoholic apple ciders out there, was this one of those?, but the answer never came. no matter, it was a nose and throat clearer! ahem! but a great idea, imho. sipping it took about 15 minutes, and well worth it! so overall, i'd say go. now i need to go back for a burger, perhaps that \"duck duck goose\", stuffed with duck confit, duck cracklings & <mark>Foie Gras</mark>! yikes!", 
            "gonna start with desert.\n\nthe adult shakes are incredible espicaly the <mark>Virgil's Orange Cream</mark> (which really taste like a creamsicle) and the brown cow (a <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with pop rocks and rum).  \n\nthe food is typical of  a good gastro pub; new american fusion.  you are rewarded for being adventurous.  \n\nthe \"street tacos\" are made from duck confit, <mark>Foie Gras</mark> cranberry relish.  they are incredible.  other appetizer standouts include the kalbi and kimchee quesadilla, the bull's balls (no they are not rocky mountain oysters), and the lobster corn dogs. the crispy pork belly bun is worth special mention.  served with hoisin sauce and pea sprouts, its high end dim sum.\n\nmeat in a tube is well represented.  try the greek touri.  different but very flavorful.\n\nfinally, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  although i'm still partial to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> bar, holsteins offerings are very creative and good eats.  cooked perfectly to order.  the \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" (teriyaki glazed kobe burger with spicy mayo and tempura avocado) is a winner.\n\nservice is fast and efficient.\n\none final note, the beer selection is excellent and very reasonably priced for the strip.", 
            "we had sliders, sliders and more sliders. loved the lobster mac n cheese, they had the crispy outside that makes you want to eat everything.  i had the slider with the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> on it and it was pretty well made.  i was totally eying the lobster roll which looked delicious as well.  nom nom...would probably try again.", 
            "a group of us visited holsteins on a saturday night and only waited approximately 20 minutes to get 13 people seated in one area. we all were helped right away. as for drinks, i didn't want to be too full for marquee so i didn't get the try any of their famous shakes. right after the drink orders were taken, we received a small bucket full of buttered popcorn. it was a bit salty but it had a lot of flavor. we also ordered the potato chips for $6. it was tasty but not $6 worth. \n\nfor the main course, my friend and i ordered from the tiny buns section. we tried the crispy pork belly bun and tenderloin rossini. reminder: those burgers are tiny. the portions are literally 4 bites total. the crispy pork bun had too much hoison sauce but the pork was cooked perfectly. the tenderloin rossini was definitely worth the $17.50. the tenderloin was cooked to perfection. the downside was that i could not taste the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> nor the truffle mayo. \n\nthe overall vibe of the restaurant and the food was 5 star worthy. but the restaurant was too loud. i seriously could not hear myself think. therefore i brought the ratings down to 4 stars. if you are ever at the cosmopolitan, you should definitely check this place out.", 
            "if you are a big fan of duck and <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, as i am, you will love, love, love the duck, duck, goose burger. also, their \"bam boozled\" (technically alcoholic, but there is so little alcohol that it's almost unfair to say they contain alcohol) pina colada shake may be the best milkshake i've ever had anywhere. i do have issue with the hefty $11 price tag though (i'm assuming the \"alcohol\" contained within technically makes it a cocktail, thus the rational for the extraordinary cost - i really wish there was a $6 non-alcoholic version). nevertheless, holsteins definitely has the most interesting burgers in las vegas and definitely worth the try if you're big on non-traditional burgers.",

(though, at $76 for lunch, we could have done without a few dishes. more on that later.)\n\nmy husband and i went on a sunday morning at 11:05 after they first opened for the day. we got seated right away at a table near the flat screens to watch the games, but within 10 or 15 minutes, the place was jam packed with diners. \n\nhere's a rundown of what we ordered: all very well executed, though would have benefitted from a few minor changes. fun novelty items too. \n\n1. <mark>Fried Pickles</mark>: loved this preparation, because these <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> are spears, not chips that fall apart and taste nothing like a pickle. this gives each bite a nice tang. flavorful sauce condiment and nice touch to have sliced meats on the side. also came with fried olives ad fried capers...though the capers were kinda dried and tasteless. \n\n2. crispy pork belly bun : steamed mantou type buns (two mini sized) and two large chunks of crispy pork belly and hoisin. very, very good,  i've had variations of this dish many times, and this one is nice. very fatty, very crisp and flavorful. though. i'd appreciate more cilantro, and some acid to cut through the fat. \n\n3. <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger: juicy and hot, slathered in sauce, kimchi and a <mark>Fried Egg</mark>...get your napkins! just get is. that's all i have to say about this one. \n\n4. tenderloin rossini: pork tend loin sliders with <mark>Foie Gras</mark> (sp? i dunk, i dot eat enlarged duck liver...is that right, very often!) was good...but as always with tenderloin, desperately needed some fat. came with house made chips, but would have preferred fries or rings. \n\n5. cake lollypop, nitrogen merangues, (sp?) push pop: strawberry cheesecake lollypop was delicious, dipped in white chocolate and had a small strawberry gel disc on top. the nitro meringue (sp?) is bubblegum flavored, and  tiny, but prepared tableside and more for show than anything. blow smoke for 30 seconds and impress your friends! for $2 it's a fun way to end a meal. the push pop...overrated. nice novelty, but the sorbet is hard and makes it difficult to eat. cute concept though. \n\nservice rocked. glasses always full, plates cleared as soon as we were finished. warm environment, creative menu items. would hit up again...and would try the long list of milkshakes!",

            "**** 4.5 stars ****\n\none of the great miracles of las vegas is that you can eat like a fatty fat fat all day every day and still go to pools surrounded by gorgeous plastic-pumped women and sing nonsense like \"sexy and i know it\", regardless of any absence of truth to that assertion. holsteins provides the perfect venue for stuffing your face on delicious patties of top quality beef while also getting an eye full of the local ladies. unbeknownst to me at the time, the same chef is behind this as public house, where i had dined the night before, and his love of squeezing his employees into clothing that might be mistaken for a table cloth was much more prominent here than there. the d\\u00e9cor here is also just dope. i love the slightly sick toons on the walls, and there are homage to pigs and cows all around. if you look at most of the complaints here it's from people who didn't actually order a burger, so i suggest you take those reviews for what they are, and don't make the same mistake.\n\nbut, since it's vegas, you will still stuff your face to the maximum in front of this beautiful bevy, knowing that you're helping to pay for their salary so that they can go to the pool tomorrow and pretend guys like you don't exist (until you buy them a pitcher of margaritas, then you're superstar hero of the next couple minutes, congrats). brian and i both took the luxury route on the menu here, although i passed on the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> with kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo, because i've already had half a dozen burgers like this across america and they all taste roughly the same...rich and oily. it was honestly more difficult passing up <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, a truly unique combination of kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado...super intriguing, and if i had been dining with someone i was dating i likely would have tried to persuade them in that direction. somehow i managed to also resist ordering a decadent milkshake, perhaps because we were eating dinner just 4 hours after we had managed to roll out of bed for lunch.\n\ni finally wound up deciding on the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, a dry aged beef sirloin patty topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and a garlic-chive aioli...nothing too crazy, but lots of big, bold, wonderful flavors, and at $18 the most expensive burger not topped with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>. the result was pretty fantastic, definitely one of the better burgers i've had lately, and came with a monstrous basket of nicely done <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (for a supplemental charge). my biggest complaint, which is kind of random, is that they skewer <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with their own stupid little logo stick to keep the bun on for presentation, which has the resulting effect of causing huge gobs of mayo or sauce to squirt from the hole in the top every time you take a bite. eating these burgers is a mess, to be sure, especially when you add on a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> as i do, but if you're like me you've already realized you're not taking one of the voluptuous vixens home (although my reason is probably different than yours) so you've resigned your face to more indulgent pleasures, like egg yolk, garlic aioli, and hamburger grease.\n\njust make sure to thoroughly wash your beard, or your own lady might catch on...and get jealous.", 
            "my girl friends and i kicked off our vegas weekend with a late and light lunch at holsteins.  i was salivating when i saw <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> ($28) on the menu with kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, and truffle mayo, but i decided that the hen house burger ($14) was good enough for half the price with its <mark>Fried Egg</mark> and bacon.  that is, until our server highly recommended the award winning <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger ($17.50) with dry aged beef, bacon, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic chive aioli.  it was done--i would eat the winner.\n\nalthough complex and tasty, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> didn't make me shake my buns or roll my eyes backwards.  i didn't care for the fancy stuff like goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, or baby arugula.  for a gourmet burger, umami burger (multiple locations in la and one in sf) is my <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and it's about 2/3 of the prices here.  i did, however, enjoy the shoestring fries at holsteins.  they're skinny, crisp, wonderful, and plentiful.  \n\nif you have a car in vegas, you should make the trek to bachi burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bachi-burger-las-vegas).  now there's a burger joint worthy of being called the best burger in sin city.",

            "the first of many yelp reviews to come :)\n\nholsteins is located right smack in the middle of the cosmopolitan. there's really no signs leading to this place, so keep your eyes peeled for a dim little restaurant in the corner of the floor. it was around dinner time on a saturday night when i went with my lover and the wait was only 15 minutes. when our name was called we were told by the hostess to walk down to the dining room to be seated. i found this a bit strange considering there were so many servers walking around- i didn't know which one would be seating us. after a few awkward eye contacts, we were greeted by a nice young lady and shown to our table. \n\nfood ordered:\n<mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> (kobe beef and <mark>Foie Gras</mark>) - i didn't like how the kobe beef masked the flavor of the <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, but it was still delicious. the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> was truly something special. i would pay $28 for the piece alone (yes, this burger was $28).\nurth burger (house made veggie patty) - the veggie patty was a bit too mushy for my liking. i wanted a bit of a crunch, at least on the outer part of the patty. nope. the avocado didn't help the mushy theme either. the texture  wasn't pleasant at all. don't get be wrong though, the flavors were definitely there. this burger went for $12-$15, i forgot. not worth it.\nshoestring fries - so good. i love crispy, semi-burnt things, so these fries were perfect for me. not that i'm saying it was burnt... but it was very crunchy. these fries were very, very thinly sliced. for those who want to taste to potato, go for the steak cut fries.\nsteak cut fries - nothing too special about these fries. very mediocre. too much potato in my mouth!\n\nthe service was good. dining was casual. place is a bit dark, but it gives this place a nice vibe for a burger joint. in all, it was a good experience. will come here again for the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>, nothing else. :)\n\ntip: don't walk too fast after the hostess tells you to walk to the dining room to be seated... you'll be standing there like a lost child :/", 
            "i am giving this place 3.5 stars. the service was weird from the start. we had a party of five, and they made us wait 10 minutes when the restaurant only had about 5 tables full. we sat down, were handed menus, and our waiter never came by for another 10 minutes. one of us had to ask someone for water, and ask for a waiter. the waiter also took forever to come back to take our orders.\n\nfrom there, it seemed like he tried to redeem himself the entire time. we finally ordered. i had the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> for $28. it was a kobe beef patty with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, onions, frisee, and truffle mayo. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was really good and filling. i only ate half. it came with a  side of fries and i mistakenly chose the shoestring fries. the steak fries were much better. oh yea, the waiter bought us buckets of fries while we waited for our food to try to suck up to us. it came with a house made ketchup that was really good. \n\nmy friend's burger was sent back to the kitchen twice. he asked for a well done patty, and it came out super rare that it bled all over the plate. second, they forgot the <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>.\n\nlastly, the waiter called the manager over to give us free dessert of liquid nitrogen meringues. \n\noverall, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fries were fine, but the service was weird.", 
            "ok so to start of the place is nicely designed and very hip. this is the only reason i even chose to give it a star.  the menu is sharp and creative.  holstein's is a burger bar and restaurant but are best known for their extensive list of alcoholic milkshakes which at $15+ each are tasty but a little hard to swallow.\n\nwe had 4 people for dinner, the total was $160 and it was to say the least, one of the worse burgers i have ever eaten...ever.\n\ni started off and had a milk shake which was good, a little hard to swallow at $12 but at least it tasted good. we ordered the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> $28 kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, truffle mayo and the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger   $17.5 dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli.\ni told our slightly slow server several time make sure <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are meidum-rare.  \n\nafter a 40 minute wait time, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> arrived, and they looked amazing.   i took my first bite and was unpleasantly surprised by the rapid sizzle of the skin on the roof of my mouth. slightly alarmed by the burning feeling i removed the bun to see what was going on.  the entire roof of my mouth was burned on a quarter size piece of foie-gras in my burger.  apparently no one bothered to consider learning how to prepare foie-gras before apply for a job at holsteins and instead fried the hell out of it in a pan.  my rather nicely sized $30 burger had a piece of foie-gras on it that was the size of a quarter and burned.  \n\nwhat i received was far from a medium-rare burger.  the greasy, oily and hard to swallow burger was far from delicious and even further away from edible.  i asked the server if this was a joke and showed him the inside of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> i had taken one bite of.   confused and surprised, he apologized and said he will be back. after waiting for 10 minutes he returned and apologized mentioning that the \"size of fie-gras varies in each burger\"  ....the question is by how much?  \n\nin an effort to make the most out of this horrible ordeal, i ordered a piece of foie-gras to place on my burger and requested they don't fry the hell out of it.  the server told me that it would be $20 extra which i told him was clearly not a problem. it arrived 20 minutes later once <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was cold.  once again it arrived burned to a brown color and tasted almost as bad as my now cold and tasteless $30 burger. \n\nto be fair the place is very cute and well designed, the staff is polite but slow and poorly trained. \n\n the service is sub fast-food quality.  our server was slow and didn't take orders very well.   \n\noverall, i would never go back and have holstein's again unless it was for a $15 milk shake which was good but sadly not good enough.", 
            "i stayed at the cosmo the last time i was in vegas and decided to try out <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and shakes restaurant. the truffle lobster mac and cheese was tasteful. pork belly buns were soo crispy and mouthwatering. very flavorful. the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> is made for a king. sooo spectacular especially with the <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, melts in ur mouth like butter! i will definitely come here every time i am in town.", 
            "5 stars for the food, minus 1 star for the service. \n\nmy fellow yelpers, you did not disappoint. my friend and i came here after reading reviews on yelp. we always like to try new things, so this was a perfect opportunity. \n\ni had the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>, and yes, it is definitely worth the $28!! after california banned <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, i was heart broken. i didn't know when i will be able to eat it again, so when i saw the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> on the menu, i had to get it!\n\nthis burger is made with kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee, and truffle mayo. this burger is packed with a punch of flavor and textures that all mesh so well together. i usually get cheese on my burgers, but i opted out this time since there's so many flavors going on already. if you absolutely need some cheese, i'd probably recommend a mild cheese like provolone or gruyere. \n\nwhen <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was set down in front of me, my jaw just about dropped to the floor. there was a huge piece of grilled <mark>Foie Gras</mark> on my burger. i was expecting small pieces or even just a pate version, but no, i was wrong. the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> was so creamy and the truffle mayo was so earthy and packed a punch. there was small pieces of truffle in the mayo! you definitely get the bang for your buck here. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came with a choice of shoestring fries (which i recommend since they are so crunchy) or steak fries. \n\nanother tip. if you check in with foursquare, you get a free house draft beer or margarita. i don't know how long this offer lasts, but give it a try. \n\nfor the service, it was just non existent. our server took so long to take our orders. we sat at the table for about 10 min after she took our order to get our drinks. i think she just wasn't in the mood to be at work, but still, you can't let the customers know that. \n\nall in all, yes, i definitely felt like a billionaire eating that burger, and that burger was probably the best fancy burger i had in my life! i can't wait til i go to vegas again.", 
            "the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>, though pricey, is definitely worth it. the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> compliments <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> so well. the flavor of all its components are exceptional. i wanted more! loved the selection of spiked milkshakes (definitely recommend the tiramasu) and other alcoholic beverages to wash down the beef. we'll be back soon, no doubt.", 
            "<mark>Foie Gras</mark> and truffle oil on a kobe beef burger patty cooked medium... ummm delish.  $28 for this biliionnaire burger was totally worth it. \n\nwhole <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> with aioli... genius! it was amazing.\n\ncomplimentary salt and vinegar popcorn... so yum.\n\nthe reason why i give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because we waited forever for our waiter to come by to take our order. in fact, we started building a three foot fort on our table with the menus and silverware to get someone's attention. it worked.", 
            "best burger i ever ate...... not even, but it is worth a visit.  i went with the \"<mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>\" .  kobe beef patty with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>.....$28.00 with fries.  after the california ban on <mark>Foie Gras</mark> i'm desperate anytime its on the menu i go hard!  decent slice couldn't focus on the fg and that's a bummer!  kobe is illegal in the us so their blowing smoke when it's on the menu!  need to clarify its \"kobe style \" not real kobe!\nanywho.... burger was very good not in the class of the \"black label\" burger at the minetta tavern but flavorful nonetheless.  \noverall skip it and go with <mark>The Classic</mark> unless your a fg freak!", 
            "my review will strictly be on what i ordered:\n\nbilionaire burger - holy s***.  talk about total mouth richness to the maxxx.  here's the thing.. i love <mark>Foie Gras</mark> to begin with so there was no hesitation at all to get this burger.  and being from cali, i had to get it since it's banned here.  anyway, they were very generous with the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> portion.  it was fatty, melt in your mouth goodness.  the \"kobe\" beef patty was fatty and meaty at the same time.  huge on true beef flavor.  i quote \"kobe\" because we should all know by there that real kobe beef cannot be sold outside of japan.  anyway, the truffle mayo was the perfect schmear to compliment all the components in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  the port marmalade onions helped to cut the richness and fattiness of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> because it had a very distinct vinegar taste.  the brioche bun was toasty, crispy but soft, and buttery as brioche should be.  it holds up well to the rest of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  the frisee was well, frisee and also helped to balanced out the richness of this burger.\n\ni did split this with my girlfriend because i knew beforehand that this burger would more than likely be close to overwhelming on the palette.  each bite was so rich i felt as if i died each time.\n\nfrozen grasshopper shake - yum!!!! i love chocolate mint to begin with, but when you add chocolate vodka to it, it just makes the shake 100x better.  \n\noverall:  enjoyed this place very much.  i would definitely consider coming back here to try what else they have to offer.\n\nlike i always say, you won't know unless you try it for yourself!", 
            "disappointing. \n\ni really wanted to like this place, based on the interior esp the wall decor. unfortunately, it stops there. \n\n**the hostesses are dumb as bricks. is that bc they are college drop-outs? learn to smile and respond quickly. geez. when i asked if they had any shirts for sale, it was like i asked them to solve long division. total air-heads. \n\neach table gets a little bucket of movie theatre popcorn to munch on while you wait. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>: bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic chive aioli. all i tasted was bread and meat. maybe when i got to the center of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, did i taste some of that confit. but really, the flavors are bland. \n\nmy bf got the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>: kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade, frisee and truffle mayo. the waitress asked if he wanted to add lobster ($10 add-on). sure, why not. wtf. who serves crumbled lobster meat?? it couldve been crumbs from leftover knuckle meat or even crawfish, how the hell would we know??! im not asking for an entire tail, but at least give us some chunks of lobster. it was minced. terrible. you could even taste it. \n\nthe beef patty is a probably about a 1/3lb. i like fuddruckers patties and even their buns, better. \n\nmy <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were limp. \n\nwe'll be going back to burger bar in mandalay bay. or in-and-out.", 
            "what's not to like about great burgers and even better shakes (especially when you can get them with alcohol in them). holsteins is located in the cosmopolitan hotel and just like the hotel has quite the vibe to it. there is open seating in the bar area but if you get there early enough you can get a seat in the dining area. \n\ntypically when i have friends in town, we seem to end up at holsteins (either because they want to try it or they are staying at the cosmopolitan hotel). either way, it's a great way to enjoy some pretty good burgers (but be prepared to spend a bit of money as the prices are definitely not that inexpensive).\n\nthere is definitely a large selection of alcoholic beverages that you can choose from, but i definitely recommend the adult shakes that they have. between my friends and i we tried the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>, oreo, and cereal bowl (tastes just like captain crunch). for burgers, we've tried quite a few of the different burgers - <mark>The Classic</mark>, the longhorn (with beef brisket as well), <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> (asian flavors with teriyaki sauce), <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> (with assorted mushrooms), the el machete (with an anaheim chili - sounds spicy, but it really is not, it's good, but it could use some more spice), and of course, the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> (kobe beef patty with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>). the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> is what a lot of people like to try (especially those from california that can't get their <mark>Foie Gras</mark> anymore. you can also add a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to your burger (which i recommend) - just to make it even more tasty with another layer of flavor.\n\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> also come with either shoestring or steak cut fries. i have ordered a side salad (to try and be a little healthier - although not by much since we were indulging in a burger), and was disappointed that they charged $2 extra dollars for <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> of a side salad over the fries (and it wasn't even a large salad). i guess next time i'll just indulge in the fries.\n\noverall, a great place to hang out with your friends, get some good burgers and have a lot of drinks. i'd definitely recommend enjoying the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> at least once.",

            "if you looking for good burgers, there are so many other options. bachi burger is awesome. also burger bar is great too. as for this place, we ordered the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> for $32. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> meat was dry and overcooked. the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> lacked flavor like they used lower grade to serve with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. we also ordered the pork belly bun which was crispy on the outside but was swimming in too much hoisen sauce. since it was one of my friend's birthday so we decided to order the un-birthday birthday cake. it look greak in the picture but was dense and  flavorless. the best thing was the icing and we scrapped it off and ate that.", 
            "i thought i had already discovered my burger place in vegas and that was gordon ramsay's burgr and no one could take that place from my heart.\n\nholstein's though, came pretty close. but i think it was my zeal talking more than anything and my weakness for those little moments where a person can feel top of the heap just from buying a meal. \n\nyou see, i had hit it pretty big at roulette and craps the night before and was feeling confident. i knew going in that i wanted that <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>, with its truffle aioli and <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, elements of a burger i know i would never eat anywhere else but on vacation. i did order it. and then some. that burger came medium rare, with additions of aged goat cheese and lobster, heightening an already indulgent, gluttonous, and decadent burger into a whole other realm. it was luscious.\n\nbut like i said, it wasn't fair. i made it luxurious because i willed it. is the law of attraction in action? perhaps. more than likely, though, it was me riding the high of a couple of wins and wanting to eat like a winner.\n\nthe philly cheese steak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> were average. nothing memorable or special.i also had a taste of the bamboozled shakes, the tiramisu and <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>. most gush about <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> but it was too candy-like for me. boyfriend had the memphis burger, which had a layer of pulled pork that he believed might have been crisped up on the flattop beforehand to create a crust. i had a bite and was impressed but really, i only tasted it for the sake of tasting because i refused to part with, even lay down, my obscenely excessive truffle, lobster, foie burger, oh no.\n\nyou had better believe i am still thinking about that burger. late at night, when all the lights are out, i reminisce about the taste of that false luxury.", 
            "very loud atmosphere, across from marquee. burgers are hit or miss, depending on personal preference and type of burger ordered. hubs loved his <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>, which had a good chunk of <mark>Foie Gras</mark>. i found my <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> a bit salty. the tomato confit, sauteed mushrooms, and marmalade onions were tasty additions to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself, though. \n\nburgers are large, and <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> bun is a bit too thick for my liking, although it stands up well to the toppings and creamy sauces. fries were similarly salty. no option to sub a salad for the bun, which is rather disappointing. you can, however, pay more to sub a salad for the fries. for a heavy meal and a satisfying piece of cow, this won't disappoint.",

            "okay so once again i'm going to disagree with my fellow yelp reviewers and say that i was not wowed by my meal at holsteins shakes and buns, and i think there are better burger places in vegas. holsteins is located at the cosmopolitan hotel and casino directly across the entrance to the marquee pool and day club. because of the location you will need to have a reservation or be prepared to wait with the diva's and meat sticks that frequent the place.  we did have a reservation and were seated on time. the decor at holsteins is eighties cool. cartoon artwork dots the walls, boom boxes are painted in bright colors and a huge pink cow welcomes you in the bar area. after looking over the menu, my wife simone ordered the meatball parm sliders and i ordered the nom-<mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> topped with melted cheese, potato chips and house made thousand island dressing. the food came out fairly quickly, and on the side i had some tasty crunchy potato stick thin <mark>French Fries</mark>. my burger however was overcooked ( ordered medium and got well done). an overcooked burger made with fresh ground meat ends up tasting like sawdust, and this was the case. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> could have been saved by the dressing, but there was very little of the dressing on it. the chips on top were the best part of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. medium thin hand cut and fried perfectly, they stayed crispy on the sandwich and gave a nice contrast to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, but overall this burger sounded better then it tasted. simone's sliders were the exact opposite of my burger. the meatballs had great garlicky flavor, they were moist, tender and tasted fresh. they were topped with a mixture of sweet marinara and basil pesto and lots of melted creamy mozzarella. i so wanted to steal them from her and i had total meat envy.  we finished off the meal with a reese pb adult shake spiked with frangelico called the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>.  any monkey that could get drunk off this would have to be a lightweight because i could taste no alcohol in it whatsoever. it was still good, once again just not as good as advertised.  so in the end i would have given holsteins a 2 star rating for my food however simone's sliders choice saved the day...so overall holsteins gets a three stars from me.",

            "the best burgers anywhere!!  my son told us about it, and my brother went and told us about it so we had to try it.  \n\ni had the mojito and it was so refreshing!!  my husband ordered the <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake and he really enjoyed it.  \n\nwe were to share our orders since we wanted to try the various burgers.  i ordered the ahi tuna sliders and my husband ordered the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> with the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> and truffle mayo.  well, when our burgers were delivered i only had 3 small bites of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>....i was in heaven.  my tuna sliders were okay, because the buns were a little hard and dry.  i was in heaven when i bit into <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> though!!  the <mark>French Fries</mark> were fantastic as well.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was expensive, but well worth it.\n\nwe sat on the couches in the lounge for lunch, because we didn't want to wait 15 minutes for a table.  it was like having lunch in our living room.\n\nwe will be back!!", 
            "i want to give this place a better review since it's at my favorite spot on the trip - the cosmopolitan.  the thing is...<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was not very good.  my wife and i split the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> (kobe beef, potato chips, thousand island dressing) thinking it would be something we couldn't find somewhere else.  the beef patty was overcooked and did not seem to be seasoned.  the potato chips were a nice touch and appeared to be made in house.  the hamburger was simply lacking flavor.  i'll say that we enjoyed the <mark>French Fries</mark> that came with the hamburger (and all hamburgers at holsteins.)  the beer selection was admirable and allowed me to an ipa that i've not had before.  too bad for you that i can't remember the name.  overall, i think that i'd go back because i got the feeling that they could do better.  casual, relatively affordable and average from most angles.  a safe bet if you are already in the cosmopolitan, but not worth a special trip.",

            "i went off <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> path, so maybe that was my downfall - i got lobster truffle mac & cheese. it wasn't anything special, and given the price of the dish (an appetizer), i expected more. the lobster was tough, the sauce was fine, but not special. the blobs of truffle didn't add anything.\n\ni also ordered <mark>French Fries</mark>, which were soggy and lukewarm. bummer.\n\ni might go back just to try a burger, but there are a lot of other restaurants in vegas i'd rather try first.", 
            "this restaurant, located in the cosmopolitan, is just ok. our waiter seemed a little inexperienced and not familiar with the menu. my mom has several food allergies to gluten and dairy and asked several questions about items on the menu and the waiter had to keep going in the back to ask the chef. i am, in a way, glad he asked the chef rather than giving out wrong information....but you should be familiar with your menu if you're going to work at a restaurant in a high-end hotel. \n\ni had the farm house salad which was pretty good. it had mixed greens, kale, asparagus, green beans, edamame, cauliflower, and heirloom tomatoes. it is supposed to come in a honey yogurt dressing but i got the balsamic dressing instead. i also added avocado to this and scratched the tomatoes. it was pretty tasty, all of the flavors seemed to work together. i just wasn't \"wowed\" by this salad. \n\nwe also ordered some <mark>French Fries</mark> for the table which were soggy and undercooked. i like <mark>French Fries</mark> to be crispy and crunchy. these were soggy and lifeless. the ketchup they serve is really good though and it seems like they make it in house. \n\nthey also have various alcoholic milkshake type beverages on their menu, which sounded amazing. one of them was a <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> drink with <mark>Red Velvet Cake</mark> vodka. there was also an almond joy and oreo drink. maybe i'll try one next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "went back w/ my girls (that have major allergies) & was very disappointed w/ how they've changed.... they could not have any fried foods like <mark>French Fries</mark>, cuz they have a seafood allergy, and i was told that they fry the calamari in the same fryer???? that right there is major red flag for anyone w/ a seafood allergy!! so, be aware people w/ allergies.....ask & tell your server about your allergies,  before you order!!!", 
            "i have been here several times and i really enjoy the milk shakes here and the ambiance...i tried the lobster roll and also <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>...they were good but not as good as other reviews led me to believe. they have good <mark>French Fries</mark>, the pot stickers were delicious, as were the cuban street tacos.", 
            "to say that holstein's is incredible is an understatement. \n\ni have had a few burgers from holstein's, and each burger is beyond phenomenal. this is one of the few restaurants that offer a gluten free bun, let alone a gluten free bun that is delicious, so when i found out they had this option we immediately ran to this restaurant without passing go. add on the fact they have spiked milkshakes, and i am all set to go.\n\nthe three burgers i've had at holstein's are:\n\nburger of the day: short rib burger\nthis burger had huge chunks of melt in your mouth short rib that made everything seem right in the world.\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger: dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli \n\nthis burger should be the first burger you eat at holstein's. everything about it is right. you'd think a burger with that many ingredients would be overwhelming, but it's not. no wonder this burger has gotten them several well-earned awards. everyone we know that has come to holstein's with us has loved this burger.\n\n<mark>Captain Hook</mark> burger:\ngrilled atlantic salmon w/frissee, pickled shallots, herb-caper mayo & house cured gravlax \n\nto be quite honest, i don't know what gravlax is, but whatever it is i love it and will go back to holstein's to eat it whenever my waistline can bear it. the salmon was cooked perfectly: tender in the inside with a buttery crust on the outside and definitely not greasy. if you're looking for a lighter option instead f a burger, this is the way to go.\n\ngo here. you will love every bite. if you have a gluten allergy or not, you will be able to eat their regular <mark>French Fries</mark> (natural cut and good, but nothing life altering) or their <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> which are a delicious treat in a world that rarely gets <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> right. if you're looking for less fried, go with the coleslaw. so, so good. eat up and enjoy!",

            "as a vegas local, i love trying new places... i took stars away mainly for service. i booked a reservation for 2 at 8:15.. showed up a bit earlier and they quickly seated us. i asked for a water with lemon and a few moments to look over the menu. water came back with no lemon. i got a very weird vibe from our waitress, like we annoyed her. i ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> medium rare with american cheese and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. my burger came back and when i cut <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> in half.. blood came out of the patty.. definitely not medium rare, this was rare beyond belief. since i was starving i did not want to make a commotion and send it back. despite the patty being undercooked, the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were delicious. my date had <mark>French Fries</mark> and those were so good. if this review was strictly based on food i would give it 4 stars, minus one for the undercooked beef patty. the portions are enough to fill you up, and it had a casual atmosphere. i will go back, probably just ask for a medium cooked hamburger instead.\n\n**reading other reviews, we did not get the complimentary popcorn either, that's a little disappointing.",

            "buns and shakes...i guess they are alluding to..well they didn't say it specifically and it wasn't a breastaurant in case you are wondering! they have a nice selection of different burgers each with a different spin. i had the kimchi burger and was really impressed. very flavorful with the sweet sauce and crunchy kimchi and the bun was soft and sweet. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> on the side were nothing special. just anyplace frozen kind. would have been nice to have some banchan instead, but it's a burger place :p\nmy friends were also nice enough to share the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger w tomato & arugula--very peppery. the delhi chicken sando--mild indian flavor. the salmon--lots of salmon for the seafood lover. i liked the pickled shallots. wanted more of them! other than the food the atmosphere is laid back, waitstaff fine, not in your face.\nit's a bit expensive, but it's vegas! i'd go back~",

            "after reading many yelpers raving about this place, the girlfriend and i decided to give it a shot.  the pink cow didn't hurt too (how can you turn away a pink cow?!? she says)\n\nlocation:  located in the new cosmopolitan hotel right outside of marquee nightclub, this joint is in a prime spot to see and be seen in.  definite positive points in my book.\n\natmosphere:  the top 40s music really gets your heart pumping and is very fitting for a cosmo hotel food establishment.  i honestly didn't take much notice to the artwork and aesthetic elements of the restaurant.  very pop modern feel without being too noisy or overbearing.  there is a bar and lounge area at the front if your in the mood for a more casual mingling time with knee high tables and lcd tvs behind the bar.  beyond that is the regular dining portion of the restaurant.\n\nfood:  \n-<mark>Fried Pickles</mark>\n-\"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger\"\n-<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\n-shoestring fries\n\n<mark>Fried Pickles</mark> baby!  money. ok honestly this was the first time i had <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> in my life, and well i am a die hard pickle lover (so really any sort of pickles would be great), these were pretty bomb.  they give you a little tin with some breaded <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> in them, fried olives, and caper berries!  what is a caper berry? yes first time i have come across one myself (like ash finding a new pokemon i guess? kinda puzzling, yet exciting).  but yah, it was pretty darn good.  i was kinda sad that there were only a few of them (about 5-6 wedges of pickles, 2 olives, 2 caper berries), but they were good, while they lasted. :(  also there was a small assortment of deli meats (salami, ham, prosciutto) which seemed like an odd pairing with the fried items, but they were a a nice tasty tid bit before our meal came.  we both having similar tastes, the gf and i ordered \"<mark>The Rising Sun</mark>\" burger.  to be honest, the server who brought our burgers out said this was the best burger in his opinion on the menu.  (i'll be the judge of that myself sir, lol).  well this burger was seriously a masterpiece in of itself.  kobe beef patty with a teri glaze, brought me back to punahou carnival days (if your from hawaii and know what im talking about), and on top of that you get the little shredded yam crispies adding color and a little bit of sweetness to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, nori furikake inside, with a generous piece of fried avocado, again giving another element of texture and creaminess to your bite.  then for the finale, the spicy mayo spread on the bun (like the kine you get with spicy tuna sushi), is like a ninja just hiding there as you gaze at all the other elements of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, waiting to make its presence known.  this my friend gives you that zing of heat (without being overpowering) that really brings all these flavors together, and for me this spicy mayo was the winnaz.  quite honestly one (if not the) best burger i've had the honor to come across in my life.  you also get your choice of bun (white or wheat).  both of which are quite tasty, as i got the white and the gf got the wheat, really can't go wrong with either.  they come with your choice of fries: shoestring or steak-cut.  i didn't want to copy the gf as i wanted the shoestring, so i convinced her to ask to upgrade to <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  they come in little mock fry-baskets which is a thumbs up for presentation.  for the taste of each of the fries, both were very good, would definitely recommend either in a heartbeat.  also they give you a nice amount of fries which is always great!\n\nprice:  ok so this is always <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> side of a vegas story, but honestly people it is vegas and yes $16-17 bucks for a designer burger is on the steep side for most people, but it is in my honest opinion worth it.\n\nverdict:  holsteins presents itself as a hip, modern burger/diner type joint in the heart of the new cosmopolitan hotel.  it's decor and atmosphere really mesh well with the feel of the hotel itself and the food it presents.  you really get what you pay for in my opinion, a great designer burger, one that you quite honestly could not find anywhere else.  in comparison, for $16-17 i would take it over blt's wagyu beef burger & max brenner's kobe burger any day for the same price range.  it's definitely a place to check out if you're in the moooood for some good burgers!\n\n(they are known for their shakes too, but we didnt get to try them as the idea of a shake first thing in the morning after a long night clubbing didn't quite fit the agenda, if you know what i mean)", 
            "holsteins is a little pricey for what you get, but the shakes and burgers are really good.  i ate here with my family for a birthday celebration, and was impressed with the food that we got.  the menu is setup interestingly and can be a little confusing at first.  we got some pretty good flavored popcorn as a little appetizer.\n\nthe kids menu is simple and decent as my son had two mini burgers with fries.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were good and the fries are well prepared.  i would like a softer bun on the mini burgers though.  fried green tomatoes are ok and not worth the price in my opinion (worst thing we ordered).  my wife had the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" burger with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> as no duck fat fries were offered.  the aged beef was really good and <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> had great flavor overall (4 stars).  i actually like the buns they use for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> as they are somewhat soft and taste good.  she also had the \"power shake\" which was amazing as it was a good mix between shake and drinking yogurt (5 stars).  i ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger with <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> and a brown cow (<mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with pop rocks).  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was great but overcooked as i wanted medium and got medium well (4.5 stars).  <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were a disappointment as i expected better (3 stars).  if you want a good dipping sauce ask for the spicy mayo used in <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger and add a little ketchup to it for a good sauce for your fries and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>.  the brown cow was really good as they use a good <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> and ice cream for it (4 stars).  you get a lot of shake which is nice and the pop rocks are kind of fun addition to the drink.  \n\nholsteins has decent service great shakes and some great hamburgers.  if the price and some of the items were better i would give this place five stars, but with some ok items and a somewhat hefty price i give them four stars.  great food and worth eating here once while in vegas if not more often depending on what you like to eat.  i want to try some of the other burgers and shakes though.", 
            "i had nothing but high hopes for holsteins, sadly my dining experience did not live up to expectations. it wasn't that the food was bad, it was actually good. what killed the experience for me was the horrifically bad service and the ridiculously loud music.\n\ni arrived at holsteins at about 9:15pm on a monday night, walked up to the hostess desk, and after being ignored for a few minutes was \"greeted\" by the snottiest hostess in the whole world. after some exasperated sighing and excessive eye-rolling i was told that they were full, the waiting list was full, and they wouldn't even take my name for the waiting list until after 9:30. boom, that was it....and then she walked away. we were aghast! wtf? oh, game on! so, i walked 3 feet away, pulled out my phone, and looked at opentable.com. oh hey, look at that...there are reservations available for holsteins...now. i promptly made a reservation for 4, pushed send, got my confirmation, and walked the 3 feet back to the hostess desk. phone in hand and with a gigantic smile on my face i greeted the snotty hostess and said i had a reservation. she once again grunted and rolled her eyes saying, \"oh, are you carrie?\" after i happily confirmed that i was indeed carrie...the carrie with the 9:30pm opentable reservation snotty hostess said, \"i saw that you just made the reservation. (eyes rolling up a storm) there is a long waiting list, but because you just made a reservation i will put your name at the top of the list. but just to let you know, it might take 20 minutes or more to get you a table.\" i honestly have never encountered a more snotty, hostile, and unaccommodating hostess anywhere. it would serve holsteins well to hire hostesses with temperaments more appropriate for the position.\n\nhere is what we ordered:\n\nbam-boozled \"shakes\" all $11.00\n\n<mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>\nfrozen grasshopper\ncereal bowl\nblack cow\n\nthey were all fine...nothing special and not very boozey. fyi, the black cow is a float not a shake, despite the fact it is not marked as such.\n\nburgers:\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> $17.50 - \nlonghorn $16.00\n<mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> $16.50\n\nall <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were cooked perfectly and they were tasty, but the toppings were very skimpy. i have indeed \"experienced better.\" they are served with fries...two of us chose shoestring fries and one upgraded to <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. sadly, both types of fries were mediocre at best. additionally we ordered the fried green tomatoes which were also mediocre.\n\nour server was fine, but not fantastic. the music was so loud we could barely hear the waitress or carry on a conversation. overall our experience was a less than stellar one. the experience with the snotty hostess put a taint on the evening and there was nothing that happened during the rest of our dinner that made up for it. there are way too many other restaurants in las vegas with bigger, better burgers and better service. i will not be returning, unless it is to punch the snotty hostess in the face (i kid! i kid!)",

(we got this and the beer was very smooth and did not taste cheap at all)\n\noverall it was a very nice experience. i loved the cute cartoony cow deco all around the restaurant. our server even made it a point to stop by and wish me a safe drive back to california when i was standing in line for the bathroom, which was not even close to our table. i thought that was a very nice gesture and topped off our visit very well.",

            "so my first time visiting the cosmopolitan, and wow, gaudy. this hotel is the hip spot now, but i guarantee the chandelier get-up will be looking dated sooner than anyone thinks. the dining area feels so much like a regular mall that i was longing for the painted clouds in almost every other casino's faux outdoor mall experience. \n\nthe wait was long, so we sat in the bar lounge across from a world series of poker player and her spunky blonde friend. at one point the wsp player went to grab something from her room and a very large man sat on the loveseat right next to the friend. when my companion told him the seat was taken, the very large man replied, \"i know,\" and proceeded to flirt with the lady. baller!\n\nanyway, holstein's makes a really great burger. had the korean 'bull'gogi - its sweet soy marinated beef, <mark>Fried Egg</mark>, kimchee slaw, chili mayo, and kalbi glaze had almost nothing to do with any of those items as they're found in koreatown, but boy, was it tasty. i just have to take a moment and acknowledge the concept (heretofore unexperienced by me) of adding a fucking <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to a fucking burger. hot damn, that's a good gimmick! volleys right over the nutritionally bankrupt bacon-wrapped hot dog, i'm sure. so yeah, that was awesome. \n\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were good, and the fresh fruit cocktails were solid. the wait staff were particularly nice. vegas prices but hey, we're in vegas.",

            "**** 4.5 stars ****\n\none of the great miracles of las vegas is that you can eat like a fatty fat fat all day every day and still go to pools surrounded by gorgeous plastic-pumped women and sing nonsense like \"sexy and i know it\", regardless of any absence of truth to that assertion. holsteins provides the perfect venue for stuffing your face on delicious patties of top quality beef while also getting an eye full of the local ladies. unbeknownst to me at the time, the same chef is behind this as public house, where i had dined the night before, and his love of squeezing his employees into clothing that might be mistaken for a table cloth was much more prominent here than there. the d\\u00e9cor here is also just dope. i love the slightly sick toons on the walls, and there are homage to pigs and cows all around. if you look at most of the complaints here it's from people who didn't actually order a burger, so i suggest you take those reviews for what they are, and don't make the same mistake.\n\nbut, since it's vegas, you will still stuff your face to the maximum in front of this beautiful bevy, knowing that you're helping to pay for their salary so that they can go to the pool tomorrow and pretend guys like you don't exist (until you buy them a pitcher of margaritas, then you're superstar hero of the next couple minutes, congrats). brian and i both took the luxury route on the menu here, although i passed on the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark> with kobe beef, <mark>Foie Gras</mark>, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo, because i've already had half a dozen burgers like this across america and they all taste roughly the same...rich and oily. it was honestly more difficult passing up <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, a truly unique combination of kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado...super intriguing, and if i had been dining with someone i was dating i likely would have tried to persuade them in that direction. somehow i managed to also resist ordering a decadent milkshake, perhaps because we were eating dinner just 4 hours after we had managed to roll out of bed for lunch.\n\ni finally wound up deciding on the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, a dry aged beef sirloin patty topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and a garlic-chive aioli...nothing too crazy, but lots of big, bold, wonderful flavors, and at $18 the most expensive burger not topped with <mark>Foie Gras</mark>. the result was pretty fantastic, definitely one of the better burgers i've had lately, and came with a monstrous basket of nicely done <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (for a supplemental charge). my biggest complaint, which is kind of random, is that they skewer <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with their own stupid little logo stick to keep the bun on for presentation, which has the resulting effect of causing huge gobs of mayo or sauce to squirt from the hole in the top every time you take a bite. eating these burgers is a mess, to be sure, especially when you add on a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> as i do, but if you're like me you've already realized you're not taking one of the voluptuous vixens home (although my reason is probably different than yours) so you've resigned your face to more indulgent pleasures, like egg yolk, garlic aioli, and hamburger grease.\n\njust make sure to thoroughly wash your beard, or your own lady might catch on...and get jealous.",

            "this swanky burger joint is located right across the nightclub marquee's entrance inside the cosmopolitan hotel. from the artwork on the wall that reminds me of oldskool 90's taggers to the loud hip music blaring through the speakers, holstein 's is hard to miss. we made it there around 7:30pm on a saturday night and the wait was no more than 20 minutes for our party of four. when your pager starts buzzing and you report to the host at the door, you're ushered to the next host in the middle of place, which that person will walk you over to your table. the place is vibrant, loud, and hip. just like in a nyc subway train, you have everything from skirts to suits to shorts & flip flops occupying this restaurant.\n \nmany items on the menu sound appealing including their numerous $11 alcoholic shakes. we ordered the frozen grasshopper: peppermint, chocolate, cr\\u00e8me de menthe, van gogh chocolate vodka. if you love them little minty & crunchy chocolate balls, then this shake is right up your alley. there's plenty of it, a bit overwhelming actually but some people like it that way. that distinct alcohol taste is barely noticed. we also got the oreo with bailey's irish cream. this is what i considered a \"safe\" shake to order. if you enjoy oreos (who doesn't?) then this is a solid route to go. again, the taste of alcohol isn't really prevalent. warning, if you have issues with dairy then you may want to stay away from the shakes here. i really don't but it did activate.... uhh nevermind.\n \nseems like <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> $17 is quite popular from many of the reviews and sure enough someone on our table ordered it. kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake not to be mistaken by bukake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado. seriously, what is there not to like about that set up? if it was truly an asian inspired burger, then a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> would finish the job. you can add it though for a buck more. i was a little sad that i didn't order this burger for myself but my buddy was kind enough to give me a slice of heaven.\n \ni ended up with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> $17.5: beef patty crusted with black pepper, holstein's creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark>, swiss cheese. oh you fancy huh? because it sure did sound fancy. although <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was good, my mind was set on <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> as the unanimous winner this night. the pepper was probably what i remember most about this burger. i did finish it but i most likely wouldn't care to order it again.\n \nthe maine lobster roll $16.5: fresh cooked lobster tossed in chive aioli in a grilled mini hot dog bun with cole slaw. the price is steep, the portion is crazy bite sized, but the taste landed a mike tyson uppercut. why oh why do you tease us like that holstein 's? gimme more!\n \nthe steak cut fries and the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were decent but can be better.\n \noverall, holstein 's should be visited at least once and from there you can determine if you want to be a regular. the meal was quite enjoyable but i'm not sure if it left an uber lasting effect on my appetite glands. i can probably live with or without it. for sure, give it a shot. on fridays, saturdays, and mondays, they are opened beyond their normal hours, midnight to 2am. however, their full menu isn't available but rather a separate and shorter late night menu. check out the art work on the walls, i want one for my place!",

(the menu was pre determined, served as a 4 course meal). it was a pleasure to be hosted by them and i would have not discovered them otherwise.\n\nbut ....\n\nsecond \"chance\" visit (late may) i was in heaven ... even if for a moment.\n\nthe breakdown: it was recovery sunday (from saturday night gallivanting). we all know the best hangover cure it some heavy greasy food ... so i gave it a second try. it was much more casual, with no worries of feeling full after.\n\nthere was a 40 min wait (that tells you its quite popular). but there was room at the bar which also had full service. the way they place the barstools leaves plenty of elbow room to really get down, without throwing 'bows.\n\ni had: the golden standard (because i just couldn't talk myself into paying $28 for one burger \"<mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>\" though i was tempted). and it was delicious. didn't even need to add a thing. no ketchup, salt, nada. it was made to perfection (medium) i chose a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> which were decent, but a little soggy at the end.\nwhile i waited, i washed down a brown cow float, which was basically a turnt up <mark>Virgil's Root Beer</mark> float with \"pop rocks\" and it brought me back to being a kid with the rocks popping in my mouth. loved it!!\ni tried their bucket of <mark>Buffalo Wings</mark>, and i liked how they didn't drench it with sauce. i enjoyed licking my fingers to that before and during my burger meal. \n\ni guess there is a time and place for everything ... and figuring out the right moment makes a huge difference.\n\nholsteins \"before\" the club no\nholsteins the day \"after\" definitely",

            "i had to write an update to my review of holstein's because it was even better the second time around!  everything from start to finish was amazing, and we ordered a lot of stuff.  even the complimentary popcorn tasted great and was not as over saturated with oil as my first visit here.  what really stole the show for me though was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger.  it was the best thing that i ate in vegas during my most recent visit, and i am salivating just thinking about it as i write this review.  i also shared sides of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, and <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> with my wife, and i loved them all.  i was so glad that we came back to eat at holstein's again when we were in las vegas, because it was my favorite meal of our trip.  i can't wait to come back here again soon!",

            "upon hearing more bad than good reviews regarding this eatery, i decided that it wasn't worth the risk of a potentially bad meal. however, since a large group of us were already on property tonight, it was the best choice for a relatively inexpensive dinner. \n\ni attempted to make a reservation via opentable, but it stated that there were no reservations remaining for the evening. then i called. the hostess explained that they are no longer taking reservations for the evening, but she would be happy to get us a table when we arrived and that there was a \"short\" wait for less than 30 minutes. since we were not physically at the restaurant, we could not put our name on the list. humph. anyway, we get to the restaurant and are given a 30-35 minute wait for our group of nine. a bit longer than i enjoy waiting, but it worked out well - we received our table within 10 minutes (and via text message; very convenient)!\n\nmost of us decided on selections from the \"big buns\" category (good ol' burgers and fries). i had a hard time choosing between a couple of their burgers, but i'm very pleased that our server directed me to their most popular selection - the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" ($17.50). dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli. holy tastebuds. that first bite was euphoric. i can't even describe it, but i'll always remember how i felt - amazing. i was raving to everyone at the table and the two people that tasted my burger affirmed my praise, as well as stating that it was much better than <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> they were eating (memphis burger - very tasty - and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> - shrug). i've had other goat cheese-arugula-tomato burgers and this one does it much better. because the goat cheese is blended with cheddar (haven't quite wrapped my head around this yet lol), it isn't too pungent and all the other flavors were so well balanced. get the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>; medium rare, of course. really, really good.\n\nwith your \"big buns\" order, you have a choice of regular fries, side salad, or a $2 upgrade for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> or thick cut <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. i got their regular fries and they were really tasty and well cooked. i also tried the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> ($9) - perfect dill spears with good crispy exterior, served with an herb-caper mayo - and a strawberry milkshake ($8) - really creamy, delicious strawberry flavor. overall, all the food was great!\n\nour server was really nice and very helpful, however, we received only one visit between receiving our food and finishing our meal, so most of our water glasses weren't refilled. then we found ourselves having to wave our arms for attention. i figured the servers must be overwhelmed, but it seems that the restaurant is always busy and it's as if no one has figured out how to properly handle the capacity of customers.\n\ni'm curious as to why people have been so unhappy with holsteins, but i can guess. based on our experience prior to and during our dinner, i'm sure they have their off days or the service may be even less attentive than it was today. hopefully i won't have to experience any of those things during future visits or even better, that it'll improve!", 
            "located in the cosmopolitan, second floor, across from race sports and marquee. we got very lost trying to find the place. the map initially made it look like it was in the bellagio, then vdara... had to ask a few people along the way for directions.\n\nonce we found it, we got seated right away in the bar area, about a 10 minute wait for a normal table. great beer list, fun grown-up milkshakes, and good burgers and fries. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are better than the plain ones, in case you're on the fence about which to get. all in all, worth the trek we had to take to find the place.", 
            "the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger with an egg added was really really good. i thought the patty had just the right amount of bite and flavor. the bun was also superb-- just the right texture. i'm pretty easily impressed when it comes to gourmet burgers though. \n\nmy husband got <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with the chips in it.. nom nom. it was a little plain and not so nom nom. he wanted mine.\n\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are way worth the $1 upgrade. they were perfection on my tongue. nice and crispy and chewy.\n\nwe also split the autumn house salad... it was so good. lots of fresh greens and fruit tossed with a sweet but tart apple vinaigrette.\n\nwe split the tiramisu adult shake and it was delicious with little chocolate and espresso bean shavings. wanted to try others but we were way too full.\n\ngreat draft beer selection too.\n\nbut the 5 stars really goes to the outstanding waitstaff. my husband was in a wheelchair and barely up on crutches during our visit. he needed to use the restroom and when he asked where it was, our waitress was like \"wait, there's a line right now\" and actually offered to keep checking to see if the line cleared and let us know. i can't remember her name but she was a sweetheart!",

            "swanky burger place.  there were people of all ages here from middle aged adults having a good time to kids barely 21.  we came with a group of 7 and was seated in around 20 minutes which was a lot faster than the 45min they quoted us.  \n\nthe waitstaff was very friendly and they are on top of their game with the drink refills.  no one really seemed to have a standard burger they all liked except the nom nom which i didn't try.  i split 2 burgers.\n\ngood:\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> - added an egg to this burger and thought this burger was good.  there wasn't anything super fancy about it but just straight forward deliciousness.\n<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\n\njust ok:\n<mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> - hot, cripsy but oversalted.\n\ndidn't like:\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> - didn't like the oil soaked tempura avacado and the glaze was over powering\nfries - were almost all soggy but still managed to be dry.  i dont know how thats possible.",

            "i was skeptical in trying holsteins because of the mixed reviews, but after eating at gordon ramsay's burgr so much, i wanted a different burger place. originally we came here around midnight fri to try the place, but were told they stopped serving their regular menu at 11pm. they offered a late night menu instead which were basically just appetizers (no burgers/shakes). no biggie, we came back the next day after a fabulous time at marquee's dayclub...spoiler alert: we also came back the next day before we left on the drive back home because it was sooo good!!\n\nthe decor is so cute here w/ the anime pig wall posters and the theme totally matched w/ the cosmopolitan. our server made great recommendations for us & started us off w/ the complimentary small bucket of lightly salt/sweet popcorn. my bf killed that thing, talk about drunk munchies\n\nbamboozled shakes:\n<mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> - i added toasted coconut marshmallow to it and this was one damn good shake! the description/ingredients seemed so minimal, yet the shake tasted so amazing. it was like a cookies n cream reese's <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark>. this was my fav out of all the other shakes. \n\ntiramisu - they had me at mascarpone ice cream. i love mascarpone, but you could barely taste it in this shake. this tasted like a chocolate shake, not much espresso/coffee flavor. \n\nbanana creme pie - my bf go this 'cause he loves bananas and i would say this was my 2nd fav shake. it tastes exactly like a banana cream pie, but in shake form w/ chocolate. i liked that they topped it w/ white chocolate covered bananas.\n\nthe shakes are big enough to share, but trust me you won't want to. i like that you get a full glass shake and the extras are in the metal mixing cup so you can eat it w/ a spoon (yum!) i also like that their shakes all were thick & creamy!\n\napps:\nsurf 'n turf quesadilla - delish my favorite app! this ain't no taco bell quesadilla. it was crunchy and not oily at all. the lobster, steak and manchego cheese inside all just melted in your mouth and is bursting w/ flavor. must order!!\n\nsoft shell crab bruschetta - for a burger place, their presentation of these apps were tapas style and as nice as any fancy steakhouse. the softshell crab was on top of a thick cut brioche bread, the aioli and tomato salad made the app refreshing\n\ncrispy calamari - big enough portion to share, i couldn't stop dunking these rings in the sweet chili sauce. i like that they don't overbread the calamari rings\n\nmaine lobster roll - pricey for this, but there were generous amount of lobster. \n\ncrispy pork belly bun - tasted better than the ones at ramsay's burgr. the steamed buns weren't dry & sauce was spot on\n\nburgers:\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> w/ <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>(normally comes w/ fries, but paid $2 to upgrade) - the best burger ever!! most asian fusion burgers get overpowered by the sauce, but not here. it didn't taste like an ordinary overly sweet typical terriyaki burger. everything was perfect about this burger, that first bite was so orgasmic. this is what a burger should taste like! the whole brioche bun was toasted to perfection. i am not sure how they did it, but the top part of the bun and inside had a nice toast crisp to it. the tempura avocado was nice, added a different texture. you could taste each item in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and they all blended well together. the kobe beef patty was cooked medium, yet it was juicy and had a nice pink to it. <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were the best we've had as well & worth the upgrade! they were thick, fried, fresh, and crispy, no soggy oiliness at all. make sure to ask for buttermilk ranch to dip the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> in!! it tastes so divine\n\nfun-ghi on wheat bun w/ salad ($2 extra) - healthy combo huh? my 2nd fav burger, but my bf preferred this over <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> because he prefers the truffle flavor. again, patty was cooked perfect along w/ toasted wheat bun. i actually prefer the regular bun's flavor although the wheat bun was toasted the same way as the regular brioche bun. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> wasn't smothered in mayo thank god! the gruyere helped accentuate the truffle portabella & caramelized onions. salad was a generous portion of mixed greens & the dressing was tangy yet sweet & light (sort of like a coleslaw dressing w/ lemon). the only negative is that we added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, but there was no runny yolk...the egg was fully cooked :(\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> w/ <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>- everyone kept talkin about this burger, but we thought it paled in comparison to <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were bomb!\n\ni would have to say that holstein's outranks ramsay's burgr. we were so pleased w/ our meal that we sent compliments to the chef. we were lucky that both days we ate here, the executive chef was working. the food comes out fast and you will leave happily stuffed. don't forget to give them your identity player's card for points!\n\nnote: try and get a girl server. the first day we had a girl and she was totally on top of it. the 2nd day, we had a guy and he seemed easily overwhelmed", 
            "the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> get a thumbs up, holstein's special lager was nice. wayne loved his urth burger. they pushed the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, which placed a distant fourth. i'd advise sticking with kobe beef. service was meh.",

            "i must first state that i was a solid 3 on this; however, what happened once we left really soured my mood along with my stomach. \n\ni must also be clear that this was my first - and subsequently, only - meal of the day. \n\nfirst, the food: my trusty companion and i each had a burger. i had the flagship \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" and she had the \"el machete\". \n\nthe <mark>Gold Standard</mark> is made with dry aged beef, which is a good choice, and topped with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar and arugula. this should be delicious, and i assume if seasoned properly it is. unfortunately, there was too much salt seasoning - and believe me... i love salt - which left the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> feeling merely standard. \n\nmy tardis companion had the \"el machete\" which is a spicy aoli and pepper based burger. this was actually delicious from the two bites i had. if there was any seasoning issue with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself it was covered by the delicious peppers and aoli!\n\nalong with that we had regular fries and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. the fresh cut fries were tasty, albeit again heavily bathed in salt. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were on the soggy side but fresh and not overly salted. \n\nwe also had milkshakes. hers being some fruit compote fourth of july special concoction and mine being chocolate strawberry. mine was very sweet but it was strawberry with chocolate sauce, so of course that was unsurprising. (i had asked for chocolate ice cream but i wasn't about to whine about the small oversight.)\n\nas we left, i thought \"unspectacular... but worth a second look\".  the food wasn't bad but it wasn't great. i figured that i might try it again when next in town. \n\nnot long after my companion and i started feeling sour in our stomachs. come dinner time, still sour... i have slightly upchucked and swallowed it back down on two occasions. even as i write this, the meal from lunch feels like it is remaining in the upper regions of my stomach and the gassy bloating remains.\n\nwe tried later to force a small meal elsewhere for consistency as it was getting late but we couldn't even touch our food. it literally went into <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> the same way it came to the table. \n\ni really didn't intend on writing a negative review... and many of the reviews are positive. i would like to think this is an isolated incident in which i suspect the culprit to be the milkshakes. \n\ni really wanted to like this place. the menu is creative.  the decor is attractive. there are a dozen reasons to be drawn to this place.  unfortunately, i went from \"looking forward to eating there\" to \"pondering a second chance\" to \"likely not looking forward to a future visit\"... \n\nif not for the promise and potential of my initial thoughts, compared to the way i feel right now, it would have resulted in one star. so in fairness, i decided to average the two opinions. \n\nall in all a very disappointing visit. thank god for pepto.", 
            "this place is good. i wouldn't say it's the best burger place ever like some reviewers have said, but it was good.\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> which were decent. the insides were lava hot, even after a while of letting them sit to cool. i am pretty sure these are frozen, though. my grandma owns a restaurant and tried out fried pickle spears for the menu and i tried those. pretty sure these were the exact same ones. \n\nmy husband is a huge burger fan. i don't know if he loves anything more.\nhe got the golden standard burger that apparently has won a bunch of awards or something (according to our waiter).\nwhen i asked him how he likes it, he just shrugged. i was shocked. he said it was alright, but if we ever ate there again, he would try something else. \n\ni had the blackened salmon po-boy. it was really good but super awkward to eat because it's a long piece of salmon sitting on a hamburger bun. i had to piece off some of the salmon and eat that separate before diving into the sandwich. overall, a good choice. the slaw on it was really good. i got <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and they tasted just like every other sweet potato fry. good, but nothing crazy amazing.\n\nwe didn't get a shake because we were outrageously full, which is a disappointment on our part hah.\nit's a fun place. nothing really too bad about it so i'll give it a 4 star. maybe i'll have to go back with more people in the future to get a better idea of what it's like.",

            "went here with a friend tonight. first of all, the setting was very nice with a animation-esque theme. the hostess told us that we could sit at the bar or the dining area, both of which have tvs. i had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger ($18.50) and my friend had the big fat greek burger($18) with $2 sub <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. we also shared the tiramisu shake ($13). when the shake came out, our waiter gave us a steel mixing cup and a glass cup with the shake. i was wondering what that steel cup was and when i looked inside it was more of the shake. i guess they made extra and they were courteous enough to give the rest of it to us. the shake was pretty good and less sweet (thank god) than the shakes at gordon ramsay's burgr. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came out pretty quick (maybe in 10-15 minutes). it wasn't that busy so that helped. the fries come out in a small, aluminum bucket which is kinda unique. the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger was great. i liked especially the arugula and the tomato confit. those veges balanced the heavy flavors of the bacon, cheese, and burger. unfortunately, i noticed the fries at the middle and bottom of my bucket were a little soggy and oily. i tried my friend's greek burger which had greek spiced lamb. she had the tsaziki sauce on the side and i thought that was a good decision especially for this burger. the sauce had mint in it and my friend didn't like it. i, on the other hand, thought it worked bc i've hand lamb with mint jelly before. my friend told the waiter she didn't like the tsaziki sauce and the waiter was kind enough to bring out a cajun remoulade sauce instead. that cajun remoulade sauce was pretty good and tasted like thousand island with some cajun seasoning. my friend's <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were great as they were crispy and did not taste oily at all. the service was great and attentive. even though <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were on the pricey side (most were $16-$18), i would come back again bc of the casual setting, fast service, and the yummy tasting burgers and shakes.",

            "after hearing so much about holsteins, i had to try it during my first trip to vegas. i waa not disappointed. i made reservations on open table since i'd heard it can get busy. the restaurant even called that morning to confirm my reservation. pretty impressed considering this is a millennial restaurant. my friend and i arrived at 1pm sharp and were promptly seated. the restaurant has a separate bar area but both have a lively atmosphere. our waiter have us some time to look over the menu, and brought a small bucket of their complimentary popcorn which my friend declared was \"addicting.\" we caught a glimpse of a burger going out to a table and they're huge! way too much for me. our waiter asked if it was our first time dining there. when we said yes he gave us a few suggestions. we took his digestion and decided to split a <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and a lobster roll with regular fries. we also ordered the philly <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark>. in case you hadn't heard, holsteins is known for their milkshakes. i ordered a black and whire, and my friend got a creme bruise. both were amazing. the philly <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> were delicious. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was tasty. tempura avocado won me over. the only disappointment was the lobster roll. it was just ok. not worth the price or the calories. \n\nservice was definitely above average. my water glass was never empty and all of my questions were well answered. plus since i asked for a souvenir or waiter gave me a drink koozy. woohoo! any way i can't wait to go back and try another burger and shake.", 
            "truly one of the best burgers i've ever had. big, juicy, and flavorful. \n\nthis restaurant is hip, fun, and chill. good place to have a burger and be rowdy with your friends. \n\ni ordered <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. even though it was huge, my burger has such depth of flavor that i was happy to devour all of it. it was spices on top of other spices. it was just delicious. this made me into a burger fan (only a fan of in-n-out burgers before). \n\nthere are layers and layers of flavors and goodness in each burger. your taste buds won't be disappointed here.", 
            "delicious, great fun burger combinations. extra rich and super sweet shakes and amply sized. underwhelming sides.\n\nsince it's vegas, there's no point in stressing about the price, since everything is at least 50-100% marked up than what it should be.\n\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> was truly an innovative combo: kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado. be warned, the crispy yam is merely just grated fried yams. the tempura avocado is extremely excellent though. but i mean, how do you go wrong with deep-fried fat? (for further reading: fried butter)\n\nthe <mark>Thai Steak Salad</mark> was barely average: grilled steak, tomato, cucumber, red onion, romaine lettuce, green papaya, mint, cilantro, roasted peanuts, tossed in a sweet-chili vinaigrette. the steak strips were substantial, but completely dry and tough, and i usually expect a sweeter sauce with my \"asian\" salads, but the sweet-chili vinaigrette was more vinaigrette than sweet or chili.\n\nthe regular fries & the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were mediocre at best, but the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were crisp, firm, and delicious.\n\nuseful: everything is super salty. everything. water will get you nowhere. my lips continually shriveled up from beginning to end no matter what i was eating. i was re-applying moisturizing lip balm like it was the air i breathe. i may try to ask for \"less salt\" if i ever go back!",

            "this review will be based only on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. \n\nsince christmas day basically consists of my mom and my boyfriend, we decided to spend some time walking on the strip and grab lunch at holsteins.\n\ni ordered <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> ($16) which was ok - not terrible, but not something i'd order again either. it was a chicken breast burger with kettle chips (more like kettle crumbs), a pickled shallot (? .. it was something pink), lettuce, and tomato. in the description it listed garlic aioli which is why i leaned towards ordering that item, but i honestly really couldn't depict it in my bites.\n\nmi madre went with <mark>Captain Hook</mark> ($17) - a salmon burger with lettuce, tomato, the pickled pink stuff, and smoked salmon. that was much more worth the money and if i ever paid a visit again, that's probably what i would order. the salmon wasn't dry and the smoked salmon actually complemented very will with the grilled salmon filet, giving <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> a strong salmon kick.\n\nmy boyfriend went with the big fat greek ($17) - a burger basically with all the ingredients you'd find at a greek restaurant like lamb, feta, lettuce, tomato, and tatziki. that was pretty tasty as well if you don't mind a hint of gaminess from the lamb. <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> quite enjoyed it but said it didn't hit the spot like he hoped.\n\nthere were definitely other options i would've been keen on trying but the average pricing was $18 for all other types of burgers and i just don't care that much about burgers to spend close to $20. all comes with a small personal-sized bucket of fries or you could sub it for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> or <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> for an extra $2.\n\nthe bill came out to be $70 after taxes and tip... that's pretty rough in my opinion but i guess i shouldn't expect any less from restaurants on the strip. \n\nwould i come here again? sure if my out-of-town friends dragged me. as for the shakes, i think they are definitely worth a try since some of the concoctions are pretty interesting and unique (not to mention it also includes liquor) if you don't mind spending the extra $13. as for me, a non-drinker, i'll just stick to off-strip joints for any burger cravings...", 
            "i was really excited to try holsteins because the menu looked great, there are a lot of highly rated reviews, and the restaurant has a fun vibe inside. while the other yelp reviews give the place 4 stars, my experience didn't live up to this expectation. this was mostly due to the lousy service that we received. our service wasn't terrible and our server was nice, but we had to ask for the complimentary popcorn to be brought to our table and ask on multiple occasions for our water to be refilled. in general, our waiter wasn't rude, but didn't seem to care about our experience here. \n\nthe menu is very unique though and the food that we tried was good. i wasn't in the mood for drinking, but the adult shake menu looks amazing. i was eyeing the <mark>Pecan Turtle Cheesecake</mark> shake, because who doesn't want to just drink a cheesecake with booze in it? my boyfriend and i were just in the mood for burgers so we ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, which had kobe beef with yam, teriyaki sauce, and tempura avocado and the longhorn burger with brisket, bbq sauce, and cole slaw. i was actually slightly disappointed with <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, but the longhorn one was delicious. we got regular fries and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and these were good, but not amazing. we had good burgers here, but unfortunately the high expectations that i had were not met. i'd give this place another try and i'd definitely come back for one of those shakes!", 
            "since the cosmopolitan didn't exist last time i was in las vegas, we wanted to check it out and we stumbled upon holstein's, a restaurant that specializes in shakes (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and burgers. it's like the shake shack or good stuff eatery on the east coast. \n\ninstead of bread, there was a medium sized pail of mixed popcorn - bbq cheddar and regular. it was a bit too early for an alcoholic beverage so i got a strawberry malt (which consisted of strawberry ice cream and milk mixed together and topped with whipped cream and strawberry meringue. for starters, we shared a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> (which consisted of purple and green romaine lettuce, croutons, and shaved grana padano cheese tossed in a garlic-parmesan dressing. it was topped with two, small, thinly sliced bread with melted cheese. for entrees, we ordered the following burgers: <mark>Captain Hook</mark> and <mark>California Turkey</mark>. they allow customers to substitute the regular fries for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> or <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> for an additional $2. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were served in a small pail. the <mark>Captain Hook</mark> burger consisted of pan seared salmon cooked to medium and glazed with remoulade sauce, smoked salmon, fricassee, and red colored pickled shallots. the <mark>California Turkey</mark> consisted of turkey party with parsley and spices, sprouts, tomato, avocado, cucumber, thinly shredded coleslaw, pepper jack cheese, and russian dressing.",

            "holsteins really does not need my review but i need to talk about my affinity for holsteins. my family and i got there at around 11:45 am. not exactly lunch time yet so it was pretty spacious and not packed. holsteins has complimentary popcorn but our server was a bit tardy compared to other servers & their tables. so at first, we saw popcorn on nearly every other table and were wondering what's so special about the popcorn that got so many people to order it as their appetizer? then we realized it's complimentary when our server brought it out pretty late. not a huge complaint but just saying.\n\ni got <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and i was pretty satisfied. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are said to be 6 oz, which i find is just right. there are some people on this yelp page who say the size isn't that great and it was not big. but i mean what more do you want? it's 6 oz. i mean yeah sure 8 oz burger is bigger but for a burger, 6 oz was just right. after consuming a 6 oz burger, you don't feel disgustingly full. it's not too much beef and not too much unhealthy food. 6 oz is just right. any more is just not necessary. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were good. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> is pepper-crusted and comes with a tomato confit. excellent burger. i loved it but i wouldn't recommend it. let me clarify. i do not regret getting it. i do not think it was a bad burger. but it wouldn't be one i would recommend to others. i didn't personally feel it was indicative of holsteins' caliber. so although i enjoyed it and it tasted great, i just wouldn't get it again. \n\nmy sister got <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger and i thought the tempura avocado and the teriyaki glaze was fantastic. they really made the entire thing a masterpiece. the tempura avocado was unique and just burst on your taste buds. teriyaki glaze gave it a nice taste. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> we ordered were all juicy, not dry. we had high praise for holsteins. \n\nholsteins has a lot more on its menu than burgr. i love gordon ramsay but his menu pales in comparison to here. also, my god, the shake was fantastic. we got the <mark>Pecan Turtle Cheesecake</mark> or whatever it was. it was absolutely magnificent. not overly sweet. it just really was an explosion of several layers of flavor that fit together really well. i definitely recommend this shake. just absolutely tasty and i want another shake from holsteins. we looked around and a myriad of other tables ordered shakes too. they're a very great aspect of the restaurant. so, get a shake along with a burger! \n\nservice was okay. not too impressive. not friendly enough. the place is pricy. i don't deny that but hey it's vegas. did you expect to get cheap burgers? tbh, i'm pretty content with paying the price for my <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> though. it's a bit pricy but they deliver on flavor. \n\ni'll definitely be back, holsteins!",

            "i was endlessly impressed with this quirky, classy vegas burger and shake joint. \nour taxi driver suggested it when my girlfriend was craving chicken wings. we all did need a base layer before a hectic night out on the strip. normally, if someome suggests a joint, i am left with limited things i tend to eat. i stood corrected in this case.\nwe found the restaurant easily and were greeted by several friendly hostesses. the decor is funky and modern with strange pictures of pickle-people and cows. we sat at an oversized booth and as i started to look at the menu, i found my savior: the urth burger. that's right folks, a vegan burger. \nmy party got a few orders of chicken wings, a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, <mark>Ahi Poke Tostadas</mark> and i ordered the urth burger with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. \nwarren was our server and he was friendly and very hospitable. thanks to yelp! i found out flavored rums were $4. the girls ordered a few cocktails and c and i stuck with waters. \nwe peppered warren with questions about the area and tattoo parlors and he tried his best to help us. he did seem moderately overwhelmed so we were forgiving of his mild forgetfulness. \nour food came out and the presentation was gorgeous! my burger was massive and absolutely amazing. the patty had a perfect blend of spices to be flavorful, yet not overpowering and it was popped with a generous portion of avocado, sprouts, tomato and lettuce. it is definitely a veg heads burger! the drinks came out shortly after the food, which was a little unopportunistic but that is okay.\ni would love to give this place 5 stars, but the pace of dining is what killed it. i loved warren as a server and it is not like we were in a massive hurry, but over 15 minutes for drinks from the time we ordered and about 8 minutes for our bill knocked it down a star.\ni would absolutely recommend it and plan to go back though!", 
            "all that hype was a let down. i chose this over shake shack and i should have done the opposite. \n\nthe ambiance is cool and laid back with great art work that is quite fitting for what they serve. it is open and airy with plenty of room to sit and hang while you get sloppy with their alcohol infused shakes. \n\nwe were seated immediately and was met with a very friendly and knowledgable host. she was able to steer us in any direction with great suggestions on drinks and appetizers. \n\ni ordered the urth burger adding cheddar and grilled <mark>Wild Mushroom</mark> and chris ordered the standard with avocado. the lobster mac n' cheese and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were also ordered. \n\nthe meals came promptly and was a decent size. chris said it was a burger with nothing special. he said the patty was just a patty with underwhelming flavors.....he did mention that an in n out would have been better. my urth burger was nothing exciting either. the patty was bland and their blend of veggies was of mediocre level. i definitely had better veggie burger at a far more unknown spot. i couldn't bring myself to finish <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. chris ate his but was still hungry. the lobster mac n' cheese was okay. just a bit runny and very little lobster. chris was not a fan. i was left to eat most of it by myself b\n\nwe didn't try their shake which i am sure is the highlight of this location. maybe next time. but as far as burgers go....we were not impressed and probably wouldn't be back for their burgers but maybe for their shakes.",

            "my bff and i recently stayed at the cosmo and visited holsteins twice. here's how it went for us:\n\nday one - bff had just finished running the las vegas rock 'n' roll marathon, so we were in no mood to be messing around. vegas was crazy-crowded, and we had no reservations, so we expected to wait quite some time. i was pleasantly surprised when our beeper went off after only 15 minutes.  i started with an absolut dirty martini (the best way to judge a decent bar), and it was very good!    then i ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> with blue cheese, and had no idea what type of fries to order. i panicked and went with steakcut.  <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was excellent; big, thick and juicy, with a bun that was just the right size and a good amount of cheese. the fries were good, but nothing spectacular.\n\nday two - bff and i both had some things on the menu that we wanted to try, so back we went.  absolut dirty martini? yes, and though it was a different bartender, it was again excellent. this time we were prepared for an appetizer, and agreed on the pizza twinkies out of sheer curiosity (and a mutual lifelong love of pizza).  they were a revelation; crispy bread surrounding melty cheese with a delicious tomato relish-type dip.  truly great.  then we both ordered a burger. i can't remember the name, but it was a thick burger between a layer of kettle chips and thousand island dressing. it was awesome. we ordered the shoestring fries and were again underwhelmed, so we ordered a side of <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. those. were. excellent.\n\nto summarize, i would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the vicinity. the only thing keeping me from awarding it 5 stars is that i found the service to be rather slow and indifferent. on both nights it took them quite awhile to check in with us once we were seated, and even longer to make sure we were ok once we had our food.",

            "well i love this hotel (cosmopolitan) so i researched restaurants to pick one for lunch. all i needed to see was \"bamboozled shakes\" with alcohol and my decision was easy!!! went with the \"drunkin monkey\" because it had my fav frangelico!! i'm sure it has about 1000 calories, but hey... you know what they say, \"what happens in vegas stays in vegas\"... so let's hope that includes calories too!!! i also had the \"machete\" burger. chili peppers, garlic sauce, yum!! then all the usual choices for side items like <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, sweet potatoe fries or regular fries. it was all amazing so now i need to go back to try one of everything else on the menu! i especially liked that they had so many other options other than burgers! turkey, chicken, salmon and lamb!! something for everyone!!",

            "what a great place! came here last night with a group of 8. the waitress split our bill for us didn't seem too thrilled about it but dealt with it. i ordered the bulgogi burger and it was probably the best burger ive ever had. juicy, spicy, sweet delicious. had a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> and kimchee on it. weird but definitely worth it. also an order of <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. although pricy when they came out there was a huge plate of them and they were perfectly crisp and totally yummy.  others had plain burgers, salad, philly cheese steak spring rolls. everyone left happy and full. oh, did i mention milkshakes?", 
            "i'd say the food here is a solid 4 stars, but a few things during my experiences here dropped it down to 3. \n\nas an appetizer, i had the truffle lobster mac n' cheese and was very disappointed by this. for the low, low price of just $16.50, you get a small dish, about the size of an iphone, full of mac n' cheese! the lobster seemed almost nonexistent and the truffle was extremely light, too light. although the saving point for this was the bite-sized blt that came with it. \n\nfor burgers, the one that stood out the most was the el machete. wow that is a good burger and it has a very nice kick to it from the spicy aioli that it's topped with. their burgers are juicy and cooked the way you like it. their buns are absolutely amazing too. they're dense enough to uphold those thick, juicy burgers with all their glorious toppings too. but not too dense where it's like you're eating styrofoam. \n\nmy bf had the long horn, since what man doesn't like extra meat? it was decent but i like my burgers to have more veggies on them. he liked it also, but agreed that the el machete just tasted better. \n\ntheir matchstick fries are fried to perfection so they're super crispy on the outside but smooth in the center. however we also had the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> and they came out extremely dark in color, so over fried. they didn't taste too bad though. \n\ni love their milkshakes! if only they weren't so expensive! you can get them non-alcoholic, which will shave off about 3 bucks from the menu price. they have some tasty concoctions, including their <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark>, which is my favorite. i tried the cap'n crunch and it was good, but it tasted just like a vanilla milkshake with some ground up cereal. still not bad though. \n\nthe cons of this place are mostly due to the environment of the restaurant.. the hostess was not friendly at all and barely even said hello. the server was friendly enough, although she could have been more attentive. she disappeared for a while after asking what we'd like to drink. the music is extremely loud. we had heard that the music is usually lower earlier in the day, but the last time i came, it was 6pm and i was still yelling over the music.\n\nthis isn't the best place for a nice dinner and conversation, but they can cook up a mean burger. also, they change the paintings on the walls every once in a while, which is pretty snazzy!", 
            "holsteins was very good. a large selection of adult shakes spiked with liquor, and regular shakes also. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were great, juicy flavorful meat topped to your liking. the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were battered and crispy served with an awesome chipotle aioli didn't find this place until my last trip to vegas and was very satisfied. the only minus is the price of the shake starting at 8 dollars-11. other than that holsteins was great.", 
            "got the korean burger.  eh.  it was super sweet.  overpowering sweet.  the meat was cooked really well but the flavors just didn't work.  truffle mac and cheese was just not good.  texture, flavor, cheesiness, just off.  the grasshopper shake was very good but didn't get me to any level of drunkiness and the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were pretty good.  there are better hamburger places out there.",

            "every time i try to come here, the wait is always ridiculous.  i never remember to make reservations either cause, well, it's a burger place!  finally, this past weekend around 2pm, after a somewhat \"short\" wait of 40 minutes, i got to try holsteins.\n\nit actually took the 4 of us awhile to look through the menu, and in the end, i went with the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>, which is a burger with dry aged beef sirloin burger, <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli.  i ordered it medium rare and came with a nice pink middle.  what really caught my attention about the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> was the dry aged beef, since dry aging beef condenses the beef flavor, and wow that burger was juicy.  out of all 4 burgers, mine was the only one that had juices dripping down my fingers, even versus the kobe beef burgers!\n\nthe toppings were all great, especially the aged goat cheddar.  you can tell it's a little different than your normal cheddar.  the garlic-chive aioli has a mellow garlic taste.  besides hoping the bacon was a little bit crispier, the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> is really a burger that's up there in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> world.  it's just a very tasty burger and i can see why it is so popular!\n\ni also tried a bit of <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, as well as the korean bull-gogi.  <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> is more of an asian fusion burger, with teriyaki glaze and a tempura avocado that sits on top of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  it also has a kobe beef patty, so the whole burger had this velvety smooth texture thanks to the fatty patty and the smooth creamy avocado!  i would like a bit more teriyaki sauce though.\n\nas for the korean bull-gogi burger, the patty is marinated to give it extra flavor.  the best part is definitely the <mark>Fried Egg</mark> that sits on top.  who can resist the egg yolk just running all over the kimchi slaw and the beef patty??\n\nout of all the fries, i liked the steak cut fries the most.  crunchy exterior with a creamy potato center.  <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were great as well.  the shoestring fries were a little stale to me.\n\nnow, with shakes as part of its name, we knew we had to try a few of their shakes and ended up getting the black cow float and the frozen grasshopper.  black cow float is a fun and somewhat nostalgic shake since it is more like a coke flat with the ice cream rather than a true shake.  it even comes with pop rocks!  the frozen grasshopper is a must for any mint chocolate fans.  smooth creamy minty frozen goodness.  for both shakes, we could taste the alcohol but it was pretty well masked!\n\nthey also have a bunch of beers on draft.  <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> triple karmeliet is a good one!\n\nprice-wise, it is pricey.  our burgers were around $18, with shakes at $11.  the price should reflect great service but i found the service a bit lacking.  our waitress only came to check on us twice and it took awhile to get her attention for the check as well.\n\nafter our meal, i can see why so many people like <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> at holsteins.  can't wait till the next time to try our other burgers!",

            "first thing, that catches your eye while wondering around the fabulous cosmopolitan hotel is this restaurant. at first look, it might be just another trendy bar with cute graffiti d\\u00e9cor (happy looking cows and chickens with smiles on their faces) but step in and look a little closer and you will realize that yes, this is a bar/lounge in the front but in the back it is a full fledged running restaurant with tables and table-booths! \n\nwe decided to stop by and try this place out before we left vegas (le sigh it is always hard to part with such an awesome city). the hostess were very sweet and little ditsy but heck they made us laugh! \nwe were seated right away which was impressive at almost 5:30pm on a weekday. the lounge/bar area was busy and so was the restaurant. \nwe settled into our table-booth, which was comfortable even though we were sandwich in-between, two other parties, we were handed our menus. this place has almost everything you could ask for:\n\nshakes (bam -boozled shakes)\nipa's\nbeer\nwine\none of a kind cocktails\n\nbut what i liked most was the free tin of freshly popped popcorn they bring to your table along with large ketchup and mustard bottles. who knew that ketchup or mustard would taste so good on popcorn!\n\nall their burgers are made to order and are fresh, natural with organic ingredients!\n\nwith so many options on their menu, it was hard to choose just one burger. \n\ni decided on the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>- no bun, kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips, 1000 island dressing\n\ni have to admit i was never the kind if girl to put potato chips or even fries on my burgers. i use to watch my friends do it and think it probably tastes weird! but screw that though i told myself i'm going in!\n\nafter ordering, it does take awhile and patience is a total virtue, that is when people watching takes place! and believe me it is a fun place to watch all the out of water tourists!  one guy was seated at a table next to us and was told he could not have his large hurricane glass at the table. you would have thought he was told that there was no strip clubs in vegas! he tried to tell the hostess that he was not going to drink it, not believing him she told him that she would hold it up at the front for him. still the look on his face was priceless!\n\nour burgers came out larger than life (or maybe that was my hunger talking) i had to try some of minh's <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> (which were delicious) i could have ate them all except i was given the \"eye\" so i swiped two more and went back to my burger! \n\nit was the perfect burger, cheesy with just the right amount of dressing and chips! <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was wonderful, full of flavor not a dry bite at all!\n\nbe warned their burgers do fill you up fast, even though i opted not to have the bun i got full half way through! i forced myself to finish this epic burger, which i am 50/50 that i did. 50% happy because it was yummy, the other 50% was left being uncomfortable for a while as my burger settled in my tummy! \n\nservice was great, and the prices were decent for being on the strip!",

            "i had to write an update to my review of holstein's because it was even better the second time around!  everything from start to finish was amazing, and we ordered a lot of stuff.  even the complimentary popcorn tasted great and was not as over saturated with oil as my first visit here.  what really stole the show for me though was <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger.  it was the best thing that i ate in vegas during my most recent visit, and i am salivating just thinking about it as i write this review.  i also shared sides of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, and <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> with my wife, and i loved them all.  i was so glad that we came back to eat at holstein's again when we were in las vegas, because it was my favorite meal of our trip.  i can't wait to come back here again soon!",

            "this is a pretty good burger place, but it's far from the best.\n\ntheir interesting combinations makes this place better, not the meat. i really enjoyed my kobe burger with bacon what not, aka the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>. the bun was nice. but the meat was slightly above average. not great, but pretty good.\n\nthe <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were decent too. nothing special, but good.",

            "ehhhhhh....that's how this gets summed up. nothing special and when you mix it with a waiter who seems unengaged - the whole experience goes downhill. \n\nthere was a group of us - as usual we all order something different and then share or share our experience. the entire table was underwhelmed. the red velvet bamboozled shake was the highlight! of course it's something they're known for so we had to try..and it didn't dissapoint.  \n\nwe had a teriyaki burger, mushroom burger, classic burger, salad, pork sliders - a variety of options. nothing overwhelming. the fries- squished into a silver bucket that just became soggy - pull one out and they com out in a group they were so tightly packed. had to upgrade to the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> and, well 5 showed up in another silver bucket...over cooked and tasteless.  we all shared a salad which was great, but not what you come here for. \n\ndefinitely not a \"gotta try it\" recommendation from me.",

            "ironically enough, i've raved endlessly about how awesome the cosmo is and yet i didn't even come here for the first time until earlier this year.  then my friend said, you know, you should really go to holsteins and try their asian burger because it's friggin awesome.  well, i just happened to be in the cosmo without having eaten a meal all day.  and i love burgers, so why the hell not?\n\nthree trips later, this spot has reached rare territory for me: mandatory trip every time i go to vegas (which seems to happen at least once a month, so this is going to be a very fruitful partnership!).  on an overall basis, top 10 burgers lifetime.  generally, the flavors of each burger and balanced very well.  nothing is overpowering the meat, which is of excellent quality.  the ingredients they use are fresh.\n\nas for <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> themselves?  the aforementioned asian burger, aka <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>, was definitely something quite unique.  crispy yam, a massive tempura-fried avocado, and kobe beef?  i just want to eat it again, but i feel like i need to try all the other burgers on the menu too.  well, that would have to be the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>.  and pretty much, you had me at <mark>Foie Gras</mark> on a burger.  last burger i've had was <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>.  while not on the same level as the previous two, i was not disappointed whatsoever.  just look at the dripping cheese on that picture i posted on it, how can you not fall in love with it?\n\nother items...where else can i get country fried bacon?  deep fried bacon?  seriously, stop tempting my heart!  the fries are ok, certainly get the job done.  <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> are fried perfectly, it's worth it to get them as as sub.\n\neven for the standard vegas premium for pricing, it's not obscenely outrageous.  in fact, it's almost impossible to find anything on the strip that is even remotely good value for money.  simply put, holsteins is awesome food in an awesome hotel.  and it is perfectly placed...came here once after raging all day at marquee dayclub.  could not have been a better post-partying meal, ever!", 
            "with the caveat that i didn't have a burger the two times i was here (but tried a number of apps and shakes), this place is typical for an eatery at a big vegas hotel - adequate, never a bad meal, but you will never be blown away in any fashion (my humble person opinion - every meal in vegas at a high end hotel is basically just a facsimile of the better version you can get at the restaurant's socal or ny location).\n\ni came here twice on a recent bachelor party.  once for milkshakes, and once for apps before our flight home.  the (boozy) milkshakes were very good.  i had the \"<mark>The Fat Boy</mark>\" (uv candy bar vodka, reese's, pretzels, sprinkles, chocolate-caramel popcorn).  a friend had the vegan maple pecan shake (almond milk 'ice cream', jack daniel's, spiced pecans, maple caramel sauce).  both were delicious, although if you are really in the mood for something sweet and creamy, the <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark> probably won't hit the spot (the sort of \"earthy\" taste of the maple and almonds doesn't give you the same satisfaction as real ice cream).  <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> was barely detectable, however (i would've liked at least just a little taste, to know i was drinking something alcoholic).\n\nthe next day we came back for <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, chicken fingers, <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark>, and surf and turf quesadillas.  i had a bloody mary, which was good, but after three days of drinking, the shrimp on top was not appetizing.  the apps were all meh - not bad, but not great.  i was expecting something more from the \"southern fried\" chicken fingers, but they basically tasted like something i could get from roy rogers.  dip was good, but again, didn't really taste fresh made or have that \"pop\" i was expecting when i read the menu description.\n\nwe sat in the front every time we came here, so i can't comment on the rear seating area, but i will say this - there is incredibly loud music with a heavy bass beat that is just not palatable.  \n\nall told, try the shakes.  maybe try <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> (can't comment directly, but i wouldn't be optimistic based on the other food).  apps are basically tgi friday's quality.", 
            "after reading a bunch of reviews and having holstein's bookmarked for a long time, we finally decided to hit it for lunch. i like the decor with the weird art and they also have a bunch of growlers on display which they sale too. it's a lot smaller inside then i thought and for some reason, i thought the seats were super uncomfortable. \n\nanyway, i went with <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> and my wife went with an urth burger substituted with beef instead of a veggie patty. that's one cool thing...they will let you do pretty much anything you want with <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, mix & match or whatever. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> itself is juicy but pretty plain in flavor. both burgers had a good amount of toppings but since the meat is so plain, it's all you can taste. my burger did have a tempura avocado on it though and that on it's own was killer!\n\nfor the price, i really expected more. they up-charge $2 to swap your fries for <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> or <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and neither of those were worth that. we also got a <mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> shake that seems to be really popular...it was ok but $11 is crazy especially since we ordered it \"virgin\". all in all, everything was just ok and the service wasn't terrible but i won't be rushing back anytime soon.",

            "pretty good place located in the cosmopolitan for a great tasting burger. while i don't believe it's at the same level as burgr by gordon ramsey in planet hollywood, they still offer delicious burgers and shakes, nonetheless, and should definitely be given a shot!\n\nthe place -\nas i mentioned, holstein's is located in the cosmopolitan and is centrally located with everything else. it's fairly easy to find and doesn't require a great deal of navigation. casino's in vegas can tend to be very large and trying to find a restaurant within one is a challenge within itself, but holstein's wasn't too hard to spot. at first glance, the place itself looks like a glorified cafe as the restaurant is very open in terms of people on the outside of the restaurant being able to look in. the decor is pretty modern, the bar is a pretty good size, and there's also, what seemed to be an impromptu, lounge area right in front of the bar for people to come in, sit on couches and socialize while still being able to enjoy the menu and the drinks. the lounge being right in front of the bar didn't look all that comfortable and appealing; however, with the right group of people and the right amount of drinks, i'm sure it would be fine for most haha. because i sat at the bar, i didn't get a chance to see the rest of the restaurant; however, the kitchen looks to be exposed so that people can look in on the action going on at the back of the house and, as a customer, that's always interesting and nice to see. not too bad, holstein's.\n**** 4/5 stars ****\n\nthe service -\ni was in vegas for a conference and i came to holstein's right after the last session ended, which was around 5:00pm or so on a thursday. there, unfortunately, was no hostess to greet me; however, i chalk that up to them being particularly busy and probably running around. no biggie on my end as i was gonna end up sitting at the bar anyways, which i did; however, if i was a party hoping to get a table, having no hostess at the front would certainly make me question. i found an open seat at the bar and immediately by one of the most friendliest faces i've seen during my visit in vegas. she was entertaining, down to earth, willing to talk with everyone at the bar, and wasn't afraid to razzle folks to try and get them to smile, which i didn't mind at all. the great service continued throughout with her making sure i was taken care of and when she had to leave for the day she made every effort to make sure i was ok and gave the next bartender updates on all her guests, which is always nice to see rather than someone leaving the next person in the dark. great service, holstein's and shout out to bridgot for making my trip to holstein's wonderful!!\n***** 5/5 stars *****\n\nthe food -\njust like any other of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> joints located in vegas, there are many different options to choose from. each burger has its own signature ingredient and level of appeal for everyone. with that being said, it'll be pretty difficult for someone to not find a burger that sounds delicious as there are many different burgers to indulge in. i settled for the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> (see picture) and decided to have that served with some <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> instead of fries. first, the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. definitely not the best <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> i've had in my life as you can probably tell they just came from a bag in the freezer; however, it got the job done and satisfied my craving for them. the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>, which is kobe beef, cheddar cheese, 1000 island dressing, and potato chips (yes...potato chips....don't lie and say you never put potato chips in your cold cut sandwiches as a kid....i don't care who you are, everyone did that and you would swear it was the best thing ever! haha). <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was perfectly cooked, the cheddar cheese and 1000 island dressing gave it that zest and creaminess it needed and then finally, the homemade potato chips, as it did in cold cut sandwiches, gave that textural difference and crunchiness that we always desire in our food. the only gripe i have about the potato chips is that there was no flavor to them, it was literally just there for the crunch, i wish they would've seasoned them with something to make it pop more. other than that, i was fairly satisfied with my selection. good job, holstein's.\n**** 4/5 stars ****\n\noverall -\nlike i said, after comparing <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> that i've had from burgr to holstein's, i would definitely choose burgr; however, if you happen to be in the cosmo and the mood for having a burger strikes you, this place can definitely deliver. i look forward to coming back and trying out the other options like the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger, but all in all, not too shabby holstein's! thanks!",

            "upon hearing more bad than good reviews regarding this eatery, i decided that it wasn't worth the risk of a potentially bad meal. however, since a large group of us were already on property tonight, it was the best choice for a relatively inexpensive dinner. \n\ni attempted to make a reservation via opentable, but it stated that there were no reservations remaining for the evening. then i called. the hostess explained that they are no longer taking reservations for the evening, but she would be happy to get us a table when we arrived and that there was a \"short\" wait for less than 30 minutes. since we were not physically at the restaurant, we could not put our name on the list. humph. anyway, we get to the restaurant and are given a 30-35 minute wait for our group of nine. a bit longer than i enjoy waiting, but it worked out well - we received our table within 10 minutes (and via text message; very convenient)!\n\nmost of us decided on selections from the \"big buns\" category (good ol' burgers and fries). i had a hard time choosing between a couple of their burgers, but i'm very pleased that our server directed me to their most popular selection - the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" ($17.50). dry aged beef sirloin burger with <mark>Smoked Bacon</mark>, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli. holy tastebuds. that first bite was euphoric. i can't even describe it, but i'll always remember how i felt - amazing. i was raving to everyone at the table and the two people that tasted my burger affirmed my praise, as well as stating that it was much better than <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> they were eating (memphis burger - very tasty - and <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> - shrug). i've had other goat cheese-arugula-tomato burgers and this one does it much better. because the goat cheese is blended with cheddar (haven't quite wrapped my head around this yet lol), it isn't too pungent and all the other flavors were so well balanced. get the <mark>Gold Standard</mark>; medium rare, of course. really, really good.\n\nwith your \"big buns\" order, you have a choice of regular fries, side salad, or a $2 upgrade for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> or thick cut <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. i got their regular fries and they were really tasty and well cooked. i also tried the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> ($9) - perfect dill spears with good crispy exterior, served with an herb-caper mayo - and a strawberry milkshake ($8) - really creamy, delicious strawberry flavor. overall, all the food was great!\n\nour server was really nice and very helpful, however, we received only one visit between receiving our food and finishing our meal, so most of our water glasses weren't refilled. then we found ourselves having to wave our arms for attention. i figured the servers must be overwhelmed, but it seems that the restaurant is always busy and it's as if no one has figured out how to properly handle the capacity of customers.\n\ni'm curious as to why people have been so unhappy with holsteins, but i can guess. based on our experience prior to and during our dinner, i'm sure they have their off days or the service may be even less attentive than it was today. hopefully i won't have to experience any of those things during future visits or even better, that it'll improve!", 
            "thought we would have to wait considering it was nye and lunch time, but surprisingly the restaurant was bigger than expected and we were seated for 8 right away.  the server came over and took our drink orders and told us the specials right away.\n\nto start we ordered the pork sliders and pork belly buns.. someone loves pork!  they were both pretty good.  the pork sliders had an asian twist with cilantro and peanut sauce.  it was a good combination.  the pork belly buns were good and tasty, but a little too fatty for my tasting.  i took a bite and it was all fat. no meat at all.  it was seasoned well, but i didn't like the fat texture.  overall the appetizers were good.  we also ordered amazing <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> that were stacked really high.  they were so crispy and so good. \n\ni ordered <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger cooked medium.  it was delicious and i think i could've eaten it all myself, but i shared it.  it came with steak fried which were thick but crispy.  \n\nother people ordered a salad which looked good, but didn't taste good.  (but who orders a salad at a burger joint?) it was a waste if money because it costs doubled for the salad compared to my burger.  i'm sure they will never order a salad at a burger joint ever again. \n\nservice was good and they gave us popcorn as he delivered everyone water.  i wanted to ask when the movie started.  the popcorn was good.  \n\nsome people in my group didn't like it, but i didn't order a salad at a burger joint so i really liked my burger.  will definitely go back to try a shake with my burger.",

            "i was skeptical in trying holsteins because of the mixed reviews, but after eating at gordon ramsay's burgr so much, i wanted a different burger place. originally we came here around midnight fri to try the place, but were told they stopped serving their regular menu at 11pm. they offered a late night menu instead which were basically just appetizers (no burgers/shakes). no biggie, we came back the next day after a fabulous time at marquee's dayclub...spoiler alert: we also came back the next day before we left on the drive back home because it was sooo good!!\n\nthe decor is so cute here w/ the anime pig wall posters and the theme totally matched w/ the cosmopolitan. our server made great recommendations for us & started us off w/ the complimentary small bucket of lightly salt/sweet popcorn. my bf killed that thing, talk about drunk munchies\n\nbamboozled shakes:\n<mark>Drunken Monkey</mark> - i added toasted coconut marshmallow to it and this was one damn good shake! the description/ingredients seemed so minimal, yet the shake tasted so amazing. it was like a cookies n cream reese's <mark>Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake</mark>. this was my fav out of all the other shakes. \n\ntiramisu - they had me at mascarpone ice cream. i love mascarpone, but you could barely taste it in this shake. this tasted like a chocolate shake, not much espresso/coffee flavor. \n\nbanana creme pie - my bf go this 'cause he loves bananas and i would say this was my 2nd fav shake. it tastes exactly like a banana cream pie, but in shake form w/ chocolate. i liked that they topped it w/ white chocolate covered bananas.\n\nthe shakes are big enough to share, but trust me you won't want to. i like that you get a full glass shake and the extras are in the metal mixing cup so you can eat it w/ a spoon (yum!) i also like that their shakes all were thick & creamy!\n\napps:\nsurf 'n turf quesadilla - delish my favorite app! this ain't no taco bell quesadilla. it was crunchy and not oily at all. the lobster, steak and manchego cheese inside all just melted in your mouth and is bursting w/ flavor. must order!!\n\nsoft shell crab bruschetta - for a burger place, their presentation of these apps were tapas style and as nice as any fancy steakhouse. the softshell crab was on top of a thick cut brioche bread, the aioli and tomato salad made the app refreshing\n\ncrispy calamari - big enough portion to share, i couldn't stop dunking these rings in the sweet chili sauce. i like that they don't overbread the calamari rings\n\nmaine lobster roll - pricey for this, but there were generous amount of lobster. \n\ncrispy pork belly bun - tasted better than the ones at ramsay's burgr. the steamed buns weren't dry & sauce was spot on\n\nburgers:\n<mark>The Rising Sun</mark> w/ <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>(normally comes w/ fries, but paid $2 to upgrade) - the best burger ever!! most asian fusion burgers get overpowered by the sauce, but not here. it didn't taste like an ordinary overly sweet typical terriyaki burger. everything was perfect about this burger, that first bite was so orgasmic. this is what a burger should taste like! the whole brioche bun was toasted to perfection. i am not sure how they did it, but the top part of the bun and inside had a nice toast crisp to it. the tempura avocado was nice, added a different texture. you could taste each item in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and they all blended well together. the kobe beef patty was cooked medium, yet it was juicy and had a nice pink to it. <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were the best we've had as well & worth the upgrade! they were thick, fried, fresh, and crispy, no soggy oiliness at all. make sure to ask for buttermilk ranch to dip the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> in!! it tastes so divine\n\nfun-ghi on wheat bun w/ salad ($2 extra) - healthy combo huh? my 2nd fav burger, but my bf preferred this over <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> because he prefers the truffle flavor. again, patty was cooked perfect along w/ toasted wheat bun. i actually prefer the regular bun's flavor although the wheat bun was toasted the same way as the regular brioche bun. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> wasn't smothered in mayo thank god! the gruyere helped accentuate the truffle portabella & caramelized onions. salad was a generous portion of mixed greens & the dressing was tangy yet sweet & light (sort of like a coleslaw dressing w/ lemon). the only negative is that we added a <mark>Fried Egg</mark> to <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, but there was no runny yolk...the egg was fully cooked :(\n\n<mark>Gold Standard</mark> w/ <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>- everyone kept talkin about this burger, but we thought it paled in comparison to <mark>The Rising Sun</mark>. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were bomb!\n\ni would have to say that holstein's outranks ramsay's burgr. we were so pleased w/ our meal that we sent compliments to the chef. we were lucky that both days we ate here, the executive chef was working. the food comes out fast and you will leave happily stuffed. don't forget to give them your identity player's card for points!\n\nnote: try and get a girl server. the first day we had a girl and she was totally on top of it. the 2nd day, we had a guy and he seemed easily overwhelmed", 
            "as a vegas local, i love trying new places... i took stars away mainly for service. i booked a reservation for 2 at 8:15.. showed up a bit earlier and they quickly seated us. i asked for a water with lemon and a few moments to look over the menu. water came back with no lemon. i got a very weird vibe from our waitress, like we annoyed her. i ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> medium rare with american cheese and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. my burger came back and when i cut <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> in half.. blood came out of the patty.. definitely not medium rare, this was rare beyond belief. since i was starving i did not want to make a commotion and send it back. despite the patty being undercooked, the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were delicious. my date had <mark>French Fries</mark> and those were so good. if this review was strictly based on food i would give it 4 stars, minus one for the undercooked beef patty. the portions are enough to fill you up, and it had a casual atmosphere. i will go back, probably just ask for a medium cooked hamburger instead.\n\n**reading other reviews, we did not get the complimentary popcorn either, that's a little disappointing.", 
            "i checked in at holstein's yesterday with my husband, we usually do a date/day or night at least once i week, we are locals so we usually don't go to the strip much. i had the chicken fingers and natural cut fries, and my hubby had a burger and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>.. the fingers were very good( i am a super picky eater). my hubby was making the hmm hmm sound the whole time he are and the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were fried perfectly and they didn't fall apart and leave you just eating the onion. the two huge issues i had were with our bartender/ waitress who was nice and attentive but a little to much with my husband... it was like she took care of my needs as a customer but engage in convo with him, kept her eyes on him and when my hubby and i shared an inside joke that we shared, you told me.... be nice..really?? like i said we are locals and i have been a waitress, cocktail server and a blackjack dealer and i know the whole \" flirt a little\" deal but not with someone's husband. we both had our wedding rings on and we were affectionate. i think she should be careful with that, i was kinda taken aback.. we ate, food was good but i will never go back to that restaurant for that reason.",

            "as far as vegas goes, there was nothing crazy over the top, indulgent, or extravagant about this restaurant.  it was a little cooler than your per usual diner in your city.  the prices were as can be expected from vegas, so upward of $15 for a burger.  i ordered a turkey burger which was cooked really, really well!  usually you think turkey burger and you think it'll be a super dry hockey puck.  not here.  the meat was flavorful and juicy. yes, i said juicy!  i would definitely come back for this burger again.  the spicy <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> sauce was misleading and wasn't that great.  the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> and fries were crispy and flavorful though.  all in all, a solid spot to get a decent burger.  it beats out all the fast dining restaurants that are scattered about on the strip for sure!",

            "i really liked this place. got a strawberry shake, and it reminded me of red robin's shakes which i love. also, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were delicious and surprisingly not too oily compared to other gourmet burgers. the one thing you have to try is the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. i hate when onions are too large in <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, but holsteins does it right with the thin onion strips and delicious breading.\n\nmy only complaint is the wait time. the first time we went, they told us it was a 30-40 minute wait for our food no matter what we ordered. food never takes that long to come out even in a steakhouse. we got lucky the second time we went because the waiter told us it was a 30-40 minute wait, noticed we were in a rush, and ended up pulling strings and got our food out in 10 minutes, so kudos to service!", 
            "to top off a successfull vegas trip , we came to holsteins hungry and anxious after seeing all the solid reviews. located right across the entrance to marquee, it's an all too familiar location, but unfortunately a location i probably won't return to.\n\nupon walking in, we were asked whether we wanted bar or table seating. the hostess literally stated that if we wanted a table, it would mean she would \"have to\" walk us over. she made it sound like we were causing the biggest inconvenience in the world to her if we didn't sit at the bar. rude. we still went for a table, and she pointed us to another waitress who would take us. a horrible system.\n\nit took 10 minutes to have a waiter even greet us after sitting down. another 35 passed before we became intolerably grumpy and impatient, flagging down our waiter to see what was going on. two burgers, one of which was rare, should not take 40 minutes to make. after a long day, 5 minutes was very agonizing, and our burgers finally came out.\n\n- \"meat ball\" burger ($15): beef, pork, veal, pecorino & provol<mark>One <mark>Two Dollar Cheese</mark></mark>, basil walnut pesto and arugula on herb foccacia roll. the meat concoction was great, but it lacked flavor or marination. of course, i loved all the cheese, but you could barely taste the walnut pesto. it could use some marinara sauce. not the best choice here.\n\n- <mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark> ($17): beef patty, truffled marinated portabella mushroom, caramelized onion, gruyere, maro & frisee.  this one was much better and was wonderfully crafted. there was plenty of gruyere, you could taste the truffle oil in the mushroom, and all ingredients balanced well with each other. a superb burger indeed. \n\nfries with one burger, <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> with the other. both were good quality. the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> weren't too deeply fried and maintained a nice crunch.\n\n- banana cream pie shake ($13): bananas, vanilla custard, nilla wafers, caramel, creme de banane, licor 43 and white chocolate covered banana. absolutely delicious. although it was technically two servings, a shake should not be worth as much as a burger. also, there was barely any hint of alcohol in here. despite this, i sipped it down to the last delicious drop.\n\nafter finishing our meal, it took another 20 minutes to hunt down a different waiter because ours kept ignoring us. the restaurant was less than half full and there was plenty of staff, so service like this is unacceptable. even the table next to us noted how long our order was taking. \n\noverpriced, extremely slow, but quite a treat if you get the right burger.",

(for further reading: fried butter)\n\nthe <mark>Thai Steak Salad</mark> was barely average: grilled steak, tomato, cucumber, red onion, romaine lettuce, green papaya, mint, cilantro, roasted peanuts, tossed in a sweet-chili vinaigrette. the steak strips were substantial, but completely dry and tough, and i usually expect a sweeter sauce with my \"asian\" salads, but the sweet-chili vinaigrette was more vinaigrette than sweet or chili.\n\nthe regular fries & the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were mediocre at best, but the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were crisp, firm, and delicious.\n\nuseful: everything is super salty. everything. water will get you nowhere. my lips continually shriveled up from beginning to end no matter what i was eating. i was re-applying moisturizing lip balm like it was the air i breathe. i may try to ask for \"less salt\" if i ever go back!", 
            "i visited on a thursday evening with coworkers after an all day tax conference. needless to say, we were all ready to get our drink on, but being with <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>, (sort of) reigned it in. to three rather than four vodka cocktails that is. work's paying right? we got an assortment of dishes, and there was no complaints. everything was pretty much awesome, particularly the ahi tuna and turkey tom sliders - def get the turkey tom yum! my boss ordered them and i ate three of the five because he is annoying. my green pasture salad was pretty boring as one would expect and the pork street taco apps and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> (huge) were phenomenal. i ended up going with a vodka soda fas mentioned and they were pouring those suckers stiff! i'd like to say thank you for that.  my only regret is i did not get the spiked grasshopper milkshake. but it's nice to have a goal now. can't wait to hit this place up the next time i am in vegas!", 
            "holsteins, has been around during this whole burger time fad and i've dinned their quite a few times.  maybe <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> fad has wore off on me, but it was just ok. $15 for a plain burger, it should have been awesome, to me and my guest it had a odd, kind of funny taste. like it was old.   it looked great on the plate, burger was nice and thick, wasn't dry, condiments seemed fresh.  my guest really like the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, but i found they had too much bread.   crunchy and crisp, but the onion to bread ratio was off.  for only an extra $2, for the rings, that's not bad. there shakes are always good.  to me a burger bar is about that piece of meat, the stuff on top should compliment it. it's all about burger, which tasted bad. sorry holsteins, i love your location, decor and service. you just have to fix what's between the bun.", 
            "although i absolutely hate the cosmopolitan, i was really happy to find this place. every single time i visit the cosmopolitan i have a horrible experience. whether it's the disgraceful customer service, the trashy clientele, the pathetic excuse for pool attendants-- it all sucks. so when my cousin asked us to meet her and her parents here, i was crazy skeptical. i was honestly just gonna grab a coke and eat somewhere else later. i'm so glad i didn't. i had the \"<mark>Gold Standard</mark>\" burger with <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> and it was, by far, the best burger i've ever had. my mom had <mark>The Classic</mark> with regular fries and we both spilt an order of the <mark>Fried Pickles</mark> (which were also, the best i've ever had). for both of us the check came out to $63. i would have paid twice that much for a burger of that quality. seriously just amazing. if you love a good in-n-out burger, you'll love this place. they put \"umami burger\" to shame and need to be in a category all to themselves. i can't wait to eat here again.", 
            "i went into holsteins with high expectations, and unfortunately was let down. the service was quite slow for 6 people and the food was underwhelming.  we each ordered burgers, but i didn't think anything was special about it.  i also had <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>.   i was a bit annoyed when i asked if i could have half <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, and half fries.  the waiter replied \"we won't customize anything here.  even if you wanted your burger cut in half, we would just give you a knife.\"\n\nthat for me makes me give holsteins 3 stars.  i had the grass hopper milk shake as well (with an extra shot).  the problem with service being so slow, was that by the time the food came, i had pretty much finished the milk shake and was quite full.\n\noverall, holsteins is not very memorable, and i would rather go to burgr or burgar bar.  there clearly was a reason why hosteins had no wait, and the other burger places did.", 
            "popular casual dining spot in the cosmopolitan hotel.\n\ncame here since hubby raved about their burgers here from a previous trip without me, so we stopped here for lunch. kid friendly place.\n\nhuge selection of milkshakes that you can order with or without alcohol - i had the pecan turtle one... it probably has as many calories and fat as what i ate for the rest of the day, but definitely a nice treat. rich creamy ice cream with all the goodness of pecans and chocolate as well! it's about $4 less than the posted price if you order one without alcohol.\n\ntheir burger selection is impressive. i sampled hubby's classic <mark>Gold Standard</mark> and thought it tasted good. i had the funghi burger and the tastes went well together with a touch of truffle, but it was a bit too greasy for my liking.\n\ndelicious <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>! average fries.\n\ngood service and decent burgers but i thought it was a bit expensive for lunch (about $30 pp).", 
            "incredibly good. a short way into our burgers (longhorn burger for me with brisket, cole slaw and pickles; a mushroom and gruyere burger for david) we said, wow, these are possibly better than any place except umami burger. as the meal went on, we decided holsteins was giving even the venerable umami hatch green chili burger a run for its money. it was that good. i got the longhorn burger because i love bbq, even though i thought the idea of brisket on a burger was silly. it wasn't. the brisket was sliced thin, and was a bit crisp - almost like a super delicious bacon. and best of all, the bbq sauce was not cloyingly sweet. a minor criticism, i thought the cole slaw disappeared and the pickles were too dominant - maybe the quantities need adjusting. david was similarly pleased with his burger, every ingredient was distinct and very tasty especially the mushrooms. one of us got fries and the other <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, both were good. service was first rate. we didn't try the shakes. we were very impressed.", 
            "surprisingly good burgers- then again, the restaurants at the cosmo are generally of a high standard in the first place so it stands to reason that this one would be as well. \n\nin addition to burgers, menu includes shakes (duh), various appetizers, salads, and sliders. note that shakes are available in regular as well as alcoholic versions.  ironically, i found that the beer menu available here was more impressive than that found at b&b: burgers and beer.\n\n<mark>The Fun-Ghi</mark>: beef patty topped w/ forest mushrooms, caramelized onion, gruyere cheese, frisee, & truffle mayo. sorry anthony bourdain, but i'm on board the truffle appreciation train, and this is flipping delicious. would get this again, without hesitation.\n\nthe longhorn burger: beef patty topped with texas smoked beef brisket, whiskey barbeque sauce, coleslaw, and dill pickle. this was bf's choice and as a texan, i'm a bit more discerning about my brisket. a tasty choice, but not something i'd order again.\n\nappreciated that all burgers come with a side of fries- upgrade to <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> or <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> for a $2 charge. even given strip upcharges, felt pricing was fair for portion and quality given here. service at the bar was friendly, attentive, and helpful with suggestions for a good beer based on our drinking preferences.", 
            "this review will be based only on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. \n\nsince christmas day basically consists of my mom and my boyfriend, we decided to spend some time walking on the strip and grab lunch at holsteins.\n\ni ordered <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> ($16) which was ok - not terrible, but not something i'd order again either. it was a chicken breast burger with kettle chips (more like kettle crumbs), a pickled shallot (? .. it was something pink), lettuce, and tomato. in the description it listed garlic aioli which is why i leaned towards ordering that item, but i honestly really couldn't depict it in my bites.\n\nmi madre went with <mark>Captain Hook</mark> ($17) - a salmon burger with lettuce, tomato, the pickled pink stuff, and smoked salmon. that was much more worth the money and if i ever paid a visit again, that's probably what i would order. the salmon wasn't dry and the smoked salmon actually complemented very will with the grilled salmon filet, giving <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> a strong salmon kick.\n\nmy boyfriend went with the big fat greek ($17) - a burger basically with all the ingredients you'd find at a greek restaurant like lamb, feta, lettuce, tomato, and tatziki. that was pretty tasty as well if you don't mind a hint of gaminess from the lamb. <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> quite enjoyed it but said it didn't hit the spot like he hoped.\n\nthere were definitely other options i would've been keen on trying but the average pricing was $18 for all other types of burgers and i just don't care that much about burgers to spend close to $20. all comes with a small personal-sized bucket of fries or you could sub it for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> or <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> for an extra $2.\n\nthe bill came out to be $70 after taxes and tip... that's pretty rough in my opinion but i guess i shouldn't expect any less from restaurants on the strip. \n\nwould i come here again? sure if my out-of-town friends dragged me. as for the shakes, i think they are definitely worth a try since some of the concoctions are pretty interesting and unique (not to mention it also includes liquor) if you don't mind spending the extra $13. as for me, a non-drinker, i'll just stick to off-strip joints for any burger cravings...",

            "came in with high expectations for the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>.  was talked out of ordering it medium rare to medium.  came out all brown and dry.  the <mark>Foie Gras</mark> was good and was the only part that kept it somewhat moist  for $32 had much higher expectations.  black & white malt shake was great as was the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>.  the fungi burger was much better than the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>.  \n\nwe had two couples, both ordered a <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>.  we ate the evidence but the manager refunded the other as the evidence was not eaten.  at any rate $32 burger should have higher quality control out of the gate.", 
            "good service, good staff, good ambiance, sub par burgers. \n\nwe ate here last night (sept 2015) and our burgers were really unimpressive. i ordered the <mark>Billionaire Burger</mark>, which is their priciest burger (double the price of the others) the kobe beef patty i ordered medium rare but it was really dry and unimpressive, seemed like bland ground beef. my girlfriend ordered the nom nom which is also kobe beef, her's was cooked pink (as mine should have been) but was still pretty dry & unimpressive overall. i probably should have sent back my burger since it was clearly overcooked, but we were with another couple and i hate to be the guy who sends back food and then my food comes out like 15 min after everyone is already done eating. \n\nas a note, i still ate the entire burger, it wasn't inedible at all. my sentiment is when you're paying $32 for a hamburger you'd hope they'd nail it and impress. maybe i had too high hopes for the restaurant after hearing that it was better than umami burger. \n\nfries and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were great, as were our beers, and our server was very nice & attentive. and actually the lobster truffle mac & cheese wasn't amazing either. really those burgers were the real issue, if it's a burger restaurant that's a major flaw.", 
            "if the prices were lower i would give it 4 stars. i give it 3 because of the price compared to the quality of the food. the food wasn't bad, it was average. as such, i don't expect an average burger to be $15-$17. \nas for the ambiance- very cute and trendy. front half is loud and smokey, back half is quiet and intimate. take your pick. \n\nthey also serve a popcorn at your table. i knew it tasted familiar but couldn't put my finger on it...it was pizza flavored popcorn. interesting. \nwe ordered the following: \n1. <mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark>- it was ok. we ordered some ranch to go with it and it made it much better. i would recommend that. \n2. <mark>El Caliente</mark> burger- i didn't have it, but i was told it was excellent by my dinner companion. no real feedback to offer. \n3. fun-ghi burger- it lacked all of the flavor i was expecting it to have. that was a bummer. it wasn't bad, it was just basic. for $18 i expect better than basic and a lot more flavor. the beef was a good selection, it was cooked perfectly at medium, it just lacked flavor.\n4. fries were ok\n5. <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> with panko break crumbs were good but also lacked flavor\n\n\nlike i said if it weren't pricey i'd give it 4 but i expect an $18 burger to be much more favorable. with all of the options for good food in vegas i wouldn't go back.", 
            "some people only go for half-steins.  not me though.  i say you gotta go holstein's or nothing at all.  i feel light-headed.\n\nfinal verdict: holstein's is pretty good and i enjoyed it.\n\nservice was excellent.  our waiter, [name removed for legal reasons], was always on top of checking up on us and making sure we were enjoying our food.\n\nfood breakdown:\n\n-popcorn: i didn't know you got this automatically, or i would have mentally prepared myself.  it's ok.  it's popcorn...you gotta do reeaaallly well to impress me with popcorn.\n\n-<mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>: good, but a mixed bag.  the first one i had was the prefect onion ring: perfect breading, a clean bite (no strings following you out), and perfectly crispy.  and while two of those never changed, i kept getting strings after that.  not a deal killer, but definitely not \"perfect\" throughout the meal.\n\n-fun-ghi burger: do you get it? fun-ghi?  i...i actually don't get it.  you should probably just call it the fungi burger...save everyone the trouble.  that being said this was honestly, without a doubt, the <mark>Best Of Las Vegas (7.2%) NV, USA</mark> of mushrooms on a burger i have ever had.  it had a delicious earthiness to it.  not my favorite burger of all time, but definitely my favorite mushroom-based burger.  that might sound like a small field...but it is.\n\n-<mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>: it must be for the kobe beef, but i find it funny that a burger with truffle mayo is cheaper than one with potato chips.  it was good, but i wasn't blown away.\n\n-fries: you get a lot of fries.\n\nnow i know everyone is waiting for me to get to the shakes...and by everyone i mean you, dale...but we didn't get one.\n\nfirst off, the regular, non-alcoholic shakes were basic and didn't seem worth the time.  second, i looked over the menu for the alcoholic shakes and every time i read the ingredient list all i could think about was the taste of straight alcohol and i lost my appetite for a shake.  is that my fault?  sure.  should i have even mentioned all this?  who's to say?  you?  i don't think so.  you don't own me.\n\nwill i be back?  perhaps.  i enjoyed it, though i wouldn't wait in a long line for it.  they just opened one nearby my house, though that one is just getting slammed for poor service so i don't know.\n\nalso, whoever did the art for the walls either worked for disney or learned a bit from their style.  i saw the 3-oval trick for the eyes, which works so well it's insane.", 
            "our party of 4 plus 2 infants was seated promptly. no one attended to us. we flagged down a server, erik who was not serving in our area but said he would take care of us. he did. above & beyond. i also told his manager about what an excellent job he did. the food was fine. tasty but not worth $20+ for a burger and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. i did enjoy the free glass of beer you get fr checking in. our friends had a black&white milkshake which they enjoyed. as for the ambience it's super loud and attracts loud people it seems. overall i would not return esp since there are so many other choices on the strip. thanks again erik!", 
            "holy cow!!! this place freaking rocks! <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger was one of the most delicious things that i have ever put in my mouth. the tempura avocado, the teriyaki glaze, the yam crunchy bits, the spicy mayo all combine to make a flavor delight in my mouth. the had bites of the nom nom and <mark>Gold Standard</mark> too. both were quite good but not quite as amazing. the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were crispy and <mark>The Fat Boy</mark> shakes were to die for. the coffee and doughnuts was oh so amazing! the caramel cheesecake was also delicious. this was one of my top meals in vegas. no one should even consider the other big name burger joints. this place blew them away.", 
            "located inside of the cosmopolitan hotel next their club, marquee.  i ordered their swiss mushroom burger which was really heavy but decent.  their burgers are a good size and taste ok.  not a lot of options with sides.  i like <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> as an alternative to regular fries but they didn't offer that.  i ordered their <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> just to try.  i was there with friends at around 1030-11pm.  there was loud music which i thought was coming from marquee but was actually an in-house dj.  it was very loud but i enjoyed it.  like a real club atmosphere with burgers.  someone from the kitchen came out and told me that they were out of <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> which was disappointing so i just got regular fries.  my sister ordered their pecan turtle shake at the recommendation of the waitress and it was sooooooo good.  i tried some and thought this was the best shake i've ever had...so delicious.  i decided after i got my burger (which took a decent amount of time to come to the table) that i would order another shake because it tasted so good.  the waitress told me that i couldn't order because the kitchen just closed.  that was understandable. most times the waitress would ask if you wanted to order anything else before the kitchen closed but this was a missed opportunity.  two stars off because i believe this was the reason that i didn't get <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>...probably because they had already closed their fryer and didn't or couldn't fire it up.  i've worked in a kitchen and i know how these things go.  as an employee i understand and as a customer i'm disappointed.  still, the milkshakes are enough to come back.", 
            "steak and kimchi quesadillas were <mark>The Fat Boy</mark>. cubano tacos were ok. <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were super tasty. fun atmosphere, ok service. oh, if you can get the black beans that come with the cubano tacos, do it. they were better than the tacos by far. ill take a bowl of those masterpieces.", 
            "amazing!! service and food was awesome! my husband and i shared <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, <mark>The Rising Sun</mark> burger, and the red velvet shake. holy smokes it was all delicious. i would go again tonight if my husband didn't want to go to the wicked spoon. the shake was one of the best i have ever had. never heard of adding vodka to a shake, but it added an amazing dimension. the beef in <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was also juicy and cooked to perfection. we had are ally great service too even though it was a really busy night. do yourself a favor and eat her. you won't regret it.", 
            "i ate here a couple times in the past and really loved it. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> are well cooked and covered in delicious toppings and the truffle fries were some some of the best i've ever had. went again last night and the truffle fries are gone! natural cut, sweet potato or <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> are all that's left. the fries used to be great and now they're only ok. the service was fast and friendly, <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was great, but the fries don't measure up anymore. you can't have a burger without fries, and it takes away from the meal when the fries are only mediocre.", 
            "holstein's was one of the first restaurants that my husband and i tried in las vegas and at the time, i remember being absolutely wow'ed. unfortunately, after living in the city for a few years and trying a lot of wonderful food that this city has to offer, we returned for a visit and i was less than impressed. \n\npreviously their burgers came sans fries and there were a few different fries that were offered. we tried truffle fries (i think...) and i was excited to try them again when we returned last night! unfortunately now the fries come on the side of your burger, and they don't offer anything other than regular, sweet potato and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> (which are just some lamely pedestrian offerings for a burger place on the strip). i tried the regular fries with my burger and was pretty unimpressed. in my opinion, if you are serving 15$ burgers you better be offering some pretty amazing fries to go with them. sadly, this was not the case.\n\ni tried the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> and it was really good. the meat was actually cooked the medium rare that i asked for, which i always appreciate. the cheddar was good, the 1000 island was a nice flavor, and the chips were fantastic. i would have much rather preferred a side of the chips (which tasted like they may have been made in house?) rather than the fries that i got with my burger! <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was huge, while the portion of fries wasn't insane, the size of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was! i couldn't even finish half of <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>. \n\nif you check in and order a burger they give you a free 12 oz of their house lager, which wasn't spectacular, but it's always nice to get something free for a yelp check in! it looked like they had a few rotating taps with craft brews, and they had a nice selection of bottled beer to offer! i really liked looking at their hard cider offerings, they even had a few that i hadn't tried before!\n\nthe service was very good, and it was incredibly fast. it was almost too fast, we probably could have sat and chatted a bit more. the restaurant wasn't busy at all, though.\n\nthe only reason i would be back would be to try one of their boozy shake flavors - they looked very interesting, and i'm bummed that i was too full to try one!", 
            "holsteins is an incredible burger joint in vegas and i would definitely recommend going there. \n\nmy friends and i were seated almost instantly. we pondered over the menu and struggled to pick our favorite burger because of all of the tasty options. i decided on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and i also got a free holsteins lager just for checking in on yelp! the beer came out quickly and it was a nice light lager similar to a light mexican beer. i tried not to finish it before <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> came out so i could enjoy them together. \n\nwhen my burger came out with the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, i took a bite and the flavors worked extremely well together. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was juicy and tasty, the cheese melted right on and the mushrooms and tomatoes topped it off. it took me a while to finish it as i tried to savor every bite. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were large and soft but still had a nice crisp to them. they were tasty but not incredible. my friends <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were amazing and i would definitely get those when i eat here again. \n\nholsteins is a very good burger place. the prices are a little bit high but it is in vegas so you can't really complain. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was incredibly cooked and i was very satisfied and full from the meal. overall a great place to grab a burger with your friends in vegas.", 
            "mmmmm, now that's a tasty burger, what was that called again?\n\na bit pricy for a burger, but it is the cosmo.\n\ndrinks at the bar, where we were not allowed to order a milkshake for one of our dining companions that does not imbibe alcohol was extremely annoying, but not as annoying as the gal that said it. attitude much? uh hello, this is a burger joint..\n\nanny who, food was good, fries are amazing, super yummy <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>, and that milkshake was flippin huge (when it finally arrived at the table)..\n\nignore the attitudes and enjoy the food..", 
            "with some great milk shakes, holstein's is a nice place to chill with friends but the sides are just okay.\n\nleaving somewhat unfulfilled from our day at the marquee dayclub, my friends and i decided to roll over to holstein's for some shakes.  in all honesty, the trip was mainly to satisfy our munchies and i am glad that the milkshakes, at least, were good.  it seems like a lot of other reviews rave about <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> which may be a reason why i was underwhelmed.  here are some of the things that we tried:\n\n<mark>Ahi Poke Tostadas</mark>- although beautifully presented, these bite size tostada pieces were just okay and i would not recommend.  sure there is some avocado aioli that goes well with the ahi but for me it was on the bland side.  the only source of heat came from the piece of jalapeno which was a little too strong of a flavor profile to enjoy the meat.\n\n<mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> - i can handle my spice, but it was slightly spicier than i would like and definitely required the dip to help with the heat.  if you are looking for something spicy, this would be it.\n\nnatural cut fries/<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> - these were cooked well but were nothing special.\n\n<mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> - their <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were probably one of the best i have had.  the coating was nice and crispy and inside was a hot well cooked piece of onion in the middle.  of all the sides, i would recommend these.\n\nmilkshakes - if there was another thing that i really enjoyed were the milkshakes  i had the black and white which was rich and creamy with a nice balance of chocolate and vanilla.  what i was surprised was that that they not only have the nicely presented milkshake in one glass and another cup with the leftover.  my friend also got the alcoholic ones and they are deceptive!  he got a major hangover afterwards so beware!\n\nanother plus here was the service.  my pretty big group of friends were seated pretty quickly and the waitress we had was super friendly and attentive even on a fairly busy day.  holstein's is located on the floor with most of the restaurant.\n\noverall, holstein's has okay food but has nice milkshakes that are worth trying if that's what you are in the mood for.  however, i am willing to come back to try their burgers.", 
            "holstein's was soooo good. i mean the place was just a greta atmosphere for a very casual experience inside of the best hotels on the strip. \n\nitems we had for appetizers: \n-<mark>Buffalo Chicken Dip</mark> (spicier than normal)\n-<mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> (a must!)\n-philly cheese steak <mark>'Philly' Egg Rolls</mark> (heavenly)\n-buff wings (super super spicy).\n\nmeal:\n<mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark> with fries (i am a sucker for potato chips so this was amazing).\n\nshake:\ncereal bowl 2.0. it literally tasted like the milk from a cereal bowl - with a little hint of vodka. aka what dreams are made of. \n\nwe had a large group (21) but everything was still very timely and the servers were friendly and informative. \n\ni ate way too much, but it was well worth it.\n\nalso - shout out to drinks to go! a must for anyone in vegas.",

            "this place was okay! i was hoping for better! we got the ahi tartar sliders which were lacking flavor and super small, got the black/white malt which was good and a great sharer. i got a burger but it wasn't that good, it was okay and it wasn't hot it just came out warm, the <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> were good. it's pretty cool inside and a chill place to hang out but the food was average. i wouldn't come back. oh and other reviewers mentioned they bring out popcorn unfortunately we didn't get any. boo =(\n\nwould come back for the shakes/malt which seem to be their speciality. service was good too till the end till it took 15 mins to get our change back for the check. =x", 
            "good quality food. nice ambience and quick service. overall nice place to visit if you are around the cosmopolitan hotel. \ni had <mark>The Crazy Bird</mark> and my friend had the <mark>Gold Standard</mark> burger. both of them very pretty good. we ordered shrimp popcorn for appetizers and they literally brought us shrimp and really popcorn, which was a bit pricey. \nwe replaced regular fries with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark>. both are pretty good. \notherwise, a pretty good option to grab a nice meal. \ni haven't had any shakes ( i believe they are popular). will post a review on their shakes if i happen to go back to this place.", 
            "where do burgers like to dance? at a meat ball!\n\nwhere do i even begin with this place? from the atmosphere to the appetizer to the meals themselves, the experience was wonderful. \n\nfrom the moment that we arrived at the restaurant, we were very impressed with the atmosphere that it gave off. being that the majority of the cosmopolitan is very dark and sleek looking, there was a bit of juxtaposition that takes place with having a place like holstein's in there. the lighting inside of the restaurant gives off a very warm and inviting vibe, and there's all sorts of cool (cow-related) artwork filling the inside of the restaurant. it's very fun!\n\non a friday night, we were seated immediately, which kind of surprised me, being that holstein's is in a very popular hotel on the strip, and on a night where people are usually out and about. i probably helped that we got there before the clubbing crowd hit, though, so there's that. either way, it was fast, and i like that! then, as soon as we were seated, we were brought our complimentary popcorn appetizer, which, i must say, was quite the tasty start to our meal. i actually had to make an effort to not fill up on the popcorn too much before the we got our actual burgers.\n\nbefore we even got our burgers, though, i made sure to check in on yelp! and boy am i glad that i did, because we were able to snag a free beer through a promotion that they have going on with yelp, wherein you get a free beer with your first check-in to the restaurant. i didn't finish it because of how tasty and filling <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> and fries were, but it was really nice! i got a tiny bit of 'tude from the waiter when asking about the promotion, but i can look past that.\n\nwhen we finally got our food (which didn't take very long at all), it looked so delicious that i had a hard time stopping to take some pictures of it to accompany my review. i ordered the <mark>Nom Nom Burger</mark>, which consisted of kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips, and thousand island dressing, and the empress, miss joyce w. ordered the urth burger, a vegetarian burger consisting of a house made vegan patty with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sprouts, and avocado. \n\nas soon as i took a bite of my burger, i knew instantly that it was without a doubt the best burger i've ever had. i don't know if it was some sort of placebo effect caused by my knowing that <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was made with kobe beef, or that <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was just plain delicious, but man was it good. <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was cooked to a perfect medium and the cheese was melted evenly all over <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, and in a generous amount. there was also a generous amount of potato chips on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark>, which gave it such a nice crunch with every bite. i don't think that i had a bite of that burger that didn't have a bit of potato chip in it. the thousand island dressing on <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> was also delicious. the entire burger was just so good, right down to the bun. with just one bite, even the empress could taste the deliciousness. even her own vegetarian burger was delicious, which in itself is not something you'd expect to eat at a place like holstein's where it's all about the beef.\n\neven the fries and <mark>Buttermilk <mark>Thick Cut Onion Rings</mark></mark> that we shared were awesomely done. both of the sides were nice and thick, and in, yet again, generous portions, which i can really appreciate. we couldn't even finish all of it because <mark>The Steakhouse Burger</mark> were so good and filling, and there was just so much in general.\n\noverall, holstein's provided a 5/5 experience for us through and through. i only wish we'd had enough time to go back there to try more of their wonderful creations. i know there wasn't one burger on that menu that i didn't want to try. \n\nif ever you find yourself in vegas, i would say to make a point to try out holstein's."
