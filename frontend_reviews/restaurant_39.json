            "eh, hard time choosing between 3 and 4 on this place.  \n\ndrinks: asian beers- nothing special but the price. come on, its vegas. i can hop on a table and get fed free beer all night. no reason to charge me 9 dollars a beer. also beer is the only beverages without prices in the drink menu. wonder why??? -1\n\nappetizer- sushi- the sushi was tasty, but for this scale of restaurant (not to mention price) it should have been better......actually i have had better sushi in reno in a dump of a casino.  -1\n\nfood- wa<mark>Saba</mark> crusted filet with <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>. cooked really well exactly as ordered . +2. \n\ndesert- skipped it, nothing looked good. ordered beer instead. \n\n\ndo yourself a favor, go to one of the other thousands of great restaurants other than here if your in vegas and reading this."

            "so we're in vegas--my first time, and i'm luv-in' it!  we went to tao tonight for drinks and dinner, sponsored by a trade association whose board my husband sits on.  so dinner was not on our dime, i never looked at a menu with prices, so i can't comment on how pricey the place is.\n\ni can say that the decor is the first thing that amazed me--loved it!  it takes a tremendously imaginative and talented person to create an atmosphere like this--which keeps you looking ahead to see what's around the corner and wondering what will astound you next\n\nthe next thing i noticed was the music being piped through the place--very hip!  loud but in a good way.  a later trip to the ladie's room revealed that there's a talented dj responsible for the tunes.  \n\nthe drinks kept coming and when it was time for dinner, we were presented with a lovely salad, followed by dinner served family style, including <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, an unbeleeeevable <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a gingery-garlicky yumminess to it, teensie weensie string beans, <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, and sauteed <mark>Sake Braised Shiitake Mushrooms</mark>.  ummmm..hello!  after dieting for 2 weeks in anticipation of this trip, my taste buds were trippin'!!\n\nnext up was an assortment of desserts, including a fuji apple tart-y thing with ice cream, a bowl of fruity stuff like tangerines, lychees, blackberries, raspberries and ice cream, chocolate lava cake and ice cream...on and on....this meal was planned to show me some love...ice cream and i, why, we're lovers!!!\n\nthe service was absolutely and completely im-pecc-able.  there was a staff of 5 or 6 dedicated to our group of about 40.  my water glass was never empty (or even close to it) and when i asked for a glass of sharp, dry white wine and the server came back with \"all she had on hand\" which was a chardonnay and i politely declined, she returned a couple of minutes later with an unbelievable pinot grigio that hit the spot.  \n\nall in all, a fabulous experience, and one i wouldn't hesitate to repeat on my second trip to this cool-ass town!", 
            "i've done 22 reviews so far, and have not yet given a 5-star.  in thinking about the best experience that i've had in a restaurant recently, i'd have to say tao in las vegas.  the combination of the tasty foods, fun decor, and excellent service makes tao las vegas deserving of my first 5-star rating!  of course, the vegas excitement adds to the total experience.\n\nthis isn't one of yelpers' favorite joints to dine at in vegas based on the ratings, so i'll share a couple of tips of what i've done and hopefully that'll be helpful to you folks out there:\n\n- <mark>Maki</mark> reservations here is a must!  without reservations, this place is impossible to get into, unless you know people, or do the ol' slipping a bill into the handshake action.  (if you do, try $20 or higher)\n\n- come with friends that are ready to party, because this is a party joint!  meet at the bar, so that if you have folks coming in from different hotels, you can enjoy the drinks while you wait.\n\n- once you're seated, order sharable appetizers, like the edamame, <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark>, or  thai stuffed <mark>Shrimp</mark>.\n\n- if you like sake, they have a pretty good selection of <mark>Sake</mark>.  if you haven't tried the nigori sake (unfiltered), i'd suggest at least trying that.  the best way is to ask the server to give you the rundown.we had the voice in the mist bottle and it was yummy!\n\n- for your entree, you must get miso-glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>!!  it's my favorite fish entree in the world!  savory white flaky tender bits of tasty fish... oh my.  it definitely melts in your mouth yet creates a flavor explosion.  so good!  my friend likes the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, but i think it's not nearly as good as the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.\n\ni've been to tao now for 3 years.  i've had a great experience every single time.  i now cannot imagine going to vegas without my <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> experience at tao.", 
            "came here for dinner on a wednesday night and it was not too busy but still really loud.  the <mark>Sake</mark> was reaally strong but in a good way.  waiter was really rushy with everything and i didn't end up ordering enough food.  the miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was buttery and delicious, but they really skimped out on the vegetables.  there were basically none, just some mung bean sprouts and really chewy tofu (i love fried tofu but this was the the worst i've ever had).  i'd come back again because the space is cool and they have a nice menu.", 
            "sort of embarrassed to say that we ate here twice on our 4-day trip - once to get into lavo nightclub free (although we thought the tao club would be open that night) and the second time to get into tao for free right after.\n\nvery good, perhaps slightly overpriced, (but barely) asian fusion food.  gorgeous, sexy d\\u00e9cor and lighting.  i had dumplings to start both nights, and veggie <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> the second night followed by a veggie sampler the second.  the <mark>Sake Braised Shiitake Mushrooms</mark> we had as a side dish were very rich on the second night.\n\na great value if you're interested in going to either club, but we weren't especially impressed with either club.  still a decent dinner choice on the strip.", 
            "my experience with tao's restaurant started before we even sat down to eat! i actually set up a reservation for a party of 11 with maria - the res manager a week before we were in town. she just had me fill out a very simple cc auth and we were good to go. \n\ngetting to the hostess stand can be a little bit of a journey as by the time you are getting in for dinner, people are already lined up to get into the club. once you make it to the bathtubs (best part of tao hands down) you are golden! \n\nand on to the food... \n\nstarted the meal with pork or chicken (sorry, i forget) gyoza. it was good but cmon baby, gyoza is gyoza. we also had the <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> with crunchy cucumber salad. both were so light and refreshing. \n\nmy entree was a wassabi crusted fillet with <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> and a side of <mark>Sake Braised Shiitake Mushrooms</mark>. the mushrooms were so tastey and perfectly tender. i had when shiitake's get mushy. the fillet came out a true medium rare and the wassabi crust set it over the top. my spoiled ass even found a cab from napa on the wine list. **side note - don't you have being out of california and seeing whack wines on the menu?** \n\ntoo bad i didn't leave room for that giant fortune cookie i keep hearing about. \n\nafter dinner you can also get a stamp that can get you another stamp that gets you into the club for free!", 
            "went here this past saturday for a friend's birthday dinner.  we were only able to get a 6:45pm spot because we called to make a reservation the day prior to arrival.  \n\ni love the dim lighting and overall ambiance of tao restaurant.  the place is bit noisy to be a romantic dinner date spot, but it suited our needs for the birthday dinner.  the club music playing in the background pumped us up for later.\n\nwe hung out at the lounge while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive and took advantage of the photo ops.  this place offers eye candy galore for both men and women...bonus!  \n\nitems we ordered:\n\n* <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> ($18) - my friends said this was tasty.  i didn't try any, so can't attest to the taste...although it smelled wonderful.  the wontons were served in a clay pot, simmering gently in it's <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>. \n\n* miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables ($34) - this dish was once again very delicious.  the fish was cooked just right...crisp on the outside and flaky on the inside.  the stir-fried veggies and fried tofu pieces rounded out the dish perfectly.  \n\n* <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> ($16 / six pieces) - i really enjoyed this roll, which consisted of spicy minced tuna spread thickly <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> cakes (cut into rectangular pieces).  \n\n* <mark>TAO Angry Dragon Roll</mark> with eel & kabayaki sauce ($15 / eight slices) - i enjoyed this roll, but it's just your standard eel roll...nothing special about it.  \n\n* kobe tartar tempura ($19 / eight slices) - the minced <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> was wrapped in seaweed, which was then encased in sushi rice and deep fried.  on the side was a bed of marinated, sliced <mark>Sake Braised Shiitake Mushrooms</mark> (which was sweet and delicious).  \n\n* black pepper sizzled <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with udon noodles ($29) - can't say much about this since i didn't get a bite, but it looked and smelled good.  the serving was plentiful, compared with the other dishes.\n\n* molten chocolate cake ($10) - this came with coconut ice cream, but they honored our request for vanilla ice cream instead.  \n\n* assorted ice creams and sorbets ($8) - served with a couple of almond sesame cookies.  \n\ndrinks: glass of scarbolo pinot grigio ($10) / tao-tini ($13) / orange dragon ($13) /  bottle of corona ($8).  \n\nfor our enter<mark>Tai</mark>, we witnessed this drunk lady that somehow ended up on the lap of the huge buddha.  she was posing for pics until security escorted her out.  i guess we're not supposed to sit on the buddha's lap?  darn!  \n\nanother great experience at tao restaurant.  i will always make it a point to dine here on every las vegas trip.", 
            "after jersey boys, we needed a light dinner. tao delivered in a big way. we were blown away by the decor. candles, lighting, glass, wood, tile, sculptures... a very cool place. \n\nwe started with a sake sampler. the waitress really took good care of us with her suggestions.  the three <mark>Sake</mark> were delicious all in their own way.  lobster wonton in a yummy broth with mushrooms and onion came first. unbelievable. just delicious. next came a <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a miso glaze, <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with duck, and <mark>Spicy Hoi Yin Eggplant</mark>. the <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was so so but the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and eggplant dishes were amazing.  we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  \nthis was every bit as good as nobu but in a better, warmer atmosphere.", 
            "better than the tao in nyc!\n\npros:  \nexcellent food! try about 3 oz. ($16 per oz) of the raw <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> tao shabu shabu. also, the soy ginger <mark>Glazed Salmon</mark> with udon noodles and spinach ($26).\natmosphere is chic and just right. we sat at the sushi bar since there was limited seating, but the seats were spacious and comfortable. \ndrinks are excellent here. especially their <mark>Sake</mark>. \ndress to impress. \n\ncons: reservations. my gf and i were here on a busy labor day weekend. we called to make reservations the morning of, but they were fully booked until 10:45. the hostess answered that if it were just two people, then they should be able to seat us right away.  we had to wait for about an hour to find seats."

            "i was a little shocked that the prices weren't out of control considering the hype around tao (at least in gossip magazines =p) anyhow, they put fresh clams in the <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and the sushi rolls were good, considering we were not coastside. the other asian fusion looked ok too, typical <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> and some chinese/meiguoren type dishes, ie: <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark>...the service was really really good though, they brought our food out and while pouring a champagne toast (bachelorette party) it got cold and they made a whole new order, and also gave us complimentary watermelon kam<mark>Ika</mark> shots on the house. niiiiice. the waiters were all young and not hard on the eyes either...heeeey."

            "yep, be prepare to wait.  our dinner reservation was at 9:30pm but didn't get in till like 40 min. after.  once we get in, it's worth it in my opinion, the food was delievered shortly after we place the order.  the track playing inside were so cool that one of my friend decide to buy the cd off them.  there were 5 guy of us that we each order a dish & there was plenty to share, all reasonable priced.  my favorite got to be their cooked samon on the menu, just a bit suprise me, really good dish!  lastly, the decor was really amazing they got this giant budda statue at first floor, there was some birthday party next to us that there were a guy working there hitting the traditional japanese drum to celebrate for them, really cool.  \noh & if you're lucky like us to get in to the club afterward, the waitress stops by your table to take u ups<mark>Tai</mark> personally, which consider the crazy, busy amount of people they have, i have to say they did a really good job.  just try it yourself, you won't be disappoint doing both the dinner & the clubbing there, in my opinion.", 
            "maybe i'm rating this place a little generously because when i went there on a date with an out-of-towner i'd met out the night before and i had stars in my eyes and butterflies in my stomach, but my memory of this place is pretty super fantastic.\n\nthe wait for a table was a bit long for a wednesday night, but we sat in the lounge up front and had some cock<mark>Tai</mark>.  the dining area was a little \"cozy\" for my tastes, but we were led to a corner booth with plenty of room to be space hogs.  the giant buddha across from us was awesome.  the food was splendid - the tempura was tender and crispy, the dumplings burst with flavor, and i even had duck for the first time and enjoyed it thoroughly.  my dining partner enjoyed the evening so much he took a rock from the assortment  behind us as a souvenir.  i don't think that's recommended by the management.\n\nthe thing that cracked me up the most about this place were the, what i like to refer to them as, slut fortune cookies.  my fortune said, 'this evening, don't let common sense be your guide.'  with fool proof advice like this, no wonder tao's celebrity clientele go all over the world flashing their cover-upable bits.", 
            "dined here with my wife over a long weekend and to quickly summarize the experience, we both loved it...everything from the decor, the service, and of course, the meal was top notch.\n\nwe booked an early reservation around 5:30pm after being sold on reviews of both the original tao in new york and this one. \n\ntip: book reservations early since the choice times fill quickly on the weekends. \n\nmy first impressions of tao's decor looks like money well spent...especially in the de<mark>Tai</mark>. upon entry, we noticed tubs filled with water and rose petals...to which my wife replied, can we get in? i told her, sure ;) it also created an intoxicating scent...or perhaps that was the drinks?\n\nour table was nicely situated on the second level which overlooked the giant buddah and coy fish pond. this was a great location since it was above the group tables noise and was quiet enough to have a decent conversation of sweet-nothings and what-nots. my wife also pointed out from this vantage point, you can see down some girls tops...i resisted to look as i felt i was being tested.\n\nour server, michael, was tremendously helpful with our dining experience. his fantastic recommendations with the sashimi, the vegetarian selections, and the strong, yet fine tao cock<mark>Tai</mark> were spot on.\n\ni also liked how the other staff members went the extra mile in <mark>Maki</mark> the dining experience special. our water glasses were always full, and empty dishes were promptly removed. they also gave us a line pass for the nightclub ups<mark>Tai</mark>. this was great in avoiding the long lines even as they opened at 10pm.\n\nanother helpful tip is the yin/yang signage on the restroom doors. here's a helpful primer...\n\nyin = feminine forces\nyang = masculine forces\n\nclever, huh?\n\nthis took my wife and i awhile to figure out, especially after a few drinks. they even included male and female statues...and the occasional male attendant peeping out from time to time...to help the confused or drunkards.\n\nit is a bit on the expensive side but well worth it. overall, we enjoyed tao so much and found ourselves craving the food the next day. i'm sure we'll be back.", 
            "we didn't eat here so i can't comment on the food (though we've been to the one in ny and thought that was good).  after our dinner at zeffirino, we decided to see if we could grab drinks somewhere and as we said that, tao appeared as if out of nowhere.  we moseyed on in and found ourselves a seat at the bar.  while drinks were great, this was probably one of the best places we ever went to purely to people watch.  you could easily just look at any random corner of this place and make up a story about any of the individuals there.  this lil activity, along w/ our drinks and incredible bartender, provided us w/ plenty of good times.  we decided to high <mark>Tai</mark> it when it started to get packed.  as we walked out, there was a huge line just to get in which made us appreciate three things.  one, we got there as early as we did, two, we didn't have to stand in line, and three, we didn't have to be crammed into the place w/ a bunch of screaming 21 year olds...", 
            "what can i say about tao the restaurant...? its trendy...its spendy...its a mad frenzy...and its probably the best spot to have \"dinner<mark>Tai</mark>\" (thats right yelpers...i invent words!) in vegas. the spectacle of the huge buddha seemingly floating above the koi fish pool is unreal (makes you wonder how they got that big bastard in the building) and awe-inspiring. the lounge and bar are like a social scene all in itself. the multiple dining areas (downs<mark>Tai</mark>, sushi bar, ups<mark>Tai</mark>) all have their own vibe about them meaning you get a different experience everytime you dine there. the food...well its just goes without saying that its f&*^^in great. the sushi, the thai, the chinese...everything is as tasty as can be. and hell yes its expensive...but your in vegas...so deal with it. you can to have fun, dine and party like a rockstar, so do it and enjoy. the service is absolutely top caliber and just adds even more to the experience. for a non-vegas person, i eat here and party here everytime im out there (i should be a spokesperson for the freakin place) and will continue to do so as long as its there.\nps...reservations definitely the way to go unless you have the vegas passport (know someone that works here).", 
            "i wish there was a way to give it a negative number of stars.  i have been to the tao ny location and loved their giant fortune cookie dessert!  i can't tell you that the food itself or drinks were memorable but i did want to check out the vegas location so i made a reservation.\n\nboy, did i make a mistake. my friends and i arrive right on time and are told that even w/ reservations, everyone waits 30 mins.  so we asked them how long we would have waited if we didn't have reservations.  apparentlly, they didn't have our reservations although i had made the reservations w/ them directly that day.  strike one from the host who was the rudest man on earth.  he must have taken too many \"cool pills\" since he had something up his ass!\n\nthen, while we wait for our reservations they screwed up at the bar, my friends and i are given a cock<mark>Tai</mark> menu that we ordered off of.  we ordered one round of drinks that clearly stated that it should have been about $30 + tip for drinks.  we get the bill and it says $60.  when i point the mistake out to the server (while clearly showing her the menu we were given), she is so dumb that she mentions that we also got a diet coke in addition to our 4 drinks!  so the diet coke accounts for the $30 difference?  what a moran!  when i asked her to bring out the manager as she clearly did not have one brain cell, the  server started giving me an attitude.  after a 10 min. wait for the \"manager\", i was told that they had given us the wrong menu w/ incorrect prices.  apparently, the bill was supposed to be $60 although the menu they gave us said it was supposed to be $7 each.  we were not given an apology for the mistake or anything!  \n\nbecause i have worked at a restaurant and currently work in advertising, i know that good customer service would have included an apology for their mistake and then an offer to honor the lower price.  no such thing was done so i demanded a talk w/ the manager.   \n\nonly after i bitched out the manager did she apologize for the mistake and correct the bill for our 1 round of $30 drinks!  this after <mark>Maki</mark> us deal w/ this and completely ruin a fun night out!  after such horrible service, we were told our table was ready (as if we were lucky to be given our table 40 mins after our reservation time!).  we told them that we would not be dining there.  we didn't want to give this establishment any of our money!\n\nwe gave them a piece of our mind and walked out w/ the glasses in hand! \n\nthis pompousness and outright horrible customer service ruined our evening.  we ended up eating at the casual asian restaurant in the venetian as we were so hungry by this time that we couldn't wait to try to find another \"trendy place\".  it turned out to be a good decision as the food was good and we got great service!  the best part, we ended up spending probably 1/6th what we would have spent at tao.  i would have paid for a great meal, great service at tao but the point that they would not quickly resolve the issue from their mistake made me furious!  \n\ntao, get your act together!  if you went to a store and they clearly had the wrong price marked on a sweater or in their ad, they should honor the lower price.  same goes for the menu you gave us!  i will never go to this location again!", 
            "first off, let me say that you can get better food in other restaurants.  but when you are in vegas, it's often more about the atmosphere and the experience.  want a celebrity sighting?  want to visit a vegas hotspot?  tao is definitely a great choice at the moment in the fickle and ever-changing vegas scene.\n\nthe food takes a number of dishes from southeast asia and moderates the taste for a western palate.  spices are generally mild, the ingredients are less exotic, and anyone who has eaten at a p.f. chang's will feel very comfortable.  you really can't go wrong if you choose a number of small plates and share them family-style.\n\ni'd also highly recommend the sake flights, which give you a sampling for some very fine wines.  oddly enough, you can't tell which is which, but does it really matter?\n\nthis is a great location for those large groups, although getting a reservation can be difficult.  it's a good thing that they have late-night seating up to 10:30 or 11:00pm.\n\na note for those bachelor/ette parties - eating dinner at the restaurant does not get you into the club automatically, so plan accordingly.  it's still a good choice to eat downs<mark>Tai</mark> and go clubbing ups<mark>Tai</mark> afterwards (because you avoid an extra taxi ride in between dinner and partying), but you need to make reservations at both locations before coming out, otherwise you risk having to wait in line.", 
            "came here visting family and was suggested to try this place out. ordered a $150 kobe fillet for my boss and then ordered some sushi (various plates) for the family along with a few dim sum and various chinese style ala carte plates. din sum was so so not worth noting, and the steak was far from anything worth $150. i, ordered some peking duck with flied lice and it was actually really good. ordered a few drinks then uncles start getting faded and was harassing the waiters to make sure they were on top of <mark>Maki</mark> sure his bottle never ran out of cold beer. sake was nothing worthwhile (i do apologize if im not as de<mark>Tai</mark> with the food, but its one to forget). the place is beautiful and is staff friendly and its a great place to grab a drink, but id rather suggest eating at the palm for great steaks.", 
            "had a comp dinner here with friends and it was absolutely fabulous.  we got to try a bunch of cock<mark>Tai</mark> too, and they were all very creative and well mixed.  the food itself was delicious and i woudln't have changed a thing! even though we were a comp dinner i didn't feel rushed at all and we sat for awhile enjoying our drinks after dinner.  go here!", 
            "friends were in town and they wanted to try the very popular tao restaurant.  (it's been reported that the tao restaurant is one of the highest gross-ranking restaurants in vegas!)  just as we were about to enter the hallway, this very large bouncer asks if he could help us and we mention we have reservations and then he allows us to proceed further.  talk about intimidating, and this was for a 7 pm dinner!\n\nwe were seated ups<mark>Tai</mark> on the balcony overlooking the huge buddha.  as menus were presented to us, the waitress asked if she could get us some water.  as i perused the flimsy two page menu, front and back, i didn't even know where to begin.  my fellow dining companions were quick to notice the 16 oz. grilled kobe sirloin for $150 and the individually priced nigiri pieces ranging from $3-$15 a piece.\n\nthe menu suggests that all items were going to be served family style, so we asked the waitress for a few suggestions.  i could barely hear her over the hum of the restaurant.  (i would not consider tao to be romantic at all.)\n\nin the end we decided to start with four different appetizers and two entrees.  and this is what we got:\n\n<mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark> ($14) - this came with five lettuce leaves.  a decent amount to fill all the leaves.  the squab mixture was a bit too moist and the bf found it too sweet.  i had squab juice stuff dripping all over my hands right off the bat.  there was a lot of flavor though and crunch, probably from the celery.\n\n<mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> ($16) - a clay pot arrived with 5 lobster-filled wontons.  very flavorful with slices of shittake mushrooms laid out too.  a very light and delicate dish.  \n\nsashimi of <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> with fresh wasabi sauce ($28) - beautifully presented on a circular clear plate with herbs on top.  we couldn't determine if they were already sliced apart or what, but with the meat being so delicate, just grab a piece and pull and the meat will tear gently apart.  lovely taste and clean.  however, i didn't recall a wasabi sauce or flavor to it.\n\npork <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with thai chili sauce ($11) - this order came with 3 triangles filled with pork, so we requested another order so we could all have a taste.  the <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> was decent, nothing particular special about it.  the thai chili sauce tasted store bought though.\n\nmiso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables ($34) - very good, but i guess the better question is when have you had a bad piece <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>?\n\n<mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark> ($26) - we must have misheard the waitress because we thought she said it came in a coconut curry.  it did not, but rather a sweet sauce with about five pieces <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> in it, including the drumstick.  it was okay, nothing particularly special about it.\n\n<mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark> ($4) - of course we had to order some rice!  we got two orders which is just enough for four people who aren't heavy rice eaters.\n\noverall, the food was good.  definitely overpriced though, and it's catered to a cer<mark>Tai</mark> kind of clientele.  you'll be amused to find things like kung pao chicken ($26) and grilled prime porterhouse with wasabi dipping sauce ($88) on the same menu.  we decided to pass on dessert as the waitress-recommended giant fortune cookie ($10) or fuji apple <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> ($8) didn't appeal to us enough.  (we actually drove over to luv-it frozen custard instead!)\n\nservice is a huge component of what makes this experience worth it or not, and tao fails in this department.  i was not impressed with the chatty young waiters who dropped (not placed) the silverware onto the table, reached across the bf to put things in front of me, and who 'hid' the menus behind my guest on his chair.  (uh, who does that?!)  as they moved our glasses and silverware to make room for our dishes, they did it in such an unorganized and messy fashion.  i felt like i was staring at someone's hands trying to do a card trick.  i'm used to the staff performing such tasks in an unnoticed way as to not disrupt the private conversation the dining guests are having.  the waitstaff should take a few lessons from rosemary's restaurant's waitstaff.  that's what i call service!\n\nat the very end of our meal, someone did come by and ask if everything was okay.  and it was...just okay.  they asked if we were going to the club afterward and i said yes and asked if they had any passes.  what they do have is a \"line pass,\" which is really a simple stamp on your inner left wrist so you can supposedly bypass the long line outside.  however, you will still have to pay cover.  (i think this part is rather ridiculous.  they should at least offer a discount on the cover instead.)  with the stamp being so simple, a washing of my hands right after dinner washed it right off.  not the best pass i would say.\n  \ntao restaurant is the kind of place you say you've been to and that's it.    there are better places where service is valued higher.\n\n$185 total, including tip and tax, no drinks", 
            "this was the first time i went to vegas with just my friends, and we went all out! we were trying to figure out where we could experience some fine dining, and we kept seeing signs for tao at the venetian. right as we walked into the beautifully decorated walkway, i felt like i was stepping into a glamorous nightlife scene from a movie. there were floating rose petals on each side of the walkway lit by candles. \n\nof course, there was a wait, but it was expected. however, instead of just standing around trying to pass the time, we sat down at their lounge area where we were waited on by a cock<mark>Tai</mark> waitress. we ordered a few drinks before dining while snacking on their complimentary wasabi peas, and before we knew it, our table was ready.\n\ntheir decor deeper into the restaurant was even more impressive than the front of house. behind me was an open sushi bar across from a wall displaying artistic pipes featured inside multi-colored backgrounds. in front of me was an enormous statue of buddha surrounded by more candles.\n\nour service was excellent. since it was our first time there, our server really wanted to give us the full experience. he was very suggestive without being pushy, so it made our ordering much less difficult. the only thing that kind of threw us off, was when a new server took over without our being informed. the service, however, remained top-notch. they were anticipating our every need.\n\nthe pad-thai was good, the shiitake mushroom tempura was delicious! best tempura i've ever had. the desserts were creative and aesthetically pleasing. definitely stop by if you want to make your trip to vegas a memorable one.", 
            "tao had a very nice ambience to the place.  i love the koi pond below the big budda statue. \nthe sashimi <mark>Spicy Shrimp, King Crab, and Asparagus Roll</mark> and mojitos were good, but don't eat the duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>. or order the watermelon cock<mark>Tai</mark>. those two were very poor choices. \nthe waitress was kind enough to take back the watermelon cock<mark>Tai</mark> with no charge. \nthe bathrooms were nice, but confusing if you dont know what yin and yang stands for. just take your chances. ;) \nwill probably give it one more chance ...", 
            "large parties dining at tao should know this....\n___________________________\nto my surprise, 4 stars for the food, but an overall 2 stars for the ridiculous way we were charged for the food and how our complaint was handled.  i dined at tao with a group of 9 for a bachelorette party the weekend of august 13, 2007. although i was disappointed with tao, i still had a great time with my fabulous girlfriends. \n\ni don't remember everything we had, but i enjoyed the <mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark>, <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. least favorite was the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> (one of the worst i've had) and chicken skewers. \n\nreason for 2 stars:\nafter we were seated, our waitress didn't come by for what seemed like 10 minutes to introduce herself. when she came by, she was friendly but did not comm<mark>Uni</mark> clearly how she was taking our order. since it was so loud and our waitress didn't have a very loud voice, 3 different members of our group asked her to clarify how much food she thought we should order. she specifically told us that we should order 3-4 starters and at least 5 main dishes. that took me by surprise b/c i thought this is small plates and how could that be enough food? so i repeated what she said to me just to clarify that 3-4 appetizers would enough food for 10 girls? we decided to just order as much as she recommended and we can order more if necessary. \n\nwhen the dishes arrived, we were all suprised at the large portions. what we found out when we got the receipt was that the waitress doubled and tripled each order (as she saw fit) so it would be enough for our table of 9. she never once said she was going to do this and we were upset because we had so much leftover food and even ate more than we wanted so it wouldn't be wasted.\n\nif we had known this is what she was going to do, we would have ordered different items. i can't remember if she tripled any main dishes but the end result was a very large bill and wasted food. \n\nwhen we brought this up to our waitress, she insisted she explained it and after she left, she never returned to our table. we then spoke to the manager who said he could only give us 2 drink tokens to compensate for the miscomm<mark>Uni</mark>. this is so lame and such a cheap gestere to rectify the situation. the least he could have done was get us into the nightclub for free afterwards. \n\ni have never, ever, gone to a restaurant where they took the liberty of doubling or tripling your order without telling you. i've always said, i want 1 order of this, 2 orders of this, etc.\n\ni would not go back to this restaurant again. food was good but not worth the price. \n\nthe club is ok if you get in early but by 1pm it gets too crowded to walk around and check things out. we got free line passes but had to go out, get in smaller line, pay $20pp at the door + get a hand stamp, then headed ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the night club. seems like a classy place but i find it offensive that they have skanky girls taking baths and playing with each other surrounded by all these bhuddas.", 
            "this tao is one of the things that makes vegas bearable for me. the decor (by my friend thomas) is spectacular- the club part is just gorgeous- buddhas everywhere (ok, a bit too much beaucoup de buddha), asian antiques, big stone tubs filled with floating rose petals- the sheer scale of the thing is amazing.\n\nthat said, of course it is obnoxious. this is vegas baby, and this place is very popular.  so, you'll need a res for sure, and even then you will wait, and the waitron will treat you as though you are an enthused tourist who just can't wait for that exotic experience. it's not quite as bad as \"would you like some sake? it's japanese rice wine, and by the way, some of the fish here is raw\", but...almost. however the sake selection is excellent and shows good taste in a sake sommelier ( a big career ambition of mine), the cock<mark>Tai</mark> are strong, and the food is decent. \n\nit is worth visiting just for the ups<mark>Tai</mark> bathrooms, which are completely transparent until you lock the door- then they cloud up (a trick also used in the nyc prada store, but they don't serve sake). an interesting psychological test.", 
            "wow, just wow.  the service for my event last night gets five of the biggest, flashiest, vegas showgirl style stars you can even imagine.\njust walking up, the zen almost washes over you as you wish that the tubs full of rose petals were actually there for you to soak in.  but then you remember it's vegas, and that's nasty, and the pounding music hits you and you're not so zen.  then you're just overwhelmed by the design of the place.  you walk into one of the most perfect lounge areas i've ever seen.  tons of cuddly couches and areas to sit with friends, all bathed in a very sexy candlelit glow.  the better to enjoy your foofy, brightly colored cock<mark>Tai</mark> in - maybe do a little canoodling.  now this is a place i would definitely come to if i lived in the area.  i had something very blue - called the blue zin i think?  (that's what happens when you let bartenders make your drinks, but worth it, it was delish) and a blueberry cosmo which just might be the most beautiful tasting cock<mark>Tai</mark> ever.  but yeah, they really should've used white cranberry juice instead of red.  i am totally stealing that drink as my own.\nand seriously, i cannot rave about the staff enough.  from setting up the event, to the execution, we were treated with kid gloves and doted upon the entire evening.  our crowd had a great time and i was swimming in compliments for an event well done, and i know it was thanks to tao and their dreamy staff (cutie patooties galore!).\nthe apps were fab (and not just because i set the menu) - i especially liked the duck, the triangular pork <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>,and the shrimp (which were not rubbery or chewy at all, but soft and almost flaky).  the food at the buffet was only decent, and the desserts just okay, but absolutely adorable (hence the one missing star overall).\ni would recommend this location for an event a million times over - they have plenty of nooks and crannies (or nightclubs or balconies overlooking the main dining room) to fit your group, and the know how to make sure your event goes off without a hitch.", 
            "like a good jewish girl, i had to have chinese food for christmas.  tao had a fun vibe, with a huge buddha and bathtubs full of rose petals, but the food just wasn't that impressive.  most of the dishes tasted like syrupy american chinese food that you could get for $10 - and i don't want to tell you how much i spent.  the drinks were good, the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> our waiter recommended was great, and desserts were delish, but overall i just wasn't blown away.\n\nplus, the fire alarm kept going off!  at first we thought it was a strobe light, but it quickly became annoying.  \n\nfinal weird note: we talked to out waiter about sex.  i'll leave the de<mark>Tai</mark> to your imagination.", 
            "tao is completely over hyped. it's nicely decorated and the people working at tao are all very pretty. the dj is even great. but the food is awful and the entire meal felt rushed. i felt like the waiters were really trying to turn the tables over quickly. the waiter even took my cock<mark>Tai</mark> and didn't ask if i wanted another. this also happened with the food. but that's not even the worst part. the worst part was the actual food. maybe i'm spoiled, living in the bay area. we have so much great asian food. tao just couldn't compare. not even close. i understand it's asian fusion, but it just did not taste good.\n\nthe appetizers were ok. we had <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, the tuna tartar, and the chicken dumplings. of course these were fine, how can you screw up a dumpling. for dinner we had sushi and it was some of the fishiest we've ever had. just awful. we also had the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and it was tasty but i think it was undercooked. about a half hour after eating it, i got really sick. we kicked down like $150+ for dinner and it was as if i hadn't even eaten it. it honestly could have been anything i ate there that made me sick, but i really think it was the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. \n\nwe even had plans to go to the nightclub afterwards but we had such a terrible dinner we wanted to get the hell out of there. we ended up at the palms. avoid tao. it's just not worth it.", 
            "food: i heard so many great things about tao so i had high expectations for the food. i ended up ordering the mongolian scallion chicken which was very tasty. i wish portions were a little bigger though. i also tried the squab <mark>Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups</mark> which i loved! they have a nice selection on their menu and also daily specials.\n\nprice: prices here are expensive. my dish was about $27 or so and my appetizer was around $15, i think. you're really paying for the atmosphere.\n\nservice: service is outstanding here. we dined here early but there were plenty of waiters taking care of us. they were all polite, well mannered and very on top of their stuff.\nalso you can make reservations on opentable.com but if you are planning on dining on a friday or saturday night...make them at least a month or so in advance!\n\natmosphere: i loved it. we dined ups<mark>Tai</mark>. considering that we were here for an early dinner, it wasn't loud or anything. very relaxing actually. i would love to see the night club next time. the entrance here is also beautiful. there are rose petal baths! i would love to come here to celebrate a birthday or something.\n\nlocation: located right in the venetian near the exit of the venetian canal shops.", 
            "okay i will start by saying that the food was not at all what i was expecting when i made reservations at this restaurant.  upon arrival, the decor was very nice and i thought i was in for a treat.  well i was wrong.  \n\nwe started with a few cock<mark>Tai</mark>, which were good.  we ordered some starters, the edamame sampler (was good and the garlic wasabe edamame was an interesting twist on a favorite), <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> with shrimp toast (my soup was pitch black, and the shrimp toast was burnt on the outside but mushy on the inside?), and <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> (were overcooked, the skins were mushy).  \n\nfor entrees we ordered the <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, kung pao chicken (which was basically like sweet <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> chicken at most chinese fast food restaurants, but not fried), eggplant, and noodles.  after seeing the food i think the prices are absolutely ridiculous for what they provide.  the food is not flavorful in any way and i definently think that tao needs to revamp their dishes (all of them were <mark>Uni</mark>)\n\nat the end of our meal we did get a dessert which was a sampler of many of their desserts.  i have to say this was definently the highlight of a disappointing meal.  they had a sparkler on the dessert platter when they brought it out and the thing that caught my attention was the gigantic fortune cookie (which has white chocolage mousse on one side and chocolate mouse on the other side).  they also had some sort of chocolate cake with a melted chocolate inside, and a fried dessert <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark>.  \n\noverall i would recommend for the money you can find much better places to eat in las vegas.", 
            "the food was amazing, our server lee was just fun. and for a group of 50 people, i'd highly recommend it. when you can get the food right for a group that large, you know they're doing something right.\n\ni asked for a specialty cock<mark>Tai</mark> menu, they sent the bartender over...umm can i take this menu to go, hello hotty! all the staff knew the menu backwards and forwards. the decor is beautiful. \n\nour drinks never went empty, nothing was taken without us being asked. \n\ngreat place for large groups!", 
            "not only is tao one of the most gorgeous restaurants i've ever seen, but the food and service were at another level.  \n\nbe sure to get the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (melts like buttah, baby) and take full advantage of the bar.  the  eggplant, while quite spicy, is really good (and i normally hate eggplant).  \n\nthe entire dining experience is great, and i found myself having a 3+ hr dinner at tao (actually, we closed down the mezzanine dining level) and the waiter was not only attentive, but very personable.  the candle on our table went out and it took less than 30 seconds for someone to notice and replace it.  yes, not really a critical part of having a nice dinner but it just showcases the level of service and attention to de<mark>Tai</mark> the wait staff had.  everyone was willing to come by and ask how we're doing (including the mafia-don type manager who was really nice and actually kinda funny) but we didnt feel crowded at all.  \n\nit's a bit pricey, esp if you have several drinks, but it's well worth it.", 
            "the food was very interesting.  some of it worked, some of it didn't, but the overall experience was delightful (until they turned up the music way too loud to talk.)  the decor is outstanding, buddha statues all around, including one 30 foot one.  the food is asian fusion.  i had salmon/avocado/<mark>King Crab California Roll</mark> which was excellent (real crab.)  the duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> were a bit over done, but tasty.  we had the lobster sea food dish, the lobster was  a bit overcooked and the sauce was heavy, but the dish was good.  the soups were very well done (cream corn <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark>.)  the blueberry won ton dessert was just excellent.  if i'd had more room i would have ordered another.\nwe had the <mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark>, which were okay, but pretty standard.  \n\ni had a couple of sake flights (they have an excellent selection) which were delightful.  the wine list is very good.  don't bother asking for a blended drink, 'it takes too much time...\" the waiter claimed.  \n\nthe service was very good, actually too good, as they started bugging us too much.  first to explain every single dish on the menu in excruciating de<mark>Tai</mark> (it is a big,eclectic menu.)  then to constantly refill my water glass every time i set it down.  \n\nit was a good meal overall and i'd recommend it.  we got their early with reservations when they opened and were promptly seated.",

            "so impressed. i really was hesitant to believe all the hype about tao, but all of it is well-deserved. the staff is unbelievably friendly and so good looking. being hot is undoubtedly a prerequisite to apply for a job at tao. i was with a party of six and we had reservations for 7:30. we didn't actually make it to our table until around 8:00 or so but i absolutely didn't mind. the lounge area is gorgeous and believe me, you will enjoy sipping on cock<mark>Tai</mark> and people watching... so much that you might not even want to go to your table : )\n\ntry the tao-tini. so yummy.\n\nfor appetizers, we had the vegetarian <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with chili sauce and the pork dumplings - both delicious.\n\nas an entree, i had the salmon, though i'm not sure of it's exact title on the menu, it's the only salmon dish there. try it, i promise you will not be disappointed.\n\nalso, don't be mislead into thinking tao is too pricey for you. everything on the menu is moderately priced and well worth it.\n\nonly downside - it seems as if bussers try to get you out and turn over tables as soon as possible, trying to pick up your dish before your even done with it. small price to pay, though, for such a great dinner.", 
            "first of all my favorite thing to do in vegas is eat. tao makes no exception to please. first course <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, super delish <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark> lobe beef just melted in your mouth. all the entrees we shared were amazing, cock<mark>Tai</mark> superb. the decor was great but to be expected from all over the top vegas restaurants. i only wish there was one in chicago.", 
            "it's pretty unfair to not seperate my reviews but i'm going to make this a resturant/lounge combo. \n\ndon't go there thinking that it will be anything like the location in ny ( which is a hometown fav) the las vegas version has an identity all of its own. i did the sushi platter with the chef's selection. your better off sticking close to the sushi chef's for an enter<mark>Tai</mark> night. \n\npersonally i suggest bringing a crowd that can appreciate a place like tao. the whole enviroment inspires intelligent conversation and anything less seems to put a damper on the whole experiance. \n\neven though i was a guest of rich they still made me get a line pass and re enter just to go ups<mark>Tai</mark>. i hear they make ppl pay to get in but they just let us walk up. ups<mark>Tai</mark> is cool. naked women decorating the place is a perk. \n\nnot a place to get your dance on .....stick to the bar behind the wierd skully wall.", 
            "wow...tao is like a p.f. chang's with mediocre food, clueless bartenders and pounding music.  the business model is sad really, they created a gorgeous space, disregarded all other de<mark>Tai</mark> and then watched the tourists flow in...", 
            "it was so crowded ups<mark>Tai</mark> on the dance floor that we decided to go down to the lounge part to find somewhere to sit and chill.  never make the mistake of going to the lounge and feeling hungry right before the kitchen closes. you will regret it because it smelled good in the lounge, but the results were not so much.  chef's roll = eww, eww, eww and tiny for the amazing price of $16!!   i am generally against these type of asian restaurants that are kinda fusion, but when you get hungry late, you get desperate. our waiter was nice and was on top of it, so the star is for him.  maybe it's better when you go for actual dinner, so don't take my review for that (although you might wanna stay away from the chef's roll then too).", 
            "thanks yelpers, i am quite impressed with the consensus on tao!  it's not nyc, but it puts its best foot or food forward.  if you read my last review on alex i had to chastise you guys a little bit, but fret not, you have been redeemed.  after an amazing \"evening with cher\" @ caesars palace, my friend and i fell through tao and had an extraordinary time.  de<mark>Tai</mark>:\n\narrival was swift, i anticipated a wait based on prior yelpers experience, and received the olive garden style beeper then shown to the well decorated and seductively lit lounge with quite a view of the gussied up vegas party-goers.  \n\nafter about twenty minutes, my dining companion and i received our table with a round of drinks on the house due to the wait.  way to go on the customer service tao.  i had the tao-tini--a+ my friend the tao cosmo.  both smooth and easy.  \n\nthe food--ordered in portions and had wonderful dishes:\nspicy lobster/<mark>King Crab California Roll</mark> excellent\nsteamed veggie dumplings--needs extra dunking sauce yum yum\ndragon <mark>Tai</mark> ribs--ok could have done without\n<mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> tuna tartar--omg, could have 2 of these\n<mark>Hot or Cold Edamame</mark>--fav.\n\ndessert was over the top:  \ngiant fortune cookie exploding w/ chocolate mousse very rich, so be warned\nrice pudding creme brule w/ extra scoop of ginger ice cream!  just like mom used to make back south--right.  \n\nour waiter was helpful, but a bit stuffy--otherwise an overall stellar performance by tao.  be careful not to trip on the way out over the eager tao nightclub revelers.", 
            "walking into a club to have dinner wasn't something on the top of my list of things to do but i heard many good things, so in i went. red accents along a dark backdrop. a hallway full of naked women in bathtubs covered in rose petals. winding maze to get from the hallways to the ups<mark>Tai</mark> dining area. plenty of bouncers to ensure eating privacy. all seemed fairly crazy to me at a place we were to have dinner but it was well worth it.\n\nthe tao restaurant had some of the most delicious salmon i've ever had. i ordered the soy ginger <mark>Glazed Salmon</mark> with udon noodles and spinach. the salmon cooked to perfection, beautifully medium in the middle, and the udon was amazing. every morsel, every bite, and every scent was packed full of flavor. the seasoning enhanced the flavor of the salmon rather than masking it.\n\ni eat a lot of asian food, not because i'm asian myself but because there is an abundant amount of asian restaurants in my area. i wouldn't say the food at tao is authentic but it is a warm welcome to to the culinary world with asian influences.\n\noverall, it was the best salmon i've ever had and definitely worth the price and i would definitely return. next time i'm bringing my appetite and dancing shoes as the club is amazing.", 
            "i was pleasantly surprised!  much less pretentious than i thought, but the waitor was a little on the pushy side.  i suppose with the economy, vegas is hurting too so he's gotta \"make it work\".  other than that, here's the rundown:\n\n-sushi:  we shared a few rolls for appetizers and they were good, but definitely $$ for the portion.  we had a spicy, crunchy <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> and something else with yellow<mark>Tai</mark>; like i said, good, but i've had better at sushi wabi in chicago.  \n\n-drinks:  sake martini, waaaaay too heavy on the vodka.  left a stinging sensation in my mouth and not in a good way.  the other tini's were on the sweet side.  \n\n-dinner:  we had <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark>...must try.  it was tender, flavorful and a great portion size.  friends had chicken curry, nice and spicy and <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, also delicious.  i thought the entrees were all reasonably priced, especially for vegas.  \n\n-atmosphere:  lots of typical d-bags yelling \"vegas baby!!\" and lots of typical chippees in slutty outfits (us included).  but overall, no complaints.  we were seated on time, the service was efficient (our food came out really fast!) and $110 per person (dinner for six, split 5 ways for b-day girl) seemed like a pretty good deal for as much as we ate and drank.", 
            "i've always hated vegas...until this last trip.  unfortunately, tao was the one blight on the trip.  the food was ok and the bill wasn't outrageous, which can be a typical vegas pitfall.\n\nwe ate family-style and had a roll that i'm fairly cer<mark>Tai</mark> is an exact rendition of fish-food., which was partly our fault for eating sushi on a sunday.  the food came out so quickly that we didn't really have much time to enjoy our meal.  that is not to say that they were trying to turn the table over though, it took about 45 minutes to receive our bill and pay for it.\n\nbottom-line: the food was mostly edible and the service was alright.", 
            "the food was 50/50... it seemed like they had the worst kitchen possible handle the appetizers & sushi, while an average chef handled the main dishes. the place was grossly overpriced so you're really just paying for the atmosphere. my fiancee and i were extremely let down and the place did not live up to the hype. our hostess said that our dinner ($185 mind you) guaranteed entrance to the nightclub after but, of course, incompetent doormen & nightclub managers had no idea what we were promised an hour earlier. save your money and go somewhere else! a group of our friends who made it in the club were split up since women were the only ones allowed ups<mark>Tai</mark>. my fiancee and myself, on the otherhand, refused paying to go in since dinner was terrible and their word meant close to nothing. honestly, if you want good asian food then go to an asian restaurant, not an asian-themed restaurant. if you want a better vegas experience take your spouse to bobby flay's mesa grill for dinner @ caesars and the mix @ mandalay (the hotel) for after dinner lounging and drinks, where at both places you'll be deeply satisfied.",

            "although i love tao nightclub, tao restaurant pales in comparison.  we went for dinner and the food is decent, but slightly over-priced for the quality and portion size.  we had a nice bottle of wine, the <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark>, black pepper <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, and <mark>TAO Lo Mein</mark> with <mark>Lacquered Roast Pork</mark>.  the duck seemed a bit over-cooked, the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> was excellent, and the <mark>TAO Lo Mein</mark> was probably a poor choice and i'm pretty sure we've all had better at our local chinese restaurants...\n\nthe waitstaff was friendly, albeit a bit slow because it was so busy, and the decor was really gorgeous.  a bit loud, but the nightclub is right ups<mark>Tai</mark> so it's not surprising!\n\nbut the best part of the dining experience by far was the dessert!  we shared a truly awe-inspiring huge fortune cookie filled with white and dark chocolate mousse, complete with a huge paper fortune inside.  amazing and the main reason for the extra star!", 
            "sooooo overrated. i have had 2 mediocre dining experiences here. i celebrated my birthday here, and it was sooo gross and ghetto. bottle service at the club was a total rip off, cer<mark>Tai</mark> not worth the 400 bucks.  we had to walk up 3 flights of what was probably the most gross filthy old s<mark>Tai</mark> i've ever seen (in heels!, wtf?). we were seated outside by the bar on these crappy mat-bench things (which were dirty and dusty).  they looked like wrestling mats that you'd see in a high school gymnasium. also, these gross old hags came over and sat on the bench next to us (they didnt buy a bottle or pay to sit there) and were smoking cigarettes. we had to track down security to ask them to leave. anyway, the environment was so lame and i was so irritated that i drank waaaay to much (so i wouldn't be aware how badly everything sucked). i blacked out and woke up the next day in my room at the encore. i was delighted to see that my wallet (and the 3 grand inside it) had been stolen. being in vegas with no id, wonderful, let me tell ya. needless to say, it was a very disappointing birthday. if you are looking for a special experience, this is not the place. i don't understand why it gets so much press, it's a real dump. now i know why they have to pay celebs so much to go here.  if they weren't getting paid, they wouldnt be caught dead here.  and as far as sushi goes, if you want an impressive meal, head to nobu or sushi roku (see my review). my next nightclub experience will probably be at xs, it looks waaaay better.",

Kobe Ribeye</mark> our waiter suggested), the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (he suggested two appetizer portions as opposed to one main which was the same price and we got more fish), and the buddha's vegetables. all were delicious and the perfect amount of food for the group. \n\nwe finished off with the oversized fortune cookie which came with a fortune for everyone and was fun to share. \n\noverall it was a fun dining experience as long as your are ok with sharing plates (which i am).",

            "this review is for the restaurant only. \n\nwell, the wait was about 40 minutes on a saturday night. whatever, i expected it. luckily they give you a pager and there are some shops around to kill time. plus theres a room full of couches to wait around on, and a small bar as well as cock<mark>Tai</mark> waitresses that will be more than happy to bring you $700 bottles. \n\nthe food was pretty good. a lot of the \"fancy food i have no idea what this is\" type stuff on the menu. but if you're into the fancy stuff you'll like it.\n\nour waiter was super awesome. i expected some douche baggery at this place with the staff but everyone seemed pretty nice and even most of the security at the door were pretty nice guys. but back to the waiter, he hooked us up with drinks and was very helpful with menu questions. unfortunately no \"group drink\" bowls for alcohol. those are always fun and this would be the perfect place. \n\nthe theme here is pretty cool too. you've got the buddhist stuff going on, it's very dark, and theres a giant statue on one wall. they've got loud music going the whole time, not like club loud, but you cer<mark>Tai</mark> can't have a quiet conversation. \n\nwould i go back? maybe. i don't regret going though. if you eat here you get free entrance to the club. gotta get a stamp!",

            "i love everything about this place!  it's a restaurant/night club at the venetian.  when we called for reservations, the frist available time was at 11:15 pm. one of my male friends said that he and his friends had a difficult time getting in the last time they were in vegas.   \n\nwe got there and we had to wait a few minutes at the lounge for our table.  people were already partying and they got us free drinks, yes!\n\nthis place is very trendy, very hip.  the decor and lighting was perfect and  there were at least 2 giant buddhas that i saw.  it was a very nice touch, added to the elegance of the place.\n\nthe one thing we did not like is that it's hard to talk to everyone at the table during the meal.  loud music was busting from the night club.  if you are looking to get that intimate conversation going on, this is not a good place.  but then,  that gave us time to just enjoy our great meal.\n\nwe had ordered:\n<mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>\npork <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with thai chili sauce\nblack pepper sizzled <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with udon noodles\n<mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>\nmandarin sizzled <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with <mark>Lacquered Roast Pork</mark>\n<mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>\nchai kiss\nchocolate lave for dessert\n\ni won't even try to describe each of them.  everything on our table was oh so good.  there was nothing that we didn't like.  we also ordered cock<mark>Tai</mark> and they were refreshing.  all was good good good.\n\nafter dinner, we hit the club.  we liked the kind of music they were playing.  the dance floor was great.  it was packed and crowded. \n\nwe just had a good time here.  this is definitely a must go restaurant/nightclub in vegas.", 
            "if you stay at the venetian hotel in las vegas, it's hard not to see all the ads for tao. my boyfriend and i failed to get into the nightclub the night we arrived, but he wanted to give their \"spiritual dining\" a chance, so we ate dinner here the night before we left.\n\ntao is huge. and i love their asian-themed decor. but it looks like it'd be impossible to get a seat without a reservation. they just get that much traffic, and we still had to wait about 10 minutes before getting our reserved table. our server darren was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu and specials. there were lots to mention. just like sushi roku, we discovered that it's customary (at least in these fine dining places) to have two servers: one to take your order and check-in, and the other to bring you your food and drinks.\n\nit took us forever to order, but because it took us 5 mins. to figure out we had to close our menu to order. lesson learned! i started off my appetizers with an orient express cock<mark>Tai</mark> ($13) with kahlua and vanilla liqueur.  my <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> (which were green!) and crunchy cucumbers (japanese style, bitter like ginger) for $10 satisfied my grumbling stomach quite well. \n\nmy main was <mark>Buddha's Harmonized Vegetable Feast for the Minor Gods</mark>, which was an entree-sized udon in sesame & black peppercorn sauce with red pepper, onions, bok choy, asparagus, and brussel sprouts to top it off ($17). a vegetarian feast indeed. the dish came in a bowl which made it less messy than it probably would have been had it come on a plate, but i wasn't expecting the amount of spice. still, a great veggie entree (maybe the only veggie entree!).\n\ntip: the restrooms say \"yin\" and \"yang.\" yin is for the women and yang is for the men. \n\ndarren offered us a menu of \"temptation\" which was the right word for it. i could barely get any more food in my stomach so i wanted ice cream. and i got to choose 3 different scoops: white chocolate & yuzu, cocunut, and green tea with almond cookies and even pocky sticks ($8) - bonus. the thing is, i think the yuzu (a japanese fruit much like tangerine) was overpowering the white chocolate, or else they were two separate flavours and they brought me the wrong one. i couldn't finish the scoops anyway, because we also got two chocolate fortune cookies!\n\nthe vegas magazines say this restaurant is only a $30 meal, but we spent about double that including drinks, appetizers and dessert.\n\ntao restaurant is truly a religious dining experience as they say. you probably have to be the type to appreciate asian food, the 20-foot buddha foun<mark>Tai</mark>, and the ancient pipe display on the wall, but i'm glad i dined here on my trip - it's a restaurant like no other i've seen in any of my travels.",

            "where: located inside tao nightclub (downs<mark>Tai</mark>)\n\nwhat: my girls and i come here to redeem our complimentary dinners once in a while.  i haven't actually sat down and payed for a meal here so i have no idea what the prices look like, but i know that the food was worth my tip!!\n\nthe all-girl complimentary dinner includes:\n-one round of shots for the girls of the party (lemon drop, washington apple, or their tao special)\n-edimame beans\n-<mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>\n-asian seasoned salad\n-about 3 rolls of sushi\n-sweet pork\n-dumplings\n-<mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark>\n-<mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark>\n-and you are able to choose a specialty drink from the list of drinks for free!\n-for dessert, a tao-made fortune cookie with a sexy/funny fortune! =d\n\nyuupppp!! our dinner came with all of that!! it was so much food, i don't think we were able to go up to the club to dance right after!

            "i was in las vegas helping a friend with an art show and stayed at the venetian where i experienced the yumminess that is tao.  \n\ni was dining alone which some people can't muster but i keep great company with myself and tend to talk to strangers lol!  \n\ni made the earliest reservations possible but still had to wait 15 mins which was totally okay because while i was waiting i won $400 on some weird monkey slot machine nearby.  i told the hostess what happened and handed her $20 as a celebratory tip which of course she reciprocated by seating me at a really nice table.\n\nbesides referencing my fellow yelper's feedback, i sometimes like to preview menus online before dining out so i have a couple of choices instead of randomly ordering.  here are the choices i divulged in and all were really delicious:\n\n<mark>Lacquered Roast Pork</mark>   $12\ntoro fatty tuna                $15 per piece\n<mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark>     $15\ntempura <mark>Sweet Potato</mark>     $4\n\n(blurb from website)\nspecializing in hong kong chinese, japanese and thai cuisines, chef ralph scamardella's creations include everything from <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> to traditional peking duck, all prepared by master chefs from across asia.\n\nat 42,000 square feet, tao's enter<mark>Tai</mark> complex is among the largest in the world and features las vegas' hippest nightclub, coolest ultra-lounge, largest banquet facility and of course, the hottest restaurant in town. this \"asian city's\" d\\u00e9cor includes lush velvets and silks, waterfalls and century old woods and stones, and a hand-carved 20-foot-tall buddha floating peacefully above an infinity pool complete with japanese koi.", 
            "my friend was in town and we wanted to go somewhere with a \"scene,\" that simultaneously had good food.  needless to say, tao was not the right spot for us.  as for the \"scene,\" tao pretty much hits the mark.  it is a beautiful restaurant, dimly lit, and plenty of las vegas visitors looking for a good time.  as for the food, it was very mediocre.  i will not be returning.  on a busy saturday night in las vegas without a reservation, we waited for our table for about 30 minutes.  not bad, huh?  well with the 40 bucks we tipped the hostess to get a table at all, i was expecting to be seated right away.  i want my 40 bucks back! oh well, live and learn.  on to the food.  between the two of us we split the chefs special roll, shrimp tempura roll, spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> crunchy onion roll, <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark>, <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, and edamame.  sounds like a lot of food, but the portions are small.  this was definitely enough food for us though.  the sushi was really not impressive.  yes, the fish is fresh, but unless you are ordering sashimi, it is still possible to get a bad roll.  well, we got three.  the worst was the shrimp tempura roll.  so small! so bland! so boring! come on, if you are going to list this a chefs speciality, it better be special.  the other two rolls were a little better, but both sitting on top of a heavy mayo sauce that did not taste good.  this is my pet peeve.  leave off the heavy sauce people! especially if it tastes like crap.  the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> were pretty decent, i could only eat one because they were rich, turn your stomach kind of rich- too saucy, too salty, too something.  i will say the <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was pretty good.  this \"healthier\" version of <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was packed with veggies and had a great flavor, the only downfall here is that it was served to us ice cold.  the best thing at this restaurant by far was the <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark>! i swear these should be on every asian restaurant menu.  i cant imagine it is too difficult to roast these bad boys up, but regardless, tao did a good job here.  if you haven't tried these peppers before, please try them!  i wouldn't steer you in the wrong direction.  anyway, i may come back to tao for a drink, but as for food, i will take my sushi/ asian craving elsewhere.", 
            "my husband surprised me and got reservations here for my birthday.  the only thing was the reservation was a tad early at 5:30p.  great dining experience and great cock<mark>Tai</mark>.  i got the wasabi en<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> and it was delicious!", 
            "while i've been to tao several times for cock<mark>Tai</mark>  i had never dined there before.  my most recent vegas excursion rectified that minor de<mark>Tai</mark>.\n\nfrom the moment we entered the restaurant, to the time we left, service was attentive and friendly.  i started off the evening by ordering my favorite cock<mark>Tai</mark>, the tao-tini.  if you've never had a tao-tini, i highly suggest you do so asap.  \n\nwe ordered multiple items off the menu for our dinner, including the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> satay as an appetizer.  after watching the vegas edition of \"the best thing i ever ate\" on food network, we wanted to try this highly touted app.  i am so happy we did!  that was seriously one of the best foods i've ever had the pleasure of eating.  everything else was just as yummy.  tuna tar tar, <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>, halibut, etc. etc.  we all loved the food. \n\ni can't wait until my next trip to vegas so i can go back to dine at tao on all of their wonderful food...and to have another tao-tini.  ;)", 
            "we decided to go to dinner here after seeing a show.  it was very crowded since it is probably the #1 nightclub in vegas and the line to get into the club was wrapped around the atrium.  we showed up for our 10:15p reservation and was told they were running a little late so 10:15 turned into about 1045p or later.  we decided to sit at the bar and order some sushi and a drink.  both the sushi and the mango martini were very good.  we then sat at a table and ordered the shrimp <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> and kung pao chicken.  both dishes were really good and the portions were very generous.  service was good as well.  while you are waiting for your table it is very enter<mark>Tai</mark> and i would definitely recommend trying this restaurant if you are in the mood for asian food.", 
            "this was my second time dining at tao and this was a far better experience than the first. we were seated promptly in a romantic booth on the far side of the restaurant near the gigantic buddha on the first floor.\n\nif there was a way to take home and/or replicate the decor of tao, i would in an instant. (i'm a sucker for asian decor, but i digress.)\n\nthe service was phenomenal. our waiter was extremely knowledgeable on the menu, although he did try to sell us on the most expensive things available (go figure.) we had show reservations at nyny and we were finished with more than enough time to spare.\n\nmy boyfriend had the hamachi (yellow<mark>Tai</mark>) to start with. the fish was fresh and delicious, although the sushi rice left something to be desired. for an entree, he had the hong kong xo shrimp with <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark> and <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>, which he loved.\n\neating out for me has been pretty rough lately since i developed some weird food intolerances. there's very little in the way of flavorful food that i can have without giving me a terrible stomachache. \n\nsince i'm not a fan of seafood, i decided to go with the <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> with crunchy cucumbers and a side of <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>. these were the best dumplings both my boyfriend and i had *ever* had (and probably will ever have.) if you like vegetables at all, you have to get these. so full of flavor and healthy to boot! we joked at the end of the meal that we'd come back and just get four orders of these dumplings.", 
            "how do i say this, ok the food is mediocre at best. it's not terrible just average and not worth the hefty prices they charge for entrees. the best dish we had was the side of eggplant, it was really tasty and so much of it enough for 5 people. \n\nthe cock<mark>Tai</mark> were good but overpriced as well. \n\nthe best thing i can say about tao is the service they are very attentive which i'm sure isn't easy considering how dark and loud it is in there. what makes having dinner at tao worth the money is you get your hand stamped and don't have to stand in the unbelievable line that is waiting to get in the hottest club in vegas. once we finished our dinner we went downs<mark>Tai</mark> and out to get in the no-line, line we waited 5 minutes at the most. the club is <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> and i'm glad we went to dinner so we could just walk right in. \n\nnext time i go to vegas if i want to go to the club again i would go for dinner first, i would definitely go early the crowd is unbelievable. \n\nif your not planning on going to the club there are better asian-fusion restaurants so save your money.", 
            "came here for a bachelorette party and was totally pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. with vegas, it's usually hit or miss with the trendy spots, and i was prepared for a miss. \n\nwe had a pre-selected menu that consisted of a variety of foods -- all were delicious. bamboo steamed <mark>Chicken Gyoza</mark>, <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark>, tofu <mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark> were all delicious! (the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> were my favorite). \n\nthen...the dessert. my god the dessert. so delicious. we received the chef's symphony of sweets which included (i don't know the real names...) a giant fortune cookie filled with chocolate and vanilla whipped cream, apple pie empanada-esque with vanilla ice cream, banana/chocolate <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark>, mochi ice cream.\n\nyum! i would definitely go back. there were also 12 of us and we each paid $70 (including tip and cock<mark>Tai</mark>) so it was also a pretty decent deal!", 
            "my bf and i had dinner here one of the nights of our vegas stay. we were seated immediately. the decor was beautiful. i love the large buddha statue in the restaurant. the music was super loud. i suppose i was okay with that since i knew it turned into a nightclub afterwards. the actual nightclub is just located ups<mark>Tai</mark>. the service was okay. i didn't mind since my beverage cup was never empty and my food came out in a timely manner. \nwe had ordered yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce, <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>, <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark>, an assortment of tempura, miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, sand pot lobster/shrimp/<mark>Scallop</mark> with black bean sauce, <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark> and <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark>. everything we ordered was pretty much delicious. i cer<mark>Tai</mark> will be back to try other things on the menu. \ni loved how after dinner, we were allowed to walk ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the club without waiting in line or paying an entrance fee. we were stamped and set for the night. :)", 
            "beautiful place, uber trendy, great drinks and amazing food located inside the venetian hotel. we were here with a group of 13 for a birthday party. the service was great, although we had reservations we still had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated. i think everyone loved their food. it is a bit pricey but its such a great spot. i got a couple of tempura dishes (<mark>Sweet Potato</mark> and avocado) and some type <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> dish. my husband tried sushi and something else and we are both a fan. it turns into a club ups<mark>Tai</mark> at night and it's free to get in as long as you get your hand stamped. however, you still have to go back outside and wait in line again to go into the club. the club was too crowded, loud, and had a much younger crowd that what i would have liked so we didn't enjoy the club portion but the restaurant is a must do!", 
            "the atmosphere sexy and loungy. perfect place for date or friend gathering. the meals  size is huge and excellent for sharing. if you have any diet restrictions of salt or high fat make sure that the waiter aware of it. we ordered spring veggie rolls, beef  appetizer and for the main course we picked the sired tuna, with \"over salted\" spinach and \"overly\"  fried coconut-shrimp with the side dish salad. the mochi desert was impressively tasty. also the cock<mark>Tai</mark> list was nice.", 
            "dropped by for dinner before heading ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the club portion of the establishment.\n\nwe ordered waaaaayyy too much food, which was fine by me since it was my last night in vegas on this trip.  might as well go out with a bang right? \n\nanyways, some highlights of the meal included the following:\n\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>\n-<mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>\n-<mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers\n-toro sashimi\n-<mark>Salmon Sashimi</mark>\n-mini donuts for desert\n\nthe thing that amazed me about this place is that the food is worth eating.  the dining room is a scene and it is enormous.  it is quite a feat that the kitchen is able to keep up with the dining room considering how large it is.  and given the people watching here, some restaurants might try to get away with the fact that their dining room is filled with a large number of scantily clad women.  tao avoids that trap and serves up some pretty tasty asian dishes and has the service to see that it gets served right.", 
            "tao is often overlooked when one thinks of dining in vegas, but give it a chance - you will be pleasantly surprised! i like to take my out-of-town guests here for a one-stop dinner/club experience and we always have an amazing meal and an amazing time.\n\ni have pretty much tried everything on the menu at this point and i've never had a dish i didn't like. there are two dishes that i adore and frequently re-order: (warning, i get pretty cheesy about the following dishes)\n\n the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>\n*located in the \"from the sea\" section of the menu\n\noh my gosh, the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.... this would very likely be my last meal on earth! the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is usually prepared to the perfect melt-in-your mouth consistency with a subtle miso glaze that delicately balances the flavor of the fish. on a few occasions it came out slightly overdone and they happily sent out another one.\n\n<mark>Salmon Sashimi</mark> with avocado, crispy onions\n*located in the \"special dishes\" section of the menu\n\nthis is one of those genius dishes that seems so simple until you take that first magical bite. the combination of texture and flavor is mind-blowing. the <mark>Salmon Sashimi</mark>, avocado, and sweet and spicy sesame sauce flavors with just a hint of crispy onions brilliantly balance each other like like a symphony of flavors in your mouth! \n\nafter you finish your incredible meal, tao will send you off with a naughty little fortune cookie. and if you're lucky, maybe it will come true ;) hey, it's vegas!\n\nso do yourself a favor and check it out. if you have a night of clubbing ahead, you can usually get escorted into the nightclub ups<mark>Tai</mark> from your table.\n\ntip: if you're just a small party of 2-3 and they don't have any reservations available at the time you want, you can usually just head back to the sushi bar and get a seat right away.", 
            "it'd been a while since i'd eaten at tao; i have a tendency to think of it more as a club than a restaurant (i have a feeling the staff does too). the host made us wait and said \"i'll see what i can do\" when we said we didn't have a reservation, giving us the impression that they might be booked. inside, there were enough tables to make my girlfriend and i roll our eyes. \n\n the good: the drinks were amazing. we had the tiger lilly and the black pearl. the desert was also amazing (molten chocolate cake with coconut ice cream).  my girlfriend really liked the <mark>Spicy Smoked Salmon Roll</mark>. we thought the jalape\\u00f1o yellow<mark>Tai</mark> was decent. the decor is really pretty. \n\n the bad: the bus staff rushed around us and passed things over our head unsteadily. it makes it hard to relax when you worry that your girlfriend is going to get trampled because she's near a service entrance. the waiter was nice, but paced the meal poorly, so we spent a lot of time just waiting after we finished our jalape\\u00f1o yellow<mark>Tai</mark>. the music was also very loud and made it hard for us to hear each other or the waiter.\n\nthe ugly: the sushi wasn't fresh. the wild yellow<mark>Tai</mark>, the white tuna and the hawaiian snapper were all virtually indistinguishable because they shared a common tinge of whatever coolers they were in. the <mark>Crispy Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll was pretty tasteless and the sauce didn't add anything other than moisture to a dry roll. \n\n  my tiny girlfriend was hungry again after a couple of hours in the casino and we ended up going for another meal, so was that $130+tip we spent at tao worth it?",

            "my husband and i were in vegas celebrating our recent marriage and we made reservations at tao for dinner. we were staying at the venetian, so it seemed appropriate that we went here for dinner, plus we heard you get free access to lavo (the other club at the palazzo) if you eat there.\n\nwe had 8:30 reservations and when we got to the place on a tuesday night, we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. the place did not seem that crowded, especially for a weeknight. anyways, once we were seated, we told the waiter about the reason for our trip and he said we would be taken care of! after browsing the menu we settled on <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> ($35) and <mark><mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> Noodles</mark> with chicken ($19) and we each had a specialty cock<mark>Tai</mark>. the <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> might have been the best thing i have ever eaten. it was fabulous. i know it was my husband's favorite meal of the entire trip. i mean, <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> from most chinese restaurants is pretty good, but then when you add <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> to the dish- it takes it to a whole new level! the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> was pretty good too, but the star of the meal was the <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark>.\n\nafter our meal, our waiter brought us over 2 glasses of champagne and we weer able to choose a dessert for free. we selected the yuzu sugar dusted donuts with a trio of 3 dipping sauces. omg these were amazing. they were warm and crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. the dipping sauces made this dessert extra special. \n\nwe had great service here, the decor was very romantic and i would definitely go back to this place next time i am in vegas!", 
            "so i have not had a meal hear, but this place is awesome for dancing and drinks!  \n\na tip: get on the list and get their by 10:30 to avoid a wait and/or a cover for the gentlemen in your party.  sometimes ladies even get an open bar on cer<mark>Tai</mark> nights!", 
            "omg amazing!  we went as a group of 9 people.  we all ordered drinks and the waitress was really helpful in helping us decide which ones to choose.  for appetizers we had the spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> roll and some scallop/<mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark>, gyoza, and some fried triangle thing.  the sushi rolls and gyoza were my favorite.  the triangle thing was good but it wasn't as good as the other appetizers.  i specifically ordered <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> pot lobster and other seafood.  it was good.  i tried my friends <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and it was delicious.  i only had a piece but it was perfect.  i would definitely recommend it!  the only thing is that it's kinda dark and after a cer<mark>Tai</mark> time the music starts to get clubby.", 
            "aside from the overhype that comes from being associated with a kardashian, tao does serve decent asian food that is actually priced pretty well.the atmosphere and decor at the restaurant is really interesting and definitely blends the theme together.  i ordered buddha's harmonized vegetable feast and had a taste of my friend's <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> as well.  both dishes were delicious.  the vegetables were cooked just right and so tasty, and the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> had just enough peanut and spice in it.  i also enjoyed the tao-tini off of their specialty cock<mark>Tai</mark> menu. it's a little sweet, so one drink was enough for me.  be sure to make a reservation because the restaurant is very popular and will fill up very quickly.  if you'd like to go to the night club (which i definitely recommend!) ask your waiter to stamp you. you get free entry to the night club if you eat dinner at the restaurant.", 
            "i will start by saying that this was once my favorite restaurant in las vegas, but i doubt that i will be back. i actually ate here twice on this trip to las vegas and i was extremely disappointed both times. the first time we went we ordered a couple of appetizers and a few sushi rolls. the lobster wonton was good but the sushi rolls were not. they came out 2 minutes after ordering them meaning that they had been made well in advance and they were no where near as good as in the past. we also got several piecess of salmon, tuna and yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi. in the past they would have brought us one big tray with all of this sushi as well as lemon, cucumber and other extras that drastically change the flavor of the sushi in a good way. this time it was quickly thrown on a small plate and it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while.\n\ni ended going again because some other friends had just gotten in town and wanted to try it out. once again i was disappointed. the sashimi was still way over priced. we go the yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi with jalapenos and ponzu and it was good but not $20 good for 4 small (really small) pieces. the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was good but not good enough to out weigh the negatives.\n\nthe atmosphere is still fun but it is slightly louder then i remember. you can tell that the place is going downhill in popularity as well since there were over 50% of the tables were empty on a friday night at 9:00.", 
            "if you're in vegas & you don't visit tao, you are missing out! \n\nask for geoffrey to be your waiter, if he is available. he recommends the most delicious dishes and describes them down to the very last de<mark>Tai</mark>. he truly made our dining experience one to remember. \n\nthe sushi <mark>Spicy Shrimp, King Crab, and Asparagus Roll</mark> were alright, nothing crazy. the <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> is very delicious. i had a <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark> vegetable dish with noodles. it was very filling. my boyfriend had the <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> carpaccio topped by a baby arugula salad. i am not a fan of raw meat, yet i tried it and it was unbelievably fresh. \n\nthe dessert plate included edible chopsticks and the fortune cookies had very interesting messages inside. \n\nkeep in mind, this restaurant is very dark and has a nightclub and lounge within the three story premise.",

            "i appreciate a fine dining experience as much as the next guy and am cer<mark>Tai</mark> not opposed to dropping the kind of coin it cost for such an experience. however, tao in the venetian in las vegas was nothing short of a major disappointment. our dinner consisted of two people, one drink each, two apps, two entres (i had the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>) and one dessert. tab with tip was just short of $180.\n\nthe service was exceptional as expected but the food, our primary reason for booking this visit, was just average. i would suggest ra as i have eaten there a number of times and it never disappoints.", 
            "great location, great menu, great vibe, great waiter, fun creative food.\n\nfor starters we did the crunchy spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> roll and the alaskan salmon crab and avocado roll - would have been happy if all we'd had was the sushi!  for dinner we had the <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>, the tile fish special (my favorite), a filet shabu shabu (asian fondue) and the mandarin sizzled <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with shrimp - loved it. i loved it all.....\n\njust go for yourself - it's worth the ride!",

            "oh, tao - i so badly wanted to give you 5 stars, but your over-hyped restaurant had some sever issues we need to address. 3 out of 5 stars for delicious food but terrible customer service. word to the wise: tao = a place where the customer is always wrong.\n\nhere's the skinny: we dined 11 deep saturday evening while in town celebrating my 32nd birthday. it's memorial day weekend and expected to be a madhouse in vegas, so i made every precaution to secure reservations, be on time for said reservations and ensure my entire party was on time with me. i may not be kim kardashian, but perhaps the manager failed to note that my reservation was made by someone who works directly with them and asked for my party to be taken care of. i'm also assuming they didn't know that i am a celebrity publicist in la and have sent numerous clients to spend thousands of dollars at their establishment. maybe if this was noted my party would have received better service. \n\nfood: my boyfriend and i split the chicken dumplings, the spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sushi roll and the chicken <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>. more than enough food! the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> seemed to be in a never-ending bowl! it alone would have fed the 2 of us easily. the dumplings were the best choice out of our order. fresh, steamed and flavorful. i only wish there were more in an order! the roll was good, but nothing special. my friend had the bbq pork and it was phenomenal. i'd look into that if bbq meats are your thing. the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> was pretty standard. it was also good but nothing to write home about. nonetheless, i was pleased with the overall good experience. the crowning glory was the giant fortune cookie that was sent out for my birthday (it is filled with both vanilla and chocolate cream - oh hey ying yang!) - which was the only good move by the restaurant the entire meal.\n\nthe service: this is where things get rough. we sat down for our 8:30pm reservation around 8:45pm. we didn't mind the 15 minute wait. we're a large party and it's saturday night - reservations can take some time. i get it. we sat down and didn't see a waitress for nearly 20 minutes. when she finally came by the table she took our drink order and bounced for another 20 minutes or so. my friend asked for an iced tea that 40 minutes later had never made it's way to the table. when we asked about it, the waitress took another 15 minutes to bring it claiming that they had to \"brew a new pot\". ok. then when we were an hour and a half into our dinner order waiting for more beverages the waitress was m.i.a. we finally called over the manager and asked if we could please get some drinks (one of which had already been ordered and never brought to the table). his response was \"what? are you trying to get something free out of this?\". i'm sorry? no. we are trying to get our drinks and spend more money in your establishment. wow. the next epic failure of this restaurant/nightclub comes from the security guard/staff. my boyfriend got up from the table to take a work related call. it was noisy inside so he stepped outside to take it. when he came back in a security guard grabbed him by his shirt and said \"where do you think you're going?! get in line!\" to which my boyfriend responded - \"i've been sitting with a table of 11 for nearly 2 hours. i just stepped outside to take a call.\" the guard then responded \"yeah right\" and grabbed him by his shirt collar. when he turned around to radio someone my boyfriend just yanked himself free and walked inside. the final straw was when the waitress asked if we'd like to divide the tab. we said yes and tried to be fair by <mark>Maki</mark> a few groups so as not to create 11 separate checks for her. tik-tok - 1 hour later (literally) she plopped down the checks with a look of irritation and left. \n\ntotal time in restaurant (due to slow service) - 3.5 hours!! it was nearly midnight when we finally left!\n\nthe club was hopping but we were not interested in that. we just wanted a nice dinner in what seemed to be only a mildly busy restaurant. a party of 11 would have left a much bigger tip had the service been respectable. i get that everyone wants to dine here, but that doesn't mean you have to stop creating a great customer experience for those choosing your restaurant. there are many other options.", 
            "after eating here a couple time this last experience was lack luster. the beef tarter rolls were so disgusting we didn't even eat more than 2 bites. it was slightly warm, mushy, and the texture made my skin crawl. the signature <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is why i usually like coming to eat here and it's been always great in the past but the combination duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was hard and seemed like it had been sitting out. the fried whole fish was pretty good, i ate everything from the <mark>Tai</mark> to the eyeball and was pretty pleased with it. the <mark>Peking Duck <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> were bland and our <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> were tasteless and chewy which wasn't good at all. during this last dinner at tao we ordered $240.00 worth of food between the 2 of us and was only happy with the snapper, <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. the appetizers were all a disappointment and even our 4 drinks weren't made to our liking. \n although i've had a good experience at tao before, this last one wasn't good at all. not sure if we will return again but who knows what will happen while in vegas right?", 
            "first of all this is one of our favorite restaurants in vegas, whether we're just eating dinner or celebrating a special occasion.  everything on the menu is delicous and the cock<mark>Tai</mark>  hands down are some of the best that i've ever had.  dont forget to order the giant fortune cookie for dessert, it doesnt dissapoint.", 
            "terrible service and not a good experience at all.\n\nit is very clear that this restaurant only welcomes those for whom money is of no consequence as they literally tried to take as much money from us as possible.\n\nfirst of all, we were asked, \"still or sparkling?\" thinking these were our only choices and still must equal tap water, we asked for still. that was a $24 mistake. although we ended up getting the manager to take it off our bill, it caused a huge hassle.\n\nwhen ordering my $14 vegetarian meal, the waiter stopped me mid-sentence and told me i needed to try their kung pau tofu dish. although mildly annoyed to be told my choice was wrong, i was excited to try this off-menu item. \\u00a0it ended up being too spicy for my taste and i switched meals with someone else. \\u00a0fast -forward to when the check came and i found out the meal he had convinced me to order was almost twice the price of the meal i originally had picked out. needless to say, i felt a little cheated.\n\nthe meal i did end up eating was good.... vegan <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> with gluten free noodles. (yes, it was also appreciated that they had gf options!) \\u00a0we were also able to use their buy-one-get-one promotion for cock<mark>Tai</mark> as it was happy hour. however, everyone at the table was really disappointed and rather indignant at the service that was given.\\u00a0\n\nthe cuisine was good but the experience was marred by the sub-par service and the costly extras.", 
            "we went here last night with a birthday party of 14. we arrived early but had to wait 45 minutes after our reservation to be seated which really made a lot of us cranky and frustrated.  when they sat us on the main floor we noticed an empty elevated long table section near us that was totally empty and could have accommodated us. the energy of the birthday girl was off at this point but we tried to cheer up the mood. we ordered the $75 per person family style menu because everyone was so hungry and agitated we knew if we all ordered individually it would further throw the party into a black hole.  some guests were just saying bring out food, anything will do. \n\nthe line for the night club portion was piling up and packing the s<mark>Tai</mark> which was horrible because it became a major task just to get to the restroom on the 2nd floor.  security initially told the girls that was the only one while we were initially waiting to be seated so we did not know any better that there was a restroom on the main floor. \n\na girl came around and stamped our wrists and told us this is to get into the club ups<mark>Tai</mark> after we finish dinner which seemed like a cool option that the restaurant seemed to give patrons and we decided that we would stay for the club after dinner instead of hesding out to ballagio.  this later became a ridiculous ordeal because as we went up the packed s<mark>Tai</mark> with our entire party the bouncer at the top stated that the stamp now did not give us admission but got us past the line outside. he told us to all go to the front door. \n\nthe look of disgust on the birthday girls face summed it up and trying to patronize the place further would just lead to further aggravation. \n\nthe only reason i gave this place one star is because the food was really good but i can't be really sure because when you are starving anything tastes good and some of the girls last meal was around noon so we were pretty hungry.", 
            "the food is great. they have great vegetarian options as well. excellent sushi, <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark>, <mark>Scallop</mark>, chicken, tempura, etc. there are many wine selections as well as premium cock<mark>Tai</mark>.  the giant fortune cookie for dessert is a must. the atmosphere, while a little dark, is very cool. i plan on going there as often as possible. it's a bit pricy but it's vegas.", 
            "we went as a company on business. the service was outstanding and the food was better. if you want a meal, cock<mark>Tai</mark> and a great place to visit, this will blow you away. there was not a food they served that did not please the palate.", 
            "this is another restaurant that i ate at while on my honeymoon.  we stayed at the venetian and thought it looked like a fabulous place.  \n\nthe restaurant itself is beautiful.  there are tubs filled with flowers as you walk in.  the decor is really pretty and there is a huge buddah statue in the restaurant.\n\nthey have a nice sized menu.  i would have given them 5 stars but there were a couple of things i found weird.  i am a vegetarian and told this to the waiter.  he helped me out by telling me what was safe to eat.  there was a side of broccoli and he told me it was made with chicken stock.  the food tasted freshly prepared (which for the price i would hope it is) so i don't really understand why the dish could not be made vegetarian as other restaurants do for me.  i ended up ordering <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> and asked if they could add pineapple because i saw they used it in another dish.  the waiter told me he could ask but was not sure the chef would do it.  they did not as he tried to make a nice gesture and brought me some raw pineapple on the side when my rice came out.  again, i think it is weird that the chef would be so rigid.\n\nother than that i have to say the food was delicious.  my rice was very good.  the <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> were so good we got a second order. the vegetable sides i was able to order were tasty.  my husband had a <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> dish and said other than some peppers being overwhelming was good as well.  \n\nduring the reservation we were asked if we were celebrating anything so we let them know we came to vegas to get married.  they did bring us a surprise dessert which was a great gesture.  it was a huge fortune cookie that when cracked open con<mark>Tai</mark> what tasted like both a chocolate and a vanilla mousse.  whatever it was, it was adorable and tasted very nice.  i did enjoy the experience and the food and would love to eat here again next time i visit vegas.", 
            "i ordered the pork pot stickers, they were very good. also ordered <mark>Hot or Cold Edamame</mark> which were decent. sushi was very good but expected. i ordered the jordan cabernet which was $120, about twice what it re<mark>Tai</mark>. i then ordered one of the most expensive items on the menu which was <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark> lobster, super salty, a little weird, should have gotten the miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. the highlight was the deep friend bread pudding, which was one of the best desserts i have ever ever eaten. the fortune cookie dessert was not very good, looked good though. i then got a warre's 1985 port which was amazing. i would pass on this one, way better restaurants in vegas.", 
            "great atmosphere! my husband and i came here right after we landed in vegas and arrived at our hotel (venetian). our flight was delayed and they were very amenable to delaying our reservation. the ambience is very loungy though the nightclub is ups<mark>Tai</mark> which has a very different feel (you would never know though!). \n\nour food was excellent. my husband got the <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>, i got <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and we shared shrimp <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> they were all very good. but the start of the show surprisingly was the maki roll we ordered for our appetizer, crispy spicy tuna with avocado. we love sushi and this was one of the best sushi experiences we have ever had. we're considering going back for just sushi. it was so fresh and tasty. \n\nlastly, if you eat at tao restaurant, you get free admission into the nightclub which was a little intense for me but worth checking out! overall great experience. would definitely go back on my next visit to vegas.", 
            "a must try. jewel in the bunch of restaurants in between the venetian / plazzo. tried <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, very very tasty. tried lobster dumplings again very tasty and juicy. dessert selection is very good. cock<mark>Tai</mark> are a bit expensive side as compare to wines but they are all worth a try.\n\nmust go!!", 
            "i have no idea what people are seeing in this restaurant.  this place is like a mediocre p.f. chang's you wait twice as long and pay twice as much for.  there are too many amazing restaurants in vegas to waste your time here. turn around and head out, do not pass go and save your $200.  seriously, if you have any sort of culinary expectations look for another option.  if you're looking for naked girls in bathtubs, this may be your place (although, no girls in the bathtubs the night we came). \n\na group of co-workers were all here for a conference and decided to try this place out since we were staying at the venetian.  we made a reservation for 8:30 and when we arrived were told we would be seated 'in a few moments' 40 minutes later (and a few times getting the run around by the guy in charge of seating), we finally got to a table.   \n\ntao highlights the modern asian fusion movement on their menu.  unfortunately they also have tried to mask their lack of flavor in dishes by <mark>Maki</mark> them overly salty or overly sweet.  this makes everything taste like it's a microwave dinner or some sort of bad chinese takeout.  \n\nwe tried the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> (way too much sauce that was overly sweet with very little spice element, kinda tasted like one you can buy out of a bottle), <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> (decent, but the shrimp toast was the highlight), <mark><mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark> Bao Buns</mark> (the pork was again way too sweet and the bun had too much dough to pork ratio, this was barely edible),  <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> (another overly sweet dish that was deemed not even as good as chinese takeout), <mark>Grilled 12 oz. Kobe Ribeye</mark> (no way this is real kobe, despite assurances from our server. it was tough and hard to cut, we had real kobe at gordon ramsey's the next night and there was no comparison) and a few sushi/<mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark> (decent, but the rice wasn't well flavored. we had better sushi at the buffet). \n\nour waiter was very nice and attentive, but there were cer<mark>Tai</mark> elements of dishes that were left off (rice for the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark>, asked for sauce on the side for a couple dishes that wasn't done).  all in all a truly regrettable experience from start to finish. their fortunes for their cookies were pretty funny though.", 
            "i don't get it. we had a reservation for 9:45pm and after inquiring several times, finally got seated at 10:30 pm. so, i thought, this must be amazing food! the food here was no better than your average pei wei/pf changs. $13/a small bowl (less than 2 cups) of <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> is outrageous. we ordered <mark>Scallop</mark>, <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> $39, <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> $28, and <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark> for 4 of us. my husband and i had green tea and the other couple had one drink each. the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the shrimp were the better of the four dishes, in my opinion. the <mark>Scallop</mark> were large, there were 4. they were soaked in a curry sauce, which i did not care for. the service was just o k, although the server said one dish of rice would be plenty, but after each one of us had 2-3 tablespoons, another dish was ordered (another $13)f the bill was probably $230 including tip.\n\nthe worst of all was the noise level. there were bunches of girls in short dresses with 6 inch heels scampering ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the nightclub at $60 a head. the noise, oh the noise! we had to sit in silence while eating because the music level and the bass was so incredibly deafening, we could not hear anything but bass.  by the time we were done with dinner, i had a horrible headache. \n\nif you don't need to worry about how much you spend, and you like very trendy, loud restaurants with mediocre food and naked girls in bathtubs, then this place is for you!",

            "this is my 2nd time at tao ... and it's better than i remembered! \n\nfor a cock<mark>Tai</mark> i had \"bubbles and berries\" which is served on the rocks with veuve yellow label, belvedere, st. germain and strawberries!!!! it was a hit!!\n\nwe had a feast served family style!!!\n\nshishito pepper- a little spice, cooked and marinated!\n\nsushi - eel avocado roll and <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> were the best!\n\nedamame- nothing special. \n\n<mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark>- huge! cut in half great for sharing! \n\ntofu <mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark>- tasty. good even got those that do eat meat. \n\nbbq pork- not a fan. not marinated enough... just taste like pork with no flavor. \n\nchicken <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>- light and tasty! \n\ngiant fortune cookie- not the tastiest, but s great concept of fortune cookies for the table!\n\nall in all... i would definitely come back!",

            "we always eat at tao in vegas, not because the food is great, because it gets our cheap lazy asses into the club for free! the restaurant itself is pretty gaudy, huge statue in the middle, lots of asian themed art. it can also be dark and loud if they have a dj playing. but we've never had to wait more than a few minutes for our table and they have always been able to accommodate our large groups.\n\nthe food here is always surprisingly good and the prices are very reasonable for vegas. we highly recommend the <mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark>, the <mark>Chinese Five Spice Short Ribs</mark>, and sausage <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>. you absolutely must get the yuzu sugar donuts. 1 order per four people, or less. they are <mark>Uni</mark> loved. \n\ndrinks are pricey, but still cheaper than the club. so fill up here, then head ups<mark>Tai</mark> and party with busta rhymes or whoever happens to be partying at tao that night!", 
            "i enjoyed tao very much.  my 2 colleagues and i had (family style):\n\n<mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark> - 'city chicken' with veggies, and hoisin and nice crisp lettuce leaves to wrap it up in.  one of the party was a little apprehensive but he ended up enjoying it quite a bit.\n\n<mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark> in a soy yuzu sauce. - these are so fun!  3 or so sweetish peppers then bam your mouth's on fire from a hot one.\n\n<mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark>\n<mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark>\nmr. wong's <mark>'Mr. Wongs' Jumbo Shrimp</mark>.\n\nall very tasty.  for beverage i had 2 mai <mark>Tai</mark> and they were excellent.",

            "friends were in town and they wanted to try the very popular tao restaurant.  (it's been reported that the tao restaurant is one of the highest gross-ranking restaurants in vegas!)  just as we were about to enter the hallway, this very large bouncer asks if he could help us and we mention we have reservations and then he allows us to proceed further.  talk about intimidating, and this was for a 7 pm dinner!\n\nwe were seated ups<mark>Tai</mark> on the balcony overlooking the huge buddha.  as menus were presented to us, the waitress asked if she could get us some water.  as i perused the flimsy two page menu, front and back, i didn't even know where to begin.  my fellow dining companions were quick to notice the 16 oz. grilled kobe sirloin for $150 and the individually priced nigiri pieces ranging from $3-$15 a piece.\n\nthe menu suggests that all items were going to be served family style, so we asked the waitress for a few suggestions.  i could barely hear her over the hum of the restaurant.  (i would not consider tao to be romantic at all.)\n\nin the end we decided to start with four different appetizers and two entrees.  and this is what we got:\n\n<mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark> ($14) - this came with five lettuce leaves.  a decent amount to fill all the leaves.  the squab mixture was a bit too moist and the bf found it too sweet.  i had squab juice stuff dripping all over my hands right off the bat.  there was a lot of flavor though and crunch, probably from the celery.\n\n<mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> ($16) - a clay pot arrived with 5 lobster-filled wontons.  very flavorful with slices of shittake mushrooms laid out too.  a very light and delicate dish.  \n\nsashimi of <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> with fresh wasabi sauce ($28) - beautifully presented on a circular clear plate with herbs on top.  we couldn't determine if they were already sliced apart or what, but with the meat being so delicate, just grab a piece and pull and the meat will tear gently apart.  lovely taste and clean.  however, i didn't recall a wasabi sauce or flavor to it.\n\npork <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with thai chili sauce ($11) - this order came with 3 triangles filled with pork, so we requested another order so we could all have a taste.  the <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> was decent, nothing particular special about it.  the thai chili sauce tasted store bought though.\n\nmiso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables ($34) - very good, but i guess the better question is when have you had a bad piece <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>?\n\n<mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark> ($26) - we must have misheard the waitress because we thought she said it came in a coconut curry.  it did not, but rather a sweet sauce with about five pieces <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> in it, including the drumstick.  it was okay, nothing particularly special about it.\n\n<mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark> ($4) - of course we had to order some rice!  we got two orders which is just enough for four people who aren't heavy rice eaters.\n\noverall, the food was good.  definitely overpriced though, and it's catered to a cer<mark>Tai</mark> kind of clientele.  you'll be amused to find things like kung pao chicken ($26) and grilled prime porterhouse with wasabi dipping sauce ($88) on the same menu.  we decided to pass on dessert as the waitress-recommended giant fortune cookie ($10) or fuji apple <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> ($8) didn't appeal to us enough.  (we actually drove over to luv-it frozen custard instead!)\n\nservice is a huge component of what makes this experience worth it or not, and tao fails in this department.  i was not impressed with the chatty young waiters who dropped (not placed) the silverware onto the table, reached across the bf to put things in front of me, and who 'hid' the menus behind my guest on his chair.  (uh, who does that?!)  as they moved our glasses and silverware to make room for our dishes, they did it in such an unorganized and messy fashion.  i felt like i was staring at someone's hands trying to do a card trick.  i'm used to the staff performing such tasks in an unnoticed way as to not disrupt the private conversation the dining guests are having.  the waitstaff should take a few lessons from rosemary's restaurant's waitstaff.  that's what i call service!\n\nat the very end of our meal, someone did come by and ask if everything was okay.  and it was...just okay.  they asked if we were going to the club afterward and i said yes and asked if they had any passes.  what they do have is a \"line pass,\" which is really a simple stamp on your inner left wrist so you can supposedly bypass the long line outside.  however, you will still have to pay cover.  (i think this part is rather ridiculous.  they should at least offer a discount on the cover instead.)  with the stamp being so simple, a washing of my hands right after dinner washed it right off.  not the best pass i would say.\n  \ntao restaurant is the kind of place you say you've been to and that's it.    there are better places where service is valued higher.\n\n$185 total, including tip and tax, no drinks", 
            "not sure how many places serve a deep fried <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> tartare sushi roll but i would gladly go to any place that does.  the wife and i really enjoyed pretty everything about this place.  the price wasn't so bad since we split the entree.  we got the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> which was very good.  \n\nsome of the prices of stuff we didn't order did seem a bit outlandish.  like $15 <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> (does that come with a foot massage?).  but whatever.  its a fun place for couples or groups.  we went on a wednesday night when the club was closed so it was semi-chill.", 
            "i really liked the decor. fresh rose petals, buddhas, candlelights, dim, very romantic. we had the <mark>Crispy Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll, shrimp tempura roll, and <mark>TAO Angry Dragon Roll</mark> with eels. they were all better than average, though a bit small - not unexpected.kids wanted the lobster wonton soup and shrimp tempura. the soup was better than the tempura - too thick and oily. we tried the duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>, it was pretty good, don't mind ordering again. the eight of us shared the <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> with scallons, xo shrimp,<mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>,<mark>TAO Lo Mein</mark>, kung pao chicken, assorted sashimi, and the lobster dish that i totally hate my friend for ordering .... just kidding about the hate part.....  every entree was very salty, and the worst part was it tasted like the same sauce was used for every dish. with all the food we ordered and consumed, i actually still had room for dessert, i must say this is probably the best part of the meal. the chocolate parfait with godiva liquer was nice, balances out the saltiness lingering in my mouth. tried hubby's lychee sorbet - refreshing, kid's mousse fortune cookie, so-so, but they found it amusing. i actually could eat more, the portions were just too small. we did not see paris hilton, but did see robin leach with a couple young blonds. :)", 
            "i had realllllly high hopes for my dining experience at tao, and to be honest, it was way below my expectations!\n\nwe arrived slightly early for our reservations but were seated immediately, which was great. the atmosphere was awesome. so trendy, cool, interesting lighting, and how can you miss the huge buddah statue in the middle of it all? undeniably, the atmosphere is the best part of tao. \n\nto drink, i had the lychee nut martini. very, very good. strong flavor of alcohol and lychee alike, it was one of the best drinks i had on my trip. \n\nwe started out with <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> in a shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>. by far, the best thing we ate all evening, although the $18 price tag was a little hefty for four bite-sized wontons. yes, they were delicious- plump, filled entirely with chunks of lobster, but still. i am a huge ginger and mushroom fan, so this broth was awesome! i wish i had some rice to sop up the goodness once we were through with the dumplings!\n\nmaybe this is where we went wrong. we decided to get sushi and split it. maybe one shouldn't order sushi from tao, as everyone around us seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their food. plus, it looked better than ours. \n\nshrimp tempura roll- this was very <mark>Uni</mark> because it was served with curry sauce. i  enjoyed the flavor of the curry with the sushi roll. almost like a fusion of indian/japanese cuisine. \n\n<mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>- good, but nothing amazing. i've had just as good a <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> at a hole in the wall for half the price. i did not like that it was served atop a puddle of mayonnaise. i understand that mayonnaise is blended within the roll as a 'spicy sauce', but this was just way too much mayo. yuck. \n\nalaskan salmon, crab, and avocado roll- nothing really identifiable or special. once again, i've had much better. \n\nperhaps my expectations were too high, but tao felt like an upscale pf changs. however, i'm glad i went because i've wanted to dine there forever. if i were to do it over, i would order one of their entrees, like mongolian scallion chicken, miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, or braised spicy shrimp. \n\nservice was not very good. felt like we were rushed the entire time.", 
            "tao is is indeed delish. i particularly enjoyed the <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> that you cook yourself <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>. the decor is fantastic and true to vegas style, the music is hot!", 
            "friggin awesome...so what do you do when you are over buffet's and eating junk in vegas? you eat at one of the \"fine\" dining establishments in your hotel. and when they mean fine they mean fine! this place is awesome and also gets you front of line status if you want to go to tao nightclub.\n\nsince we had such a large party (8) we couldn't get a reservation until 1045. a little late for dinner....but its vegas....i woke up at 5pm so it's not that late ;-)\n\nwe were seated and our server was very helpful in explaining the menu and the items on it and mentioning the special of the night. \n\nso i had the 8oz wasabi en<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>. best steak ever!!! i have eaten at most of the \"fine\" steak houses in san diego and one other steak house in vegas but this one takes the cake. it was so tender and beautifully cooked (medium rare). my friends also had the special of the night (a 12oz rib eye) this was also very good and cooked perfectly. we also had the beef shabu shabu pot....it was good but i wish we could have tried the <mark>Kobe Beef</mark>...that would have been awesome. either way i could have eaten the broth by itself. the other thing that stood out was the <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> carpaccio. excellent!! marinated and cut exquisitely.\n\nall in all the best restaurant i have eaten at so far in my 27 years.", 
            "i love the tao in vegas, more so then the 1 in nyc..  i like the vibe, the atmosphere, the music and the drinks. the bartenders are fun and friendly also..  and the food i am in love with the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> in the <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> that is pretty much all i eat every time i come here..   its like having an orgasm in my mouth, when i eat them i make these moans and groans and not a lot of food does that for me, so because of that i must go to tao every time when in vegas cause its reliable and i don't have to fake it.. ; )~", 
            "the food was fantastic, and i highly recommend the chef's tasting sampler. the highlights were the <mark>Peking Duck <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark>, <mark>Kobe Beef</mark>, citrus japanese snapper and the dumplings. for drinks, i had the tao-hito, which unfortunately just tasted watered down. also, the decor is well done, as has been mentioned before, the 30-foot buddha wall is sweet. the service was great once the food started coming, but previous to that it was slow and it took some time to get our drinks. lastly, if you go with a group, you may want to limit it to six people only because we had to cram in eight sizable guys around a table designed for six. there were other tables which would've worked, but the majority seemed setup for six.", 
            "i've been here four times and aside from a minor intoxicated mix up on bottle vs. drink service made by moi and group and small service lapse whilst sitting alone, this is dining nirvana. \n\nlocated inside the venetian, which already smells great, the entrance and gift shop have the wonderful smell of sandalwood. the stone \"baths\" greet you as you walk to the hostess station...each time i've visited they have been filled with water, rose petals and candles. i've heard mention that there may be events where buddha nymphs are soaking in the tubs...could be urban legend, could be wishful thinking by drunken pigs. either way, i wish i was a tao bath girl.... \n\nbut i digress...back to the food. whether dining alone at the sushi bar, partying with friends, or starting at a special someone this place accommodates the mood. dark wood, candle light, ginormous statues of the buddha, fresh flowers, small medium and large buddha statues abound. i have not yet had the pleasure of seeing the club - but dining here has been enough satisfaction. \n\nthe sushi is divine and overpriced...individual order are great but if you really want to be impressed, throw your credit card to the wind and go for the \"chef's special\". - otherwise known as sushi roulette in vegas. you give them an amount to spend and then wait for monster plate. the sashimi of <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> (think carpaccio) is glorious, buttery, melty goodness and even better with the smokey sauce that accompanies the avocado tempura (sin on a plate). \n\npeking duck <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark>, <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> meal or satay small plate, <mark>Scallop</mark>...you could spend forever savoring. the sake menu is amazing and must be sampled - probably the reason i have never gotten to desert. but then again, there are great places within the venetian to venture to for liquid desert!\n\nif you like asian food or sushi it's a must visit for the food and the atmosphere.  and no, the swanky couches in the front room are not for the uncool to lounge upon and think they can order drinks from - bottle service only and all that goes with it!", 
            "the girls and i decided to dine here on saturday night at 5:15pm.  yes, we dined that early.  i called to reserve a table for nine a couple of days before we dined, so we got a choice of the 5:15pm or 10:45pm seating.  since we had to get back to our rooms at wynn to get ready for clubbing at xs, we opted for the 5:15pm seating.   i loved the asian d\\u00e9cor...muted lighting makes the restaurant appear like an elegant lounge.  our round table was good for eating family style...and was located right in front of the huge buddha statue.  \n\ndishes my friends and i tried and their star ratings (with 5 stars being the best):\n\n* edamame (4 stars / $7) - edamame is edamame...what else can i say?\n    \n* <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> (4 stars / $16) - i didn't get a chance to taste this, but my friends loved it.  \n\n* miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables (5 stars / $34) - i loved this dish.  so tasty...the fish was so flaky and tender.  \n\n* <mark>Spicy Hoi Yin Eggplant</mark> (4 stars / $9) - i kept hearing raves from my friends about this eggplant dish.    \n\n* mandarin sizzled <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with peking duck (4 stars / $14) - my friends loved this dish, but i thought it was just ok...it could have done with more peking duck.  as it was, the duck slices were too thin and too few.    \n\n* <mark><mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> Noodles</mark> with shrimp (4 stars / $22) - again, my friends raved about this dish, but i found it to be so-so.  i'm picky about thai dishes, so i expect more.  i have to say i was surprised by the large serving of <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> since other dishes we ordered came in small servings. \n\n* giant fortune cookie (4 stars / $10) - this fortune cooked is filled with white & dark chocolate mousse.  so pretty to look at...and the filing provided a nice taste and texture to a regular fortune cookie.  our server also provided nine separate fortunes with our cookie, so that was a nice touch.  \n\n* chocolate raspberry wontons (4 stars / $9) - the crisp wontons filled with raspberry filing tasted wonderful with the vanilla bean ice cream.  \n\nthe wine list had a lot of good options, but we stayed away from alcohol during dinner as we were saving our drinking for our bottle service at xs the same night.  overall, tao has great ambiance, good food and great service.  our server is one of the best i have ever encountered in my years of dining.  he was very patient with our group and answered our questions with a smile.  i would definitely dine here again.", 
            "scrumptious! loved tao, we had an early reservation, 5 p.m. as we were going to see phantom of the opera, so i cannot verify the issues of other reviews who had to wait a long time even with a reservation.\n\nwe were promptly seated, and hats off to titus our server. he was fabulous. when asking for recommendations he was honest and truthful offering an explanation as to why he felt the way he did about a dish. he was attentive, friendly and fun to interact with during our dining experience.\n\nnow to the food, we started with the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, steamed and not fried and exquisite. the lobster was perfectly cooked, and the <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> was amazing, 5 wontons was a great starter, but left us wanting many more.\ni ordered the wok seared new york strip, it was seared to  perfection with a nice crust on the outside, yet tender on the inside. the sauce is bursting with strong asian flavors that are a perfect accompianment.\ntony ordered the omakase, which is sushi <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark> and is the chef's choice. he was thrilled with everything served on the plate. \n\nthe food was wonderful,so  we decided to break with tradition and order dessert, that turned out to be a good decision. we ordered the chocolate <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark> served with an orange dipping sauce, again, truly amazing, there is nothing better than something with a crunch and oozing warm melted chocolate. \n\ncan't wait to go back!", 
            "i've been to the club here before, which will be reserved for a seperate review.  dining at tao is one of those vegas experiences that you will remember.  located at the venetian, which is like a lego-land comprised of the gritti palace and the royal danieli with st. mark's and the grand canal thrown in for good measure, tao is a buddhist temple amid this garbled baroque mess.  \n\nyou will need reservations here and expect to have a drink at the bar, which isn't all too bad considering the loads of eye candy hanging around, as if they are apart of the scenery, so you will be sure to see something that you like.  take the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to order a grey goose and soda, sit on one of the couches, and look at all the hot asian broads w/their raven tresses and wasp-thin waists, and the european bitches in their milanese high heels and tossed-boob salad exploding out of their wrap-dresses.  yes, yes, tres chic, i know. \n\nthe dining room is dim, crowded, and there's a thousand conversations going on at one and the same time.  not sure if i'd come here for a \"special occasion\" type of dinner, as in ask your girl to marry you or to tell your mistress you're married.  our waiter was cool, reminded me of a socal dude, like he'd hang out in venice beach.  \n\nfor dinner we started off with the spicy tuna tartare and <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> shashimi - both were to die for (the tuna was crisp and crunchy, and the <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> was like eating kobe tai, go figure).  with our main course (we both got the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>) we paired it up with the lobster and kimchi rice (again, an excellent choice). \n\ni'm a sake novice and was open to suggestion: we started off with the sake sampler, and with our dessert got the sake dessert sampler, i believe, and me and my bud both agreed that the cloudy voices in the mist was our least favorite - i walked out of here a bit rocked.  for dessert we opted for the giant fortune cookie.  \n\nin the end, $244.00 <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark> before tip, which, in my opinion, isn't bad at all considering what we got.  will definitely make it here again and do our best to revitalize the economy.", 
            "went here this past saturday for a friend's birthday dinner.  we were only able to get a 6:45pm spot because we called to make a reservation the day prior to arrival.  \n\ni love the dim lighting and overall ambiance of tao restaurant.  the place is bit noisy to be a romantic dinner date spot, but it suited our needs for the birthday dinner.  the club music playing in the background pumped us up for later.\n\nwe hung out at the lounge while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive and took advantage of the photo ops.  this place offers eye candy galore for both men and women...bonus!  \n\nitems we ordered:\n\n* <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> ($18) - my friends said this was tasty.  i didn't try any, so can't attest to the taste...although it smelled wonderful.  the wontons were served in a clay pot, simmering gently in it's <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>. \n\n* miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables ($34) - this dish was once again very delicious.  the fish was cooked just right...crisp on the outside and flaky on the inside.  the stir-fried veggies and fried tofu pieces rounded out the dish perfectly.  \n\n* <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> ($16 / six pieces) - i really enjoyed this roll, which consisted of spicy minced tuna spread thickly <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> cakes (cut into rectangular pieces).  \n\n* <mark>TAO Angry Dragon Roll</mark> with eel & kabayaki sauce ($15 / eight slices) - i enjoyed this roll, but it's just your standard eel roll...nothing special about it.  \n\n* kobe tartar tempura ($19 / eight slices) - the minced <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> was wrapped in seaweed, which was then encased in sushi rice and deep fried.  on the side was a bed of marinated, sliced <mark>Sake Braised Shiitake Mushrooms</mark> (which was sweet and delicious).  \n\n* black pepper sizzled <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with udon noodles ($29) - can't say much about this since i didn't get a bite, but it looked and smelled good.  the serving was plentiful, compared with the other dishes.\n\n* molten chocolate cake ($10) - this came with coconut ice cream, but they honored our request for vanilla ice cream instead.  \n\n* assorted ice creams and sorbets ($8) - served with a couple of almond sesame cookies.  \n\ndrinks: glass of scarbolo pinot grigio ($10) / tao-tini ($13) / orange dragon ($13) /  bottle of corona ($8).  \n\nfor our enter<mark>Tai</mark>, we witnessed this drunk lady that somehow ended up on the lap of the huge buddha.  she was posing for pics until security escorted her out.  i guess we're not supposed to sit on the buddha's lap?  darn!  \n\nanother great experience at tao restaurant.  i will always make it a point to dine here on every las vegas trip.",

            "tao is one of my favorite restaurants ever!  located inside the venetian, this asian fusion restaurant is a must eat when you're at vegas.  make sure you make reservations though, especially on the weekends, or you might not get the time you want or you'll have to wait awhile.\nthe decor is very trendy vegas, with dim lighting, lit red walls to contrast the dimness , buddha statues, bathtubs filled w/ rose petals, and japanese lanterns.  ambiance is very chic, modern, and sophisticated.  \nthe food compliments the ambiance of the place, using traditional asian recipes and adding modern flair.  here's what i had:\nappetizers: \n<mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark>- asian flavored <mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark> were sweet, tasty, and the meat came right off the bone - there were 6 <mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark> in one order\npeking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>- fried spingrolls with peking duck inside was delicious and not covered in oil like other <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>\nentree:\nmiso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> -  my favorite place to get <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> never disappoints\namerican kobe- my friend ordered this and he gave me a couple bites, and it was pretty good.  first time having <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> so i wasn't too sure what to make of it.  beware of $88 price tag.\ndessert:\ngiant fortune cookie- enough to feed 4 and served with fresh tropical fruit.  the fortune cookie was light and complemented well with the vanilla mouse inside the cookie.  i found the chocolate mousse to be a little too sweet.\nservice was efficient and friendly, so no problems there.\ni'll definitely come back to tao every time i go back to vegas.", 
            "i was in las vegas for a work event and two of my colleagues and i decided to try tau out for dinner. \n\nwe had reservations but still waited almost 20 minutes to be seated and were only seated at that time because my colleague went back up to the host stand. i understand that the restaurant was busy but expected that if the wait was that long (with a reservation) that the host would let us know. \n\nonce we were seated we decided to let the waiter (who had been there for 5 years) decide how we would attack the menu. his recommendations were spot on. we started with the <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> (which was tasty but had too much rice for me) and the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> (wontons were light and the lobster and sauce were rich - delicious). \n\nhe had us move onto sushi and had the <mark>Surf and Turf Roll</mark> and the yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce. the yellow<mark>Tai</mark> has a great balance of flavor and while the <mark>Surf and Turf Roll</mark> was good, it had almost too many flavors going on. \n\nwe moved onto heartier dishes like the wok-seared new york sirloin (which was good and way less expensive than the 12 oz <mark>Grilled 12 oz. Kobe Ribeye</mark> our waiter suggested), the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (he suggested two appetizer portions as opposed to one main which was the same price and we got more fish), and the buddha's vegetables. all were delicious and the perfect amount of food for the group. \n\nwe finished off with the oversized fortune cookie which came with a fortune for everyone and was fun to share. \n\noverall it was a fun dining experience as long as your are ok with sharing plates (which i am).", 
            "i love the atmosphere of this place.  the menu has some great offerings at your typical expensive vegas prices.  i had two smaller dishes, some sushi and the <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> tartare.  the sushi was pretty good, although not earth-shattering.  the <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> was tasty at first, but it was salty and at the end i was just eating it to eat it.  other people at my table had the fish (bass), which they said was very good.  anyway, this is a good place to hang out.",

            "i ate here at the bar with my sis-in-law since we were going to the club afterward. it turned out to be a great idea, not only for the convenience of being downs<mark>Tai</mark> from the club, but also because the food was pretty good and the atmosphere was very fun. the decor was awesome and the layout of the bar/lounge was cool, except it gets really crowded before the club opens. our bartender was on top of everything the entire time (except for one thing that i'll get to at the end for emphasis) and our food came at a reasonable pace. the sushi here is about average based on what we got. some yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi and a special roll. tasty, decent portions, the usual. i have loved this place ever since <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark> reasons: the sake menu is extensive and the <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> carpachio is incredible! it's the best i've ever had and i've been craving it ever since! we had a great time at the bar and had some good food for the price... it didn't seem all that expensive to me for what we got. all in all, a great start to the night. \n\nnow here's the one thing that the bartender dropped the ball on and remember this if you eat there before the club:\n\nturns out you have to get a stamp from your server to get in ups<mark>Tai</mark>. even if you have a freakin receipt for $200 at that very place! so back to the bartender we go, then she says go to the front because she was busy i think. by then the front is getting slammed with bodies all wanting to get into the club so talking to the folks at the front was near impossible, not to mention maneuvering through the masses. so finally after badgering the people at the front, and some nifty work by my sister getting in with another crowd already lined up for the stamp guy, we got em and were good to go. that's a whole 'lotta nonsense for a stamp i know and just remember to get yours when you pay for your meal. lucky i didn't give 'em three stars for that cluster f#@$!",

(she had never had <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> before, and not knowing better she ate a portion of it, along with the mushrooms- and remarked that it was \"good\").  i tried it and found it flavorful but chewy - something that <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> should never  be.  by the time we were able to point this out to the server, it was time for us to leave for our show and there was no time to order something else. no adjustment on the tab, either!  lesson:  don't order <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> unless you know the restaurant knows \"kobe\" beef.",

            "large parties dining at tao should know this....\n___________________________\nto my surprise, 4 stars for the food, but an overall 2 stars for the ridiculous way we were charged for the food and how our complaint was handled.  i dined at tao with a group of 9 for a bachelorette party the weekend of august 13, 2007. although i was disappointed with tao, i still had a great time with my fabulous girlfriends. \n\ni don't remember everything we had, but i enjoyed the <mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark>, <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. least favorite was the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> (one of the worst i've had) and chicken skewers. \n\nreason for 2 stars:\nafter we were seated, our waitress didn't come by for what seemed like 10 minutes to introduce herself. when she came by, she was friendly but did not comm<mark>Uni</mark> clearly how she was taking our order. since it was so loud and our waitress didn't have a very loud voice, 3 different members of our group asked her to clarify how much food she thought we should order. she specifically told us that we should order 3-4 starters and at least 5 main dishes. that took me by surprise b/c i thought this is small plates and how could that be enough food? so i repeated what she said to me just to clarify that 3-4 appetizers would enough food for 10 girls? we decided to just order as much as she recommended and we can order more if necessary. \n\nwhen the dishes arrived, we were all suprised at the large portions. what we found out when we got the receipt was that the waitress doubled and tripled each order (as she saw fit) so it would be enough for our table of 9. she never once said she was going to do this and we were upset because we had so much leftover food and even ate more than we wanted so it wouldn't be wasted.\n\nif we had known this is what she was going to do, we would have ordered different items. i can't remember if she tripled any main dishes but the end result was a very large bill and wasted food. \n\nwhen we brought this up to our waitress, she insisted she explained it and after she left, she never returned to our table. we then spoke to the manager who said he could only give us 2 drink tokens to compensate for the miscomm<mark>Uni</mark>. this is so lame and such a cheap gestere to rectify the situation. the least he could have done was get us into the nightclub for free afterwards. \n\ni have never, ever, gone to a restaurant where they took the liberty of doubling or tripling your order without telling you. i've always said, i want 1 order of this, 2 orders of this, etc.\n\ni would not go back to this restaurant again. food was good but not worth the price. \n\nthe club is ok if you get in early but by 1pm it gets too crowded to walk around and check things out. we got free line passes but had to go out, get in smaller line, pay $20pp at the door + get a hand stamp, then headed ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the night club. seems like a classy place but i find it offensive that they have skanky girls taking baths and playing with each other surrounded by all these bhuddas.",

            "perhaps because kim kardashian, her mom, & co. were to the table to my right, and david spade and colin firth of snl were to the table to my left, tao failed to give me one thing i would have needed - a lobster bib.\n\nthat is the only thing that my tao restaurant dining experience lacked and who knows, had i asked, maybe they would have had one on hand. we had reservations for saturday night for 8:30pm to celebrate my 30th birthday. friends were gathered from chicago, nyc, and san francisco. we had a 45 minute delay in being seated at our table but that came as no surprise given the busy night. we were seated in the first floor dining area near the majestic two-story tall buddha statue. our server was courteous, attentive, and knowledgeable on the menu items.\n\nthe standouts for me appetizer-wise were the <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> and <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark> (i'm pescatarian and do not eat meat). my carnivore friends seem to enjoy the dragon <mark>Tai</mark> <mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark> and meat potstickers. through it all, the wine kept pouring.\n\nour entrees came and i was dazzled by my <mark>Typhoon Lobster</mark> with fingerling potatoes and spicy <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark>. this is when the bib would have come in handy because when i was done it looked like i had massacred an aquatic beast! fine food, great conv, surrounded by top notch friends -  this was an evening to be remembered. \n\ni will mention that the pair who ordered the peking duck for 2 were indifferent to it. the description had sounded amazing but did not live up to their expectations. everyone else enjoyed their food immensely though. then came what would make for buzz that this meal was a contender for best meal ever - the dessert platter.\n\nover the off-key singing of 'happy birthday' came the mother of all dessert platters. it included a scoop of ice cream, sorbet, molton chocolate cake, fruit, and a giant fortune cookie filled with white and dark chocolate mousse and chocolate buddhas. simply incredible and i am not generally a dessert person. \n\nfrom the moment you walk in to the moment you leave tao you feel as though you are experiencing something <mark>Uni</mark>, exotic, and daring. the decor is chic and sexy, the vibe hip and happening. thank you tao for <mark>Maki</mark> my birthday dinner one i will never forget.", 
            "let me start off by saying that i absolutely love tao! the decor is amazing, the staff is very friendly & helpful, and the food is delicious. and if that's not enough for you, inform your waiter that you plan on going to the club after dinner and they will give you a stamp that will get you in for free (both males & females) and let you skip the line. you can't beat that! \n\nwe visited tao (restaurant) on 4/1/10. we made same day reservations and they were able to accommodate us. i had the \"<mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark> with thai peanut sauce\" and my date had the \"soy ginger <mark>Glazed Salmon</mark> with udon noodles and spinach.\" both dishes were great - cooked perfectly, even to the toughest food critic's standards. however, i think the best part of the meal came at the end. like any other asian restaurant, they give you a free fortune cookie with your bill. but these are not your standard boring fortune cookies. the fortunes inside are a little more <mark>Uni</mark> than most. mine said \"you will receive a spanking in your near future\" and they bear the tao logo on the corner. definitely made us laugh at the end of a really great meal. \n\non the down side, prices are a little high here, but that is expected from any nice restaurant in las vegas. don't let this deter you - this place is worth the splurge! i highly recommend tao - i know i will make time for tao every time i go to vegas!", 
            "we went to the tao asian bistro that is a celebrity hangout in the venetian.  it is over 42,000 square feet, that boasts a nightclub, lounge and restaurant.\n\nthe decor is lush velvets, waterfalls , many <mark>Uni</mark> buddha sculptures and a hand-carved 20-foot tall buddha floating over a pond. \n\nthe food was awesome. kudos to sam hazen the executive chef who has created a menu that features specialties from china, japan and thailand. not going to list everything ordered, as that would make for a very long blog. but the highlights were the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, the addictive edamame, <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, a <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> dish that was unlike anything that i have ever had, and of course all topped off with a hot sake.\n\nthe only downside to the visit - even though we had reservations -  we had to wait an hour for a table. \n\nbut i will go back just for the dessert - chocolate and raspberry wontons served with tahitian vanilla bean ice-cream. (next time - no sharing!!).", 
            "just got back from a weekend in vegas and a second visit to tao.\n\ni think the crux of the issue here is that it's a restaurant and a nightclub.  so, you get (what is in my opinion) some pretty decent asian fusion cuisine and attentive service in the restaurant marred by the typical nightclub attitude - \"self-important\" is the phrase that comes to mind.\n\nfirst and foremost, be sure not to stand in the wrong place.  my group of four were informed not to stand where we were standing three separate times in the first 20 minutes at the venue.  the first was when we were in line to check in for our 9pm reservation behind some other folks that were taking an impossibly long time at the host stand to notify the host of their arrival.  a \"welcome to tao\" would have been nice but instead it was more like \"be sure to stand to the left if you have a dining reservation.\"  gee, thanks.\n\nafter being informed at the host stand that they were running \"a little behind,\" we headed to the bar to grab some drinks.  the end of the bar was open so we headed over there, but very shortly after ordering our $50 round we were informed by another bouncer that we couldn't stand at that side of the bar.  i informed him rather indignantly that we wouldn't even be in the bar in the first place if they were able to seat us in a timely fashion for the reservation we'd made a month ago.  so i took my time signing the check and then we headed to another area of the bar where we were told yet again not to stand where we were standing.\n\nthings got better once we were finally seated at our table - fortunately it was only a 15 minute delay which was marginally acceptable (in my opinion, any material delay when a reservation is involved should warrant some free drinks).  i do like the food here, even though several of the menu options are somewhat <mark>Uni</mark> (read: kung pao chicken).  the sushi is good but overpriced and the shabu shabu is fun but easily recreated at home.  i think the small plates are probably where the best options lie, but you do need to order several of them to make a meal.  our waiter was very friendly and attentive - a nice contrast to the police state that was the bar area.\n\nit was the food and ambience that brought me back a second time but i think i can find something comparable in las vegas on a future visit,  somewhere where they care a little more about friendly service and are not focused so much on cattle-herding the club kids.", 
            "4.5 stars!\nwe're from the east coast and have been searching all over vegas for east coast style peking duck (with pancakes), so we checked out tao.\n\nwe had to wait 1/2 hr past our reservation time...\n\n<mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>  - very good\n<mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> - awesome! melts in your mouth\npeking duck - good, but not worth $70 (hoisen had to much vinegar and the quantity of meat was small)\nfortune cookie dessert - good, very <mark>Uni</mark>\n\nthe highlight is the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and i would order that again.", 
            "the entrance to this place starts off with a row of concrete filled bath tubs on both sides of you and the thematic color is black. you enter into a large open dark area with lounge style seating. we got a nice private room that overlooked into the rest of the dining area. we had about 15 people in our party and spent over $1000 including tax and tip. so this was an expensive restaurant nonetheless. it was a different twist on modern i would say. i ordered the appetizer butter fish which was skewered on wood and came with virtually uncooked and earthy tasting fresh asparagus. the butterfish was cooked just right with the perfect sweet fish flavor. the sweet glaze on the butterfish was delish as well. i ordered a bowl of <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> which they charged $5 for. i think they pride themselves in the presentations of their dishes. their bathrooms are quite <mark>Uni</mark> as you walk into the hallway and see these boy pictures and think taht you are going into a male bathroom and then you find two doors with each with a similar statue next to them, but no inscription as to which is male or female. talk about russian rulet. i won't spoil it. i ended up waiting for someone to come out of one of them before i chose the right bathroom.", 
            "truly just ok.\n\ni was here with two girlfriends and we came for dinner before hitting the nightclub. we had a reservation but had to sit at the bar for over 20 minutes before we were seated. the place was super loud (people and music) and when we were seated, we were barely an arms-length away from the next table over. our server(s) - we had a few rotating in/out (maybe it was the switch over time?) - were pleasant but seemed rushed and stressed throughout the meal. \n\nthe food was mediocre and arrived overly quickly... we definitely felt rushed. we each had something different - variety of fish, meat and chicken - but each dish was overly salty and oily. the portions were fine but lacking flare and flavor. i also didn't like how we \"had\" to order main dishes in order to be able to access the nightclub. i was much more interested in ordering two appetizers but my evening plans got in the way!\n\nthe cock<mark>Tai</mark> were fun and the wine list impressive. the bar at the front of the restaurant has a great atmosphere - i'd come back for drinks anytime.  i'd probably also come back for dinner because, after all, it's vegas and you're here to have some fun in loud and busy places! \n\np.s. in case you didn't know: the entrance to the restaurant has bath tubs which have both rose petals and barely clothed women soaking in them! it's a surprise and a <mark>Uni</mark> experience!", 
            "7:30pm reservation.  arrived on-time and seated promptly.  the place was already packed and there was a good vibe.  not too loud, not too quiet.  our waitress was very friendly, responsive, and timely.\n\ndrinks- tao-tini..  they were good.  smooth and wound up putting back quite a few through the dinner.  didn't really feel the effects so i'm thinking the \"smoothness\" was perhaps just a lack of alcohol.\n\nthere was a chef's tasting menu being offered this night for an unbelievable $55.  super cheap.  both the gf and i went with this option.  first course- spicy tuna tartare over <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>.  yum.  she went with the thai stuffed shrimp.  again yum.\n\nsecond course-  <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>.. eh ok.  she went with the <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark>.  neither of us enjoyed as they were extremely bitter and wound up each only taking two bites.\n\nthird course-  wasabi crusted filet with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>.  two others at the table also ordered this and theirs was cooked perfect medium.  unfortunately i ordered the same temperature and was brought a completely rare piece of meat.  after taking the piece back to the kitchen, it returned 5 minutes later completely charred on the outside yet still very much rare on the inside.  i'm not one to send a piece of steak back twice, so i just left it alone.  i finished the 1/2 of my gf's perfectly cooked filet.\n\nfourth course-  chocolate <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> and a citrus dipping sauce.  very good and very rich.  j<mark>Uni</mark> apple blossom with vanilla ice cream.  nothing special, but good none the less.\n\nif we didn't get such a great deal with the tasting menu, i know my review would be completely different based on my <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> not being cooked to order two times, and eventually just giving up on that course.  with that aside, i did enjoy myself and the majority of the meal was very good.... btw... if you order a coffee with bailey's, it is brought out in a mug large enough to wash your hands.", 
            "i love fusion food so this restaurant was perfect for my taste buds. ambiance was modern, romantic, and dim. food was great. i ordered the lobster with potatoes(about $40) and my husband got the preset meal for $50. with his meal he got the spicy tuna sushi(pretty good, rice was lightly burnt at the bottom), egg plant dish(sweet and juicy), and fillet mignon(decent) and it also came with variety scoops of ice cream(flavors:  green tea, passion fruit, and ginger) for dessert. the ice cream flavors were delicious and <mark>Uni</mark>.   my lobster dish was great.  full of asians flavors, just how i like it. our waitress was attentive and polite. overall, i would definitely come back during my next visit to vegas.",

            "my lovely wife and i extended her business trip so we could enjoy a nice weekend away without our kids.  of all the restaurant choices, i wanted my wife and vegas newbie to experience the ventian and tao.\n\nreception by the hostess was luke warm and the table was so so with location near the big budda but too close to the server entrances.  but our waitress was extremely attentive and engaging for a vegas wiat person <mark>Maki</mark> up for the poor reception ( i find most vegas servers are dettached and have <mark>Uni</mark> written on their forehead.  reminds me of summit county colorado wait staff who after a ski season make you beg for service).\n\nwe enjoyed the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> satay and a spicey <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> for an appetize.  i drank a version of the moscow mule that was worth the crazy price.  the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is so good i would consider it for appetizer, main course and dessert.  our main courses consisted of the ahi tuna and wyogi <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>.  both tasted fantastic.  we walked out spending $240 ish.\n\ntao atmosphere reminds me a bit of a amped up pf changs but the food is much better.  i highly recommend a reservation and dont accept the first table.  we saw an older guy come in with his \"niece\" i'm sure, and when he rejected the table near the wait person entance, he was shown a much better table.  i get the feeling a few bucks in the hand of the hostess makes a big difference here.\n\ni would definetly go back for a work event or a special occassion.  the place is a bit expensive and the service iffy, but foood quality is above average and considering the options on the main strip, its one of my favorites.", 
            "beautiful restaurant, exceptional staff, and good food; my only negative was you're paying for ambiance and service, not <mark>Uni</mark> or authenticity of the meals.\n\ntao has an asian fusion vibe, not authentic, but not fake either.  the buddhist iconography and kanji gave a mostly chinese feel.  the restrooms were clean, but unfortunately had an attendant.  the restaurant was very crowded and popular, especially around the s<mark>Tai</mark> leading to the (disappointing) nightclub.  i loved our table; it was a cozy and comfortable booth, but was near the kitchen so my coat was repeatedly knocked off my chair.\n\nour waitress that evening was perfect; friendly, efficient, and nice.  we had the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>; it was succulent and i enjoyed lightly cooking each piece.  i enjoyed a beer and tea with dinner.  the host staff was funny and made me feel like our comfort was tantamount.  \n\nthe conversation was the best part of dinner, while people watching and taking in the ambiance.  this is a good place to try among the culinary smorgasbord present in las vegas.", 
            "if you are craving asian fusion in las vegas and want to go shopping at a generic vegas mall, this is your spot! this place is pricier than your average asian fusion restaurant, and more delicious. \n\nwhat sets this place apart from other asian locations is the <mark>Uni</mark> dining atmosphere and the higher quality in the food. the service is also top notched. it's a great place for a dinner date. \n\nwhile you are here, look at the giant buddha statue. like how did they get it to vegas? las vegas never stops amazing me.", 
            "the only reason to eat here is to avoid the long lines waiting to gain access to tao nightclub. \nonce you've finished dining, your waiter will usher you past all the line-losers to gain your rightful spot amongst the beautiful people.\n\nit's there you'll wonder why, after six vodka and red bulls, your 'buzz' more resembles a sunday afternoon on the couch than the dance party you'd hoped for.\nwell duh, you just ate enough food for a small village in the sudan.\non the bright side, you didn't have to wait in line.\n\navoid the 'family' meal experience. the bill was a stack before the tip for 8 of us. \nstick with the sake bombers instead. \ntao has a <mark>Uni</mark> device that cleverly drops six shots into six beers simultaneously. it's so fascinating, you'll want to try this at least a dozen or so times.\ndon't forget to shout out some asian babble as you salute the emperor or else the bombers have very little effect.\n\nthe <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was a triumph. the beef was like butter - i'm guessing it was kobe, and if it wasn't, it was likely from a bull who'd had his nuts cupped daily by some half wit.", 
            "lets start with the arrival. we had a reservation friday at 9 pm. granted, it is a friday and reservations are not an exact science - but this restaurant was cer<mark>Tai</mark> well overbooked. it would appear they are more concerned about <mark>Maki</mark> sure the restaurant is at capacity than customer experience. \n\nwe were seated around 9:35 pm. after complaining that this was unacceptable, the host picked up our first round of drinks. \n\nonce seated, the noise level in the restaurant makes talking next to impossible. i felt myself yelling to comm<mark>Uni</mark>, which i am sure perpetuates into an even louder restaurant. \n\nwe had ordered a <mark>King Crab California Roll</mark>. it was mediocre at best. i have had thicker crab meat at the buffet across the street. and for this price ($18 if i recall correctly), i am sure 50% of the price was paying for where i was eating. \n\nthe highlight of the meal was the dessert. we had the yazu trio donuts. they were delicious. \n\nthe lounge was nice. ample seating space for you to lounge after eating. drinks are the same price as you would expect on the strip in any top scale lounge/club.", 
            "my friend and i dined at tao on a saturday night and had reservations at 8pm and were immediately seated. this place was overall an amazing experience. the ambiance is beautiful, the staff is very friendly and the food was delicious. my friend and i started with the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> as an appetizer. perfect portion size and had a <mark>Uni</mark> and very flavorful taste. for our entree we ordered the <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark> and a side of the sausage <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> which comes with a fried egg on top and is mixed at your table in front of you. everything we ordered was exceptional! highly recommened for large groups or even a couple.", 
            "a friend and i visited tao's restaurant and club in vegas during memorial weekend 2015 and we were definitely impressed. \nthe restaurant itself is beautiful and spacious. the entrance to the restaurant itself was very <mark>Uni</mark>! walking into the restaurant there were bath tubs full of naked women tastefully covered in flowers. no pictures were allowed but i tried unsuccessfully anyway. we sat in the bar area until out table was ready and had a drink. the bartenders were helpful and courteous but the bar was very full. \nonce we were seated for dinner we decided to share a meal of their lobster <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> as well as the <mark>Glazed Salmon</mark>. both dishes were absolutely delicious and the salmon was cooked perfectly. however, we both thought the lobster <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was very salty and way too greasy. their was literally a pool of grease in the bowl of rice which we were surprised they did not drain a little before serving it to us.\nafter having dinner in their restaurant we were informed that entrance into their club was complimentary for all diners. this was a big plus because it allowed us to avoid the $30.00 per person cover charge.\nthe club was very much like the restaurant - beautiful and full of both naked and costumed woman but this time they were all dancing instead of lounging like the ladies in the bathtubs at their restaurants entrance. like at the restaurant bar the club bar served very good drinks. snoop dogg was the enter<mark>Tai</mark> for the night i was there. when the club let out the staff surprisingly handed out flip flops to all the women. but on the downside the flip flops were all the same size but this didn't stop any of the women from using the slippers lol. my friend said they were a relief from her high heels. i simply took mine home as a souvenir. the take home slippers were definitely a <mark>Uni</mark> touch.\nthe only negative that i could recall beside the one size fits all slippers was the greasy rice but the rest of my experience was wonderful. i'd definitely return when i'm in vegas again.", 
            "we always eat at tao in vegas, not because the food is great, because it gets our cheap lazy asses into the club for free! the restaurant itself is pretty gaudy, huge statue in the middle, lots of asian themed art. it can also be dark and loud if they have a dj playing. but we've never had to wait more than a few minutes for our table and they have always been able to accommodate our large groups.\n\nthe food here is always surprisingly good and the prices are very reasonable for vegas. we highly recommend the <mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark>, the <mark>Chinese Five Spice Short Ribs</mark>, and sausage <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>. you absolutely must get the yuzu sugar donuts. 1 order per four people, or less. they are <mark>Uni</mark> loved. \n\ndrinks are pricey, but still cheaper than the club. so fill up here, then head ups<mark>Tai</mark> and party with busta rhymes or whoever happens to be partying at tao that night!", 
            "words cannot describe this amazing restaurant! the interior has beautiful-embient lighting, with a very intimate setting. the food just melts in your mouth! they have the best asian fare that include tastes from china, japan, and thailand. truly a very <mark>Uni</mark> dinning experience! the <mark><mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> Noodles</mark> and sushi are my favourites."

            "pleasantly surprised by the food. i wanted to experience a trendy vegas restaurant and heard mixed reviews on tao (ny and vegas). however, i really enjoyed my dinner here.\n\nfirst of all, the decor is beautiful, albeit ridiculous. a restaurant called tao, filled with numerous buddha statues including the nearly twenty feet tall one in the main room, large photographs of sumo wrestlers in one dining area, and large color photographs of buddhist priests of varying ages decorating the hallway to the restroom, and the overall opulent decor? not to mention the crowd of tourists and revealingly dressed beautiful and less beautiful people. not sure this is what buddha intended but overall a very beautiful lounge and restaurant.\n\nwe had a reservation (thank goodness; the place was packed) but had to wait about a half and hour. we got a drink at the bar. yes, well drinks were expensive but not surprising for vegas. once we were seated, we had a nice view of the gigantic buddha. our server was very friendly and informative. i felt in general the waitstaff was attentive, even though the restaurant was so busy.\n\nas appetizers, we ordered the lobster dumplings in shitake mushroom broth, spicy ahi tuna on top of crispy <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark> (basically like nigiri) and the <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark>. the dumplings and broth were excellent but the skin of the won tons were a little thick. the spicy ahi tuna was yuuummmy. the <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark> was the weakest dish. the fish was not very prominent, which was disappointing since i love toro. this roll was also topped with some sort of crunchy, sweet cracker-like topping that i did not love. \n\nwe also had two entrees: the black pepper flank steak and udon noodles, and miso-glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. the steak and udon noodles were okay; nothing special. the miso-glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was delicious and perfectly cooked. the vegetables it came with were somewhat of an afterthought but the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was so beautifully cooked that i didn't care too much.\n\ndefinitely a fun, vibrant, loud environment. overall, i was impressed by the quality and flavor of the food and i enjoyed the atmosphere.", 
            "best meal ever!! server was excellent, he read my mind at least twice. recommended <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark> and chef roll as apps and the toro (having never had it) was like silk in your mouth. atmosphere is sexy dark and non invasive. we sat in the mezanine overlooking buddha. i ordered shrimp and chicken <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> and my husband ordered the black pepper sizzled filet with udon noodles. we shared both as they each sent your mouth into absolute happiness. after dinner i had the orient express martini for dessert (so delicious) and then we sat and enjoyed a pot of tea before paying the check. perfect 10 year anniversary dinner. \nthey also stamped us for the nightclub which was awesome as the line was at least a mile long.\nwill return for sure!", 
            "my bf and i had dinner here one of the nights of our vegas stay. we were seated immediately. the decor was beautiful. i love the large buddha statue in the restaurant. the music was super loud. i suppose i was okay with that since i knew it turned into a nightclub afterwards. the actual nightclub is just located ups<mark>Tai</mark>. the service was okay. i didn't mind since my beverage cup was never empty and my food came out in a timely manner. \nwe had ordered yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce, <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>, <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark>, an assortment of tempura, miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, sand pot lobster/shrimp/<mark>Scallop</mark> with black bean sauce, <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark> and <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark>. everything we ordered was pretty much delicious. i cer<mark>Tai</mark> will be back to try other things on the menu. \ni loved how after dinner, we were allowed to walk ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the club without waiting in line or paying an entrance fee. we were stamped and set for the night. :)",

            "dined here with my wife over a long weekend and to quickly summarize the experience, we both loved it...everything from the decor, the service, and of course, the meal was top notch.\n\nwe booked an early reservation around 5:30pm after being sold on reviews of both the original tao in new york and this one. \n\ntip: book reservations early since the choice times fill quickly on the weekends. \n\nmy first impressions of tao's decor looks like money well spent...especially in the de<mark>Tai</mark>. upon entry, we noticed tubs filled with water and rose petals...to which my wife replied, can we get in? i told her, sure ;) it also created an intoxicating scent...or perhaps that was the drinks?\n\nour table was nicely situated on the second level which overlooked the giant buddah and coy fish pond. this was a great location since it was above the group tables noise and was quiet enough to have a decent conversation of sweet-nothings and what-nots. my wife also pointed out from this vantage point, you can see down some girls tops...i resisted to look as i felt i was being tested.\n\nour server, michael, was tremendously helpful with our dining experience. his fantastic recommendations with the sashimi, the vegetarian selections, and the strong, yet fine tao cock<mark>Tai</mark> were spot on.\n\ni also liked how the other staff members went the extra mile in <mark>Maki</mark> the dining experience special. our water glasses were always full, and empty dishes were promptly removed. they also gave us a line pass for the nightclub ups<mark>Tai</mark>. this was great in avoiding the long lines even as they opened at 10pm.\n\nanother helpful tip is the yin/yang signage on the restroom doors. here's a helpful primer...\n\nyin = feminine forces\nyang = masculine forces\n\nclever, huh?\n\nthis took my wife and i awhile to figure out, especially after a few drinks. they even included male and female statues...and the occasional male attendant peeping out from time to time...to help the confused or drunkards.\n\nit is a bit on the expensive side but well worth it. overall, we enjoyed tao so much and found ourselves craving the food the next day. i'm sure we'll be back.", 
            "i wish there was a way to give it a negative number of stars.  i have been to the tao ny location and loved their giant fortune cookie dessert!  i can't tell you that the food itself or drinks were memorable but i did want to check out the vegas location so i made a reservation.\n\nboy, did i make a mistake. my friends and i arrive right on time and are told that even w/ reservations, everyone waits 30 mins.  so we asked them how long we would have waited if we didn't have reservations.  apparentlly, they didn't have our reservations although i had made the reservations w/ them directly that day.  strike one from the host who was the rudest man on earth.  he must have taken too many \"cool pills\" since he had something up his ass!\n\nthen, while we wait for our reservations they screwed up at the bar, my friends and i are given a cock<mark>Tai</mark> menu that we ordered off of.  we ordered one round of drinks that clearly stated that it should have been about $30 + tip for drinks.  we get the bill and it says $60.  when i point the mistake out to the server (while clearly showing her the menu we were given), she is so dumb that she mentions that we also got a diet coke in addition to our 4 drinks!  so the diet coke accounts for the $30 difference?  what a moran!  when i asked her to bring out the manager as she clearly did not have one brain cell, the  server started giving me an attitude.  after a 10 min. wait for the \"manager\", i was told that they had given us the wrong menu w/ incorrect prices.  apparently, the bill was supposed to be $60 although the menu they gave us said it was supposed to be $7 each.  we were not given an apology for the mistake or anything!  \n\nbecause i have worked at a restaurant and currently work in advertising, i know that good customer service would have included an apology for their mistake and then an offer to honor the lower price.  no such thing was done so i demanded a talk w/ the manager.   \n\nonly after i bitched out the manager did she apologize for the mistake and correct the bill for our 1 round of $30 drinks!  this after <mark>Maki</mark> us deal w/ this and completely ruin a fun night out!  after such horrible service, we were told our table was ready (as if we were lucky to be given our table 40 mins after our reservation time!).  we told them that we would not be dining there.  we didn't want to give this establishment any of our money!\n\nwe gave them a piece of our mind and walked out w/ the glasses in hand! \n\nthis pompousness and outright horrible customer service ruined our evening.  we ended up eating at the casual asian restaurant in the venetian as we were so hungry by this time that we couldn't wait to try to find another \"trendy place\".  it turned out to be a good decision as the food was good and we got great service!  the best part, we ended up spending probably 1/6th what we would have spent at tao.  i would have paid for a great meal, great service at tao but the point that they would not quickly resolve the issue from their mistake made me furious!  \n\ntao, get your act together!  if you went to a store and they clearly had the wrong price marked on a sweater or in their ad, they should honor the lower price.  same goes for the menu you gave us!  i will never go to this location again!", 
            "came here visting family and was suggested to try this place out. ordered a $150 kobe fillet for my boss and then ordered some sushi (various plates) for the family along with a few dim sum and various chinese style ala carte plates. din sum was so so not worth noting, and the steak was far from anything worth $150. i, ordered some peking duck with flied lice and it was actually really good. ordered a few drinks then uncles start getting faded and was harassing the waiters to make sure they were on top of <mark>Maki</mark> sure his bottle never ran out of cold beer. sake was nothing worthwhile (i do apologize if im not as de<mark>Tai</mark> with the food, but its one to forget). the place is beautiful and is staff friendly and its a great place to grab a drink, but id rather suggest eating at the palm for great steaks.", 
            "i've done 22 reviews so far, and have not yet given a 5-star.  in thinking about the best experience that i've had in a restaurant recently, i'd have to say tao in las vegas.  the combination of the tasty foods, fun decor, and excellent service makes tao las vegas deserving of my first 5-star rating!  of course, the vegas excitement adds to the total experience.\n\nthis isn't one of yelpers' favorite joints to dine at in vegas based on the ratings, so i'll share a couple of tips of what i've done and hopefully that'll be helpful to you folks out there:\n\n- <mark>Maki</mark> reservations here is a must!  without reservations, this place is impossible to get into, unless you know people, or do the ol' slipping a bill into the handshake action.  (if you do, try $20 or higher)\n\n- come with friends that are ready to party, because this is a party joint!  meet at the bar, so that if you have folks coming in from different hotels, you can enjoy the drinks while you wait.\n\n- once you're seated, order sharable appetizers, like the edamame, <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark>, or  thai stuffed <mark>Shrimp</mark>.\n\n- if you like sake, they have a pretty good selection of <mark>Sake</mark>.  if you haven't tried the nigori sake (unfiltered), i'd suggest at least trying that.  the best way is to ask the server to give you the rundown.we had the voice in the mist bottle and it was yummy!\n\n- for your entree, you must get miso-glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>!!  it's my favorite fish entree in the world!  savory white flaky tender bits of tasty fish... oh my.  it definitely melts in your mouth yet creates a flavor explosion.  so good!  my friend likes the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, but i think it's not nearly as good as the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.\n\ni've been to tao now for 3 years.  i've had a great experience every single time.  i now cannot imagine going to vegas without my <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> experience at tao.", 
            "the food is just so-so. felt a tad overpriced, but the menu was very <mark>Uni</mark>. i ordered the black peppered <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with udon noodles and i enjoyed the noodles more than the steak. i asked for medium rare and it came out burnt and medium well. i believe that such a tender piece of meat cooked anything more than medium might as well be tossed out. \n\ni'll give props to the bartender for <mark>Maki</mark> some really good drinks. i felt the buzz half way through my dinner, but i couldn't taste the alky at all.\n\n(club reviewed in different section.)", 
            "i would give this place three stars, but the service kicks it up a notch.\n\nthe food is good, but expensive. the boyfriend loved the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark>! everything else was good, but not great. we ordered <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>, gyoza, and a few other things. the server helped us decide, and took an active role in <mark>Maki</mark> sure we were taken care of, comfortable, and full. granted, this was after the buffet at island sushi off the strip, so we weren't trying to eat too much, and the final bill reflected that: $20 per person, including tip. but we didn't order too much, and the server had it all just right. he also made sure that we had enough room in our stomachs left to be able to dance comfortably. he got us the line pass stamps to get into tao, where we danced the night away (albeit a little uncomfortably, given how many people were crammed into that tiny room).\n\nthe decor is spot on. they did a fabulous job decorating this place, and it's all very classy and elegant, without it being over the top, like the rest of vegas is.", 
            "if you have ever dined in las vegas then you know it's all about show here.  i have been to tao in nyc and while the food and atmosphere were stellar, they cannot compare to the service i received at the vegas location.  on the way in, giant tubs full of fresh rose petals line the hallway, there is a giant buddha in the dining room.\n\nthe waiter was so knowledgeable that he was just speaking extemporaneously...just shooting from the hip about the preparation, the sauces, <mark>Maki</mark> recommendations.  he didn't look at a menu or refer to a notepad once.", 
            "we had a short weekend trip to vegas and decided to check out tao since we were staying at the venetian.  it was our first time going into tao (we later also went to the nightclub), and we found the decor and ambiance to fitting, comfortable, and well-thought.  the four of us kept commenting on the buddha floating over the koi pond, the wall of candles, and the giant portraits that were hanging near our tables.  fortunately, our luck didn't just run out there.\n\nwe ordered two appetizers and four main course dishes and were pleasantly surprised with the quality and the quantity.  the <mark>Scallop</mark> were amazingly tasty, and the <mark>Peking Duck <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> were beyond my expectations.  our entrees were <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>, a red curry chicken, a <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and salmon over udon noodles.  all dishes were exceptionally prepared and the thai dishes were better than you'd find at most specialty thai restaurants.  impressive.  five stars would be awarded if our server had been more attentive and perhaps if the price were just a smidge lower.  dinner ended up running a little long and we were antsy to get over to our cirque du soleil show.\n\nat the end of the meal, we left as a happy group and were extremely glad we stopped in.  i'll definitely be <mark>Maki</mark> another reservation the next time i'm in town.  \n\nbonus: the other perk of eating there for dinner was that we were able to get stamps to return later in the evening for their must-see club experience.  the stamps saved us from a huge wait in line and also got us in without a cover charge.", 
            "we went to this restaurant mainly because we heard the good stuff about the dancing ups<mark>Tai</mark>! but when we arrived we were immediately intrigued by the restaurant and the entrance! beautiful. great staff. the waiter mentioned that there was some reviews about them of them being snobby...i couldn't believe it. our waitress was so attentive, extremely interested in <mark>Maki</mark> sure our experience was awesome. we ate this amazing corn soup with a crab stick that was to die for. then we had yellow<mark>Tai</mark> jalapeno sashiimi and <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> and it was delicious! i tried their specialty drink and again superb! go there and enjoy! try the lychee/mojito mix that they make. outstanding. a bit pricey but worth it!", 
            "i tried giving tao restaurant a second chance, but it has still failed to redeem itself from previous experiences. a huge factor in my poor rating for this venue was the lackluster service. i called about 2 weeks in advanced to make a reservation for 7 and we still had to wait over 40 minutes for our table to be set. what's the point of <mark>Maki</mark> a reservation if we're stuck waiting in the lounge anyway? the hostesses were not very helpful or friendly either. \"your table will be ready in a few minutes\" turned into a dreadful prolonged standstill in our evening. i have the slightest feeling they dragged it out intentionally just to entice us to order drinks in the lounge, but we did not cave.\n\nfinally seated in the nippy upper level right in front of an overpowering ac system, us poor gals decked out in vegas-appropriate dresses shivered as well browsed through the menu. the fish clay pot i had my eyes set on was taken off the menu, so i played it safe and ordered the black peppered <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> w/ udon once again. it took me a while to regain the sensation in my tongue from the blazing hot flavor, but the rest of my friends thought it was pretty tasty. the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was one of the best dishes at the table. who knew such a thick, buttery, succulent filet accompanied by a pile of spinach could be so worthy of drooling-status. \n\ni still think the prices are overpriced for what you're getting. $18 for <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> is just flat out absurd. the only reason we decided to dine here was to get stamped for the nightclub so we could pass up the entire line with free cover. smart idea if you plan on dancing the night away at tao, but after this experience, i'd much rather scout for vip passes on the strip or find a promoter for a hook up.\n\nps: don't forget to bring floss if you order the black pepper <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>. i walked out front door with black specks all over my teeth. hawtness.", 
            "dinner here was amazing.  we made sure to get an earlier reservation (6:30) on a friday evening, so we didn't have to worry about the night club crowd coming or having our reservation be bumped.\n\ni had originally asked for a private table after reading reviews on here about some tables being too close to one another.  we were seated on the third level over looking the main floor and the table couldn't have been more perfect.\n\nthere were two of us having dinner this evening, and tao didn't disappoint (at this time slot) for a romantic evening.  the lighting, decor, and music were all absolutely perfect.\n\nwe started out with the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> and veggie dumplings.  he had a gin and tonic, i ordered a shirley temple  (unfortunately he brought me a roy rogers, but i wasn't going to whine about it and have him run down three flights of s<mark>Tai</mark> for another soda for this pregnant chick).  entrees were <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> and <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> with pork <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>.  phen-o-menal.  i have never had such good food enter my mouth.  i hate steak, and my husbands cut of meat almost turned me into a convert.\n\ndessert was fruit and sorbet, <mark>Maki</mark> for a perfect food ending to the experience.\n\nour server was just ok, but the young man doing the clean up work was the one who deserved the kudos.  just an over all pleasant guy.\n\ni suggest this restaurant to anyone...just make sure you go earlier in the evening, and i think you'll be hard pressed to bitch about anything.", 
            "the best dining experience ever. we waited forever to get seated for a party of 7 but it was all worth the wait. \na lot of the dishes we ate was recommended from our waiter and our waiter did a really good job <mark>Maki</mark> those recommendations. every dish we had was mouth watering. my favorite was the lobster dumbling (interesting right?) and the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. a lot of their sushi rolls were really delicious also. everyone should definitely give this place a try at least once when you're in vegas. it would be worth the experience =) i would definitely come back here", 
            "perhaps because kim kardashian, her mom, & co. were to the table to my right, and david spade and colin firth of snl were to the table to my left, tao failed to give me one thing i would have needed - a lobster bib.\n\nthat is the only thing that my tao restaurant dining experience lacked and who knows, had i asked, maybe they would have had one on hand. we had reservations for saturday night for 8:30pm to celebrate my 30th birthday. friends were gathered from chicago, nyc, and san francisco. we had a 45 minute delay in being seated at our table but that came as no surprise given the busy night. we were seated in the first floor dining area near the majestic two-story tall buddha statue. our server was courteous, attentive, and knowledgeable on the menu items.\n\nthe standouts for me appetizer-wise were the <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> and <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark> (i'm pescatarian and do not eat meat). my carnivore friends seem to enjoy the dragon <mark>Tai</mark> <mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark> and meat potstickers. through it all, the wine kept pouring.\n\nour entrees came and i was dazzled by my <mark>Typhoon Lobster</mark> with fingerling potatoes and spicy <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark>. this is when the bib would have come in handy because when i was done it looked like i had massacred an aquatic beast! fine food, great conv, surrounded by top notch friends -  this was an evening to be remembered. \n\ni will mention that the pair who ordered the peking duck for 2 were indifferent to it. the description had sounded amazing but did not live up to their expectations. everyone else enjoyed their food immensely though. then came what would make for buzz that this meal was a contender for best meal ever - the dessert platter.\n\nover the off-key singing of 'happy birthday' came the mother of all dessert platters. it included a scoop of ice cream, sorbet, molton chocolate cake, fruit, and a giant fortune cookie filled with white and dark chocolate mousse and chocolate buddhas. simply incredible and i am not generally a dessert person. \n\nfrom the moment you walk in to the moment you leave tao you feel as though you are experiencing something <mark>Uni</mark>, exotic, and daring. the decor is chic and sexy, the vibe hip and happening. thank you tao for <mark>Maki</mark> my birthday dinner one i will never forget.", 
            "if you are looking for a memorable meal, this is a great place to go while in vegas. from start to finish this was one of the most memorable dinners i have had in my life. the atmosphere, music, staff and food make this a great place to dine.\n\ni went for my birthday with my girlfriend, so we had reservations, so we didn't wait to be seated. the wait staff was very very attentive and truly catered to anything we needed.\n\nthe food didn't dissapoint as i had read a lot about tao before going. we chose from a very extensive wine list, decided on our appetizers and meal and were pleased with every part of the meal.\n\nthe part of the dinner that was the most memorable was when they brought out a huge fortune cookie for my birthday (i didn't realize my gf had planned for them to do that) by this point i was very stuffed, but it was such a great idea for a birthday dessert. i didn't feel rushed at all and was able to truly enjoy my meal.\n\nthank you tao for <mark>Maki</mark> my birthday that much better.", 
            "i'm disappointed, tao. the first two times i went, you had this amazing delicious black <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> udon noodles dish that was an orgasm in my mouth. then you took it off the menu. now, you are not only overpriced and loud with crappy service, your food is mediocre at best.  \n\nwe had table reservations for 10:15 pm, and we were seated at 11:30 pm. granted we went on the night that jay-z went to tao the club, but still. \nour food took 30 minutes to come out. i wasn't even hungry anymore at this point and my friend took a nap at the table stone cold sober because we were so tired and bored. \nwaiter definitely didn't give a crap about us at that point in the night and didn't bother checking back on us. \nmy friend ordered the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and it was good, very soft and chewy. a bit too sweet. \nanother friend ordered the salmon on a bed of udon noodles and she said the noodles were not good. \ni ordered the wasabi crusted steak. it was good, but not worth the 2 hour wait and $35 price tag. \n\ni would not recommend. however, if you do go, definitely make reservations and try not to go on a weekend or when a huge star is <mark>Maki</mark> an appearance...haha. \n\ngreat sake selection. tao's a pretty awesome place to drink and dance (aka go for the club, not for the restaurant) and to see hot girls.", 
            "our vacation in las vegas started with a romantic dinner at tao...we had to race over to not miss our reservation, the restaurant is gorgeous. i loved the dim lighting and the hip music playing, they even honored my request for a booth. well the booth was actually sofa cushions and throw pillows hehe. our server was nice but as other yelpers have mentioned the service is fast, so fast i feel like you can't really enjoy your evening. bussers constantly hoover around like ninjas to clear items right away <mark>Maki</mark> me feel rushed but i'm sure its because they have a lot of reservations. started with the <mark>King Crab California Roll</mark> , very good and then we had the miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>. the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was so delicious just like butta! recommend this dish , the duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> my guy seemed to enjoy and for dessert we had the molten chocolate cake mmmm delightful!", 
            "damn!! they got us on the free admission to the club. when you do the math is not worth it. guys pay 40 and girls free. but our bill for 4 people was three hundred plus. ha! ok on to what we liked:\n\nambiance: great- kinda loud so good for groups.\nservice: this was good too, i guess it will depend on your waiter.\nfood: we had the kang pao chicken, shrimp coconut, <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> and the damn <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. (yes they push the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> to you)!! \n\nok, yes portions are small, but everything is very tasty. so basically you are paying for the chefs <mark>Maki</mark> it. we paired it with a bottle of wine. oh and the water. careful here, it is 8 dollars for distiller water. hahaha .. \n\nafter dinner we literally had to step out the restaurant to stand in a special line just to be directed to go back in. that's silly if you ask me. you will get stamped twice, that is silly too. at around 10pm when the club opens the crowd is not bad. however, this place gets ridiculous full of women. so men ... enjoy!", 
            "great place to have dinner. <mark>Maki</mark> reservations much ahead of time with the correct amount of guests is a must. because if it gets too busy it may be difficult for them to add more ppl to your party. food is delicious. had the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. other dishes we ordered <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> topped with fried egg, hong kong xo shrimp & <mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark>. all scrumptious, & best of all is getting a stamp after dinner to go clubbing ups<mark>Tai</mark>. but for labor day weekend, you still have to pay for admission even after dinner. the club is usually way over packed, especially during labor day weekend. popular place, hip-hop music, fantastic asian food, great service...i can't wait to go back, back to tao's tao's ugh!!!", 
            "i went to tao asian bistro on april 4, 2013 with my boyfriend for our romantic date in vegas. i loved the atmosphere and decor. the music is loud and pumping through out the restaurant but it didn't bother me at all. it could bother some older people though but it set the tone for the ambiance of the place and i personally enjoyed it.  i suggest <mark>Maki</mark> a reservation to the place since it is pretty busy.  the wait for our table did not take too long. we were able to grab a drink at the bar right there located in the entrance and get our barrings and enjoy what this place had to offer. the staff was very helpful and friendly. the food..amazing. i had the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>..omg! so good..so worth it. boyfriend had the kobe steak topped with onions, amazing as well! dessert was terrific.  after dinner, if you wanted to go to the nightclub all you have to do is ask your waiter and a hostess will stamp your hand to get in to the club. you still have to go outside to check your i.d. but the wait in the line is minimal.  \nso, why the 3 star?  well everything was great except at the end of our meal when the waiter brought back our check to sign the total. i wasn't sure what that was about but pointed to my boyfriend to have him sign it because he was paying for it. now, we are seated very close to the other people and the waiter yells out, \" well when you tip me less than 10% you have to initial that's what you want.\"  people next to us were looking at us and my face just went flush! then he walked away muttering something under his breath, i was trippin! my boyfriend had miscalculated the tip, not usually coming to a place like this and feeling a bit uncomfortable, he quickly signed the bill over and gave it to the waiter not realizing he miscalculated the tip.  now, i understand..don't get me wrong. i was a bartender so tips are apart of your income and perhaps in a place like this, management may look at the waiters performance as a reason why his tip was so small, which clearly was not the case, he was great. but to embarrass us like that, really upset me and instead of going to the club later, we just decided to go home. so much for a romantic night. but you know, regardless of all that, i do know that vegas thrives on money and on our way out i gave the waiter another tip because he was good, no doubt. it was just a misunderstanding. \nagain, i understand where the waiter was coming from but jeeze, maybe speak softer and don't walk away muttering things under your breathe <mark>Maki</mark> us feel like we were unwelcomed and like we did not belong. because of this, regardless of the awesome food, we will not go back nor advise others to do so either because i believe it could have been handled better with less embarrassment for customers who spent over $200 for dinner.",

            "i've been back to tao every time i've been in vegas (so 3 or 4 more times), and have had excellent food and service every time. i think the key is <mark>Maki</mark> a reservation well in advance and expect that you will have to get a drink in the lounge while you wait for your table. (max wait has been 20-30 minutes, nothing compared to the 1.5 hour wait the first time) it's a great place for groups as you can tell them your preferences and have them just bring out a bunch of items for the table.",

            "oh, tao - i so badly wanted to give you 5 stars, but your over-hyped restaurant had some sever issues we need to address. 3 out of 5 stars for delicious food but terrible customer service. word to the wise: tao = a place where the customer is always wrong.\n\nhere's the skinny: we dined 11 deep saturday evening while in town celebrating my 32nd birthday. it's memorial day weekend and expected to be a madhouse in vegas, so i made every precaution to secure reservations, be on time for said reservations and ensure my entire party was on time with me. i may not be kim kardashian, but perhaps the manager failed to note that my reservation was made by someone who works directly with them and asked for my party to be taken care of. i'm also assuming they didn't know that i am a celebrity publicist in la and have sent numerous clients to spend thousands of dollars at their establishment. maybe if this was noted my party would have received better service. \n\nfood: my boyfriend and i split the chicken dumplings, the spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sushi roll and the chicken <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>. more than enough food! the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> seemed to be in a never-ending bowl! it alone would have fed the 2 of us easily. the dumplings were the best choice out of our order. fresh, steamed and flavorful. i only wish there were more in an order! the roll was good, but nothing special. my friend had the bbq pork and it was phenomenal. i'd look into that if bbq meats are your thing. the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> was pretty standard. it was also good but nothing to write home about. nonetheless, i was pleased with the overall good experience. the crowning glory was the giant fortune cookie that was sent out for my birthday (it is filled with both vanilla and chocolate cream - oh hey ying yang!) - which was the only good move by the restaurant the entire meal.\n\nthe service: this is where things get rough. we sat down for our 8:30pm reservation around 8:45pm. we didn't mind the 15 minute wait. we're a large party and it's saturday night - reservations can take some time. i get it. we sat down and didn't see a waitress for nearly 20 minutes. when she finally came by the table she took our drink order and bounced for another 20 minutes or so. my friend asked for an iced tea that 40 minutes later had never made it's way to the table. when we asked about it, the waitress took another 15 minutes to bring it claiming that they had to \"brew a new pot\". ok. then when we were an hour and a half into our dinner order waiting for more beverages the waitress was m.i.a. we finally called over the manager and asked if we could please get some drinks (one of which had already been ordered and never brought to the table). his response was \"what? are you trying to get something free out of this?\". i'm sorry? no. we are trying to get our drinks and spend more money in your establishment. wow. the next epic failure of this restaurant/nightclub comes from the security guard/staff. my boyfriend got up from the table to take a work related call. it was noisy inside so he stepped outside to take it. when he came back in a security guard grabbed him by his shirt and said \"where do you think you're going?! get in line!\" to which my boyfriend responded - \"i've been sitting with a table of 11 for nearly 2 hours. i just stepped outside to take a call.\" the guard then responded \"yeah right\" and grabbed him by his shirt collar. when he turned around to radio someone my boyfriend just yanked himself free and walked inside. the final straw was when the waitress asked if we'd like to divide the tab. we said yes and tried to be fair by <mark>Maki</mark> a few groups so as not to create 11 separate checks for her. tik-tok - 1 hour later (literally) she plopped down the checks with a look of irritation and left. \n\ntotal time in restaurant (due to slow service) - 3.5 hours!! it was nearly midnight when we finally left!\n\nthe club was hopping but we were not interested in that. we just wanted a nice dinner in what seemed to be only a mildly busy restaurant. a party of 11 would have left a much bigger tip had the service been respectable. i get that everyone wants to dine here, but that doesn't mean you have to stop creating a great customer experience for those choosing your restaurant. there are many other options.",

Kobe Ribeye</mark> (no way this is real kobe, despite assurances from our server. it was tough and hard to cut, we had real kobe at gordon ramsey's the next night and there was no comparison) and a few sushi/<mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark> (decent, but the rice wasn't well flavored. we had better sushi at the buffet). \n\nour waiter was very nice and attentive, but there were cer<mark>Tai</mark> elements of dishes that were left off (rice for the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark>, asked for sauce on the side for a couple dishes that wasn't done).  all in all a truly regrettable experience from start to finish. their fortunes for their cookies were pretty funny though.",

            "fun atmosphere and great food. i was unsure what to expect when we got there because it took them almost 20 minutes after our scheduled reservation to get seated. however, the staff was very apologetic and got the three of us a round of drinks to make up for the delay. once we were seated everything was amazing. our server jon was very knowledgeable and the food was amazing and came out quickly. the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was the best i have ever had and the eggplant was also extremely delicious. furthermore, the manager made a point to come in and check in on us throughout the meal to make sure we were enjoying everything and to apologize again for the delay, at the end he even sent us a giant fortune cookie for dessert that was heavenly. the manager and the staff did an amazing job turning our experience around and <mark>Maki</mark> sure we were truly happy and enjoying everything. i would definitely done here again.", 
            "never been to this place before but what energy.staff was keen on <mark>Maki</mark> the evening special and it showed.from the moment we went it , welcomed with smiles and shown to the lounge area.bar staff was only too happy to accommodate and answered any inquiries we had.just wandering around ups<mark>Tai</mark> (there is so much to see) we met joey p.he took us about and showed us the koi and statues,  photographed us  and was such a pleasure to speak with. did i mention the dj was kickin it? oh yeah, it was on. just one of those nights where everything fell in to place, thank you tao, we loved it.", 
            "lets start with the arrival. we had a reservation friday at 9 pm. granted, it is a friday and reservations are not an exact science - but this restaurant was cer<mark>Tai</mark> well overbooked. it would appear they are more concerned about <mark>Maki</mark> sure the restaurant is at capacity than customer experience. \n\nwe were seated around 9:35 pm. after complaining that this was unacceptable, the host picked up our first round of drinks. \n\nonce seated, the noise level in the restaurant makes talking next to impossible. i felt myself yelling to comm<mark>Uni</mark>, which i am sure perpetuates into an even louder restaurant. \n\nwe had ordered a <mark>King Crab California Roll</mark>. it was mediocre at best. i have had thicker crab meat at the buffet across the street. and for this price ($18 if i recall correctly), i am sure 50% of the price was paying for where i was eating. \n\nthe highlight of the meal was the dessert. we had the yazu trio donuts. they were delicious. \n\nthe lounge was nice. ample seating space for you to lounge after eating. drinks are the same price as you would expect on the strip in any top scale lounge/club.", 
            "service began slow, but soon picked up. most everything we ordered was delish! we saw tao on \"must eat\" places on the food channel - as the focused on the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. although i appreciate the guide through the <mark>Maki</mark> of the dish, it was really just miso butterfish. lobster won ton in ginger shiitake broth was yum!\ni'd come again.", 
            "i'm very disappointed in the customer service i received at tao asian bistro restaurant tonight. i booked a dinner reservation for my best friend bachelorette party for 8:30pm. we had a packed schedule for the night, so i was really upset when 9:10pm rolled around and we were not seated. we arrived at 8:20pm, and i booked this table over 2 weeks ago. a couple of large parties walked in after and was immediately seated. i had to make the decision to leave because we were on a strict schedule. it pretty much ruined my best friend's bachelorette party since she was looking forward to the food at tao. \n\nwe will not be <mark>Maki</mark> any reservations at tao ever again.", 
            "i'm going to give 5 stars. i want to explain it all from start to finish. i made a boo boo on open table but dru was so nice and since we arrived early he said peak would not be for another 30 min so we sat down immediately.  my reservation was made for the one in new jersey! oops. so bad. i was just sitting there like omg \"i never do this\". then up pops jeffrey at table and he's so nice and chipper.  he made me feel at home and un rushed!  for <mark>Maki</mark> boo boo on my reservation i think i may have got the best server in the house. he's so awesome. \n\ni also met one of the managers, kong, he came by to check on me and he was very informative. i'll remember his name like \"king kong\" lol. anyway so i'm eating and everything is delicious. service is beyond great. i'm going to tao nightclub again but just to see what's up. i'll provide pics as i go but 5 stars for how they treated me and how delicious the food and service are. \n\ni'm"

            "i've been to tao las vegas twice, and both experiences are in the top 5 best meals i've ever had. \n\ni think the key here is to get the tasting menu - basically, tell your server how much you'd like to pay per person, note any food preferences, and your server will put together a tasting menu which is perfect for groups who want to try a little bit of everything. \n\nfirst off all, we had incredible service. there were 5 us celebrating my friend's 30th birthday, and our server was energetic, passionate, and delivered a great experience. his manager was also phenomenal, and ended up comp'ing us with a second bottle of perrier-jouet champagne after he mispoured a glass. \n\nour server (i can't remember his name) told us that $50 per person would be more than enough to get everything we wanted, and he was right about that. all in all, he brought out three courses - two rounds of appetizers and tasting plates, and one round of entrees. it felt like we tried everything on the menu, and were so stuffed by the third round. highlights included:\n\n- <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with asparagus - honestly, out of this world. melt in your mouth, incredibly flavourful. \n\n- <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>\n\n- <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> with avocado and <mark>Soy Paper</mark> - probably the best sushi i've ever tasted\n\n- <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> - every bite was an explosion of delicious flavour\n\nin addition to the wonderful food and service, tao also has a great atmosphere - beautiful decor, good music, very trendy and sleek, filled with beautiful people. bonus is that you get free entry to tao nightclub after dinner, though we didn't find it that great (it was crowded and not fun). \n\nwould highly recommend tao for dinner!"

            "first of all my favorite thing to do in vegas is eat. tao makes no exception to please. first course <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, super delish <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark> lobe beef just melted in your mouth. all the entrees we shared were amazing, cock<mark>Tai</mark> superb. the decor was great but to be expected from all over the top vegas restaurants. i only wish there was one in chicago.", 
            "i guess for vegas this is suppose to be good. the front of the house was horrendous. servers were friendly but pacing of the food was so off.  the food was ok, we had sushi <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark>, over-priced.  i think this place is highly over-rated but i guess you go  for the ambience. i don't  think i would come back but coming from the bay area i have high expectations.", 
            "scrumptious! loved tao, we had an early reservation, 5 p.m. as we were going to see phantom of the opera, so i cannot verify the issues of other reviews who had to wait a long time even with a reservation.\n\nwe were promptly seated, and hats off to titus our server. he was fabulous. when asking for recommendations he was honest and truthful offering an explanation as to why he felt the way he did about a dish. he was attentive, friendly and fun to interact with during our dining experience.\n\nnow to the food, we started with the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, steamed and not fried and exquisite. the lobster was perfectly cooked, and the <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> was amazing, 5 wontons was a great starter, but left us wanting many more.\ni ordered the wok seared new york strip, it was seared to  perfection with a nice crust on the outside, yet tender on the inside. the sauce is bursting with strong asian flavors that are a perfect accompianment.\ntony ordered the omakase, which is sushi <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark> and is the chef's choice. he was thrilled with everything served on the plate. \n\nthe food was wonderful,so  we decided to break with tradition and order dessert, that turned out to be a good decision. we ordered the chocolate <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark> served with an orange dipping sauce, again, truly amazing, there is nothing better than something with a crunch and oozing warm melted chocolate. \n\ncan't wait to go back!", 
            "the only thing i really liked about this place were the drinks and the atmosphere. it's a see-and-be-seen kinda place which i knew to expect. three of us waited 1 hour on a monday night to eat here, which wasn't really a problem since we sat at the bar for that hour, but it was also 10 pm!! we made friends with the bartender who was a really cool, down to earth girl who shared stories of celeb sightings and poured plenty of alcohol in our drinks to make them worth $15 (she also told us about the bizarre rules that tao had for their staff, only to be expected at a hot vegas spot). by the time we got seated it was clear that our waitress was either exhausted or could not handle the amount of tables she had because frankly - she sucked. she forgot drinks, forgot to put in orders, took 20 minutes to bring over the check, and wasn't even friendly or apologetic. i sampled a few things - the duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> which were ok, the <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark> which were decent but nothing to write home about, and some sushi <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark> which was again - just ok. anything else we had was not memorable. like i said at the beginning, the drinks were fabulous but obviously pricey - hey it is vegas! but i could've drank the \"geisha girl\" martini all night. i definitely won't be back there to eat but would consider going for a few cock<mark>Tai</mark> or hitting the nightclub.", 
            "we decided to come so that we can have a nice dinner and then easily get into tao.  i actually thought the food was really good and the service was great too.  it is a bit pricey, but oh well - it's vegas.\n\nmade reservations on opentable.com and got seated pretty quickly (there were only 2 of us)\n\ncrispy <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark> roll - inventive and different, but just ok in my book\n<mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> - yum, v. good, would get this again\nwok seared ny sirloin - good sized portion, nicely cooked meat, the sauce and mushrooms were very flavorful\n<mark>TAO Lo Mein</mark> - really big portion, v. yummy but was your typical <mark>TAO Lo Mein</mark> from any chinese restaurant\n\nbefore we left we got a stamp on our wrist that said \"line pass\".  we went back to our hotel to relax for a bit and then went to tao a bit later and got in no problem.", 
            "tao is a gorgeous restaurant! servers were very attentive. i went with my ladies and we had a feast! i do recommend reservations for dinner. \n\nhere are some of dishes we had:\n\n<mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> - the first few bites were delicious. the bass was like butter. after that, the sauce really sank in and became a bit overwhelmingly sweet. \n\ncrispy <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark> roll - perfection! \n\n<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> - i wasn't too fond of this. it was too buttery for my taste. \n\nbuddha's harmonized vegetable feast - we needed to eat something healthy during the night... \n\nchef's selection of symphony sweets \n1) moshi - ice cream in a gushy chewy yummy shell\n2) big fortune cookie w/ ice cream and fruits - mmmm :d \n\nright ups<mark>Tai</mark> is the super packed super popular lavo nightclub.", 
            "i've been to tao many times, but never actually sat down for dinner until i went to vegas last weekend. i got to say, i was very impressed. i went on a sunday (holiday weekend) and the wait was about 30 minutes. we had a drink in the lounge area so it wasn't bad. the music and ambiance were perfect. once we were seated, we had nothing but great service. our server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable and our food came out super fast. we ordered the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, the <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark> with wasabi salsa (i'm not a big fan of wasabi, but this was sooo good!), <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with asparagus, and the chef's roll. everything we ordered was delicious, however the chef's roll was okay.\n\nagain, the servers there were great. it was a team effort. if another server saw that we had a question or had finished our plates, he/she would come right away. anyway, if you're looking for a restaurant that has great food plus a fun and fresh atmosphere, tao is perfect. \n\np.s - i took off one star because this place is a little pricey and the portions are a bit small too.", 
            "i went to tao for the 2nd time tonight for dinner.  the last time i went i had some sort of a groupon or something, and tonight my friend had a gift card she was given as a gift.  i think that's the only way i would dine here.  i think the food is overpriced, and if you're going to spend this much on a meal, there's other places in town i'd rather go.  maybe it's just me.\n\nwe started with two appetizers... the spicy tune <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> and the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>.  we had the tartare last time and really enjoyed it.  we enjoyed it again this time, but it wasn't as magical as it was last time.  the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>... well, they tasted like the best wontons i've ever eaten, but i could barely taste the lobster.  the flavor was drowned out from the broth, i thought.\n\nfor a main course, we split the most expensive omakase sushi menu, which was like $58.  very underwhelming how little food we got: one roll, 7 pieces of nigiri, and 6 slices <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark>.  granted, one of the nigiri was toro, and the roll was a <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> of some sort, but for $58, i'd expect a little more.  throw some salmon nigiri in there!\n\nwe also split the coconut crusted shrimp with peanut sauce, which was really delicious, though the breading on the shrimp was too thick.  that was made up for in quantity of shrimp, as i think there were like 8 or so large shrimp.  it also came with a side of rice, and some sort of salad in the middle of the plate.\n\nlastly, we tried the avocado tempura since we both love avocado.  very tasty.\n\nwe stuck with water, and when our bill came, it was $140 after tax.  we did have a lot of food, but that seems like way too much to pay for a meal at a place like tao.  the service was top notch, and the ambiance is typical loud music, dark vibe that you'd expect in vegas.  so 4 stars for me.", 
            "first night in vegas and this was the first place we ate.  honestly, i have no idea what was ordered since i was able to enjoy the sharing plates that were already chosen by someone else at the table.  don't think of this as an authentic venture into asian cuisine, but rather a high end of your americanized favorites.  everything that came out was very tasty, a particular stand out was the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> which was outrageously good.  the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>, <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark>, various skewers of meat, ice cream mochi, were all tasty.  there wasn't a single dish that was ordered that i would have regretted ordering.  the waitstaff was a little kookey (his personality was incredibly bubbly in an odd sort of way) but he was very, very attentive to our table.  at no point did my drink empty, always presented dishes on the right, and people cleared our table quickly once items were finished.  the kitchen was equally able to keep the wait times between courses very minimal.\n\nambiance of the restaurant is pretty nice, kind of reminds me of sea in brooklyn.  they also had some pretty intense club music playing during the entire meal, apparently next door is a club so i guess that's kind of expected but it was definitely a club kind of atmosphere while we ate since the music was so loud.", 
            "greeted by incredible decor as you walk in and are seated, you're already excited about the meal to come. japanese, chinese and thai fused in a way that made us extremely happy. white <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark>, <mark>Crispy Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll, lobster <mark>Tai</mark> dumplings, duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>. all delicious dishes. our favorites however were kobe tartare and five spice beef <mark>Chinese Five Spice Short Ribs</mark> - omg!!!! of you like sake, and vodka, sake and fruity cock<mark>Tai</mark> you're in for a treat. i had a sake called 'first embrace of snow'. a must if you live food and are in vegas.",

            "tao is a chic, dim lit asian place at the venetian. the entrance is lined up with empty bathubs filled with water and flowers. when you walk in and pass the lounge into the restaurant, a large buddha statue welcomes you into this beautiful restaurant. i went here before catching a show & loved my food!\ni ordered:\nappetizer- veggie dumplings (sauteed ginger & sesame seeds)\nentree- sushi--spicy tuna, salmon, & <mark>Spicy Shrimp, King Crab, and Asparagus Roll</mark>. (it was amazing) \ndessert- white choc/raspberry fried wontons w/ icecream\n\n*warning*- no free refills. 4 bucks for a glass of sprite filled with ice? eh. anyhow, the ambiance is trendy, the service was quick, the food was delicious & overall..was a great first night out during my vegas trip this past weekend!\n\nmake sure you have reservations well in advance!",

            "pleasantly surprised by the food. i wanted to experience a trendy vegas restaurant and heard mixed reviews on tao (ny and vegas). however, i really enjoyed my dinner here.\n\nfirst of all, the decor is beautiful, albeit ridiculous. a restaurant called tao, filled with numerous buddha statues including the nearly twenty feet tall one in the main room, large photographs of sumo wrestlers in one dining area, and large color photographs of buddhist priests of varying ages decorating the hallway to the restroom, and the overall opulent decor? not to mention the crowd of tourists and revealingly dressed beautiful and less beautiful people. not sure this is what buddha intended but overall a very beautiful lounge and restaurant.\n\nwe had a reservation (thank goodness; the place was packed) but had to wait about a half and hour. we got a drink at the bar. yes, well drinks were expensive but not surprising for vegas. once we were seated, we had a nice view of the gigantic buddha. our server was very friendly and informative. i felt in general the waitstaff was attentive, even though the restaurant was so busy.\n\nas appetizers, we ordered the lobster dumplings in shitake mushroom broth, spicy ahi tuna on top of crispy <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark> (basically like nigiri) and the <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark>. the dumplings and broth were excellent but the skin of the won tons were a little thick. the spicy ahi tuna was yuuummmy. the <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark> was the weakest dish. the fish was not very prominent, which was disappointing since i love toro. this roll was also topped with some sort of crunchy, sweet cracker-like topping that i did not love. \n\nwe also had two entrees: the black pepper flank steak and udon noodles, and miso-glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. the steak and udon noodles were okay; nothing special. the miso-glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was delicious and perfectly cooked. the vegetables it came with were somewhat of an afterthought but the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was so beautifully cooked that i didn't care too much.\n\ndefinitely a fun, vibrant, loud environment. overall, i was impressed by the quality and flavor of the food and i enjoyed the atmosphere.",

            "my bf and i had dinner here one of the nights of our vegas stay. we were seated immediately. the decor was beautiful. i love the large buddha statue in the restaurant. the music was super loud. i suppose i was okay with that since i knew it turned into a nightclub afterwards. the actual nightclub is just located ups<mark>Tai</mark>. the service was okay. i didn't mind since my beverage cup was never empty and my food came out in a timely manner. \nwe had ordered yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce, <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>, <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark>, an assortment of tempura, miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, sand pot lobster/shrimp/<mark>Scallop</mark> with black bean sauce, <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark> and <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark>. everything we ordered was pretty much delicious. i cer<mark>Tai</mark> will be back to try other things on the menu. \ni loved how after dinner, we were allowed to walk ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the club without waiting in line or paying an entrance fee. we were stamped and set for the night. :)", 
            "i went here on a recommendation of a friend. i really enjoyed the atmosphere and our waiter was great. we were very happy with the recommendations made from our waiter. the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was wonderful. the sashimi plate had a great selection; the <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark> and the chef roll were all delicious.\n\nwe sat at the sushi bar. something we always enjoy, however, at tao there was no interaction between the itamae (sushi chef) and the patrons which we found disappointing, especially because it seemed they had a lot of down time. \n\nbecause this is vegas, people watching is always at its' best. there was another couple sitting at the sushi bar who clearly had a lot to drink, so that made for some enter<mark>Tai</mark> conversation over dinner. \n\noverall, the food was good and the wait staff attentive; however, i would probably try somewhere else for sushi when we go back next year.",

            "like the new york inspired tao, the vegas version is the mega grand daddy of the two, sporting a beautiful asian themed interior of the highest caliber.  and also like the new york tao, featuring plenty of asian fusion that is severely overpriced and at times overrated.  plenty of people tend to seek this place during all hours of the day, during various nights of the week.  staff has been helpful but amusing in that on more than one occasion, our wait person was unable to pronounce properly some of the items on the menu and confused a thai dish with an indian one (curry, go figure.).  if you must go, make sure someone else pays your bill as my night special bok choy with seared tuna and duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> was a mere $31.50.\n\nif that wasn't enough, in order to fill myself i ended up going to in-n-out shortly afterward.", 
            "friends were in town and they wanted to try the very popular tao restaurant.  (it's been reported that the tao restaurant is one of the highest gross-ranking restaurants in vegas!)  just as we were about to enter the hallway, this very large bouncer asks if he could help us and we mention we have reservations and then he allows us to proceed further.  talk about intimidating, and this was for a 7 pm dinner!\n\nwe were seated ups<mark>Tai</mark> on the balcony overlooking the huge buddha.  as menus were presented to us, the waitress asked if she could get us some water.  as i perused the flimsy two page menu, front and back, i didn't even know where to begin.  my fellow dining companions were quick to notice the 16 oz. grilled kobe sirloin for $150 and the individually priced nigiri pieces ranging from $3-$15 a piece.\n\nthe menu suggests that all items were going to be served family style, so we asked the waitress for a few suggestions.  i could barely hear her over the hum of the restaurant.  (i would not consider tao to be romantic at all.)\n\nin the end we decided to start with four different appetizers and two entrees.  and this is what we got:\n\n<mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark> ($14) - this came with five lettuce leaves.  a decent amount to fill all the leaves.  the squab mixture was a bit too moist and the bf found it too sweet.  i had squab juice stuff dripping all over my hands right off the bat.  there was a lot of flavor though and crunch, probably from the celery.\n\n<mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> ($16) - a clay pot arrived with 5 lobster-filled wontons.  very flavorful with slices of shittake mushrooms laid out too.  a very light and delicate dish.  \n\nsashimi of <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> with fresh wasabi sauce ($28) - beautifully presented on a circular clear plate with herbs on top.  we couldn't determine if they were already sliced apart or what, but with the meat being so delicate, just grab a piece and pull and the meat will tear gently apart.  lovely taste and clean.  however, i didn't recall a wasabi sauce or flavor to it.\n\npork <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with thai chili sauce ($11) - this order came with 3 triangles filled with pork, so we requested another order so we could all have a taste.  the <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> was decent, nothing particular special about it.  the thai chili sauce tasted store bought though.\n\nmiso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables ($34) - very good, but i guess the better question is when have you had a bad piece <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>?\n\n<mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark> ($26) - we must have misheard the waitress because we thought she said it came in a coconut curry.  it did not, but rather a sweet sauce with about five pieces <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> in it, including the drumstick.  it was okay, nothing particularly special about it.\n\n<mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark> ($4) - of course we had to order some rice!  we got two orders which is just enough for four people who aren't heavy rice eaters.\n\noverall, the food was good.  definitely overpriced though, and it's catered to a cer<mark>Tai</mark> kind of clientele.  you'll be amused to find things like kung pao chicken ($26) and grilled prime porterhouse with wasabi dipping sauce ($88) on the same menu.  we decided to pass on dessert as the waitress-recommended giant fortune cookie ($10) or fuji apple <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> ($8) didn't appeal to us enough.  (we actually drove over to luv-it frozen custard instead!)\n\nservice is a huge component of what makes this experience worth it or not, and tao fails in this department.  i was not impressed with the chatty young waiters who dropped (not placed) the silverware onto the table, reached across the bf to put things in front of me, and who 'hid' the menus behind my guest on his chair.  (uh, who does that?!)  as they moved our glasses and silverware to make room for our dishes, they did it in such an unorganized and messy fashion.  i felt like i was staring at someone's hands trying to do a card trick.  i'm used to the staff performing such tasks in an unnoticed way as to not disrupt the private conversation the dining guests are having.  the waitstaff should take a few lessons from rosemary's restaurant's waitstaff.  that's what i call service!\n\nat the very end of our meal, someone did come by and ask if everything was okay.  and it was...just okay.  they asked if we were going to the club afterward and i said yes and asked if they had any passes.  what they do have is a \"line pass,\" which is really a simple stamp on your inner left wrist so you can supposedly bypass the long line outside.  however, you will still have to pay cover.  (i think this part is rather ridiculous.  they should at least offer a discount on the cover instead.)  with the stamp being so simple, a washing of my hands right after dinner washed it right off.  not the best pass i would say.\n  \ntao restaurant is the kind of place you say you've been to and that's it.    there are better places where service is valued higher.\n\n$185 total, including tip and tax, no drinks", 
            "tao had a very nice ambience to the place.  i love the koi pond below the big budda statue. \nthe sashimi <mark>Spicy Shrimp, King Crab, and Asparagus Roll</mark> and mojitos were good, but don't eat the duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>. or order the watermelon cock<mark>Tai</mark>. those two were very poor choices. \nthe waitress was kind enough to take back the watermelon cock<mark>Tai</mark> with no charge. \nthe bathrooms were nice, but confusing if you dont know what yin and yang stands for. just take your chances. ;) \nwill probably give it one more chance ...", 
            "love the huge buddah! this place just felt cool, not to mention the people in here looked much cooler than the typical people walking the vegas strip!!\n\nin a town filled with meat, this was a great place to get a vegetarian meal. you are usually in pretty good shape with asian food, but the abundance of fish and steak on the menu made me worry at first!\n\nwhat we got\n\nveggie <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>\nveggie dumplings\nkung pao chicken as kung pao tofu :) \n<mark>Sweet Potato</mark>, japanese eggplant and avocado tempura\n\nroot of innocence sake (yum!)\n\nthe wine list is immense and great, but the sake was a better deal :)\n\ni personally recommend the avocado tempura!! i had never had avocado tempura before and these big yummy chunks are a great treat!", 
            "wow, just wow.  the service for my event last night gets five of the biggest, flashiest, vegas showgirl style stars you can even imagine.\njust walking up, the zen almost washes over you as you wish that the tubs full of rose petals were actually there for you to soak in.  but then you remember it's vegas, and that's nasty, and the pounding music hits you and you're not so zen.  then you're just overwhelmed by the design of the place.  you walk into one of the most perfect lounge areas i've ever seen.  tons of cuddly couches and areas to sit with friends, all bathed in a very sexy candlelit glow.  the better to enjoy your foofy, brightly colored cock<mark>Tai</mark> in - maybe do a little canoodling.  now this is a place i would definitely come to if i lived in the area.  i had something very blue - called the blue zin i think?  (that's what happens when you let bartenders make your drinks, but worth it, it was delish) and a blueberry cosmo which just might be the most beautiful tasting cock<mark>Tai</mark> ever.  but yeah, they really should've used white cranberry juice instead of red.  i am totally stealing that drink as my own.\nand seriously, i cannot rave about the staff enough.  from setting up the event, to the execution, we were treated with kid gloves and doted upon the entire evening.  our crowd had a great time and i was swimming in compliments for an event well done, and i know it was thanks to tao and their dreamy staff (cutie patooties galore!).\nthe apps were fab (and not just because i set the menu) - i especially liked the duck, the triangular pork <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>,and the shrimp (which were not rubbery or chewy at all, but soft and almost flaky).  the food at the buffet was only decent, and the desserts just okay, but absolutely adorable (hence the one missing star overall).\ni would recommend this location for an event a million times over - they have plenty of nooks and crannies (or nightclubs or balconies overlooking the main dining room) to fit your group, and the know how to make sure your event goes off without a hitch.", 
            "the food was very interesting.  some of it worked, some of it didn't, but the overall experience was delightful (until they turned up the music way too loud to talk.)  the decor is outstanding, buddha statues all around, including one 30 foot one.  the food is asian fusion.  i had salmon/avocado/<mark>King Crab California Roll</mark> which was excellent (real crab.)  the duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> were a bit over done, but tasty.  we had the lobster sea food dish, the lobster was  a bit overcooked and the sauce was heavy, but the dish was good.  the soups were very well done (cream corn <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark>.)  the blueberry won ton dessert was just excellent.  if i'd had more room i would have ordered another.\nwe had the <mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark>, which were okay, but pretty standard.  \n\ni had a couple of sake flights (they have an excellent selection) which were delightful.  the wine list is very good.  don't bother asking for a blended drink, 'it takes too much time...\" the waiter claimed.  \n\nthe service was very good, actually too good, as they started bugging us too much.  first to explain every single dish on the menu in excruciating de<mark>Tai</mark> (it is a big,eclectic menu.)  then to constantly refill my water glass every time i set it down.  \n\nit was a good meal overall and i'd recommend it.  we got their early with reservations when they opened and were promptly seated.", 
            "we had a large party so we had to wait to be seated but as you come in the decor is all asian fusion flair and  and modern.  once seated we got our drinks pretty quick and ordered a ton of small plates of: <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>, <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>, prawns, yummy kobe sirloin, <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, etc.. everything tasted pretty good but i was not wowed.  i ordered the chocolate parfait and it was the best!! service seemed very prompt overall.  i think the place is nice but pretty pricey and maybe just a place you go one time and that is it.", 
            "i really liked the decor. fresh rose petals, buddhas, candlelights, dim, very romantic. we had the <mark>Crispy Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll, shrimp tempura roll, and <mark>TAO Angry Dragon Roll</mark> with eels. they were all better than average, though a bit small - not unexpected.kids wanted the lobster wonton soup and shrimp tempura. the soup was better than the tempura - too thick and oily. we tried the duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>, it was pretty good, don't mind ordering again. the eight of us shared the <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> with scallons, xo shrimp,<mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>,<mark>TAO Lo Mein</mark>, kung pao chicken, assorted sashimi, and the lobster dish that i totally hate my friend for ordering .... just kidding about the hate part.....  every entree was very salty, and the worst part was it tasted like the same sauce was used for every dish. with all the food we ordered and consumed, i actually still had room for dessert, i must say this is probably the best part of the meal. the chocolate parfait with godiva liquer was nice, balances out the saltiness lingering in my mouth. tried hubby's lychee sorbet - refreshing, kid's mousse fortune cookie, so-so, but they found it amusing. i actually could eat more, the portions were just too small. we did not see paris hilton, but did see robin leach with a couple young blonds. :)", 
            "i went with my boyfriend & 4 yr old son & we really enjoyed it. service was friendly, attentive & majority of the waiters were quite decent looking lol.\n\n*lychee martini - excellent\n*pork <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> w/ thai chili sauce - delicioius, tho they're more like a triangle shape than a roll lol\n*<mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> - mediocre, wouldn't order it again\n*crunchy spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> roll w/ crushed <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> - flavorful, fresh & <mark>Uni</mark>\n*a crusted red snapper dish - awesome. the fish was cooked just right: not too dry, not too undercooked.& the sauce went well with it. \n\nit's a fun, trendy atmosphere & i definitely want to go back...minus one star for the small portions...but ya gotta expect it in vegas i guess.", 
            "this restaurant had it all. a very hip vibe, cool decor (for sf yelpers it reminded me of ana mandara), great service and really good food. honestly, the service is what took this place to a 5 for me. our waiter was named zeban (?) and he was really helpful on suggesting dishes and pacing our food. he even held back on the last order (some <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>) until we were sure we wanted them. he was right. it was one too many dishes. here are a few highlights- lobster won tons were great. bbq pork was so so as was the sliced steak. crispy tuna tartare sushi was amazing, as was the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> satay. the udon noodles with bbq salmon was cooked to perfection, but i was expecting a soup type udon and this was a large piece of salmon next to a pile of noodles. the star of the night was the peking duck served mushu style. wine list was good and wine service was very good. i liked that zeban knew his stuff. nothing worse than a waiter that has no clue what the wines taste like. the sake list was really great too,. we had the giant fortune cookie for dessert, which was a kick. it was a super fresh fortune cookie filled with white and chocolate mousse, and served with fresh fruit. yum.it came with 4 fortunes in it, which was a fun way to end dinner. \nfinally, a warning: yin= ladies room and yang = men's room. 2 men walked into the ladies while we were in there. the restroom attendant (love that touch, so old school) said it happens all the time...", 
            "since we were staying at the venetian, we chose tao for our dinner destination the last night of our vegas weekend... my dad made the reservation in advance and let them know we were celebrating a birthday.  there were six of us in the party, and we actually all arrived right on time!  the hostess said it would be a few minutes, so we sat at a table in the lounge area, ordered some drinks, and snacked on some of the wasabi peas.  the waitress that took our cock<mark>Tai</mark> orders was sweet, and she made some great taojitos for the group!  at 8:30, we were wondering why we had to wait so long and getting a bit ansy... we finally were taken to our table around 8:40.\n\ndinner was amazing once we were seated.  chris was our server and took great care of us.  we enjoyed a round of appetizers including lobster dumplings, crispy tuna tataki, edamame, duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>, and eggplant tempura.  we also did dinner family style and shared wasabi steak, <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> with shrimp, crispy snapper, seafood in black bean sauce, <mark>Spicy Hoi Yin Eggplant</mark>, curry shrimp tempura maki, and pork fi<mark>Pork Belly Red Rice</mark>.  it's two days later, and i am writing this all from memory - it was that good!  (usually i would have to look back at the menu to remember what we ordered, but it all made a lasting impression in this case).  we literally cleaned all of the plates - everything was great, and quick too!\n\nluckily, even with all of that food, we saved room for dessert.  chris brought out a beautiful birthday cake for the birthday girl and boy (my bro and sis are twins).  i'm talking really quality, beautiful gourmet cake (like aj's in az).  it had \"happy birthday a & z\" written on it in chocolate and it was a vanilla layer cake of sorts.  \n\ni didn't pay the bill, and i'm sure it was expensive, but this was by far the best meal we had on the trip, and i'm sure it was worth it!  the only reason i'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the wait we had upon arrival - other than that, tao was amazing!  beautiful ambiance too - i'll have to go back next time to check out the nightclub!", 
            "3.5 stars. i ordered the peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> as my appetizer and fried red snapper as my main course (snapper was the stand out). this restaurant is massive! a friend of mine at dinner exclaimed that this place looked exactly like pf changs (they're like an americanize chinese food place with nicer decor and an american wait-staff). it was a replica of that place, just this one was the super-walmart of pf changs'. \n\nthe <mark>Peking Duck <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> tasted like they were from a pre-packaged roll set they also lack a sizable amount of hoisin dipping sauce which i was looking forward to. i was underwhelmed since they were $14. the red snapper was actually good, i enjoyed and recommend it.\n\nthe music was pretty loud in the place, so i wouldn't bring my family here for a quiet meal.\n\noverall, decent, not memorial except for the semi-naked girls in the bathtubs as we left the restaurant. this is vegas, what do you expect?", 
            "so impressed. i really was hesitant to believe all the hype about tao, but all of it is well-deserved. the staff is unbelievably friendly and so good looking. being hot is undoubtedly a prerequisite to apply for a job at tao. i was with a party of six and we had reservations for 7:30. we didn't actually make it to our table until around 8:00 or so but i absolutely didn't mind. the lounge area is gorgeous and believe me, you will enjoy sipping on cock<mark>Tai</mark> and people watching... so much that you might not even want to go to your table : )\n\ntry the tao-tini. so yummy.\n\nfor appetizers, we had the vegetarian <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with chili sauce and the pork dumplings - both delicious.\n\nas an entree, i had the salmon, though i'm not sure of it's exact title on the menu, it's the only salmon dish there. try it, i promise you will not be disappointed.\n\nalso, don't be mislead into thinking tao is too pricey for you. everything on the menu is moderately priced and well worth it.\n\nonly downside - it seems as if bussers try to get you out and turn over tables as soon as possible, trying to pick up your dish before your even done with it. small price to pay, though, for such a great dinner.", 
            "i have been to tao before, though usually earlier in the evening and we liked it enough to go back. well, that is the last time i will be going there and also the last time i will recommend that anyone else go either. \n\nlike many of the other reviewers i had made a dinner reservation (far in advance) for a sat night dinner. the best time we could get was 10:15. after waiting in line for the \"reservation check-in\" we were told they would call us when our table was ready and they gave us a pager. well wait we did. we didn't get seated until and hour later! what kind of restaurant operation takes reservations and then makes you wait an hour anyway? that is really poor front of the house operation. \n\nfood: the shabu-shabu filet was terrible. it tasted like they had left the raw meat sitting out for hours. the <mark>Garlic Green Beans</mark> we all ordered tasted like they drenched them in fish sauce, and i could tell that they had not changed the oil in their fryer in quite some time as the <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> (both appetizer and dessert kind) tasted like rancid oil and were too hard to bite through! not one person at our table commented on liking their food. \n\nthe wait staff seemed to be attentive but that was only the first time our waiter came to the table. after that time we had to try and find our waiter to flag him down. when it came time to pay and we were obviously done for quite some time, he was nowhere to be found. even worse, three of us paid to have sparkling water instead of just tap water and when we were about half way done with our glasses, someone actually came around and refilled them with with tap water! if you are going to hire people who can pay attention or at least ask the question, then maybe you should serve your waters in different glasses since there are three options.\n\nafter our mediocre and ridiculously overpriced meal we went to go to the club ups<mark>Tai</mark>. they came around and gave us stamps at the table that would allow us access without waiting in the long line and without paying. when the first person got to the front of the smaller line he was charged entry <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark> to get in ($50!!). immediately we said, \"wait we don't have to pay\" instead of being able to credit him back for the charge or just giving him cash, the manager came over and gave him drink tickets instead. he acted like he was being soooo nice by giving him and the girl he paid for a ticket and then a second one each. what, 4 drinks for $50, not including tip?? geee, thanks so much for the generosity. to top it all off, the club sucks. cheesy, bad flow and really bad air flow. we decided to go up the tao beach instead to get outside and that was better as far as being able to move around and breath, but the cockroaches running around were a bit of a turnoff.\n\nwith all of the choices in vegas now, this place needs to step up their service and food quality or be replaced.", 
            "tao is one of my favorite restaurants ever!  located inside the venetian, this asian fusion restaurant is a must eat when you're at vegas.  make sure you make reservations though, especially on the weekends, or you might not get the time you want or you'll have to wait awhile.\nthe decor is very trendy vegas, with dim lighting, lit red walls to contrast the dimness , buddha statues, bathtubs filled w/ rose petals, and japanese lanterns.  ambiance is very chic, modern, and sophisticated.  \nthe food compliments the ambiance of the place, using traditional asian recipes and adding modern flair.  here's what i had:\nappetizers: \n<mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark>- asian flavored <mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark> were sweet, tasty, and the meat came right off the bone - there were 6 <mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark> in one order\npeking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>- fried spingrolls with peking duck inside was delicious and not covered in oil like other <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>\nentree:\nmiso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> -  my favorite place to get <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> never disappoints\namerican kobe- my friend ordered this and he gave me a couple bites, and it was pretty good.  first time having <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> so i wasn't too sure what to make of it.  beware of $88 price tag.\ndessert:\ngiant fortune cookie- enough to feed 4 and served with fresh tropical fruit.  the fortune cookie was light and complemented well with the vanilla mouse inside the cookie.  i found the chocolate mousse to be a little too sweet.\nservice was efficient and friendly, so no problems there.\ni'll definitely come back to tao every time i go back to vegas.", 
            "we had a wonderful experience. we had an rsvp and had zero wait. we had a group of 10 led by a vip that secured us a nice round table. the wise and skilled waiter (jake) sagely suggested that we set an approximate cost per person of around $70 or so (not including drinks) and he bring out multiple entrees and serve family style. we had a few vegetarians in the group.\n\nthis plan worked very very well. the vegetarian dishes (kung pao tofu, <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>, <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark>, sake-flavored mushrooms) were all quite good. the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers were out of this world. also quite good were the lobster dumplings. service was excellent at all times, though this might have been influenced by a vip in our group. b/c said vip among other stuff we were treated to sushi, some apps and a dessert platter with a giant fortune cookie stuffed with yum, ice cream, apple dumplings, pocky, and stuff similar to cannolis. the dessert was good, but definitely not the best stuff that this place has. if you are looking to save money, skip dessert here.\n\nperhaps our experience was not normal b/c the vip on board, however the food, ambiance as well as the great wine/liquor menu justify a splurge here. if your waiter is half as good as jake, you will be 100% satisfied.", 
            "the only thing i really liked about this place were the drinks and the atmosphere. it's a see-and-be-seen kinda place which i knew to expect. three of us waited 1 hour on a monday night to eat here, which wasn't really a problem since we sat at the bar for that hour, but it was also 10 pm!! we made friends with the bartender who was a really cool, down to earth girl who shared stories of celeb sightings and poured plenty of alcohol in our drinks to make them worth $15 (she also told us about the bizarre rules that tao had for their staff, only to be expected at a hot vegas spot). by the time we got seated it was clear that our waitress was either exhausted or could not handle the amount of tables she had because frankly - she sucked. she forgot drinks, forgot to put in orders, took 20 minutes to bring over the check, and wasn't even friendly or apologetic. i sampled a few things - the duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> which were ok, the <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark> which were decent but nothing to write home about, and some sushi <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark> which was again - just ok. anything else we had was not memorable. like i said at the beginning, the drinks were fabulous but obviously pricey - hey it is vegas! but i could've drank the \"geisha girl\" martini all night. i definitely won't be back there to eat but would consider going for a few cock<mark>Tai</mark> or hitting the nightclub.",

            "best meal in vegas.  i quizzed the waiter on at least five different dishes i was considering and once he explained what was actually in the dishes, they sounded amazing.  i felt he did a much better job with the descriptions than what was on the menu so be sure to ask questions about the food prep.  we started with <mark>Sweet Potato</mark> tempura and veggie <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>, both were lovely.  then we moved on to the pepper filet udon noodles which were a more flavorful <mark>TAO Lo Mein</mark> and the xo shrimp with extra spice which had <mark>Garlic Green Beans</mark>, shrimp, rice all in a spicy, bean sauce.  the shrimp dish was the best asian dish i have ever eaten.  for dessert, we went with the donuts with the dipping sauce which were a great finish to a great meal.  great, knowledgeable and helpful service.",

            "it kills me to write this review. this is maybe the most disappointing dining experience i've ever had in las vegas. i brought a group of 11 here last thursday night. our waiter's name was bobby. he strongly suggested a pre-fixe menu due to the size of our party - it would come with appetizers, main dishes and dessert for $60 a person (pre-fixe means we have no choice in what gets brought to out table, fyi).\n\nso after we agree to the dinner, the appetizers made it out in about 20 minutes; and honestly, they were great. fried <mark><mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark> Bao Buns</mark>, <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>, <mark>Chinese Five Spice Short Ribs</mark>, some kind of seafood dumplings and three rolls of sushi. our table of 11 seemed satisfied with the amount of food we received for the first course. also, i thought all of it was delicious. \n\nunfortunately, this is where our fun ended. about an hour later, our waiter comes to our table for the first time since our appetizers were dropped off and asked if we were ready for dessert. we said, \"ummm, we'd like our dinner first!\". he acted shocked that we hadn't eaten yet. he left, came back a minute later and said that all of our food was delivered to another table accidentally and that he'd have a new round of food brought to us very quickly, maybe 10 minutes. well, 20 minutes later, we started to get upset. i told bobby that we had been waiting too long for our dinner. he tried to claim we had only been waiting 45 minutes, including the mistake. but i disagreed and he got a little upset with me. he told our table 3 minutes and our food would be out. so we waited. again. ten more minutes went by and i walked over to an assistant manager and asked him to please get our bill right away because we were leaving. i said we'd be happy to pay for our drinks and all the appetizers. he said that was fine. moments later the food finally came out. but it was too late.almost 90 minutes had passed and four people had left our party. \n\ntwo minutes later, bobby comes back to the table and announces that dessert is on the way - mind you, we didn't get any dinner. i told him to talk with his manager - we had already agreed to pay for what we consumed and we wanted to leave. he got more and more visibly upset with me and our group - he was also having words with the assistant manager after i demanded the bill.\n\nwe finally got the bill and it was $327 and change. for appetizers and about 13 drinks. we tipped %15 percent, even though our service was awful; and he never gave a true apology for screwing up our dinner. \n\nwhat stinks, is that i was the reason my group went to dinner here! i convinced them to go - and we all had an awful experience. even worse, literally no one from the restaurant seemed to care in the least. seriously, even the assistant manager admitted it was a long time to wait for dinner, yet after being there for a total of 2 hours, they didn't even comp the drinks. \n\nneedless to say, i will never go there again. and 10 other people will never go again either. its a good thing las vegas has so many awesome places to dine. and for that reason, you should avoid this establishment!!!", 
            "nice interior and service. the food wasnt too special.\n\nliked the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> and the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>,\nbut dont get the duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>..you can't taste the duck", 
            "i was a little apprehensive given the overall average rating was only 3ish stars ...but my fridge was adamant about attending their halloween bash and the concierge says the best option would be to do dinner then club ...\n\nall that said, my concerns were unfounded.  the food was divine!!  we started with the lobster <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> which were delish ...the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> truly is one of the best things i've ever eaten (apparently that's their sig dish) but the shut yo minute dish was the <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>.  huge shrimp in this crispy coconut coating was beyond yummy ...\n\nwe finished with the fortune cookie which is much much more than a cookie!! \n\nfull and a wee bit tipsy we went through the gyrations to get into the club (why so many stamps and check points??) \n\nparty if was!!! really amazing costumes. great music. a place to stand or dance.  best of five clubs we visited!"

            "i was in las vegas for a work event and two of my colleagues and i decided to try tau out for dinner. \n\nwe had reservations but still waited almost 20 minutes to be seated and were only seated at that time because my colleague went back up to the host stand. i understand that the restaurant was busy but expected that if the wait was that long (with a reservation) that the host would let us know. \n\nonce we were seated we decided to let the waiter (who had been there for 5 years) decide how we would attack the menu. his recommendations were spot on. we started with the <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> (which was tasty but had too much rice for me) and the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> (wontons were light and the lobster and sauce were rich - delicious). \n\nhe had us move onto sushi and had the <mark>Surf and Turf Roll</mark> and the yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce. the yellow<mark>Tai</mark> has a great balance of flavor and while the <mark>Surf and Turf Roll</mark> was good, it had almost too many flavors going on. \n\nwe moved onto heartier dishes like the wok-seared new york sirloin (which was good and way less expensive than the 12 oz <mark>Grilled 12 oz. Kobe Ribeye</mark> our waiter suggested), the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (he suggested two appetizer portions as opposed to one main which was the same price and we got more fish), and the buddha's vegetables. all were delicious and the perfect amount of food for the group. \n\nwe finished off with the oversized fortune cookie which came with a fortune for everyone and was fun to share. \n\noverall it was a fun dining experience as long as your are ok with sharing plates (which i am).", 
            "just back from vegas and again had a fantastic meal at tao. this restaurant is likely my favorite anywhere. i have been there 3 times and have had 3 amazing meals. the atmosphere is great and the food is incredibly flavorful and very well prepared. sushi is high quality. must try <mark>Surf and Turf Roll</mark>. miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> out of this world. noodle <mark>Lobster and Kim Chee Fried Rice</mark> dishes are great. i have typically gone with a large group and we order the chefs taste menu. not a bad selection to be had. incredibly high quality restaurant with great food and a fun atmosphere. highly recommended!"

            "ok when i think about restaurants on the strip i generally don't think i'm going to have any sort of meal that is satisfying, tastes out of this world and is not pretentious. tao has really taught me a lesson in that department. don't judge until you've tried. \n\ni've come to tao two times to eat and both times my socks have been blown off. not really...cos both times i wore heels that were way too high and uncomfortable and ended the night walking around without shoes. note to self: do not wear ridiculous shoes when you intend to walk more than 3 steps. \n\ni digress...i digress...back to tao. contrary to popular belief, both times i was here (once with 8 people and once with 4), we were able to get tables (the first time we called the night before and the next time we just walked in) on saturday nights. as you enter tao, there are these flower-petal filled mini earthen bath tubs...haha...if i had a couple of their super strong lychee martinis i would go take plonk myself in one of these. they look that zen and inviting. \n\nthis latest visit i made to tao started with drinks at the bar while waiting for our table. lychee martinis...i made sure to ask for \"extra strong\" martinis and that was delivered. a great start to the night. the waiter we had was very knowledgeable about the food. he knew exactly what went in each dish. tao is also very vegetarian friendly. they can substitute tofu in many dishes and there are many veggie options. ok now to the dishes:\n\n1. <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark> - yum yum...very nice and interesting. never had these before. i probably wouldn't order these if i didn't have more than 4 people in my party. rather large portion and the taste is interesting only the first couple of bites\n\n2. sake infused mushrooms - ok i am going to go <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> right now. this was soooo good....i hate sake and i'm salivating all over my laptop right now. i can't even describe this dish. you just need to get it. need to i tell you\n\n3. steamed veggie dumplings - the dumplings itself were pretty normal. nothing out of the regular dumpling world. don't get me wrong, they were good...just nothing to write a paragraph about (although i guess i already have). now, the dumplings came with this amazing crunchy cucumber side. ok...seriously...cooked cucumbers. sounds icky but yum yum yum. very very nice...\n\n4. <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with veggies - wow. crispy lettuce, perfectly cooked tofu, simple flavors and you wouldn't even know you are eating <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> (i don't like <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>). tastes sooo good. this is literally the best <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> i've had outside of asia. and i've eaten many a <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>\n\n5. mango tamarind martini - this one tasted sooooo good. masked the taste of alcohol (i can't stand the taste of alcohol) and tasted interesting with just a hint of tamarind. a perfect complement to the meal. the drink still packed a good punch even though you couldn't taste the \"punch.\"\n\nwe ended the meal with the 4 of us sharing a chocolate cake of some sort. i'm not a fan of chocolate cakes in general so i can't really remember how it tasted. the girls seemed to like it though. \n\nwe even got our hands stamped to get into tao (the club area) after we ate. totally worth the price!\n\nif you are in vegas and up for a nice dinner on the strip i would suggest tao for sure. great food, amazing drinks, good service and the ambiance is of course wonderful.", 
            "7:30pm reservation.  arrived on-time and seated promptly.  the place was already packed and there was a good vibe.  not too loud, not too quiet.  our waitress was very friendly, responsive, and timely.\n\ndrinks- tao-tini..  they were good.  smooth and wound up putting back quite a few through the dinner.  didn't really feel the effects so i'm thinking the \"smoothness\" was perhaps just a lack of alcohol.\n\nthere was a chef's tasting menu being offered this night for an unbelievable $55.  super cheap.  both the gf and i went with this option.  first course- spicy tuna tartare over <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>.  yum.  she went with the thai stuffed shrimp.  again yum.\n\nsecond course-  <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>.. eh ok.  she went with the <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark>.  neither of us enjoyed as they were extremely bitter and wound up each only taking two bites.\n\nthird course-  wasabi crusted filet with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>.  two others at the table also ordered this and theirs was cooked perfect medium.  unfortunately i ordered the same temperature and was brought a completely rare piece of meat.  after taking the piece back to the kitchen, it returned 5 minutes later completely charred on the outside yet still very much rare on the inside.  i'm not one to send a piece of steak back twice, so i just left it alone.  i finished the 1/2 of my gf's perfectly cooked filet.\n\nfourth course-  chocolate <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> and a citrus dipping sauce.  very good and very rich.  j<mark>Uni</mark> apple blossom with vanilla ice cream.  nothing special, but good none the less.\n\nif we didn't get such a great deal with the tasting menu, i know my review would be completely different based on my <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> not being cooked to order two times, and eventually just giving up on that course.  with that aside, i did enjoy myself and the majority of the meal was very good.... btw... if you order a coffee with bailey's, it is brought out in a mug large enough to wash your hands.", 
            "my friend was in town and we wanted to go somewhere with a \"scene,\" that simultaneously had good food.  needless to say, tao was not the right spot for us.  as for the \"scene,\" tao pretty much hits the mark.  it is a beautiful restaurant, dimly lit, and plenty of las vegas visitors looking for a good time.  as for the food, it was very mediocre.  i will not be returning.  on a busy saturday night in las vegas without a reservation, we waited for our table for about 30 minutes.  not bad, huh?  well with the 40 bucks we tipped the hostess to get a table at all, i was expecting to be seated right away.  i want my 40 bucks back! oh well, live and learn.  on to the food.  between the two of us we split the chefs special roll, shrimp tempura roll, spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> crunchy onion roll, <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark>, <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, and edamame.  sounds like a lot of food, but the portions are small.  this was definitely enough food for us though.  the sushi was really not impressive.  yes, the fish is fresh, but unless you are ordering sashimi, it is still possible to get a bad roll.  well, we got three.  the worst was the shrimp tempura roll.  so small! so bland! so boring! come on, if you are going to list this a chefs speciality, it better be special.  the other two rolls were a little better, but both sitting on top of a heavy mayo sauce that did not taste good.  this is my pet peeve.  leave off the heavy sauce people! especially if it tastes like crap.  the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> were pretty decent, i could only eat one because they were rich, turn your stomach kind of rich- too saucy, too salty, too something.  i will say the <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was pretty good.  this \"healthier\" version of <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was packed with veggies and had a great flavor, the only downfall here is that it was served to us ice cold.  the best thing at this restaurant by far was the <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark>! i swear these should be on every asian restaurant menu.  i cant imagine it is too difficult to roast these bad boys up, but regardless, tao did a good job here.  if you haven't tried these peppers before, please try them!  i wouldn't steer you in the wrong direction.  anyway, i may come back to tao for a drink, but as for food, i will take my sushi/ asian craving elsewhere.",

            "tao restaurant is a pretty nice place.  really cool environment, good vibe, beautiful layout, etc, etc.  it's also not a bad thing that they don't seat you right away (even if you have reservations)....they have a nice lounge area.\n\nif restaurants were all about the environment, then tao would get 5 stars.  but alas, this is a review of a restaurant, so the actual food is important too.  typical asian fusion stuff....a mix of a wide variety of asian dishes.  if you don't know what asian fusion is, think about it this way....you can order sashimi (japanese), <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> (thai), <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> for appetizers (thai), and then throw down some shrimp, <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, spicey <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>, kung pao, etc.  oh yeah, avoid the sashimi....we're talking 4 small leaflets worth for $60.  the food is decent, but nothing special.  the environment goes along way (great place to take your special someone or a bunch of friends)...but the food is nothing to rave about.  remember, it's definitely on the pricey end.  if you're considering a few appetizers, some drinks, maybe a bottle of sake, an entree for you and your sweatie, and then some dessert to close the deal, we're talking $100 each, easily.\n\nand please, please don't go here just to get a free line pass for tao, the club.  it's not worth it.  why pay $100 per person for a mediocre dinner just to get into the club?  and besides, if you're part of a sausage fest, you'll still have to pay cover and still wait a bit in line.  and if you cheap out on the dinner (where your main motivation was to get into the club and it's obvious), the server doesn't have to hook you up.\n\nand once you're in, you're screwed because tao is geared towards table service.....unless you enjoy being packed like sardines (well i suppose if there were two girls and you.....).  anyways, think about it...$100 for dinner, $ for cover, and then a whole bunch of $ for drinks. ...and standing the whole time and being very uncomfortable.  or spending $200-$250 each person for bottle/table service, depending on how many are in your group.  it's a no brainer.\n\nso back to the tao restaurant....great environment good vibe, cool place to eat......average food.", 
            "i've done 22 reviews so far, and have not yet given a 5-star.  in thinking about the best experience that i've had in a restaurant recently, i'd have to say tao in las vegas.  the combination of the tasty foods, fun decor, and excellent service makes tao las vegas deserving of my first 5-star rating!  of course, the vegas excitement adds to the total experience.\n\nthis isn't one of yelpers' favorite joints to dine at in vegas based on the ratings, so i'll share a couple of tips of what i've done and hopefully that'll be helpful to you folks out there:\n\n- <mark>Maki</mark> reservations here is a must!  without reservations, this place is impossible to get into, unless you know people, or do the ol' slipping a bill into the handshake action.  (if you do, try $20 or higher)\n\n- come with friends that are ready to party, because this is a party joint!  meet at the bar, so that if you have folks coming in from different hotels, you can enjoy the drinks while you wait.\n\n- once you're seated, order sharable appetizers, like the edamame, <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark>, or  thai stuffed <mark>Shrimp</mark>.\n\n- if you like sake, they have a pretty good selection of <mark>Sake</mark>.  if you haven't tried the nigori sake (unfiltered), i'd suggest at least trying that.  the best way is to ask the server to give you the rundown.we had the voice in the mist bottle and it was yummy!\n\n- for your entree, you must get miso-glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>!!  it's my favorite fish entree in the world!  savory white flaky tender bits of tasty fish... oh my.  it definitely melts in your mouth yet creates a flavor explosion.  so good!  my friend likes the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, but i think it's not nearly as good as the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.\n\ni've been to tao now for 3 years.  i've had a great experience every single time.  i now cannot imagine going to vegas without my <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> experience at tao.", 
            "i'll be fair in saying that it's not the worst i've had because it wasn't, but please, for a restaurant in vegas... \n\nmy friends took me here because we would get entry to the club if we ate at the restaurant - now, i'm not big on spending loads of money on food, i prefer the simple yet delicious; but i thought, hell, it's a vegas joint so it's bound to hit the spot.\n\ni was disappointed. my friend got sushi, it was really good. my other friend got swordfish it was good. i got chicken and while it was good (you can't mess up chicken), it wasn't worth $25. for $25 i got a thigh and half a breast <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> and... and what? that's it. fine dining at it's best... i don't get a side of veggies or rice or tates, just chicken. \n\nmaybe i don't understand the whole realm of fine dining, but why would i pay $25 for a piece <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> that i could definitely cook better at home and not get anything to compliment it? \n\nthe decor was nice and all but honestly, it's a little too dim in their for me. sure, it sets a mood blah blah blah, but i'm not going to be in any mood but seeing an optometrist after i have to strain my eyes looking at the menu in dusk-like light.\n\nas much as i enjoyed a piece of my friends sushi, i'm confident in saying that i will not be returning here in the near future. if i come up at the tables, i might stop by for a roll or two, but don't count on it.", 
            "fantastic food and good (albeit not speedy) service. the waiter was very friendly and happy to make recommendations. they were very accommodating of my dietary needs (vegan) and i ended up getting the kung pao chicken with tofu instead <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark>. they also allowed me to substitute <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>. the place is absolutely gorgeous...worth the money!!",

            "**** review is for summer restaurant week 2013 menu ****\n\na friend joined me here for dinner last night before the human nature show and we both ordered from the restaurant week menu.  for the first course, my friend ordered the <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> with peanut sauce.  i got the \"crunchy spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> roll with spicy mayonnaise.\" we both enjoyed our dishes.  we didn't try each others dishes because paula doesn't eat sushi and <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> is just <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark>.  i did try the peanut sauce and it was good.\n\nfor course two, paula got the <mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark> with choy sum, sweet chili, and lime.  i got the <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> with shitake mushroom, bell pepper, and <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark>.  i did have some of the <mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark> and it was very tender and the sauce was excellent.  the <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> was very good.  the filet was sliced and barely <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark> with the vegetables.  the stand out was the sauce again!  it was rich and very flavorful.\n\nfor dessert, we again took different paths.  paula got the crispy fuji apple blossoms with tahitian vanilla bean ice cream and i got the chocolate <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>\n with kalamansi dipping sauce.  the rolls were good but they weren't stuffed with chocolate as i hoped they would be.  rather, there was some melted chocolate on a leaf and the rolls were placed on the chocolate.  regardless, they were good.  the dipping sauce was non-descript.  i really couldn't say it had much of a flavor.  it tasted more like mango than orange.  for paula's apple blossoms, they were triangle puff pastries with apple filling.  they were good.\n\nservice was very good.  my iced tea was refilled when it got halfway down.  the table was bussed quickly.  our server was very pleasant and he was pleased to know there was at least one local having dinner at tao.\n\nthe room is quite nice.  dark and woody with a large buddha in the center along one wall.  we got our cameras/phones out so we could get a photo of it.  it would be a good place to take a date if you wanted to impress.\n\ni can only can fit in two places for this restaurant week, and i'm glad tao was one of them!",

            "group of 5 ladies, came here on a saturday night during the 4th of july holiday. first of all, the hostess with the blonde hair and orange dress was a total petty bitch and did not want to seat us. had us waiting for over an hour for a table when we saw several open. we would have at least ordered drinks and  appetizers but there was no service in the waiting area. the waiting area was blaring with loud edm music, not at all conducive for dinner or lounge talk and definitely scared us a bit thinking that the club would be the same. meanwhile, troops of people with questionable attractiveness and boldly comfortable physiques would trapes in every few minutes heading over to the nightclub area. we were already on the guestlist for the party but having had good history with their sister company, lavo, we wanted to try the food first,  but in these moments, both the dinner and club scene here were so off putting. the night started off quite weak. once we were seated, after 12, finally the service came pouring in. at least 3 or 4 servers came to our table to excuse the slackness and eager to be of service. nice view of the big buddha statue in the center. food was decent, we enjoyed the pan fried <mark>Chicken Gyoza</mark>, the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> and the <mark>Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups</mark> were ok, we kind of got full off of just appetizers cause again, large portions. my cousins miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> entree was good. strong miso flavor, but if you're cool with that, its good. big portion <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> by someone else. i dont like <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> or peanut tastes so i didnt taste it but she enjoyed. looked big and fresh. i split the shrimp, lobster, scallop in bean sauce entree with someone else because it sounded big and also to cut costs and have more things on the table to taste. was really looking forward to it, it has all of my favorite meaty chewy seafoods. it was shockingly bad, dont know if there was an error made in the sauce recipe, but i have had plenty of similar dishes in the past, never have any been half as bad, and it came highly recommended by the waiter and was amongst the most expensive so we were surprised that it was so bitter. the table tasted and agreed that the sauce had an unpleasant taste. the waiter took it off of our bill gracefully and we left a great tip in exchange. in this moment, the great service that we are accustomed to from lavo, was thankfully shining through here at tao as well. a nice chick came to our table to stamp us and set us up for the complimentary club access. as i said before, we were already on the guestlist so didnt need it, but its nice that they have that additional incentive for dining there, as lavo used to do. will continue nightclub review in other yelp page.", 
            "the only reason im giving tao 2 starts is because of the decor. its dark, with beautiful asian style and a huge hindu god or whatever.. the foods okk, ive had better asian cuisine. its over priced, they charge $5 for a piece of sushi which is unbelievable. my gf got a bowl of noodles & pieces <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark>, you barely noticed any chicken bc they were cut and sliced so tiny. i just think this place is over-hyped.", 
            "this is a really fun place to go with a group of friends and the food was well-liked by everyone in our 10-person group - especially the ladies. a bit pricey, but quite enjoyable nonetheless. \n\nwhen you have a large group, as we did, i would advise getting a lot of plates to share. you can always get more of anything you love. we started with sushi and moved on to <mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark> and <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark>, all of which was very tasty. personally, i love dim sum and i felt the <mark><mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark> Bao Buns</mark> to be about my favorite dish of the night. the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was probably the most popular dish among the group. tao also has several wagyu beef offerings and i haven't found too much fault with any of them.\n\nall in all, a great dinner in a great venue with plenty of ambiance. if the girls are having a good time, then i'm having a good time!"

            "this is a review for the tao restaurant:\n\ni know what you're thinking: style over substance.  i was thinking that too when i first walked into this restaurant.  it is like eating in a nightclub or lounge.  lots of well-dressed good looking people, and relatively loud music.  this place is a scene.  but you know what?  the substance was actually there for the meal that i had.\n\nwe shared a series of small dishes and main courses and were very impressed.  the substance was actually there in the food and the service was friendly and attentive.  a nice treat considering that i was expecting the worst.\n\nfor our starters we had the shrimp with peanut sauce, <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark>, the <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>, and the spicy eggland dish.  all of the dishes were quite good, flavorful, and had a good portion size.  the dish that really stood out here was the <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> which ranks up there with one of the best rolls i've had -- it packed a nice kick and the fish was fresh.\n\nfor the main courses, we shared the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, the <mark>Typhoon Lobster</mark>, and the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>.  the main courses were all delicious.  the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was fantastic as was the lobster.  it was all decadent and delicious.\n\ni would come back here as the food lived up to the style of the restaurant.  plus, you can a line pass if you eat here which allowed us to bypass the huge line into the tao nightclub and enter the club with no cover charge.  a nice bonus!", 
            "my bf and i had dinner here one of the nights of our vegas stay. we were seated immediately. the decor was beautiful. i love the large buddha statue in the restaurant. the music was super loud. i suppose i was okay with that since i knew it turned into a nightclub afterwards. the actual nightclub is just located ups<mark>Tai</mark>. the service was okay. i didn't mind since my beverage cup was never empty and my food came out in a timely manner. \nwe had ordered yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce, <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>, <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark>, an assortment of tempura, miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, sand pot lobster/shrimp/<mark>Scallop</mark> with black bean sauce, <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark> and <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark>. everything we ordered was pretty much delicious. i cer<mark>Tai</mark> will be back to try other things on the menu. \ni loved how after dinner, we were allowed to walk ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the club without waiting in line or paying an entrance fee. we were stamped and set for the night. :)", 
            "we did not wait long for our table & the lounge area is a great spot to wait in. the tao-tini is a must try! it is a light drink, that leaves a creamy raspberry taste in your mouth. the service was the best service i had my entire trip. i recommend the spicy tuna tartare, <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark>, and the albacore <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> special, if they have it. i wasn't crazy about the peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>. the desserts were equally amazing as the food. it definitely has an intimate atmosphere & the nightclub is above the restaurant. those who dine there have access to the nightclub but go on a separate line. definitely worth it!",

            "ok here we go.... things to consider on this review:\nthis is a restaurant that claims to be one of the finest asian fusion bistro in the us so i should be rated accordingly since they are charging you accordingly.\nlooks: the place is beautiful, ambiance is perfect, they get a 10 here\nservice: started good, i was greeted and assigned a table right away, restaurant was near full, once i sat it took 15 min for my waiter just to show and every time i wanted a drink i had to wait much lore than usual just for him to get my order, once ordered the drink came fast, so it was my waiter the cause of the delay.\nfood: i started with a <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>, it was ok, fresh good flavor but too simple, i've had much better <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> in fort worth\nthen no had the ginger salmon, first i expected wild salmon not farm raised, it was well cooked though it came in pieces, one large a a couple around, not like broken but as if i got the bottom of the pile, again i am rating this restaurant accordingly to what they claim to be.. and charge. flavor was good, i love ginger, but it was too intense, not even half through i couldn't finish it, it was too much ginger and garlic.\ndessert was vanilla ice cream with apples, the apple part was old and hard to chew, the i cream was perfection.\ndrinks: i ordered a beer, i was surprised they brought me the beer in a aluminum bottle and not even offered a chilled glass, made me feel like a red neck \nwould i return ?? no specially with all the options in vegas.\nhope this is useful !!", 
            "i've been to tao las vegas twice, and both experiences are in the top 5 best meals i've ever had. \n\ni think the key here is to get the tasting menu - basically, tell your server how much you'd like to pay per person, note any food preferences, and your server will put together a tasting menu which is perfect for groups who want to try a little bit of everything. \n\nfirst off all, we had incredible service. there were 5 us celebrating my friend's 30th birthday, and our server was energetic, passionate, and delivered a great experience. his manager was also phenomenal, and ended up comp'ing us with a second bottle of perrier-jouet champagne after he mispoured a glass. \n\nour server (i can't remember his name) told us that $50 per person would be more than enough to get everything we wanted, and he was right about that. all in all, he brought out three courses - two rounds of appetizers and tasting plates, and one round of entrees. it felt like we tried everything on the menu, and were so stuffed by the third round. highlights included:\n\n- <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with asparagus - honestly, out of this world. melt in your mouth, incredibly flavourful. \n\n- <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>\n\n- <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> with avocado and <mark>Soy Paper</mark> - probably the best sushi i've ever tasted\n\n- <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> - every bite was an explosion of delicious flavour\n\nin addition to the wonderful food and service, tao also has a great atmosphere - beautiful decor, good music, very trendy and sleek, filled with beautiful people. bonus is that you get free entry to tao nightclub after dinner, though we didn't find it that great (it was crowded and not fun). \n\nwould highly recommend tao for dinner!", 
            "i have no idea what people are seeing in this restaurant.  this place is like a mediocre p.f. chang's you wait twice as long and pay twice as much for.  there are too many amazing restaurants in vegas to waste your time here. turn around and head out, do not pass go and save your $200.  seriously, if you have any sort of culinary expectations look for another option.  if you're looking for naked girls in bathtubs, this may be your place (although, no girls in the bathtubs the night we came). \n\na group of co-workers were all here for a conference and decided to try this place out since we were staying at the venetian.  we made a reservation for 8:30 and when we arrived were told we would be seated 'in a few moments' 40 minutes later (and a few times getting the run around by the guy in charge of seating), we finally got to a table.   \n\ntao highlights the modern asian fusion movement on their menu.  unfortunately they also have tried to mask their lack of flavor in dishes by <mark>Maki</mark> them overly salty or overly sweet.  this makes everything taste like it's a microwave dinner or some sort of bad chinese takeout.  \n\nwe tried the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> (way too much sauce that was overly sweet with very little spice element, kinda tasted like one you can buy out of a bottle), <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> (decent, but the shrimp toast was the highlight), <mark><mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark> Bao Buns</mark> (the pork was again way too sweet and the bun had too much dough to pork ratio, this was barely edible),  <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> (another overly sweet dish that was deemed not even as good as chinese takeout), <mark>Grilled 12 oz. Kobe Ribeye</mark> (no way this is real kobe, despite assurances from our server. it was tough and hard to cut, we had real kobe at gordon ramsey's the next night and there was no comparison) and a few sushi/<mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark> (decent, but the rice wasn't well flavored. we had better sushi at the buffet). \n\nour waiter was very nice and attentive, but there were cer<mark>Tai</mark> elements of dishes that were left off (rice for the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark>, asked for sauce on the side for a couple dishes that wasn't done).  all in all a truly regrettable experience from start to finish. their fortunes for their cookies were pretty funny though.", 
            "my lovely wife and i extended her business trip so we could enjoy a nice weekend away without our kids.  of all the restaurant choices, i wanted my wife and vegas newbie to experience the ventian and tao.\n\nreception by the hostess was luke warm and the table was so so with location near the big budda but too close to the server entrances.  but our waitress was extremely attentive and engaging for a vegas wiat person <mark>Maki</mark> up for the poor reception ( i find most vegas servers are dettached and have <mark>Uni</mark> written on their forehead.  reminds me of summit county colorado wait staff who after a ski season make you beg for service).\n\nwe enjoyed the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> satay and a spicey <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> for an appetize.  i drank a version of the moscow mule that was worth the crazy price.  the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is so good i would consider it for appetizer, main course and dessert.  our main courses consisted of the ahi tuna and wyogi <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>.  both tasted fantastic.  we walked out spending $240 ish.\n\ntao atmosphere reminds me a bit of a amped up pf changs but the food is much better.  i highly recommend a reservation and dont accept the first table.  we saw an older guy come in with his \"niece\" i'm sure, and when he rejected the table near the wait person entance, he was shown a much better table.  i get the feeling a few bucks in the hand of the hostess makes a big difference here.\n\ni would definetly go back for a work event or a special occassion.  the place is a bit expensive and the service iffy, but foood quality is above average and considering the options on the main strip, its one of my favorites.",

            "7:30pm reservation.  arrived on-time and seated promptly.  the place was already packed and there was a good vibe.  not too loud, not too quiet.  our waitress was very friendly, responsive, and timely.\n\ndrinks- tao-tini..  they were good.  smooth and wound up putting back quite a few through the dinner.  didn't really feel the effects so i'm thinking the \"smoothness\" was perhaps just a lack of alcohol.\n\nthere was a chef's tasting menu being offered this night for an unbelievable $55.  super cheap.  both the gf and i went with this option.  first course- spicy tuna tartare over <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>.  yum.  she went with the thai stuffed shrimp.  again yum.\n\nsecond course-  <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>.. eh ok.  she went with the <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark>.  neither of us enjoyed as they were extremely bitter and wound up each only taking two bites.\n\nthird course-  wasabi crusted filet with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>.  two others at the table also ordered this and theirs was cooked perfect medium.  unfortunately i ordered the same temperature and was brought a completely rare piece of meat.  after taking the piece back to the kitchen, it returned 5 minutes later completely charred on the outside yet still very much rare on the inside.  i'm not one to send a piece of steak back twice, so i just left it alone.  i finished the 1/2 of my gf's perfectly cooked filet.\n\nfourth course-  chocolate <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> and a citrus dipping sauce.  very good and very rich.  j<mark>Uni</mark> apple blossom with vanilla ice cream.  nothing special, but good none the less.\n\nif we didn't get such a great deal with the tasting menu, i know my review would be completely different based on my <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> not being cooked to order two times, and eventually just giving up on that course.  with that aside, i did enjoy myself and the majority of the meal was very good.... btw... if you order a coffee with bailey's, it is brought out in a mug large enough to wash your hands.",

            "cool, trendy, delicious.\n\nquick tips:\n\n1.  stick to small plates and starters.  most creative.\n\n2.  skip the nigiri sushi.  expensive and not spectacular.\n\n3.  lots of spicy, hot flavors from chili and wasabi.  this is drinking food.\n\nif you must have sushi, top props to the <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> with black tobiko, <mark>King Crab California Roll</mark> (made with real king crab), and the <mark>Crispy Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll served with a yuzu mayonnaise.  all are familiar just made with top quality ingredients and a good flavor twist that makes you long for a second bite.\n\nsmall plate standouts include an unexpectedly good grilled <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> served with a satay sauce. never thought what is essentially peanut butter would go so well with fish.  the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> with mango chili sauce while not purely crab meat just pairs so well with the sauce.  well balanced.  the spicy tuna tartar <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> crackers, a great twist on the classic.  outstanding.  bold flavor, cool tuna, <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> cracker.  so much contrast make for a delicious bite of food.  finally the  <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> sashimi with fresh wasabi; yum.\n\ndo not pass on the peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with hoisin sauce or the lobster and shrimp <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with spicy pineapple sauce.  big bold flavors.  textual contrast at its best.\n\nfinally, if you never had avocado tempura try it.  the warm avocado has the creamy texture of uni.  very different.  very good.\n\nnote:  dining at tao should be social so bring a group of friends.  the food is meant to be shared.  \n\nspecial note:  for the guys, dining at tao does not give you any special vip privileges to enter the tao nightclub later in the evening.  ladies, work the magic.\n\n\nrecommended.", 
            "i went to tao for the 2nd time tonight for dinner.  the last time i went i had some sort of a groupon or something, and tonight my friend had a gift card she was given as a gift.  i think that's the only way i would dine here.  i think the food is overpriced, and if you're going to spend this much on a meal, there's other places in town i'd rather go.  maybe it's just me.\n\nwe started with two appetizers... the spicy tune <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> and the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>.  we had the tartare last time and really enjoyed it.  we enjoyed it again this time, but it wasn't as magical as it was last time.  the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>... well, they tasted like the best wontons i've ever eaten, but i could barely taste the lobster.  the flavor was drowned out from the broth, i thought.\n\nfor a main course, we split the most expensive omakase sushi menu, which was like $58.  very underwhelming how little food we got: one roll, 7 pieces of nigiri, and 6 slices <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark>.  granted, one of the nigiri was toro, and the roll was a <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> of some sort, but for $58, i'd expect a little more.  throw some salmon nigiri in there!\n\nwe also split the coconut crusted shrimp with peanut sauce, which was really delicious, though the breading on the shrimp was too thick.  that was made up for in quantity of shrimp, as i think there were like 8 or so large shrimp.  it also came with a side of rice, and some sort of salad in the middle of the plate.\n\nlastly, we tried the avocado tempura since we both love avocado.  very tasty.\n\nwe stuck with water, and when our bill came, it was $140 after tax.  we did have a lot of food, but that seems like way too much to pay for a meal at a place like tao.  the service was top notch, and the ambiance is typical loud music, dark vibe that you'd expect in vegas.  so 4 stars for me.", 
            "my first trip to vegas started out great.  we were staying in the palazzo so we decided on dinner and some drinks at tao.  we started with the tuna tartare with <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>.  it was definitely delicious.  my friend said it was the best she's ever had.  i don't know if i'd go that far, but i'd order it again.  for my main dish, i had the miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> which was a really great choice.  it was moist and flavorful and cooked to perfection.  my friends had some sushi and the chicken <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> and they were all very happy.  our server was friendly and quick, the decor was hip, and the food was great.", 
            "dropped by for dinner before heading ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the club portion of the establishment.\n\nwe ordered waaaaayyy too much food, which was fine by me since it was my last night in vegas on this trip.  might as well go out with a bang right? \n\nanyways, some highlights of the meal included the following:\n\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>\n-<mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>\n-<mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers\n-toro sashimi\n-<mark>Salmon Sashimi</mark>\n-mini donuts for desert\n\nthe thing that amazed me about this place is that the food is worth eating.  the dining room is a scene and it is enormous.  it is quite a feat that the kitchen is able to keep up with the dining room considering how large it is.  and given the people watching here, some restaurants might try to get away with the fact that their dining room is filled with a large number of scantily clad women.  tao avoids that trap and serves up some pretty tasty asian dishes and has the service to see that it gets served right.", 
            "i have eaten at both taos in las vegas and nyc many times. delish! \n\nthe decor is similar in both establishments (large stone buddha, lots of red and black). service has always been on point and it's great for groups because the atmosphere is loud and fun.\n\nsome of my favorite menu items are:\n\n-cloudy sake\n-lychee martini\n-<mark>Salmon Sashimi</mark> appetizer (with jalepeno)\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> (which has tuna on it)\n-miso-glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>\n-giant fortune cookie\n\nsome of their menu items are also found on tao beach's menu.\n\noh, and remember to always read your fortune out loud and end it with \"in the bed.\"", 
            "the cons:\n-we had a long wait(over an hour atleast) even though we had late night reservations, but it wasn't so bad. we had some drinks at the bar, talked to the bartender a bit and people watched. \n-when we were seated, i have to admit, i was a little disappointed with our table. it was one of those where you are right next to the neighboring table and share a booth with the stranger next to you. not that big of a deal really.\n-my husband had the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> w/ <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>. he was pretty disappointed. i felt bad bc i had talked him into getting this dish due to all the great reviews.\n\nthe pros:\n-my dish alone is the reason i would go back to tao and the reason i gave it 4 stars... the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was outstanding! best fish i've ever eaten. just the perfect amount of sweetness and it melted in your mouth like butter. \n\n\nsomewhere in the middle:\n-for an app. we had the <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>- good, not great. i was hoping it would taste like a similar dish i had once at katsuya in hollywood and it just didn't stack up. \n\n\nwill we be going back? doubtful. maybe if i go to vegas with some girlfriends in the future i'll have a chance to eat some more of that delicious fish, but i will not likely be going back with the husband.", 
            "i admit, the ambiance is pretty cool, but if you're looking for a place to dine and chat it's a bit difficult to do that at tao. i thought the noise level was a bit too loud among the music and various side conversations from neighboring tables.\n\nour group of 14 decided to order family style. dishes that stuck out to me:\n\n * <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>: one of my favorite things i ate at tao. if you're afraid of spicy food, this wasn't too spicy. i enjoyed the textures and flavors this dish provided.\n\n*<mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark>: delicious and easy to wrap.\n\n*lobster wonton: i thought the wonton was overcooked, which had that \"mushy\" texture. pass.\n\n*miso glazed chillian <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>: another favorite dish i enjoyed eating. i highly recommend this dish.\n\nour bill at the end of our meal came out to $45 for 13 of us. although the food was enjoyable, i personally thought that it wasn't worth $45. then again, i had no input on what we ordered since one of the girls in our party was responsible for that. i wouldn't mind coming back and giving it another try though.\n\n*edit 9-26-12*\n\ni should clarify that each girl paid $45...not $45 for the total bill. if you're all about the food, you might as well head to a good chinese restaurant and pay half the price.", 
            "if you're in vegas & you don't visit tao, you are missing out! \n\nask for geoffrey to be your waiter, if he is available. he recommends the most delicious dishes and describes them down to the very last de<mark>Tai</mark>. he truly made our dining experience one to remember. \n\nthe sushi <mark>Spicy Shrimp, King Crab, and Asparagus Roll</mark> were alright, nothing crazy. the <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> is very delicious. i had a <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark> vegetable dish with noodles. it was very filling. my boyfriend had the <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> carpaccio topped by a baby arugula salad. i am not a fan of raw meat, yet i tried it and it was unbelievably fresh. \n\nthe dessert plate included edible chopsticks and the fortune cookies had very interesting messages inside. \n\nkeep in mind, this restaurant is very dark and has a nightclub and lounge within the three story premise.", 
            "always a good combination of food, fund and flare.  just be sure to get there early (before 6:30 pm unless you have a reservation).  the dishes are always scrumptious, from <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>, to sushi combinations to simple edamame.  and for sake lovers, the menu is f - i - n - e.  but be prepared to shell out some dollars.\n\nso have a cock<mark>Tai</mark> (or 2) before heading to this treasure trove of asian splendor.  order an appetizer to share (i like the edamame, tuna...well, i really haven't had anything bad), then move into something more substantial.  consider splitting dinner or even a few appetizers.  (you're in vegas...save your money for the tables or the streets!)  but when you finally have to eat...skip the buffet's.  i mean, let's face it, you don't know when the last kid sneezed on it, right?  go to tao's an experience some zen....ah'uummmmmm.....",

            "i've been to tao las vegas twice, and both experiences are in the top 5 best meals i've ever had. \n\ni think the key here is to get the tasting menu - basically, tell your server how much you'd like to pay per person, note any food preferences, and your server will put together a tasting menu which is perfect for groups who want to try a little bit of everything. \n\nfirst off all, we had incredible service. there were 5 us celebrating my friend's 30th birthday, and our server was energetic, passionate, and delivered a great experience. his manager was also phenomenal, and ended up comp'ing us with a second bottle of perrier-jouet champagne after he mispoured a glass. \n\nour server (i can't remember his name) told us that $50 per person would be more than enough to get everything we wanted, and he was right about that. all in all, he brought out three courses - two rounds of appetizers and tasting plates, and one round of entrees. it felt like we tried everything on the menu, and were so stuffed by the third round. highlights included:\n\n- <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with asparagus - honestly, out of this world. melt in your mouth, incredibly flavourful. \n\n- <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>\n\n- <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> with avocado and <mark>Soy Paper</mark> - probably the best sushi i've ever tasted\n\n- <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> - every bite was an explosion of delicious flavour\n\nin addition to the wonderful food and service, tao also has a great atmosphere - beautiful decor, good music, very trendy and sleek, filled with beautiful people. bonus is that you get free entry to tao nightclub after dinner, though we didn't find it that great (it was crowded and not fun). \n\nwould highly recommend tao for dinner!", 
            "went here for a bachelorette party and the food was amazing. our server was really friendly and made great suggestions, we ordered everything he mentioned and we were not disappointed. you must try the spicy tuna tartar <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> appetizer and the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> entree.",

(we joked that it must have cocaine in it it was so great!). the key is to get a reservation and come early for dinner.", 
            "i love tao. i don't care what anyone says or thinks. i make it a point to come here each time we visit and when my husband and i are in vegas for a few months we try to come here often to support the establishment. \n\ni must admit that one of my best friends is a lead sever here so i can expect spectacular service as well as i can trust her to bring me out what i like. \n\nas far as flavor goes, i rate it brimming the top notch for asian fusion. nothing i had was bland. some things were not up my alley, like some of the sushi (we had a shit load of sushi), but i can be a sushi purist. the entrees are fine dining experience whether the taste speaks to you or not. deal with it. it's sweet dishes and there's lots of teriyaki flavor and the like, and i really don't understand people calling this a cop out. asian fusion is supposed to be sweet sometimes. right? \n\nthe <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> is my sh*t! drunk, sober, day, night, at the pool, at the restaurant, begging for it at the club bar. my husband will have to stock up when i'm pregnant. \n\ni love the hamachi sashimi in their ponzu (?) sauce and topped with jalape\\u00f1os. even though you can find this everywhere in vegas, like all the top hotels are required to serve it or something. whatever. i'll take 10. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> were seriously good but honestly i think it's because i fall for the hype of lobster like allllll the time, it's seriously annoying. i forget that there's a way to do any lobster anyway and as long as it's not like eating a sea shoe i love it. so know that before you take my advice on these <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>. i love lobster ravioli and this was like that but with an asian flare and swimming in a soupy like base. like wor gau gee soup if it were rich. like a little china in...seattle or something. \n\nwe had the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> and i approve. not like this is the place you must get your <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark>, but let's be predictable and order the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> shall we? \n\nwe had some kind of hot dish thing that came in a cast iron bowl and our sever mixed it for us at the table. my hubs loved it and i thought it was a-okay. \n\nthe <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is my entree of choice. it should be yours too if it's your first rodeo. truly good stuff and don't you tell me otherwise! \n\nthe rest of the food we had and can't remember was yummers and some very well worth the price. however, the 85$ ribeye is not worth it no matter if it's a damn good steak. a lot of truly good ingredients at tao are ridiculously priced if i'm to be 100 about it. like $38 for the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with no carbs is kind of annoying. sometimes, too much is too much and your bill here should definitely not be cheap. \n\nthis is the sexiest restaurant on the strip in my opinion. just try this place. or at least go at night to see the girlies in the bath tubs. oh and if you have dinner here you can enter the club for free apparently. \n\nthe atmosphere and ambiance is beautiful and and a very well done asian theme. the lighting is low and dimmer than dim. i will admit my first time i was not drunk enough and complained about how in the world i would be able to eat let alone see my food. totally falls in line with the club vibe, and i guess you can make out over dinner? \n\nservice is phenomenal and i am leaving my friend out of it. i mean, she is phenomenal, her name is heather ask for her, but to be fair this rating is for the rest of the team. the boh is obviously doing something right and the foh is really great in my personal experience. from serving staff to the folks who only bring out our drinks to the hustling bussers, i have to applaud the management and training protocol. like for real, let me see your protocol so i can steal it. \n\nthere seem to be mixed reviews of the place and i have to venture to wonder if a lot of the negative is competitive haterism. tao has done significantly well for themselves in the nightlife industry and in a very short amount of time. that can be an envious thing and something we all hope to experience in vegas if we are in the business. sad to see some bad reviews on the food, as i do believe they meet expectations in a las vegas sense. so make your own idea of the place. give it a go and ask for my girl heather. tell her to go away if she's too nice to you. she won't take it personally. she's just amazing like that.",

            "i would give this place three stars, but the service kicks it up a notch.\n\nthe food is good, but expensive. the boyfriend loved the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark>! everything else was good, but not great. we ordered <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>, gyoza, and a few other things. the server helped us decide, and took an active role in <mark>Maki</mark> sure we were taken care of, comfortable, and full. granted, this was after the buffet at island sushi off the strip, so we weren't trying to eat too much, and the final bill reflected that: $20 per person, including tip. but we didn't order too much, and the server had it all just right. he also made sure that we had enough room in our stomachs left to be able to dance comfortably. he got us the line pass stamps to get into tao, where we danced the night away (albeit a little uncomfortably, given how many people were crammed into that tiny room).\n\nthe decor is spot on. they did a fabulous job decorating this place, and it's all very classy and elegant, without it being over the top, like the rest of vegas is.", 
            "friday, january 8, 2010\n\nas being my first trip into this restaurant i have to say this: it's packed! reservations were at 9:30 and we arrived about 5 minutes after 9 and still weren't seated until 9:45. all i was thinking was: the food better be outstanding. and it was very very very good. \n\nappetizers: lobster <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> & wontons\n\nmain dishes: spicey whole lobster & lobster, prawns & <mark>Scallop</mark> in a black bean sauce.", 
            "so i got a $200 gift card from a very nice catering manager at tao after we had a successful company party that we threw during ces 2009. my bf and i decided to dine here during my stay in vegas for ces 2010. we had to wait for our table even though we had made reservations, so we went to the bar and i had a mojito while we sat in that crowded area. we were seated in 15 minutes. the place is very asian and sexy...but kinda crowded. we had lobster <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> & wontons as appetizers. for our main course we had this huge spicy lobster, prawns and <mark>Scallop</mark> in black bean sauce. food was decent, service was okay as well. i probably wouldn't go back here unless it was for someone's birthday or something.", 
            "delicious!!!\n\nfirst time at tao and it was great! it was a 20min wait w/o reservation, which wasn't that bad if you are starving. anyway, had a drink at the bar and chilled until we were called....\n\nfor app--<mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> w/ mango chili sauce--amazing!\nentree--kun pao chicken w/ <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>....tasty!  \n\ni really enjoyed the food and the service was great! one of the waiters stamped our hand for the lavo niteclub...a pity we never made it there lol.\n\nnext time i'm in town, i will be stopping by...yep yep!", 
            "warning!\nwe sat right by the bar/kitchen. first of all, tables should not be put where you can be knocked in the head by a box/carton of anything. we could see straight into the bar-tending pick-up area. i looked up and saw 3 glasses of red drinks. a waitress took one straw, swirled the drink, put the straw in her mouth and tasted it, did not change the straw, and took it out to serve!!! hello disease!\n\nnow for the real review - \n\n\n8:40pm 4/10/11\nshowed up early on a mon night for 9:15pm reservation, hostess said we were not on the list, very unprofessional. was told to wait on the non-reservation line. terrible. \n\n9:40pm 4/10/11\n\nstaff: our waiter was great, attentive but not overbearing\nfood:\n     appetizers: delicious\n               <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> with mango chili sauce - holy cow this was excellent! it may be real crabmeat!\n               <mark>Pork Potstickers</mark> with a chili sesame glaze - pretty darn good!\n               peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with hoisin sauce - not as good as the traditional peking duck bun but it was pretty fun in a <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> presentation.\n \n     entrees: eh\n               <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura of <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>\n                - it was not crusted... the (yummy) \"crust\" was a tiny bit on top of the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>. the <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> were terrible. battered with no spices. the steak was cooked perfectly but a bit on the salty side. \n               tao shabu shabu <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> with wasabi dipping sauce\n                - the 1 oz ($17) of <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> was 2-3 thin slices of beef (2in x 1in). broth tasted like soy. the sauce was all soy tasting too.", 
            "every time we go to vegas, we eat here.  its hard to justify going to other places when this spot is so amazing.  i know vegas has a lot to offer, but this place never dissappoints.  \ncrisy thai shrimp with spicy pineapple sauce appetizer, <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> with mango chili suace, filet mingnon with wasabi crust, <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark>, were all superb. \neverything has a <mark>Uni</mark> and wonderful flavor.  everything we've ordered has been excellent.  they play loud music but its also a club and its fun...the decor is wonderful and beautiful and spectacular. great service. its a can't-miss.", 
            "came here for a bachelorette party and was totally pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. with vegas, it's usually hit or miss with the trendy spots, and i was prepared for a miss. \n\nwe had a pre-selected menu that consisted of a variety of foods -- all were delicious. bamboo steamed <mark>Chicken Gyoza</mark>, <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark>, tofu <mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark> were all delicious! (the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> were my favorite). \n\nthen...the dessert. my god the dessert. so delicious. we received the chef's symphony of sweets which included (i don't know the real names...) a giant fortune cookie filled with chocolate and vanilla whipped cream, apple pie empanada-esque with vanilla ice cream, banana/chocolate <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark>, mochi ice cream.\n\nyum! i would definitely go back. there were also 12 of us and we each paid $70 (including tip and cock<mark>Tai</mark>) so it was also a pretty decent deal!", 
            "cool, trendy, delicious.\n\nquick tips:\n\n1.  stick to small plates and starters.  most creative.\n\n2.  skip the nigiri sushi.  expensive and not spectacular.\n\n3.  lots of spicy, hot flavors from chili and wasabi.  this is drinking food.\n\nif you must have sushi, top props to the <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> with black tobiko, <mark>King Crab California Roll</mark> (made with real king crab), and the <mark>Crispy Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll served with a yuzu mayonnaise.  all are familiar just made with top quality ingredients and a good flavor twist that makes you long for a second bite.\n\nsmall plate standouts include an unexpectedly good grilled <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> served with a satay sauce. never thought what is essentially peanut butter would go so well with fish.  the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> with mango chili sauce while not purely crab meat just pairs so well with the sauce.  well balanced.  the spicy tuna tartar <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> crackers, a great twist on the classic.  outstanding.  bold flavor, cool tuna, <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> cracker.  so much contrast make for a delicious bite of food.  finally the  <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> sashimi with fresh wasabi; yum.\n\ndo not pass on the peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with hoisin sauce or the lobster and shrimp <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with spicy pineapple sauce.  big bold flavors.  textual contrast at its best.\n\nfinally, if you never had avocado tempura try it.  the warm avocado has the creamy texture of uni.  very different.  very good.\n\nnote:  dining at tao should be social so bring a group of friends.  the food is meant to be shared.  \n\nspecial note:  for the guys, dining at tao does not give you any special vip privileges to enter the tao nightclub later in the evening.  ladies, work the magic.\n\n\nrecommended.", 
            "wow! everything here was amazing: the food, the service, the drinks! craftsteak was my 2nd favorite restaurant, but this place is now in 2nd (kokomo's for their lobster bisque remains at #1).\n\nwe came without reservations at 9pm after phantom and the place was packed. amazingly enough, we got seated immediately. the ambiance was dark, trendy with loud music. i loved the giant buddha.\n\nour waiter was super nice and always on the ball as we ordered several rounds of drinks. i got the taotini and my husband got the orange dragon. they were super yummy. ($12 each)\n\nbut the food...the food! i want to go back to vegas already just to eat here again.  we ordered the small plates:\n\n1. <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok roasted asparagus. \n- this was so freakin amazing. 2nd best bite of food i've had in my entire life. flaky, delicate, tender and so flavorful. we'd heard about this from the best thing i ever ate: vegas on the food network. did not disappoint!!!!  this came with 2 skewers.($19)\n\n2. <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> with mango chili sauce\n- best <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> i've ever had. crunchy outside, such a wonderful crab flavor with a tangy & spicy mango chili sauce. 3 to an order on these. ($18)\n\n3. <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>\n- we thought these were going to be crunchy, but they were soft and tender in a delicious broth. the lobster was so delicate and not chewy whatsoever. these were super yummy. 4 wontons. ($18)\n\nwe were so in love with the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> that we ordered another because we could not get enough!!!\n\nwe were too full for dessert. we loved our naughty fortunes. i absolutely will be dreaming about this food until we get back to tao again.", 
            "we did not wait long for our table & the lounge area is a great spot to wait in. the tao-tini is a must try! it is a light drink, that leaves a creamy raspberry taste in your mouth. the service was the best service i had my entire trip. i recommend the spicy tuna tartare, <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark>, and the albacore <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> special, if they have it. i wasn't crazy about the peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>. the desserts were equally amazing as the food. it definitely has an intimate atmosphere & the nightclub is above the restaurant. those who dine there have access to the nightclub but go on a separate line. definitely worth it!", 
            "had a 7:45 reservation: was seated at 8:30. <mark>Scallop</mark> were rubbery, <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> wasn't as stellar as the server was raving about. lobster kimchee <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> wasn't anything to write home about. the only things we enjoyed were the appetizers: <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> and lobster ravioli. for the price, i'd rather go to hakkasan.", 
            "i have no idea what people are seeing in this restaurant.  this place is like a mediocre p.f. chang's you wait twice as long and pay twice as much for.  there are too many amazing restaurants in vegas to waste your time here. turn around and head out, do not pass go and save your $200.  seriously, if you have any sort of culinary expectations look for another option.  if you're looking for naked girls in bathtubs, this may be your place (although, no girls in the bathtubs the night we came). \n\na group of co-workers were all here for a conference and decided to try this place out since we were staying at the venetian.  we made a reservation for 8:30 and when we arrived were told we would be seated 'in a few moments' 40 minutes later (and a few times getting the run around by the guy in charge of seating), we finally got to a table.   \n\ntao highlights the modern asian fusion movement on their menu.  unfortunately they also have tried to mask their lack of flavor in dishes by <mark>Maki</mark> them overly salty or overly sweet.  this makes everything taste like it's a microwave dinner or some sort of bad chinese takeout.  \n\nwe tried the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> (way too much sauce that was overly sweet with very little spice element, kinda tasted like one you can buy out of a bottle), <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> (decent, but the shrimp toast was the highlight), <mark><mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark> Bao Buns</mark> (the pork was again way too sweet and the bun had too much dough to pork ratio, this was barely edible),  <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> (another overly sweet dish that was deemed not even as good as chinese takeout), <mark>Grilled 12 oz. Kobe Ribeye</mark> (no way this is real kobe, despite assurances from our server. it was tough and hard to cut, we had real kobe at gordon ramsey's the next night and there was no comparison) and a few sushi/<mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark> (decent, but the rice wasn't well flavored. we had better sushi at the buffet). \n\nour waiter was very nice and attentive, but there were cer<mark>Tai</mark> elements of dishes that were left off (rice for the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark>, asked for sauce on the side for a couple dishes that wasn't done).  all in all a truly regrettable experience from start to finish. their fortunes for their cookies were pretty funny though.", 
            "super expensive? well it tasted so good.. we ordered <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark>/balls and mandarin style pork <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>. \n\nthe ambience was very romantic and we spent good time on our anniversary. \n\nthe service was very good and the waiter after learning that it was our anniversary came back with a dessert on the house. \n\nwe didn't get time to completely checkout the pond and the huge buddha statue but in vegas everything is so mega style.", 
            "i love tao. i don't care what anyone says or thinks. i make it a point to come here each time we visit and when my husband and i are in vegas for a few months we try to come here often to support the establishment. \n\ni must admit that one of my best friends is a lead sever here so i can expect spectacular service as well as i can trust her to bring me out what i like. \n\nas far as flavor goes, i rate it brimming the top notch for asian fusion. nothing i had was bland. some things were not up my alley, like some of the sushi (we had a shit load of sushi), but i can be a sushi purist. the entrees are fine dining experience whether the taste speaks to you or not. deal with it. it's sweet dishes and there's lots of teriyaki flavor and the like, and i really don't understand people calling this a cop out. asian fusion is supposed to be sweet sometimes. right? \n\nthe <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> is my sh*t! drunk, sober, day, night, at the pool, at the restaurant, begging for it at the club bar. my husband will have to stock up when i'm pregnant. \n\ni love the hamachi sashimi in their ponzu (?) sauce and topped with jalape\\u00f1os. even though you can find this everywhere in vegas, like all the top hotels are required to serve it or something. whatever. i'll take 10. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> were seriously good but honestly i think it's because i fall for the hype of lobster like allllll the time, it's seriously annoying. i forget that there's a way to do any lobster anyway and as long as it's not like eating a sea shoe i love it. so know that before you take my advice on these <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>. i love lobster ravioli and this was like that but with an asian flare and swimming in a soupy like base. like wor gau gee soup if it were rich. like a little china in...seattle or something. \n\nwe had the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> and i approve. not like this is the place you must get your <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark>, but let's be predictable and order the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> shall we? \n\nwe had some kind of hot dish thing that came in a cast iron bowl and our sever mixed it for us at the table. my hubs loved it and i thought it was a-okay. \n\nthe <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is my entree of choice. it should be yours too if it's your first rodeo. truly good stuff and don't you tell me otherwise! \n\nthe rest of the food we had and can't remember was yummers and some very well worth the price. however, the 85$ ribeye is not worth it no matter if it's a damn good steak. a lot of truly good ingredients at tao are ridiculously priced if i'm to be 100 about it. like $38 for the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with no carbs is kind of annoying. sometimes, too much is too much and your bill here should definitely not be cheap. \n\nthis is the sexiest restaurant on the strip in my opinion. just try this place. or at least go at night to see the girlies in the bath tubs. oh and if you have dinner here you can enter the club for free apparently. \n\nthe atmosphere and ambiance is beautiful and and a very well done asian theme. the lighting is low and dimmer than dim. i will admit my first time i was not drunk enough and complained about how in the world i would be able to eat let alone see my food. totally falls in line with the club vibe, and i guess you can make out over dinner? \n\nservice is phenomenal and i am leaving my friend out of it. i mean, she is phenomenal, her name is heather ask for her, but to be fair this rating is for the rest of the team. the boh is obviously doing something right and the foh is really great in my personal experience. from serving staff to the folks who only bring out our drinks to the hustling bussers, i have to applaud the management and training protocol. like for real, let me see your protocol so i can steal it. \n\nthere seem to be mixed reviews of the place and i have to venture to wonder if a lot of the negative is competitive haterism. tao has done significantly well for themselves in the nightlife industry and in a very short amount of time. that can be an envious thing and something we all hope to experience in vegas if we are in the business. sad to see some bad reviews on the food, as i do believe they meet expectations in a las vegas sense. so make your own idea of the place. give it a go and ask for my girl heather. tell her to go away if she's too nice to you. she won't take it personally. she's just amazing like that.", 
            "i truly have not had a bad experience at tao. the quality of the service is great and the food is excellent. \nthe sushi is always nice and fresh and the main entrees are delicious. i would recommend to get the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> for appetizer. they are meaty and very tasty. the glazed miso cod is one of the best things on the menu. for side dishes you can never go wrong with the <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> or the noodles. and for dessert, well you have to get the amazing fortune cookie. this is a giant fortune cookie with half chocolate and half cream! it's just delish! \nif you are planning on visiting tao you will be pleased with the food. however, the restaurant is not cheap. well i guess you get for what you pay!", 
            "this was my first visit here, for my birthday, definitely felt like a celebrity, seeing as though all the celebrities do eat here.  my girls made reservations for us, they did so good.  we were a tad bit late, but the hostess was nice enough to seat us within a good 15 minutes.  that was really sweet of her, because the place was packed, and i'm sure that's nothing new.\n\nonce we were seated, our waiter, i hate that i forgot his name, greeted all of the ladies with a smile, told us all about the specials, what's popular, all that good stuff to help us decide.  the restaurant was very dim, very dark, very sexy.  honestly, it was a little too dark, made it very difficult to read the menu, but that was nothing big to complain about.  because it was a group of girls, we all made the executive decision to order 3 or 4 appetizers, 3 or 4 dinner entrees, make it like family style.  pass everything around the table, everyone gets to taste everything.  now, i don't know if i got my hopes too high up for tao, but the overall meal, it was...good. not great, but good.  i wasn't disappointed, but i guess i was expecting out-of-this world cuisine.  \n\nhonestly, the best things, were the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> and the <mark>Pork Potstickers</mark>.  full of flavor, full of filling, the mango chili sauce on the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> was really good, so was the chili sesame glaze on the potstickers.  that was my favorite.  now, the entrees, it's not like they were bad, but i wasn't blown away.  if i had to pick one of my favorites, it would have to be the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>.  cooked perfectly, tender, flavor was awesome and the tower of <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> were a great match. a fun match.  i ordered the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, which melted in my mouth like butter, tender and flaky, but the seasoning was a little off.  it's like there wasn't enough.  but the quality was top notch.\n\nit was so sweet that they did bring me this giant fortune cookie, with a giant fortune on the inside, filled with sweet, smooth, velvety vanilla and chocolate mouse.  i mean it was so good and the cookie was just the cutest and so delicious.  the fresh fruit with the chocolate, i mean it was literally a sweet ending.\n\noverall, i would definitely recommend tao, it is definitely the place to be, always jumpin', always poppin' and it's really just a pretty cool place!"

            "friends were in town and they wanted to try the very popular tao restaurant.  (it's been reported that the tao restaurant is one of the highest gross-ranking restaurants in vegas!)  just as we were about to enter the hallway, this very large bouncer asks if he could help us and we mention we have reservations and then he allows us to proceed further.  talk about intimidating, and this was for a 7 pm dinner!\n\nwe were seated ups<mark>Tai</mark> on the balcony overlooking the huge buddha.  as menus were presented to us, the waitress asked if she could get us some water.  as i perused the flimsy two page menu, front and back, i didn't even know where to begin.  my fellow dining companions were quick to notice the 16 oz. grilled kobe sirloin for $150 and the individually priced nigiri pieces ranging from $3-$15 a piece.\n\nthe menu suggests that all items were going to be served family style, so we asked the waitress for a few suggestions.  i could barely hear her over the hum of the restaurant.  (i would not consider tao to be romantic at all.)\n\nin the end we decided to start with four different appetizers and two entrees.  and this is what we got:\n\n<mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark> ($14) - this came with five lettuce leaves.  a decent amount to fill all the leaves.  the squab mixture was a bit too moist and the bf found it too sweet.  i had squab juice stuff dripping all over my hands right off the bat.  there was a lot of flavor though and crunch, probably from the celery.\n\n<mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> ($16) - a clay pot arrived with 5 lobster-filled wontons.  very flavorful with slices of shittake mushrooms laid out too.  a very light and delicate dish.  \n\nsashimi of <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> with fresh wasabi sauce ($28) - beautifully presented on a circular clear plate with herbs on top.  we couldn't determine if they were already sliced apart or what, but with the meat being so delicate, just grab a piece and pull and the meat will tear gently apart.  lovely taste and clean.  however, i didn't recall a wasabi sauce or flavor to it.\n\npork <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with thai chili sauce ($11) - this order came with 3 triangles filled with pork, so we requested another order so we could all have a taste.  the <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> was decent, nothing particular special about it.  the thai chili sauce tasted store bought though.\n\nmiso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables ($34) - very good, but i guess the better question is when have you had a bad piece <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>?\n\n<mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark> ($26) - we must have misheard the waitress because we thought she said it came in a coconut curry.  it did not, but rather a sweet sauce with about five pieces <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> in it, including the drumstick.  it was okay, nothing particularly special about it.\n\n<mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark> ($4) - of course we had to order some rice!  we got two orders which is just enough for four people who aren't heavy rice eaters.\n\noverall, the food was good.  definitely overpriced though, and it's catered to a cer<mark>Tai</mark> kind of clientele.  you'll be amused to find things like kung pao chicken ($26) and grilled prime porterhouse with wasabi dipping sauce ($88) on the same menu.  we decided to pass on dessert as the waitress-recommended giant fortune cookie ($10) or fuji apple <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> ($8) didn't appeal to us enough.  (we actually drove over to luv-it frozen custard instead!)\n\nservice is a huge component of what makes this experience worth it or not, and tao fails in this department.  i was not impressed with the chatty young waiters who dropped (not placed) the silverware onto the table, reached across the bf to put things in front of me, and who 'hid' the menus behind my guest on his chair.  (uh, who does that?!)  as they moved our glasses and silverware to make room for our dishes, they did it in such an unorganized and messy fashion.  i felt like i was staring at someone's hands trying to do a card trick.  i'm used to the staff performing such tasks in an unnoticed way as to not disrupt the private conversation the dining guests are having.  the waitstaff should take a few lessons from rosemary's restaurant's waitstaff.  that's what i call service!\n\nat the very end of our meal, someone did come by and ask if everything was okay.  and it was...just okay.  they asked if we were going to the club afterward and i said yes and asked if they had any passes.  what they do have is a \"line pass,\" which is really a simple stamp on your inner left wrist so you can supposedly bypass the long line outside.  however, you will still have to pay cover.  (i think this part is rather ridiculous.  they should at least offer a discount on the cover instead.)  with the stamp being so simple, a washing of my hands right after dinner washed it right off.  not the best pass i would say.\n  \ntao restaurant is the kind of place you say you've been to and that's it.    there are better places where service is valued higher.\n\n$185 total, including tip and tax, no drinks", 
            "large parties dining at tao should know this....\n___________________________\nto my surprise, 4 stars for the food, but an overall 2 stars for the ridiculous way we were charged for the food and how our complaint was handled.  i dined at tao with a group of 9 for a bachelorette party the weekend of august 13, 2007. although i was disappointed with tao, i still had a great time with my fabulous girlfriends. \n\ni don't remember everything we had, but i enjoyed the <mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark>, <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. least favorite was the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> (one of the worst i've had) and chicken skewers. \n\nreason for 2 stars:\nafter we were seated, our waitress didn't come by for what seemed like 10 minutes to introduce herself. when she came by, she was friendly but did not comm<mark>Uni</mark> clearly how she was taking our order. since it was so loud and our waitress didn't have a very loud voice, 3 different members of our group asked her to clarify how much food she thought we should order. she specifically told us that we should order 3-4 starters and at least 5 main dishes. that took me by surprise b/c i thought this is small plates and how could that be enough food? so i repeated what she said to me just to clarify that 3-4 appetizers would enough food for 10 girls? we decided to just order as much as she recommended and we can order more if necessary. \n\nwhen the dishes arrived, we were all suprised at the large portions. what we found out when we got the receipt was that the waitress doubled and tripled each order (as she saw fit) so it would be enough for our table of 9. she never once said she was going to do this and we were upset because we had so much leftover food and even ate more than we wanted so it wouldn't be wasted.\n\nif we had known this is what she was going to do, we would have ordered different items. i can't remember if she tripled any main dishes but the end result was a very large bill and wasted food. \n\nwhen we brought this up to our waitress, she insisted she explained it and after she left, she never returned to our table. we then spoke to the manager who said he could only give us 2 drink tokens to compensate for the miscomm<mark>Uni</mark>. this is so lame and such a cheap gestere to rectify the situation. the least he could have done was get us into the nightclub for free afterwards. \n\ni have never, ever, gone to a restaurant where they took the liberty of doubling or tripling your order without telling you. i've always said, i want 1 order of this, 2 orders of this, etc.\n\ni would not go back to this restaurant again. food was good but not worth the price. \n\nthe club is ok if you get in early but by 1pm it gets too crowded to walk around and check things out. we got free line passes but had to go out, get in smaller line, pay $20pp at the door + get a hand stamp, then headed ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the night club. seems like a classy place but i find it offensive that they have skanky girls taking baths and playing with each other surrounded by all these bhuddas.", 
            "tao is completely over hyped. it's nicely decorated and the people working at tao are all very pretty. the dj is even great. but the food is awful and the entire meal felt rushed. i felt like the waiters were really trying to turn the tables over quickly. the waiter even took my cock<mark>Tai</mark> and didn't ask if i wanted another. this also happened with the food. but that's not even the worst part. the worst part was the actual food. maybe i'm spoiled, living in the bay area. we have so much great asian food. tao just couldn't compare. not even close. i understand it's asian fusion, but it just did not taste good.\n\nthe appetizers were ok. we had <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, the tuna tartar, and the chicken dumplings. of course these were fine, how can you screw up a dumpling. for dinner we had sushi and it was some of the fishiest we've ever had. just awful. we also had the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and it was tasty but i think it was undercooked. about a half hour after eating it, i got really sick. we kicked down like $150+ for dinner and it was as if i hadn't even eaten it. it honestly could have been anything i ate there that made me sick, but i really think it was the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. \n\nwe even had plans to go to the nightclub afterwards but we had such a terrible dinner we wanted to get the hell out of there. we ended up at the palms. avoid tao. it's just not worth it.",

            "i had realllllly high hopes for my dining experience at tao, and to be honest, it was way below my expectations!\n\nwe arrived slightly early for our reservations but were seated immediately, which was great. the atmosphere was awesome. so trendy, cool, interesting lighting, and how can you miss the huge buddah statue in the middle of it all? undeniably, the atmosphere is the best part of tao. \n\nto drink, i had the lychee nut martini. very, very good. strong flavor of alcohol and lychee alike, it was one of the best drinks i had on my trip. \n\nwe started out with <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> in a shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>. by far, the best thing we ate all evening, although the $18 price tag was a little hefty for four bite-sized wontons. yes, they were delicious- plump, filled entirely with chunks of lobster, but still. i am a huge ginger and mushroom fan, so this broth was awesome! i wish i had some rice to sop up the goodness once we were through with the dumplings!\n\nmaybe this is where we went wrong. we decided to get sushi and split it. maybe one shouldn't order sushi from tao, as everyone around us seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their food. plus, it looked better than ours. \n\nshrimp tempura roll- this was very <mark>Uni</mark> because it was served with curry sauce. i  enjoyed the flavor of the curry with the sushi roll. almost like a fusion of indian/japanese cuisine. \n\n<mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>- good, but nothing amazing. i've had just as good a <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> at a hole in the wall for half the price. i did not like that it was served atop a puddle of mayonnaise. i understand that mayonnaise is blended within the roll as a 'spicy sauce', but this was just way too much mayo. yuck. \n\nalaskan salmon, crab, and avocado roll- nothing really identifiable or special. once again, i've had much better. \n\nperhaps my expectations were too high, but tao felt like an upscale pf changs. however, i'm glad i went because i've wanted to dine there forever. if i were to do it over, i would order one of their entrees, like mongolian scallion chicken, miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, or braised spicy shrimp. \n\nservice was not very good. felt like we were rushed the entire time.", 
            "i totally get it.  the promoters/owners lure you into tao restaurant, ply you with yummy food and drink, and then convince you that tao nightclub is just as upscale and well-done.  don't fall for it!  just eat the food, drink the booze, and leave!  you'll have a better night for it.\n\ntao restaurant is amazing.  i loved the decor, the service, the short wait, and of course the food.  this behemoth of a restaurant does asian fusion right.  i had the tao-tini (after my requisite dirty grey goose on the rocks).  fruity, strong as all hell, and delicious.  my pic and i started with the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>.  best.  dish.  ever.  next time i go back, that's all i'm ordering.  we also had the lobster dumplings to start.  good.  but definitely not the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>.\n\nwe then ordered the thai fish hot pot, which had a very strong sauce, overpowering on its own, but perfect with steamed rice.  we made the mistake of ordering veggie <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>.  why were we trying to be healthy? anyway, what came was a plate of veggies + mush.  ugh.  panda express makes a better <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> than that!\n\nupon leaving the venetian, my pic and i decided that next time, we're just ordering 6 servings of the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>.  and then heading to jet to shake it all off!\n\np.s.  one of my students told me that her group of friends was offered free dinner + drinks + tao admission the same weekend.  so if you have a group of 10+ cute asian girls, you may get dinner for free!  otherwise, expect to spend about $50/person, not including drinks.",

            "i've been to tao many times, but never actually sat down for dinner until i went to vegas last weekend. i got to say, i was very impressed. i went on a sunday (holiday weekend) and the wait was about 30 minutes. we had a drink in the lounge area so it wasn't bad. the music and ambiance were perfect. once we were seated, we had nothing but great service. our server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable and our food came out super fast. we ordered the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, the <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark> with wasabi salsa (i'm not a big fan of wasabi, but this was sooo good!), <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with asparagus, and the chef's roll. everything we ordered was delicious, however the chef's roll was okay.\n\nagain, the servers there were great. it was a team effort. if another server saw that we had a question or had finished our plates, he/she would come right away. anyway, if you're looking for a restaurant that has great food plus a fun and fresh atmosphere, tao is perfect. \n\np.s - i took off one star because this place is a little pricey and the portions are a bit small too.", 
            "my friend was in town and we wanted to go somewhere with a \"scene,\" that simultaneously had good food.  needless to say, tao was not the right spot for us.  as for the \"scene,\" tao pretty much hits the mark.  it is a beautiful restaurant, dimly lit, and plenty of las vegas visitors looking for a good time.  as for the food, it was very mediocre.  i will not be returning.  on a busy saturday night in las vegas without a reservation, we waited for our table for about 30 minutes.  not bad, huh?  well with the 40 bucks we tipped the hostess to get a table at all, i was expecting to be seated right away.  i want my 40 bucks back! oh well, live and learn.  on to the food.  between the two of us we split the chefs special roll, shrimp tempura roll, spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> crunchy onion roll, <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark>, <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, and edamame.  sounds like a lot of food, but the portions are small.  this was definitely enough food for us though.  the sushi was really not impressive.  yes, the fish is fresh, but unless you are ordering sashimi, it is still possible to get a bad roll.  well, we got three.  the worst was the shrimp tempura roll.  so small! so bland! so boring! come on, if you are going to list this a chefs speciality, it better be special.  the other two rolls were a little better, but both sitting on top of a heavy mayo sauce that did not taste good.  this is my pet peeve.  leave off the heavy sauce people! especially if it tastes like crap.  the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> were pretty decent, i could only eat one because they were rich, turn your stomach kind of rich- too saucy, too salty, too something.  i will say the <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was pretty good.  this \"healthier\" version of <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was packed with veggies and had a great flavor, the only downfall here is that it was served to us ice cold.  the best thing at this restaurant by far was the <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark>! i swear these should be on every asian restaurant menu.  i cant imagine it is too difficult to roast these bad boys up, but regardless, tao did a good job here.  if you haven't tried these peppers before, please try them!  i wouldn't steer you in the wrong direction.  anyway, i may come back to tao for a drink, but as for food, i will take my sushi/ asian craving elsewhere.", 
            "this was my first time dining at tao. this review is for the restaurant not the nightclub. \n\nthe ambiance and decor... is great. enter via long hallway with several flower pedal ponds. we were escorted to a good dtable past the giant buddah statue.\n\nthe service... is great, very attentive and professional. \n\nthe food... i am currently on a strict diet so i did not eat much. i saw a picture of a shrimp plate on their website and knew i wanted that because it works with my diet, i ordered an appetiser plate of the crispy thai shrimp thinking it was what was on the picture, however that was not it. however what i got which was stuffed shrimp in a fried wrap similar to an eggrog was devine. others in my party ordered chillean <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, and other delish looking dishes and they said it was all excellent. i capped off the night with a pot of green tea which was great. i love asian food and i highly recommend tao to anyone.", 
            "it's fairly rare that i'll kick out a 5 star review. in my opinion, a restaurant has to meet or exceed on all expectations in order to achieve a five star rating. that said, tao las vegas achieves exactly this. \n\ni have eaten here many times at this point but this particular review is for dinner last saturday. i was in town with friends for a birthday celebration. there were 5 of them and none of them had ever gone to tao. so, i wanted to share the love and expose them to the joy of tao cuisine.\n\nour reservation was for 6:30pm. we arrived 10 minutes early and were seated promptly. we quietly pulled the server aside and let him know that it was a birthday dinner and he promised to take care of it. \n\nduring dinner, we ordered everything from the steak (amazing!) to the <mark>TAO Angry Dragon Roll</mark> (highly recommended). some items that i recommend, in no particular order:\n\n<mark>TAO Angry Dragon Roll</mark> - delicious\n<mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> w/ wok roasted asparagus - no trip to tao is completely without this\n<mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> - a good secondary choice - if you have room add this\n\none thing i should point out - if you're feeling like steak, don't shy away from tao's offerings. they were fantastic! and very <mark>Uni</mark> seasoned. \n\nin fact i want one right now.\n\nlast but not least - the restaurant delighted us by bringing us a huge fortune cookie for my friend's birthday, filled with chocolate mousse and white chocolate mousse.\n\nfyi the chocolate mousse was the best that i've ever tasted!\n\nand finally - they ended the night by serving us delicious coffee. \n\nthank you tao. i love you. and i'll be back to see you again really really soon.", 
            "i went to tao for the 2nd time tonight for dinner.  the last time i went i had some sort of a groupon or something, and tonight my friend had a gift card she was given as a gift.  i think that's the only way i would dine here.  i think the food is overpriced, and if you're going to spend this much on a meal, there's other places in town i'd rather go.  maybe it's just me.\n\nwe started with two appetizers... the spicy tune <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> and the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>.  we had the tartare last time and really enjoyed it.  we enjoyed it again this time, but it wasn't as magical as it was last time.  the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>... well, they tasted like the best wontons i've ever eaten, but i could barely taste the lobster.  the flavor was drowned out from the broth, i thought.\n\nfor a main course, we split the most expensive omakase sushi menu, which was like $58.  very underwhelming how little food we got: one roll, 7 pieces of nigiri, and 6 slices <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark>.  granted, one of the nigiri was toro, and the roll was a <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> of some sort, but for $58, i'd expect a little more.  throw some salmon nigiri in there!\n\nwe also split the coconut crusted shrimp with peanut sauce, which was really delicious, though the breading on the shrimp was too thick.  that was made up for in quantity of shrimp, as i think there were like 8 or so large shrimp.  it also came with a side of rice, and some sort of salad in the middle of the plate.\n\nlastly, we tried the avocado tempura since we both love avocado.  very tasty.\n\nwe stuck with water, and when our bill came, it was $140 after tax.  we did have a lot of food, but that seems like way too much to pay for a meal at a place like tao.  the service was top notch, and the ambiance is typical loud music, dark vibe that you'd expect in vegas.  so 4 stars for me.", 
            "dropped by for dinner before heading ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the club portion of the establishment.\n\nwe ordered waaaaayyy too much food, which was fine by me since it was my last night in vegas on this trip.  might as well go out with a bang right? \n\nanyways, some highlights of the meal included the following:\n\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>\n-<mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>\n-<mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers\n-toro sashimi\n-<mark>Salmon Sashimi</mark>\n-mini donuts for desert\n\nthe thing that amazed me about this place is that the food is worth eating.  the dining room is a scene and it is enormous.  it is quite a feat that the kitchen is able to keep up with the dining room considering how large it is.  and given the people watching here, some restaurants might try to get away with the fact that their dining room is filled with a large number of scantily clad women.  tao avoids that trap and serves up some pretty tasty asian dishes and has the service to see that it gets served right.", 
            "wow! everything here was amazing: the food, the service, the drinks! craftsteak was my 2nd favorite restaurant, but this place is now in 2nd (kokomo's for their lobster bisque remains at #1).\n\nwe came without reservations at 9pm after phantom and the place was packed. amazingly enough, we got seated immediately. the ambiance was dark, trendy with loud music. i loved the giant buddha.\n\nour waiter was super nice and always on the ball as we ordered several rounds of drinks. i got the taotini and my husband got the orange dragon. they were super yummy.

($18)\n\nwe were so in love with the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> that we ordered another because we could not get enough!!!\n\nwe were too full for dessert. we loved our naughty fortunes. i absolutely will be dreaming about this food until we get back to tao again.",

            "i've been to tao las vegas twice, and both experiences are in the top 5 best meals i've ever had. \n\ni think the key here is to get the tasting menu - basically, tell your server how much you'd like to pay per person, note any food preferences, and your server will put together a tasting menu which is perfect for groups who want to try a little bit of everything. \n\nfirst off all, we had incredible service. there were 5 us celebrating my friend's 30th birthday, and our server was energetic, passionate, and delivered a great experience. his manager was also phenomenal, and ended up comp'ing us with a second bottle of perrier-jouet champagne after he mispoured a glass. \n\nour server (i can't remember his name) told us that $50 per person would be more than enough to get everything we wanted, and he was right about that. all in all, he brought out three courses - two rounds of appetizers and tasting plates, and one round of entrees. it felt like we tried everything on the menu, and were so stuffed by the third round. highlights included:\n\n- <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with asparagus - honestly, out of this world. melt in your mouth, incredibly flavourful. \n\n- <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>\n\n- <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> with avocado and <mark>Soy Paper</mark> - probably the best sushi i've ever tasted\n\n- <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> - every bite was an explosion of delicious flavour\n\nin addition to the wonderful food and service, tao also has a great atmosphere - beautiful decor, good music, very trendy and sleek, filled with beautiful people. bonus is that you get free entry to tao nightclub after dinner, though we didn't find it that great (it was crowded and not fun). \n\nwould highly recommend tao for dinner!", 
            "group of 5 ladies, came here on a saturday night during the 4th of july holiday. first of all, the hostess with the blonde hair and orange dress was a total petty bitch and did not want to seat us. had us waiting for over an hour for a table when we saw several open. we would have at least ordered drinks and  appetizers but there was no service in the waiting area. the waiting area was blaring with loud edm music, not at all conducive for dinner or lounge talk and definitely scared us a bit thinking that the club would be the same. meanwhile, troops of people with questionable attractiveness and boldly comfortable physiques would trapes in every few minutes heading over to the nightclub area. we were already on the guestlist for the party but having had good history with their sister company, lavo, we wanted to try the food first,  but in these moments, both the dinner and club scene here were so off putting. the night started off quite weak. once we were seated, after 12, finally the service came pouring in. at least 3 or 4 servers came to our table to excuse the slackness and eager to be of service. nice view of the big buddha statue in the center. food was decent, we enjoyed the pan fried <mark>Chicken Gyoza</mark>, the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> and the <mark>Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups</mark> were ok, we kind of got full off of just appetizers cause again, large portions. my cousins miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> entree was good. strong miso flavor, but if you're cool with that, its good. big portion <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> by someone else. i dont like <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> or peanut tastes so i didnt taste it but she enjoyed. looked big and fresh. i split the shrimp, lobster, scallop in bean sauce entree with someone else because it sounded big and also to cut costs and have more things on the table to taste. was really looking forward to it, it has all of my favorite meaty chewy seafoods. it was shockingly bad, dont know if there was an error made in the sauce recipe, but i have had plenty of similar dishes in the past, never have any been half as bad, and it came highly recommended by the waiter and was amongst the most expensive so we were surprised that it was so bitter. the table tasted and agreed that the sauce had an unpleasant taste. the waiter took it off of our bill gracefully and we left a great tip in exchange. in this moment, the great service that we are accustomed to from lavo, was thankfully shining through here at tao as well. a nice chick came to our table to stamp us and set us up for the complimentary club access. as i said before, we were already on the guestlist so didnt need it, but its nice that they have that additional incentive for dining there, as lavo used to do. will continue nightclub review in other yelp page.",

            "what an experience this evening was for me and my colleagues! i wanted to go to this restaurant because quite honestly it is always in the gossip magazines as the celebrity hangout. i had stopped by last year for a glass of wine but had never gone for dinner until last week.\nthe entrance is absolutely gorgeous with two rows of what looks like baths filled with roses. it has a low light vibe to it and a gigantic buddha that stands from ceiling to floor in the center of the restaurant. ambiance is fabulous. bring a light so that you can read the menu though! \nour server was lawrence who was an absolute delight from beginning to end. great humor and a lot of fun. i recognized him from an unfortunate episode on the kardashian's reality show. lovely lovely guy. \nwe started our meals with an array of delicious appetizers. the standout was the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>. my friend and i practically licked the bottom of the bowl. unbelievable. \ntwo of my friends ordered the steak which they both loved. the steaks came with three huge and gorgeous <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>. great presentation. my other friend ordered the sushi which was a hit as well. the entrees didn't hold as much interest to me as the appetizers so i \"settled\" on the coconut fried shrimp with spicy thai peanut sauce. i asked if i could get it not fried but told i couldn't. i think it is because of the volume of guests they have each night. disappointing as i would have been perfect if not fried. i was only able to eat two of them before it was just too much. i felt such a waste to leave all that food. the portions are very generous. \nwe finished the evening by sharing an order of the sugar coated doughnuts that came with vanilla and dark chocolate sauces and a caramel one as well. my one friend would not stop talking about them so even though we were full we had to at least try them. again we licked the bottom of the plate!! what a fabulous way to end the meal.\nthe food and the ambiance were both outstanding. to top it off though was the service. everyone we interacted with was just so friendly and professional. special shout out again to lawrence our server. i did stop dave (another server) at one point and he graciously took care of getting some sauces for me for the shrimp - at no charge and with a smile. i found the fact that the service to be so good of somewhat of a surprise. this is basically a tourist place and so i wouldn't have great expectations for the service and the fact it was exceptional makes this place even more special.",

            "i love tao. i don't care what anyone says or thinks. i make it a point to come here each time we visit and when my husband and i are in vegas for a few months we try to come here often to support the establishment. \n\ni must admit that one of my best friends is a lead sever here so i can expect spectacular service as well as i can trust her to bring me out what i like. \n\nas far as flavor goes, i rate it brimming the top notch for asian fusion. nothing i had was bland. some things were not up my alley, like some of the sushi (we had a shit load of sushi), but i can be a sushi purist. the entrees are fine dining experience whether the taste speaks to you or not. deal with it. it's sweet dishes and there's lots of teriyaki flavor and the like, and i really don't understand people calling this a cop out. asian fusion is supposed to be sweet sometimes. right? \n\nthe <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> is my sh*t! drunk, sober, day, night, at the pool, at the restaurant, begging for it at the club bar. my husband will have to stock up when i'm pregnant. \n\ni love the hamachi sashimi in their ponzu (?) sauce and topped with jalape\\u00f1os. even though you can find this everywhere in vegas, like all the top hotels are required to serve it or something. whatever. i'll take 10. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> were seriously good but honestly i think it's because i fall for the hype of lobster like allllll the time, it's seriously annoying. i forget that there's a way to do any lobster anyway and as long as it's not like eating a sea shoe i love it. so know that before you take my advice on these <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>. i love lobster ravioli and this was like that but with an asian flare and swimming in a soupy like base. like wor gau gee soup if it were rich. like a little china in...seattle or something. \n\nwe had the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> and i approve. not like this is the place you must get your <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark>, but let's be predictable and order the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> shall we? \n\nwe had some kind of hot dish thing that came in a cast iron bowl and our sever mixed it for us at the table. my hubs loved it and i thought it was a-okay. \n\nthe <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is my entree of choice. it should be yours too if it's your first rodeo. truly good stuff and don't you tell me otherwise! \n\nthe rest of the food we had and can't remember was yummers and some very well worth the price. however, the 85$ ribeye is not worth it no matter if it's a damn good steak. a lot of truly good ingredients at tao are ridiculously priced if i'm to be 100 about it. like $38 for the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with no carbs is kind of annoying. sometimes, too much is too much and your bill here should definitely not be cheap. \n\nthis is the sexiest restaurant on the strip in my opinion. just try this place. or at least go at night to see the girlies in the bath tubs. oh and if you have dinner here you can enter the club for free apparently. \n\nthe atmosphere and ambiance is beautiful and and a very well done asian theme. the lighting is low and dimmer than dim. i will admit my first time i was not drunk enough and complained about how in the world i would be able to eat let alone see my food. totally falls in line with the club vibe, and i guess you can make out over dinner? \n\nservice is phenomenal and i am leaving my friend out of it. i mean, she is phenomenal, her name is heather ask for her, but to be fair this rating is for the rest of the team. the boh is obviously doing something right and the foh is really great in my personal experience. from serving staff to the folks who only bring out our drinks to the hustling bussers, i have to applaud the management and training protocol. like for real, let me see your protocol so i can steal it. \n\nthere seem to be mixed reviews of the place and i have to venture to wonder if a lot of the negative is competitive haterism. tao has done significantly well for themselves in the nightlife industry and in a very short amount of time. that can be an envious thing and something we all hope to experience in vegas if we are in the business. sad to see some bad reviews on the food, as i do believe they meet expectations in a las vegas sense. so make your own idea of the place. give it a go and ask for my girl heather. tell her to go away if she's too nice to you. she won't take it personally. she's just amazing like that.", 
            "delicious asian fusion / high end asian (mostly chinese, but has japanese, thai and other mixes) fare. \n\ni've tried almost every dish, but try a variety of small plates, such as <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, fancy cock<mark>Tai</mark> etc.\n\nalmost every dish is done with a nice fusion touch and top quality, great for corporate parties. \n\nafter, go party at tao ups<mark>Tai</mark>. enjoy."

            "group of 5 ladies, came here on a saturday night during the 4th of july holiday. first of all, the hostess with the blonde hair and orange dress was a total petty bitch and did not want to seat us. had us waiting for over an hour for a table when we saw several open. we would have at least ordered drinks and  appetizers but there was no service in the waiting area. the waiting area was blaring with loud edm music, not at all conducive for dinner or lounge talk and definitely scared us a bit thinking that the club would be the same. meanwhile, troops of people with questionable attractiveness and boldly comfortable physiques would trapes in every few minutes heading over to the nightclub area. we were already on the guestlist for the party but having had good history with their sister company, lavo, we wanted to try the food first,  but in these moments, both the dinner and club scene here were so off putting. the night started off quite weak. once we were seated, after 12, finally the service came pouring in. at least 3 or 4 servers came to our table to excuse the slackness and eager to be of service. nice view of the big buddha statue in the center. food was decent, we enjoyed the pan fried <mark>Chicken Gyoza</mark>, the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> and the <mark>Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups</mark> were ok, we kind of got full off of just appetizers cause again, large portions. my cousins miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> entree was good. strong miso flavor, but if you're cool with that, its good. big portion <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> by someone else. i dont like <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> or peanut tastes so i didnt taste it but she enjoyed. looked big and fresh. i split the shrimp, lobster, scallop in bean sauce entree with someone else because it sounded big and also to cut costs and have more things on the table to taste. was really looking forward to it, it has all of my favorite meaty chewy seafoods. it was shockingly bad, dont know if there was an error made in the sauce recipe, but i have had plenty of similar dishes in the past, never have any been half as bad, and it came highly recommended by the waiter and was amongst the most expensive so we were surprised that it was so bitter. the table tasted and agreed that the sauce had an unpleasant taste. the waiter took it off of our bill gracefully and we left a great tip in exchange. in this moment, the great service that we are accustomed to from lavo, was thankfully shining through here at tao as well. a nice chick came to our table to stamp us and set us up for the complimentary club access. as i said before, we were already on the guestlist so didnt need it, but its nice that they have that additional incentive for dining there, as lavo used to do. will continue nightclub review in other yelp page.",

            "okay i will start by saying that the food was not at all what i was expecting when i made reservations at this restaurant.  upon arrival, the decor was very nice and i thought i was in for a treat.  well i was wrong.  \n\nwe started with a few cock<mark>Tai</mark>, which were good.  we ordered some starters, the edamame sampler (was good and the garlic wasabe edamame was an interesting twist on a favorite), <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> with shrimp toast (my soup was pitch black, and the shrimp toast was burnt on the outside but mushy on the inside?), and <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> (were overcooked, the skins were mushy).  \n\nfor entrees we ordered the <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, kung pao chicken (which was basically like sweet <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> chicken at most chinese fast food restaurants, but not fried), eggplant, and noodles.  after seeing the food i think the prices are absolutely ridiculous for what they provide.  the food is not flavorful in any way and i definently think that tao needs to revamp their dishes (all of them were <mark>Uni</mark>)\n\nat the end of our meal we did get a dessert which was a sampler of many of their desserts.  i have to say this was definently the highlight of a disappointing meal.  they had a sparkler on the dessert platter when they brought it out and the thing that caught my attention was the gigantic fortune cookie (which has white chocolage mousse on one side and chocolate mouse on the other side).  they also had some sort of chocolate cake with a melted chocolate inside, and a fried dessert <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark>.  \n\noverall i would recommend for the money you can find much better places to eat in las vegas.", 
            "the food was very interesting.  some of it worked, some of it didn't, but the overall experience was delightful (until they turned up the music way too loud to talk.)  the decor is outstanding, buddha statues all around, including one 30 foot one.  the food is asian fusion.  i had salmon/avocado/<mark>King Crab California Roll</mark> which was excellent (real crab.)  the duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> were a bit over done, but tasty.  we had the lobster sea food dish, the lobster was  a bit overcooked and the sauce was heavy, but the dish was good.  the soups were very well done (cream corn <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark>.)  the blueberry won ton dessert was just excellent.  if i'd had more room i would have ordered another.\nwe had the <mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark>, which were okay, but pretty standard.  \n\ni had a couple of sake flights (they have an excellent selection) which were delightful.  the wine list is very good.  don't bother asking for a blended drink, 'it takes too much time...\" the waiter claimed.  \n\nthe service was very good, actually too good, as they started bugging us too much.  first to explain every single dish on the menu in excruciating de<mark>Tai</mark> (it is a big,eclectic menu.)  then to constantly refill my water glass every time i set it down.  \n\nit was a good meal overall and i'd recommend it.  we got their early with reservations when they opened and were promptly seated.",

            "i have no idea what people are seeing in this restaurant.  this place is like a mediocre p.f. chang's you wait twice as long and pay twice as much for.  there are too many amazing restaurants in vegas to waste your time here. turn around and head out, do not pass go and save your $200.  seriously, if you have any sort of culinary expectations look for another option.  if you're looking for naked girls in bathtubs, this may be your place (although, no girls in the bathtubs the night we came). \n\na group of co-workers were all here for a conference and decided to try this place out since we were staying at the venetian.  we made a reservation for 8:30 and when we arrived were told we would be seated 'in a few moments' 40 minutes later (and a few times getting the run around by the guy in charge of seating), we finally got to a table.   \n\ntao highlights the modern asian fusion movement on their menu.  unfortunately they also have tried to mask their lack of flavor in dishes by <mark>Maki</mark> them overly salty or overly sweet.  this makes everything taste like it's a microwave dinner or some sort of bad chinese takeout.  \n\nwe tried the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> (way too much sauce that was overly sweet with very little spice element, kinda tasted like one you can buy out of a bottle), <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> (decent, but the shrimp toast was the highlight), <mark><mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark> Bao Buns</mark> (the pork was again way too sweet and the bun had too much dough to pork ratio, this was barely edible),  <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> (another overly sweet dish that was deemed not even as good as chinese takeout), <mark>Grilled 12 oz. Kobe Ribeye</mark> (no way this is real kobe, despite assurances from our server. it was tough and hard to cut, we had real kobe at gordon ramsey's the next night and there was no comparison) and a few sushi/<mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark> (decent, but the rice wasn't well flavored. we had better sushi at the buffet). \n\nour waiter was very nice and attentive, but there were cer<mark>Tai</mark> elements of dishes that were left off (rice for the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark>, asked for sauce on the side for a couple dishes that wasn't done).  all in all a truly regrettable experience from start to finish. their fortunes for their cookies were pretty funny though.",

            "after eating here a couple time this last experience was lack luster. the beef tarter rolls were so disgusting we didn't even eat more than 2 bites. it was slightly warm, mushy, and the texture made my skin crawl. the signature <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is why i usually like coming to eat here and it's been always great in the past but the combination duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was hard and seemed like it had been sitting out. the fried whole fish was pretty good, i ate everything from the <mark>Tai</mark> to the eyeball and was pretty pleased with it. the <mark>Peking Duck <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> were bland and our <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> were tasteless and chewy which wasn't good at all. during this last dinner at tao we ordered $240.00 worth of food between the 2 of us and was only happy with the snapper, <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. the appetizers were all a disappointment and even our 4 drinks weren't made to our liking. \n although i've had a good experience at tao before, this last one wasn't good at all. not sure if we will return again but who knows what will happen while in vegas right?", 
            "eh.\n\nthe best part of this place is the amazing decor and ambiance. food is just fine, but expensive (vegas nightclub strip restaurant, go figure!). we wanted to try out tao because we were with a couple of dudes and knew we could get into the club without paying for a cover for the guys if we ate dinner there.\n\njust fyi, you must get an entree which does not include most of the sushi, soups, etc. if you want free access to the club. i kinda think the rule is crap because i wanted a <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and sushi roll and was planning on ordering multiple drinks but was told that it didn't qualify as an entree selection. so i ended up getting something i didn't want as much and ordered less drinks. i really couldn't win here. my recommendation would be spending an amount per person or per table, but i am not an expert. \n\nwe ordered edamame and tempura shrimp and <mark>Sweet Potato</mark> as appetizers. edamame was super spicy, but i am into that sorta thing so it was good. the tempura was average.for my entree i ordered some special sushi roll with tuna or salmon on top, don't remember. if you couldn't tell the sushi roll was very unmemorable to me. it was average sushi that comes with an ayce joint. however, this suchi roll was $32! my husband got the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> which was presented great, but taste was again average to me. \n\nthe highlight of the night was the giant fortune cookie desert that they bring out for celebrations. it was very tasty and great to share. \n\nbottom line: probably won't be back if it is my job to choose a place, but the food was edible, in a beautiful location, with friendly servers."

            "okay i will start by saying that the food was not at all what i was expecting when i made reservations at this restaurant.  upon arrival, the decor was very nice and i thought i was in for a treat.  well i was wrong.  \n\nwe started with a few cock<mark>Tai</mark>, which were good.  we ordered some starters, the edamame sampler (was good and the garlic wasabe edamame was an interesting twist on a favorite), <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> with shrimp toast (my soup was pitch black, and the shrimp toast was burnt on the outside but mushy on the inside?), and <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> (were overcooked, the skins were mushy).  \n\nfor entrees we ordered the <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, kung pao chicken (which was basically like sweet <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> chicken at most chinese fast food restaurants, but not fried), eggplant, and noodles.  after seeing the food i think the prices are absolutely ridiculous for what they provide.  the food is not flavorful in any way and i definently think that tao needs to revamp their dishes (all of them were <mark>Uni</mark>)\n\nat the end of our meal we did get a dessert which was a sampler of many of their desserts.  i have to say this was definently the highlight of a disappointing meal.  they had a sparkler on the dessert platter when they brought it out and the thing that caught my attention was the gigantic fortune cookie (which has white chocolage mousse on one side and chocolate mouse on the other side).  they also had some sort of chocolate cake with a melted chocolate inside, and a fried dessert <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark>.  \n\noverall i would recommend for the money you can find much better places to eat in las vegas.", 
            "tao... great ambiance! love the dim lighting, bathtubs filled with rose petals, candles and especially the huge buddha statue as the focal point of the restaurant/club. \n\nwith that said... the food... eehh. yes, just eeh. i had great service - the wait staff was very attentive - my water glass was always topped off even thought it was 3/4s full.\n\nmaybe it was the hype of everyone - family, friends, celebrities - that i thought my dinner at tao was going to be a culinary experience. honestly, i probably would have had a better meal at pf chang's and spent a lot less for it. my appetizer (<mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark>) was bland and my noodle dish was so oily and greasy! i left feeling quite unsatisfied and quite queasy too. \n\nwould i go tao for the club and drinks? sure - it's the buddha that calls me.\n\nwould i go for dinner at tao again? yes, but only if i was outnumbered in a large group and that's where everyone decided to go. otherwise... probably not.", 
            "so the best meal of the whole vacation goes to... tao. what do you think of when you think of tao, besides winnie-the pooh, maybe a pathway or a philosophy of the true nature of the world? tao restaurant located in the venetian has found their \"pathway\" through their food. \n\nunbeknownst to me, tao is one of the hottest places on the strip. not only is it a restaurant but a lounge, banquet hall, a club, and celeb hot spot. i guess i know how to pick them! what i like is that the service treats everyone like royalty. the service here is <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> fast and they have more then enough staff on hand. we met one host and then got seated by another, then our server, a water guy, a guy that brings out food, and then a guy that takes it all away. the decor was <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> too, dark rich colors, all kinds of fabrics, very bold and very de<mark>Tai</mark>. of course the 16 foot tall buddha stands out just a little. \n\nthe most impressive attribute about tao is their food. tao specializes in hong kong chinese, japanese, and thai cuisines. i know it's a lot but this location is huge so they room for it all. the <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> was unbelievable and all it consisted of was fresh tuna in a roll with a crispy outer ring of something (they wouldn't tell me what is was). <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> and veg <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark> were surprisingly filling and were perfectly cooked. of course you have to get something tempura, i recommend the asparagus, it wasn't greasy at all, we loved them. so for dessert you have to get the giant fortune cookie (it's almost the size of your head), yeah it's cheesy but it's filled with white and chocolate mousse and you won't be able to put your spoon down. \n\nother then the drinks tao is relatively cheap, at least compared to most of vegas. but even if it wasn't tao is worth the visit.", 
            "my experience with tao's restaurant started before we even sat down to eat! i actually set up a reservation for a party of 11 with maria - the res manager a week before we were in town. she just had me fill out a very simple cc auth and we were good to go. \n\ngetting to the hostess stand can be a little bit of a journey as by the time you are getting in for dinner, people are already lined up to get into the club. once you make it to the bathtubs (best part of tao hands down) you are golden! \n\nand on to the food... \n\nstarted the meal with pork or chicken (sorry, i forget) gyoza. it was good but cmon baby, gyoza is gyoza. we also had the <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> with crunchy cucumber salad. both were so light and refreshing. \n\nmy entree was a wassabi crusted fillet with <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> and a side of <mark>Sake Braised Shiitake Mushrooms</mark>. the mushrooms were so tastey and perfectly tender. i had when shiitake's get mushy. the fillet came out a true medium rare and the wassabi crust set it over the top. my spoiled ass even found a cab from napa on the wine list. **side note - don't you have being out of california and seeing whack wines on the menu?** \n\ntoo bad i didn't leave room for that giant fortune cookie i keep hearing about. \n\nafter dinner you can also get a stamp that can get you another stamp that gets you into the club for free!", 
            "perhaps because kim kardashian, her mom, & co. were to the table to my right, and david spade and colin firth of snl were to the table to my left, tao failed to give me one thing i would have needed - a lobster bib.\n\nthat is the only thing that my tao restaurant dining experience lacked and who knows, had i asked, maybe they would have had one on hand. we had reservations for saturday night for 8:30pm to celebrate my 30th birthday. friends were gathered from chicago, nyc, and san francisco. we had a 45 minute delay in being seated at our table but that came as no surprise given the busy night. we were seated in the first floor dining area near the majestic two-story tall buddha statue. our server was courteous, attentive, and knowledgeable on the menu items.\n\nthe standouts for me appetizer-wise were the <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> and <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark> (i'm pescatarian and do not eat meat). my carnivore friends seem to enjoy the dragon <mark>Tai</mark> <mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark> and meat potstickers. through it all, the wine kept pouring.\n\nour entrees came and i was dazzled by my <mark>Typhoon Lobster</mark> with fingerling potatoes and spicy <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark>. this is when the bib would have come in handy because when i was done it looked like i had massacred an aquatic beast! fine food, great conv, surrounded by top notch friends -  this was an evening to be remembered. \n\ni will mention that the pair who ordered the peking duck for 2 were indifferent to it. the description had sounded amazing but did not live up to their expectations. everyone else enjoyed their food immensely though. then came what would make for buzz that this meal was a contender for best meal ever - the dessert platter.\n\nover the off-key singing of 'happy birthday' came the mother of all dessert platters. it included a scoop of ice cream, sorbet, molton chocolate cake, fruit, and a giant fortune cookie filled with white and dark chocolate mousse and chocolate buddhas. simply incredible and i am not generally a dessert person. \n\nfrom the moment you walk in to the moment you leave tao you feel as though you are experiencing something <mark>Uni</mark>, exotic, and daring. the decor is chic and sexy, the vibe hip and happening. thank you tao for <mark>Maki</mark> my birthday dinner one i will never forget.", 
            "we had a wonderful experience. we had an rsvp and had zero wait. we had a group of 10 led by a vip that secured us a nice round table. the wise and skilled waiter (jake) sagely suggested that we set an approximate cost per person of around $70 or so (not including drinks) and he bring out multiple entrees and serve family style. we had a few vegetarians in the group.\n\nthis plan worked very very well. the vegetarian dishes (kung pao tofu, <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>, <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark>, sake-flavored mushrooms) were all quite good. the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers were out of this world. also quite good were the lobster dumplings. service was excellent at all times, though this might have been influenced by a vip in our group. b/c said vip among other stuff we were treated to sushi, some apps and a dessert platter with a giant fortune cookie stuffed with yum, ice cream, apple dumplings, pocky, and stuff similar to cannolis. the dessert was good, but definitely not the best stuff that this place has. if you are looking to save money, skip dessert here.\n\nperhaps our experience was not normal b/c the vip on board, however the food, ambiance as well as the great wine/liquor menu justify a splurge here. if your waiter is half as good as jake, you will be 100% satisfied.", 
            "if you stay at the venetian hotel in las vegas, it's hard not to see all the ads for tao. my boyfriend and i failed to get into the nightclub the night we arrived, but he wanted to give their \"spiritual dining\" a chance, so we ate dinner here the night before we left.\n\ntao is huge. and i love their asian-themed decor. but it looks like it'd be impossible to get a seat without a reservation. they just get that much traffic, and we still had to wait about 10 minutes before getting our reserved table. our server darren was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu and specials. there were lots to mention. just like sushi roku, we discovered that it's customary (at least in these fine dining places) to have two servers: one to take your order and check-in, and the other to bring you your food and drinks.\n\nit took us forever to order, but because it took us 5 mins. to figure out we had to close our menu to order. lesson learned! i started off my appetizers with an orient express cock<mark>Tai</mark> ($13) with kahlua and vanilla liqueur.  my <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> (which were green!) and crunchy cucumbers (japanese style, bitter like ginger) for $10 satisfied my grumbling stomach quite well. \n\nmy main was <mark>Buddha's Harmonized Vegetable Feast for the Minor Gods</mark>, which was an entree-sized udon in sesame & black peppercorn sauce with red pepper, onions, bok choy, asparagus, and brussel sprouts to top it off ($17). a vegetarian feast indeed. the dish came in a bowl which made it less messy than it probably would have been had it come on a plate, but i wasn't expecting the amount of spice. still, a great veggie entree (maybe the only veggie entree!).\n\ntip: the restrooms say \"yin\" and \"yang.\" yin is for the women and yang is for the men. \n\ndarren offered us a menu of \"temptation\" which was the right word for it. i could barely get any more food in my stomach so i wanted ice cream. and i got to choose 3 different scoops: white chocolate & yuzu, cocunut, and green tea with almond cookies and even pocky sticks ($8) - bonus. the thing is, i think the yuzu (a japanese fruit much like tangerine) was overpowering the white chocolate, or else they were two separate flavours and they brought me the wrong one. i couldn't finish the scoops anyway, because we also got two chocolate fortune cookies!\n\nthe vegas magazines say this restaurant is only a $30 meal, but we spent about double that including drinks, appetizers and dessert.\n\ntao restaurant is truly a religious dining experience as they say. you probably have to be the type to appreciate asian food, the 20-foot buddha foun<mark>Tai</mark>, and the ancient pipe display on the wall, but i'm glad i dined here on my trip - it's a restaurant like no other i've seen in any of my travels.", 
            "this was my second time dining at tao and this was a far better experience than the first. we were seated promptly in a romantic booth on the far side of the restaurant near the gigantic buddha on the first floor.\n\nif there was a way to take home and/or replicate the decor of tao, i would in an instant. (i'm a sucker for asian decor, but i digress.)\n\nthe service was phenomenal. our waiter was extremely knowledgeable on the menu, although he did try to sell us on the most expensive things available (go figure.) we had show reservations at nyny and we were finished with more than enough time to spare.\n\nmy boyfriend had the hamachi (yellow<mark>Tai</mark>) to start with. the fish was fresh and delicious, although the sushi rice left something to be desired. for an entree, he had the hong kong xo shrimp with <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark> and <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>, which he loved.\n\neating out for me has been pretty rough lately since i developed some weird food intolerances. there's very little in the way of flavorful food that i can have without giving me a terrible stomachache. \n\nsince i'm not a fan of seafood, i decided to go with the <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> with crunchy cucumbers and a side of <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>. these were the best dumplings both my boyfriend and i had *ever* had (and probably will ever have.) if you like vegetables at all, you have to get these. so full of flavor and healthy to boot! we joked at the end of the meal that we'd come back and just get four orders of these dumplings.", 
            "a coworker and i ate here after our last night working a multi-day event in vegas.  we were exhausted and grabbing the redeye a few hours later back to boston.\n\nlet's say this first: every restaurant in vegas over-salts their food, because it's part of the bigger plan to drink your face off.  knowing this, i can't really complain about how salty the food was (which it was), because that's just sort of the foundation that vegas sets for you.\n\nmy coworker and i shared <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark>, a sushi roll, and an order of the pad <mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark>.\n\n...it was all really delicious.  i was honestly pretty shocked.  i come to vegas about 4 times a year for work, and i've managed to eat at my fair share of restaurants on the strip.  i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.\n\nwe also got an excellent table in the back of the room, but i think that's because a coworker called ahead to her contact at tao for us, since she'd done a reception there recently.  not sure if that affected our service, but the waiter was very friendly and chatty.", 
            "amazing!  my second visit was as wonderful  as my first.  i was in vegas with my kids and really wanted to go to tao since it was incredible 18months ago when my husband and i went alone.  we made an early reservation and dined ahead of the night club crowd.  the food was so delicious.  my son who loves asian food said it is the best and my picky daughter left stuffed.  <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, lobster won tons, spicy wonton soup, <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark>- everything was fresh, full of flavor and perfectly prepared.  the donuts were a tasty ending.  the staff was very attentive.  the ambiance is great - it is an experience!", 
            "this is another restaurant that i ate at while on my honeymoon.  we stayed at the venetian and thought it looked like a fabulous place.  \n\nthe restaurant itself is beautiful.  there are tubs filled with flowers as you walk in.  the decor is really pretty and there is a huge buddah statue in the restaurant.\n\nthey have a nice sized menu.  i would have given them 5 stars but there were a couple of things i found weird.  i am a vegetarian and told this to the waiter.  he helped me out by telling me what was safe to eat.  there was a side of broccoli and he told me it was made with chicken stock.  the food tasted freshly prepared (which for the price i would hope it is) so i don't really understand why the dish could not be made vegetarian as other restaurants do for me.  i ended up ordering <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> and asked if they could add pineapple because i saw they used it in another dish.  the waiter told me he could ask but was not sure the chef would do it.  they did not as he tried to make a nice gesture and brought me some raw pineapple on the side when my rice came out.  again, i think it is weird that the chef would be so rigid.\n\nother than that i have to say the food was delicious.  my rice was very good.  the <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> were so good we got a second order. the vegetable sides i was able to order were tasty.  my husband had a <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> dish and said other than some peppers being overwhelming was good as well.  \n\nduring the reservation we were asked if we were celebrating anything so we let them know we came to vegas to get married.  they did bring us a surprise dessert which was a great gesture.  it was a huge fortune cookie that when cracked open con<mark>Tai</mark> what tasted like both a chocolate and a vanilla mousse.  whatever it was, it was adorable and tasted very nice.  i did enjoy the experience and the food and would love to eat here again next time i visit vegas.",

            "what can i say about tao that hasn't already been said? let me give it a shot! for starters, the bathtub looking decorations on the way in were stunning- filled with water and fresh rose petals with floating candles, absolutely gorgeous! there was no wait (amazing, given all the other reviews, but it was a monday night...) so we were seated right by the floating buddha. as for that-- this statue is breath-taking! it is approximately 20 feet tall, and appears to be floating on the pond of live koi fish. i happily drank with the tao-tini (delish) and my companion had the lychee tini (a little too sweet for her) then the berries and bubbles (very good). \nwe started with the <mark>Chicken Gyoza</mark> with napa cabbage and soy dipping sauce (steamed) and we inhaled it. perfect! we then shared the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> over veggies (excellent) and the chicken <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> (very good- not as spicy as i'd have liked though). the dessert menu was very diverse, and we settled on a 6-pack of buddha chocolates (adorably packaged-- almost too cute to eat! milk, white and dark chocolates). \nthe ambiance was absolutely divine, so much so that we did not want to leave. but our bellies were full, our drink glasses empty and the hour late-- so we did depart after all. but for sure, i will be going back!!", 
            "went out for a fancy dinner with friends to celebrate some birthdays this past weekend in vegas. dressed to the nines and prepared for some fancy offerings...was not disappointed!\n\natmosphere: dark and intimate! two levels of fancy decor and a giant buddha in the middle of the first floor. make sure you have reservations to this place. it's very popular. it is a great place to go for date night if you want somewhere romantic. or bring a group for a fancy night out with friends!\n\ndrinks: don't expect a cheap drink here! i had a small bottle of sake for $30 and most cock<mark>Tai</mark> were very pricey. wine is pricey as well and beer is available for a cost. \n\nfood: indulge. just do it. i had the duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> which was sooo flavorful and was a giant bowl full. so many herbs and not as greasy as i had expected. thanks to my fellow vegas goers i got to taste the <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>, <mark>Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups</mark>, <mark>Chicken Gyoza</mark>, <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> as well as the <mark>Grilled 12 oz.

            "this was my first visit here, for my birthday, definitely felt like a celebrity, seeing as though all the celebrities do eat here.  my girls made reservations for us, they did so good.  we were a tad bit late, but the hostess was nice enough to seat us within a good 15 minutes.  that was really sweet of her, because the place was packed, and i'm sure that's nothing new.\n\nonce we were seated, our waiter, i hate that i forgot his name, greeted all of the ladies with a smile, told us all about the specials, what's popular, all that good stuff to help us decide.  the restaurant was very dim, very dark, very sexy.  honestly, it was a little too dark, made it very difficult to read the menu, but that was nothing big to complain about.  because it was a group of girls, we all made the executive decision to order 3 or 4 appetizers, 3 or 4 dinner entrees, make it like family style.  pass everything around the table, everyone gets to taste everything.  now, i don't know if i got my hopes too high up for tao, but the overall meal, it was...good. not great, but good.  i wasn't disappointed, but i guess i was expecting out-of-this world cuisine.  \n\nhonestly, the best things, were the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> and the <mark>Pork Potstickers</mark>.  full of flavor, full of filling, the mango chili sauce on the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> was really good, so was the chili sesame glaze on the potstickers.  that was my favorite.  now, the entrees, it's not like they were bad, but i wasn't blown away.  if i had to pick one of my favorites, it would have to be the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>.  cooked perfectly, tender, flavor was awesome and the tower of <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> were a great match. a fun match.  i ordered the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, which melted in my mouth like butter, tender and flaky, but the seasoning was a little off.  it's like there wasn't enough.  but the quality was top notch.\n\nit was so sweet that they did bring me this giant fortune cookie, with a giant fortune on the inside, filled with sweet, smooth, velvety vanilla and chocolate mouse.  i mean it was so good and the cookie was just the cutest and so delicious.  the fresh fruit with the chocolate, i mean it was literally a sweet ending.\n\noverall, i would definitely recommend tao, it is definitely the place to be, always jumpin', always poppin' and it's really just a pretty cool place!"

            "3.5 stars. i ordered the peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> as my appetizer and fried red snapper as my main course (snapper was the stand out). this restaurant is massive! a friend of mine at dinner exclaimed that this place looked exactly like pf changs (they're like an americanize chinese food place with nicer decor and an american wait-staff). it was a replica of that place, just this one was the super-walmart of pf changs'. \n\nthe <mark>Peking Duck <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> tasted like they were from a pre-packaged roll set they also lack a sizable amount of hoisin dipping sauce which i was looking forward to. i was underwhelmed since they were $14. the red snapper was actually good, i enjoyed and recommend it.\n\nthe music was pretty loud in the place, so i wouldn't bring my family here for a quiet meal.\n\noverall, decent, not memorial except for the semi-naked girls in the bathtubs as we left the restaurant. this is vegas, what do you expect?", 
            "the food was fantastic, and i highly recommend the chef's tasting sampler. the highlights were the <mark>Peking Duck <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark>, <mark>Kobe Beef</mark>, citrus japanese snapper and the dumplings. for drinks, i had the tao-hito, which unfortunately just tasted watered down. also, the decor is well done, as has been mentioned before, the 30-foot buddha wall is sweet. the service was great once the food started coming, but previous to that it was slow and it took some time to get our drinks. lastly, if you go with a group, you may want to limit it to six people only because we had to cram in eight sizable guys around a table designed for six. there were other tables which would've worked, but the majority seemed setup for six.", 
            "we had a short weekend trip to vegas and decided to check out tao since we were staying at the venetian.  it was our first time going into tao (we later also went to the nightclub), and we found the decor and ambiance to fitting, comfortable, and well-thought.  the four of us kept commenting on the buddha floating over the koi pond, the wall of candles, and the giant portraits that were hanging near our tables.  fortunately, our luck didn't just run out there.\n\nwe ordered two appetizers and four main course dishes and were pleasantly surprised with the quality and the quantity.  the <mark>Scallop</mark> were amazingly tasty, and the <mark>Peking Duck <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> were beyond my expectations.  our entrees were <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>, a red curry chicken, a <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and salmon over udon noodles.  all dishes were exceptionally prepared and the thai dishes were better than you'd find at most specialty thai restaurants.  impressive.  five stars would be awarded if our server had been more attentive and perhaps if the price were just a smidge lower.  dinner ended up running a little long and we were antsy to get over to our cirque du soleil show.\n\nat the end of the meal, we left as a happy group and were extremely glad we stopped in.  i'll definitely be <mark>Maki</mark> another reservation the next time i'm in town.  \n\nbonus: the other perk of eating there for dinner was that we were able to get stamps to return later in the evening for their must-see club experience.  the stamps saved us from a huge wait in line and also got us in without a cover charge.", 
            "weak. i would say to go here only if you want to skip the line and get into tao nightclub.\n\nto get in you'll need to order one of their entree dishes or two sushi rolls. i got some sushi that i can't remember. i think it was the angry dragon and a spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark> with asparagus. both were just okay. some of my buddies got the black pepper <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with udon noodles. how would i describe it? salty! it was like they poured in some soy sauce and decided to leave the bottle titled while they cook the food. that dish was dissapointing. maybe we got some bad dishes, but gotta be more consistent than this!\n\nservice was pretty good, but the food was meh. go here if you want entry into the club. i wouldn't recommend it otherwise.", 
            "cool, trendy, delicious.\n\nquick tips:\n\n1.  stick to small plates and starters.  most creative.\n\n2.  skip the nigiri sushi.  expensive and not spectacular.\n\n3.  lots of spicy, hot flavors from chili and wasabi.  this is drinking food.\n\nif you must have sushi, top props to the <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> with black tobiko, <mark>King Crab California Roll</mark> (made with real king crab), and the <mark>Crispy Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll served with a yuzu mayonnaise.  all are familiar just made with top quality ingredients and a good flavor twist that makes you long for a second bite.\n\nsmall plate standouts include an unexpectedly good grilled <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> served with a satay sauce. never thought what is essentially peanut butter would go so well with fish.  the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> with mango chili sauce while not purely crab meat just pairs so well with the sauce.  well balanced.  the spicy tuna tartar <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> crackers, a great twist on the classic.  outstanding.  bold flavor, cool tuna, <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> cracker.  so much contrast make for a delicious bite of food.  finally the  <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> sashimi with fresh wasabi; yum.\n\ndo not pass on the peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with hoisin sauce or the lobster and shrimp <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with spicy pineapple sauce.  big bold flavors.  textual contrast at its best.\n\nfinally, if you never had avocado tempura try it.  the warm avocado has the creamy texture of uni.  very different.  very good.\n\nnote:  dining at tao should be social so bring a group of friends.  the food is meant to be shared.  \n\nspecial note:  for the guys, dining at tao does not give you any special vip privileges to enter the tao nightclub later in the evening.  ladies, work the magic.\n\n\nrecommended.", 
            "i went to tao for the 2nd time tonight for dinner.  the last time i went i had some sort of a groupon or something, and tonight my friend had a gift card she was given as a gift.  i think that's the only way i would dine here.  i think the food is overpriced, and if you're going to spend this much on a meal, there's other places in town i'd rather go.  maybe it's just me.\n\nwe started with two appetizers... the spicy tune <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> and the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>.  we had the tartare last time and really enjoyed it.  we enjoyed it again this time, but it wasn't as magical as it was last time.  the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>... well, they tasted like the best wontons i've ever eaten, but i could barely taste the lobster.  the flavor was drowned out from the broth, i thought.\n\nfor a main course, we split the most expensive omakase sushi menu, which was like $58.  very underwhelming how little food we got: one roll, 7 pieces of nigiri, and 6 slices <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark>.  granted, one of the nigiri was toro, and the roll was a <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> of some sort, but for $58, i'd expect a little more.  throw some salmon nigiri in there!\n\nwe also split the coconut crusted shrimp with peanut sauce, which was really delicious, though the breading on the shrimp was too thick.  that was made up for in quantity of shrimp, as i think there were like 8 or so large shrimp.  it also came with a side of rice, and some sort of salad in the middle of the plate.\n\nlastly, we tried the avocado tempura since we both love avocado.  very tasty.\n\nwe stuck with water, and when our bill came, it was $140 after tax.  we did have a lot of food, but that seems like way too much to pay for a meal at a place like tao.  the service was top notch, and the ambiance is typical loud music, dark vibe that you'd expect in vegas.  so 4 stars for me.",

            "omg amazing!  we went as a group of 9 people.  we all ordered drinks and the waitress was really helpful in helping us decide which ones to choose.  for appetizers we had the spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> roll and some scallop/<mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark>, gyoza, and some fried triangle thing.  the sushi rolls and gyoza were my favorite.  the triangle thing was good but it wasn't as good as the other appetizers.  i specifically ordered <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> pot lobster and other seafood.  it was good.  i tried my friends <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and it was delicious.  i only had a piece but it was perfect.  i would definitely recommend it!  the only thing is that it's kinda dark and after a cer<mark>Tai</mark> time the music starts to get clubby.", 
            "after eating here a couple time this last experience was lack luster. the beef tarter rolls were so disgusting we didn't even eat more than 2 bites. it was slightly warm, mushy, and the texture made my skin crawl. the signature <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is why i usually like coming to eat here and it's been always great in the past but the combination duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was hard and seemed like it had been sitting out. the fried whole fish was pretty good, i ate everything from the <mark>Tai</mark> to the eyeball and was pretty pleased with it. the <mark>Peking Duck <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> were bland and our <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> were tasteless and chewy which wasn't good at all. during this last dinner at tao we ordered $240.00 worth of food between the 2 of us and was only happy with the snapper, <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. the appetizers were all a disappointment and even our 4 drinks weren't made to our liking. \n although i've had a good experience at tao before, this last one wasn't good at all. not sure if we will return again but who knows what will happen while in vegas right?"

            "i went here with a group of friends to celebrate a \"birthday\" which turned out to be something else. the interior was nice but the food was a bit marginal for the price. i mean, c'mon! duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> for $15? <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> for $19-22? for one person? i'm not one to look at the price but this place made me do it. i could go to any asian restaurant for the same food but for less money and better taste.\n\nwe started the night with some tasty cock<mark>Tai</mark>. i wanted to try love potion #9 (grey goose cherry noir, cranberry and lychee puree) but angela h beat me to it so to be different,  i got a dragon slayer (bacardi dragonberry, ginger liqeur, strawberry and togarashi spice) instead. black pearl ((henessy black, blackberries, yuzu and agave nectar). the drinks were pretty awesome!\n\nwasabi-<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>:\nthis one was the best value for $38. good and tender filet. however,  this one came with fat...and i'm not a fan of animal fat.  the wasabi crust was great and not overpowering/sinus-clearing. 3.5/5\n\nmandarin sizzled <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with peking duck:\nthe duck was great and overall this was good <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>. but for $15 and a serving for 1 person? not so much. 3/5\n\n<mark>Lacquered Roast Pork</mark>:\nchinese bbq pork is what this is. you get about 7 slices of pork. i mean, it wasn't bad but it wasn't spectacular either. go to chinatown instead. 2/5\n\nthe highlight of the evening was the dessert sampler. it was a huuuge plate with all kinds of crazy chocolate desserts. we had a chocolate mousse, a giant fortune cookie filled with cream and chocolate, ice cream, souffle, wontons with chocolate, fruits...crazy!", 
            "if i was rating just the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, it would be a 4 star easily!  it was the rest of the items that pulled the review down slightly, as was the bang/buck ratio.\n\nthe <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> ($40) with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>. this was great! a little fatty which i loved, perfectly cooked, and the crust was very flavorful but not overpowering. a good deal considering the prices of the other dishes! go with the steak!!\n\nmandarin sizzled <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with peking duck ($15). this was good! it had lots of flavor, and a slightly larger portion than i was expecting...but still a little spendy overall.\n\n<mark>Lacquered Roast Pork</mark> ($13). this was a little chewy and the sauce was pretty thick. can't touch the cheaper versions in chinatown!  pass\n\nand to finish, the dessert platter. this thing was huge!! enough food for the 10+ of us! we said our dinner here was for an anniversary, so this monster was gratis! there were some goodies there...nothing amazing, but all were good! \n\nso again, if you come here...go with the steaks!  i wasn't impressed with the rest of the meal personally.\n\npics :",

            "it kills me to write this review. this is maybe the most disappointing dining experience i've ever had in las vegas. i brought a group of 11 here last thursday night. our waiter's name was bobby. he strongly suggested a pre-fixe menu due to the size of our party - it would come with appetizers, main dishes and dessert for $60 a person (pre-fixe means we have no choice in what gets brought to out table, fyi).\n\nso after we agree to the dinner, the appetizers made it out in about 20 minutes; and honestly, they were great. fried <mark><mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark> Bao Buns</mark>, <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>, <mark>Chinese Five Spice Short Ribs</mark>, some kind of seafood dumplings and three rolls of sushi. our table of 11 seemed satisfied with the amount of food we received for the first course. also, i thought all of it was delicious. \n\nunfortunately, this is where our fun ended. about an hour later, our waiter comes to our table for the first time since our appetizers were dropped off and asked if we were ready for dessert. we said, \"ummm, we'd like our dinner first!\". he acted shocked that we hadn't eaten yet. he left, came back a minute later and said that all of our food was delivered to another table accidentally and that he'd have a new round of food brought to us very quickly, maybe 10 minutes. well, 20 minutes later, we started to get upset. i told bobby that we had been waiting too long for our dinner. he tried to claim we had only been waiting 45 minutes, including the mistake. but i disagreed and he got a little upset with me. he told our table 3 minutes and our food would be out. so we waited. again. ten more minutes went by and i walked over to an assistant manager and asked him to please get our bill right away because we were leaving. i said we'd be happy to pay for our drinks and all the appetizers. he said that was fine. moments later the food finally came out. but it was too late.almost 90 minutes had passed and four people had left our party. \n\ntwo minutes later, bobby comes back to the table and announces that dessert is on the way - mind you, we didn't get any dinner. i told him to talk with his manager - we had already agreed to pay for what we consumed and we wanted to leave. he got more and more visibly upset with me and our group - he was also having words with the assistant manager after i demanded the bill.\n\nwe finally got the bill and it was $327 and change. for appetizers and about 13 drinks. we tipped %15 percent, even though our service was awful; and he never gave a true apology for screwing up our dinner. \n\nwhat stinks, is that i was the reason my group went to dinner here! i convinced them to go - and we all had an awful experience. even worse, literally no one from the restaurant seemed to care in the least. seriously, even the assistant manager admitted it was a long time to wait for dinner, yet after being there for a total of 2 hours, they didn't even comp the drinks. \n\nneedless to say, i will never go there again. and 10 other people will never go again either. its a good thing las vegas has so many awesome places to dine. and for that reason, you should avoid this establishment!!!",

            "large parties dining at tao should know this....\n___________________________\nto my surprise, 4 stars for the food, but an overall 2 stars for the ridiculous way we were charged for the food and how our complaint was handled.  i dined at tao with a group of 9 for a bachelorette party the weekend of august 13, 2007. although i was disappointed with tao, i still had a great time with my fabulous girlfriends. \n\ni don't remember everything we had, but i enjoyed the <mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark>, <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. least favorite was the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> (one of the worst i've had) and chicken skewers. \n\nreason for 2 stars:\nafter we were seated, our waitress didn't come by for what seemed like 10 minutes to introduce herself. when she came by, she was friendly but did not comm<mark>Uni</mark> clearly how she was taking our order. since it was so loud and our waitress didn't have a very loud voice, 3 different members of our group asked her to clarify how much food she thought we should order. she specifically told us that we should order 3-4 starters and at least 5 main dishes. that took me by surprise b/c i thought this is small plates and how could that be enough food? so i repeated what she said to me just to clarify that 3-4 appetizers would enough food for 10 girls? we decided to just order as much as she recommended and we can order more if necessary. \n\nwhen the dishes arrived, we were all suprised at the large portions. what we found out when we got the receipt was that the waitress doubled and tripled each order (as she saw fit) so it would be enough for our table of 9. she never once said she was going to do this and we were upset because we had so much leftover food and even ate more than we wanted so it wouldn't be wasted.\n\nif we had known this is what she was going to do, we would have ordered different items. i can't remember if she tripled any main dishes but the end result was a very large bill and wasted food. \n\nwhen we brought this up to our waitress, she insisted she explained it and after she left, she never returned to our table. we then spoke to the manager who said he could only give us 2 drink tokens to compensate for the miscomm<mark>Uni</mark>. this is so lame and such a cheap gestere to rectify the situation. the least he could have done was get us into the nightclub for free afterwards. \n\ni have never, ever, gone to a restaurant where they took the liberty of doubling or tripling your order without telling you. i've always said, i want 1 order of this, 2 orders of this, etc.\n\ni would not go back to this restaurant again. food was good but not worth the price. \n\nthe club is ok if you get in early but by 1pm it gets too crowded to walk around and check things out. we got free line passes but had to go out, get in smaller line, pay $20pp at the door + get a hand stamp, then headed ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the night club. seems like a classy place but i find it offensive that they have skanky girls taking baths and playing with each other surrounded by all these bhuddas.", 
            "not many people have actually ate at tao. the food is phenomenal! the special rolls are good. (look for one with crunch on it... i forgot the name) and the bbq <mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark> are some of the best i've ever had! <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is really good too. i ate ups<mark>Tai</mark> where you have a great view of the buddha. everything at this restaurant is good as hell. i highly recommend this place over any restraunt in the other hotels. you cannot go wrong ordering here.",

            "when planning my trip to vegas, this was one place i had heard a lot about and thought i needed to try.  so, we booked reservations a week in advance through open table. \n\ni knew the place was trendy, and in my experience, trendy means pretentious and disappointing.  my first impression, by the automated response i received from open table was not great.  the message they send back asks that you please call the restaurant the day of the reservation to confirm.  isn't that their job???  i was kind of offended.  \n\nanyway, i called to confirm and they were abrupt on the phone.  we got to the restaurant and had to wait in line to check in for our reservation.         once at the stand, i was given a buzzer and told that i needed to wait.  so, we waited 10 minutes.  there's good people-watching, but i'd rather be seated right away then wait when i have a reservation.  \n\nwhen the buzzer went off, we went back up to the desk and this time the man was overly kind, as many people in vegas had been.  he thanked us profusely for waiting, told us that he really hoped we enjoyed our night, and the rest of our stay.  we were escorted to the perfect table on the second level over-looking the 3-story asian figure sitting on a koi pond in front of a wall of candles.  it was gorgeous.  the waitress was really sweet and about 10 minutes in, we were seated with out menus closed and a manager came up and asked us if we were waiting on the waitress of if she was waiting on us.  we told him not to worry that we were relaxing.  he told us that if there was anything he could do to make our meal more enjoyable, we should let him know.  again...so nice...totally unexpected. \n\n in typical fashion, i over ordered.  we had edamame (cold with shaved ginger and sesame seed in maybe sesame oil?)...they were okay, not great.  we also had tempura avocado (i'd never seen that before, and i don't generally like the taste of warm avocado...it wasn't different this time) and zucchini.  and...because i'm a hog and needed 3 appetizers, we ordered the garlic and lime stuffed shrimp, which i was looking forward to most of all.  they were probably the biggest disappointment.  the shrimp tasted like they'd been frozen, and they stuffing was, more than anything, breadcrumbs.  hell, they weren't even stuffed...more like patted on top of the shrimp. \n\n for entrees we ordered the filet (b) and thai seafood stew.  b thought his filet, was good...not as good as at delmonico, but still good.  it was served with <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> (one of the better things served).  the seafood stew had a generous portion of seafood:  crab claws, <mark>Shrimp</mark>, clams, lobster, and squid.  the broth was okay, flavored with cilantro and thai basil.  it was a clear broth, though, which wasn't what i was expecting.  due to the order ordering at the beginning of meal, there wasn't room for dessert.\n\noverall, 4 stars for great service, 3 for food.",

($55 mil, that's $16 mil more than no.2). they must be doing something right.\n\ntao's service was surprisingly great although we arrived 8-ish without reservation. we were seated promptly with courtesy. our server was super nice and informative, as he explained every single dishes we've ordered as they arrived at our table.\n\ninterior deco was as usual. check it out for yourself on their website. \n\nsome of the dishes we've tried:\n\nsmall plate: thai stuffed shrimp with garlic, lime, and thai chili sauce \nsmall plate: <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok roasted asparagus\n<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura of <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>\nchef's roll\ndesert: chocolate zen parfait\n\nthe food was all excellent, but this place is really more about the vibe and the people-watching. tao is a popular destination for private parties among celebrities. the bill came out to be around $130, including a couple of drinks. not bad for a fun dinner in vegas.\n\ni would definitely visit there again next time i go to vegas.", 
            "i've been planning my birthday for the past 2 months and tao restaurant was my destination.  reservations were for friday night 8:45pm. note: your required to confirm the day of the reservation before noon.  checked in with the matre' d was pleased to be escorted directly to our table.  it was already crowded with people at the lounge having drink while waiting for their own table?? there was 3 of us for dinner-2 guys and myself.  we were lead toward the back and seated at a table close to the sushi bar. before you read any further this review is truly dedicated the service and to our waiter vs. the food.  in celebration of my birthday we ordered a bottle of the yellow label and voss sparkling water. after reviewing the menu, i asked the waiter what recommendations he had, and even though we ended up not getting anything that was mentioned, i thought it was great that he had extensive knowledge about the food.  we ordered:  <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with grilled asparas, wasabe <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>, duck friend rice,noodles and short-ribs.  the food honestly was mediocre for the price that you are paying.  there are so much more comparable quality food here in sf  that don't cost and arm and a leg.  needless to say i wasn't too disappointed as my expectations weren't that high, and i was paying to be part of the scene.  now kudos for the service, the waiter was extremely courteous, came at the right times to offer service,and always made sure that glasses were always filled.  i'm a lightweight and only drank a glass of champagne, i thought it was wonderful  that he was so observant and only filled up my companions glasses and only towards the end of dinner did he offer me more.  and lastly because there was a male to female ratio at the clubs, even with a $300 dollar dinner i still wouldn't have been able to get in, he worked the magic and got all 3 of us line passes for the club because it was my birthday.  above and beyond.  \nin summary: tao restaurant is a place to see and be seen, just don't have too hight expectations about the food.  especially for those of you who live here in sf.", 
            "i sort of felt like i was supposed to pay admission to get in.  tao is more of an experience rather than just a restaurant.  i enjoyed everything i ordered. from the <mark>Sweet Potato</mark>, to the <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>, to the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>.  everything was just amazing.  our server was excellent.  he was friendly without being annoying.  i told the server that i was a concierge and that i worked for an elite company (the name of which i can't say here because i'll get fired!!!)  and he brought out a complimentary fortune cookie.  i'm not talking about those little shits you get from the takeout place up the road.  this was a massive, probably 5 pound fortune cookie with one side filled with chocolate mousse and the other filled with white chocolate.  covered in fresh, tropical fruit, it was absolutely stunning to look at and even better to devour.  entering the bathroom, it's sort of hard to tell which one is for you as they are only labeled with \"yin\" and \"yang.\"  which one am i? yin or yang?  omg omg omg.  a brief panic attack hit me as i feared entering the wrong gender bathroom in the hippest restaurant in las vegas.  luckily, some slutty looking chicks went into one of the bathrooms (can't remember if it was yin or yang) and so i went into the opposite one.  inside, a convenience store was waiting.  this is not a joke.  every type of gum, breath mint/spray/strip, and designer cologne you could imagine was just sitting there.  like 10 grand worth of burberry just laying around.   heaven! except there wasn't an overly friendly indian man working in there.  so, not a true convenience store, but i'm confident that tao will complete the theme sometime in the near future.  anyway, tao is even on opentable, so i really can't even find one, single flaw with the whole place.  if you're in vegas, go there!  (if you're hot/cool/trendy/rich enough.... you fucking loser.)", 
            "if i could, i would give this place 3.5 stars.  to start with, we had our reservations at 10:15 but didn't actually get seated until well over 10:30.  the interior decor was very exotic and i loved the big buddha inside.  \n\nthe food: i ordered the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>.  to be honest, i could not taste the wasabi much and the <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> were a bit too dough-y.  the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> was not very flavorful so i don't know if i would order that again.  the other dishes my friends had were delicious, especially the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the <mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark>.  \n\nthe drinks: my friends ordered lychee martinis and they were quite good.  i'm not a fan of sweet drinks but it had the perfect amount of lychee in it. \n\nthe dessert:  get the giant fortune cookie!!! \n\nthe service: it seemed like the waiter only forgot my things.  he forgot my drink... then he forgot the limes for my drink... other than that he was alright.\n\nthe layout:  the tables are very close together so it was annoying to keep bumping into the backs of people's chairs or have the waiters/busboys bump into the chairs.  also it was very loud in the restaurant.  i wouldn't recommend it for parties bigger than 4 because you cannot hear what people are saying. \n\nthe dj:  the guy who was spinning the night we ate there was awesome", 
            "i liked it.  not the best, not the worst.  my friend and i walked in at 8ish on a saturday night with no reservation.  (we'd tried to get one, but were told the earliest possible was 11pm).  the host was great and said he could get us a table in 20 to 30 minutes (yes, we were looking our gorgeous best that night).  turned out to be about 45 minutes, but was happy to wait since we grabbed a seat at the bar, ordered a glass of wine, and snacked on the wasabi-coated edamame, which were so very tasty.  \n\nafter our buzzer went off, we were seated at a perfect little corner table.  would have been perfect for a date, but alas, it was just my girl friend and i.  not that i mind. ninety-nine percent of the time i'd rather be with her than a date, anyway.  beautiful, opulent decor.  our server was very friendly.  recommended a half bottle of wine when we were both ordering a glass, which gave us more bang for the buck.\n\nwe shared the chicken dumplings (fine), the crabcake appetizer special (so, so good), and the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> (tasty and perfectly cooked). \n\noverall, a good experience. plus we got front of the line passes for the club. definitely tops it off nicely.", 
            "i've eaten here twice, on separate trips to vegas, and i've never tried a dish i didn't really like. it's cer<mark>Tai</mark> expensive for what's on the plate, but you're also paying for the ambiance and the exclusivity -- this place is a hot ticket in vegas. last night i sampled the appetizer of steamed chicken potstickers (very tasty) and the fish hot pot main course, which was full of delicious shellfish in a lovely spicy broth that smacked of lemongrass, garlic, chili, etc. sooo good. after finishing off the lobster, clams, <mark>Scallop</mark>, shrimp and calamari that were floating around, i pretty much wanted to drink the bowl dry, the broth was that good. my date had the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, which came with <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> and a few greens. i tried a piece of his steak and it was a really tender, delicious filet. our table was a group of 8 in total, and there was a special occasion to celebrate, so we asked what they could do -- they ended up bringing out a special sampler dessert for the table, replete with sparkler, and even wrote a message on the plate in chocolate sauce, as we'd requested. even the dessert (a giant fortune cookie filled with vanilla and chocolate mousse, a mochi sampler, and ice cream), was really tasty.", 
            "i read that you still had to wait with reservations. i think we waited like 15 minutes past our reservation time.  we were enter<mark>Tai</mark> by some strong cock<mark>Tai</mark> and a wandering saxophonists playing to the house beats the dj was spinning. i tried to avert the saxophonist but homeboy just could not let up.\n\nit is a beautiful restaurant. we were not thinking it would be a quiet romantic dinner. the husband and i did sharesies and had the spicy tuna tartare appetizer which looked like a roll, the rice had a crunch as if they put in on a frying pan...it was good.  memorable was the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>. it had a little kick only wasabi would bring. also memorable the crunchy spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> roll with crushed <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>. the <mark>TAO Lo Mein</mark> with pork- ah okay...but you can get that anywhere i think. the lobster and shrimp dumplings were good.\n\ndrinks were really good.  we enjoyed the people watching and the pulsing beats of the djs. it's vegas so don't expect bible study groups-it's all about the bachelors/bachelorettes and general party people. oh and ask for the stamp so you don't have to wait in the awful line",

            "been here a few times, always a lively and fun atmosphere. the lounge is a nice area to people watch as you wait for your table or if you have no reservation, you can eat there on a first come-first serve basis. we always get a plate of sushi for starters. the <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> is good. had the wasabi crusted filet w/ <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>, decent. the wasabi was a different twist on things, but i think i can do without. also previously had the miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with peking duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> as a side, both were decent as well. service has always been pretty good. \ni would reserve a table a couple of weeks in advance or you'll be dining late. i mean starting dinner at 11:30pm late. \ni've learned when you go to a trendy asian-fusion place the food is going to be mix results. sushi is usually good, but main dish can be a hit or miss. if you're looking at tao then you heard about the nice decor. the vibe is vegas/hollywood glam, seen someone famous every time. if you dine here, you also get a line stamp for the club. you can impress your friends and said you had dinner at the highest grossing restaurant in the country, which tao is. the place is more about the scene than the food. but worth checking out once to see what the fuss is all about.", 
            "my experience with tao's restaurant started before we even sat down to eat! i actually set up a reservation for a party of 11 with maria - the res manager a week before we were in town. she just had me fill out a very simple cc auth and we were good to go. \n\ngetting to the hostess stand can be a little bit of a journey as by the time you are getting in for dinner, people are already lined up to get into the club. once you make it to the bathtubs (best part of tao hands down) you are golden! \n\nand on to the food... \n\nstarted the meal with pork or chicken (sorry, i forget) gyoza. it was good but cmon baby, gyoza is gyoza. we also had the <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> with crunchy cucumber salad. both were so light and refreshing. \n\nmy entree was a wassabi crusted fillet with <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> and a side of <mark>Sake Braised Shiitake Mushrooms</mark>. the mushrooms were so tastey and perfectly tender. i had when shiitake's get mushy. the fillet came out a true medium rare and the wassabi crust set it over the top. my spoiled ass even found a cab from napa on the wine list. **side note - don't you have being out of california and seeing whack wines on the menu?** \n\ntoo bad i didn't leave room for that giant fortune cookie i keep hearing about. \n\nafter dinner you can also get a stamp that can get you another stamp that gets you into the club for free!", 
            "we dined as a group of 10 on a saturday evening. highly recommend for a group dinner, as it provides funky and hip ambiance and decor and excellent food and service. as previous reviewers note, it's on the expensive side, but tao is not the place to go for a quick and cheap bite in vegas.\n\ni ordered the tuna tartare with peppercorn sauce - one of their signature dishes. it was perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. their wine/sake list provided lots of formidable pairings (i chose a sauvignon blanc). several others in our party had the wasabi-en<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, but frankly it wasn't that impressive. it was served with tier of fried <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> and lacked anything memorable in terms of taste, although it was cooked perfectly.\n\na significant bonus of dining at the tao is that you get a line pass stamp for the nightclub, although the process of getting into the club was not quite as seamless as we expected.

            "if i was rating just the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, it would be a 4 star easily!  it was the rest of the items that pulled the review down slightly, as was the bang/buck ratio.\n\nthe <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> ($40) with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>. this was great! a little fatty which i loved, perfectly cooked, and the crust was very flavorful but not overpowering. a good deal considering the prices of the other dishes! go with the steak!!\n\nmandarin sizzled <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with peking duck ($15). this was good! it had lots of flavor, and a slightly larger portion than i was expecting...but still a little spendy overall.\n\n<mark>Lacquered Roast Pork</mark> ($13). this was a little chewy and the sauce was pretty thick. can't touch the cheaper versions in chinatown!  pass\n\nand to finish, the dessert platter. this thing was huge!! enough food for the 10+ of us! we said our dinner here was for an anniversary, so this monster was gratis! there were some goodies there...nothing amazing, but all were good! \n\nso again, if you come here...go with the steaks!  i wasn't impressed with the rest of the meal personally.\n\npics :", 
            "what an experience this evening was for me and my colleagues! i wanted to go to this restaurant because quite honestly it is always in the gossip magazines as the celebrity hangout. i had stopped by last year for a glass of wine but had never gone for dinner until last week.\nthe entrance is absolutely gorgeous with two rows of what looks like baths filled with roses. it has a low light vibe to it and a gigantic buddha that stands from ceiling to floor in the center of the restaurant. ambiance is fabulous. bring a light so that you can read the menu though! \nour server was lawrence who was an absolute delight from beginning to end. great humor and a lot of fun. i recognized him from an unfortunate episode on the kardashian's reality show. lovely lovely guy. \nwe started our meals with an array of delicious appetizers. the standout was the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>. my friend and i practically licked the bottom of the bowl. unbelievable. \ntwo of my friends ordered the steak which they both loved. the steaks came with three huge and gorgeous <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>. great presentation. my other friend ordered the sushi which was a hit as well. the entrees didn't hold as much interest to me as the appetizers so i \"settled\" on the coconut fried shrimp with spicy thai peanut sauce. i asked if i could get it not fried but told i couldn't. i think it is because of the volume of guests they have each night. disappointing as i would have been perfect if not fried. i was only able to eat two of them before it was just too much. i felt such a waste to leave all that food. the portions are very generous. \nwe finished the evening by sharing an order of the sugar coated doughnuts that came with vanilla and dark chocolate sauces and a caramel one as well. my one friend would not stop talking about them so even though we were full we had to at least try them. again we licked the bottom of the plate!! what a fabulous way to end the meal.\nthe food and the ambiance were both outstanding. to top it off though was the service. everyone we interacted with was just so friendly and professional. special shout out again to lawrence our server. i did stop dave (another server) at one point and he graciously took care of getting some sauces for me for the shrimp - at no charge and with a smile. i found the fact that the service to be so good of somewhat of a surprise. this is basically a tourist place and so i wouldn't have great expectations for the service and the fact it was exceptional makes this place even more special.", 
            "great ambiance. i had the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, cooked rare of course, and was amazing. came with 3 lightly fried <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>.", 
            "this was my first visit here, for my birthday, definitely felt like a celebrity, seeing as though all the celebrities do eat here.  my girls made reservations for us, they did so good.  we were a tad bit late, but the hostess was nice enough to seat us within a good 15 minutes.  that was really sweet of her, because the place was packed, and i'm sure that's nothing new.\n\nonce we were seated, our waiter, i hate that i forgot his name, greeted all of the ladies with a smile, told us all about the specials, what's popular, all that good stuff to help us decide.  the restaurant was very dim, very dark, very sexy.  honestly, it was a little too dark, made it very difficult to read the menu, but that was nothing big to complain about.  because it was a group of girls, we all made the executive decision to order 3 or 4 appetizers, 3 or 4 dinner entrees, make it like family style.  pass everything around the table, everyone gets to taste everything.  now, i don't know if i got my hopes too high up for tao, but the overall meal, it was...good. not great, but good.  i wasn't disappointed, but i guess i was expecting out-of-this world cuisine.  \n\nhonestly, the best things, were the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> and the <mark>Pork Potstickers</mark>.  full of flavor, full of filling, the mango chili sauce on the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> was really good, so was the chili sesame glaze on the potstickers.  that was my favorite.  now, the entrees, it's not like they were bad, but i wasn't blown away.  if i had to pick one of my favorites, it would have to be the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>.  cooked perfectly, tender, flavor was awesome and the tower of <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> were a great match. a fun match.  i ordered the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, which melted in my mouth like butter, tender and flaky, but the seasoning was a little off.  it's like there wasn't enough.  but the quality was top notch.\n\nit was so sweet that they did bring me this giant fortune cookie, with a giant fortune on the inside, filled with sweet, smooth, velvety vanilla and chocolate mouse.  i mean it was so good and the cookie was just the cutest and so delicious.  the fresh fruit with the chocolate, i mean it was literally a sweet ending.\n\noverall, i would definitely recommend tao, it is definitely the place to be, always jumpin', always poppin' and it's really just a pretty cool place!"

(usually i would have to look back at the menu to remember what we ordered, but it all made a lasting impression in this case).  we literally cleaned all of the plates - everything was great, and quick too!\n\nluckily, even with all of that food, we saved room for dessert.  chris brought out a beautiful birthday cake for the birthday girl and boy (my bro and sis are twins).  i'm talking really quality, beautiful gourmet cake (like aj's in az).  it had \"happy birthday a & z\" written on it in chocolate and it was a vanilla layer cake of sorts.  \n\ni didn't pay the bill, and i'm sure it was expensive, but this was by far the best meal we had on the trip, and i'm sure it was worth it!  the only reason i'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the wait we had upon arrival - other than that, tao was amazing!  beautiful ambiance too - i'll have to go back next time to check out the nightclub!", 
            "the girls and i decided to dine here on saturday night at 5:15pm.  yes, we dined that early.  i called to reserve a table for nine a couple of days before we dined, so we got a choice of the 5:15pm or 10:45pm seating.  since we had to get back to our rooms at wynn to get ready for clubbing at xs, we opted for the 5:15pm seating.   i loved the asian d\\u00e9cor...muted lighting makes the restaurant appear like an elegant lounge.  our round table was good for eating family style...and was located right in front of the huge buddha statue.  \n\ndishes my friends and i tried and their star ratings (with 5 stars being the best):\n\n* edamame (4 stars / $7) - edamame is edamame...what else can i say?\n    \n* <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> (4 stars / $16) - i didn't get a chance to taste this, but my friends loved it.  \n\n* miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables (5 stars / $34) - i loved this dish.  so tasty...the fish was so flaky and tender.  \n\n* <mark>Spicy Hoi Yin Eggplant</mark> (4 stars / $9) - i kept hearing raves from my friends about this eggplant dish.    \n\n* mandarin sizzled <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with peking duck (4 stars / $14) - my friends loved this dish, but i thought it was just ok...it could have done with more peking duck.  as it was, the duck slices were too thin and too few.    \n\n* <mark><mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> Noodles</mark> with shrimp (4 stars / $22) - again, my friends raved about this dish, but i found it to be so-so.  i'm picky about thai dishes, so i expect more.  i have to say i was surprised by the large serving of <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> since other dishes we ordered came in small servings. \n\n* giant fortune cookie (4 stars / $10) - this fortune cooked is filled with white & dark chocolate mousse.  so pretty to look at...and the filing provided a nice taste and texture to a regular fortune cookie.  our server also provided nine separate fortunes with our cookie, so that was a nice touch.  \n\n* chocolate raspberry wontons (4 stars / $9) - the crisp wontons filled with raspberry filing tasted wonderful with the vanilla bean ice cream.  \n\nthe wine list had a lot of good options, but we stayed away from alcohol during dinner as we were saving our drinking for our bottle service at xs the same night.  overall, tao has great ambiance, good food and great service.  our server is one of the best i have ever encountered in my years of dining.  he was very patient with our group and answered our questions with a smile.  i would definitely dine here again.", 
            "after jersey boys, we needed a light dinner. tao delivered in a big way. we were blown away by the decor. candles, lighting, glass, wood, tile, sculptures... a very cool place. \n\nwe started with a sake sampler. the waitress really took good care of us with her suggestions.  the three <mark>Sake</mark> were delicious all in their own way.  lobster wonton in a yummy broth with mushrooms and onion came first. unbelievable. just delicious. next came a <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a miso glaze, <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with duck, and <mark>Spicy Hoi Yin Eggplant</mark>. the <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was so so but the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and eggplant dishes were amazing.  we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  \nthis was every bit as good as nobu but in a better, warmer atmosphere.", 
            "i always have to get my tao fix every time i go to vegas.  best asian cuisine on the strip.  the food is always great and presentations creative. haven't had a dish that i didn't like.  the wait staff is very professional, very knowledgeable from apps to dessert, cock<mark>Tai</mark> to the wine list.  the evening that we were there, they offered a 3 course pre-pix menu for $55/person, with quite a few selections for each course.  the portions were plenty and the taste even more outstanding.  what we did was to get everything on the menu so we can share all the dishes.\n\ncock<mark>Tai</mark>:\ntao-hito, tao's version of the classic mojito with bacardi limon rum\nlychee martini, belvedere, triple sec and fresh lychee puree \nmango tamarind martini, finlandia mango vodka, cranberry juice and tamarind\norient express, stolichnaya vanilla vodka, kahlua and chilled espresso\n\nwines:  \nshiraz, hope estates 2007, hunter valley, australia\n\nappetizers:\n<mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> with peanut sauce - chicken cooked just right.  peanut sauce so tasty.\n\n<mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> cakes - tartare just seasoned perfectly.  i could have had two of these... that good!\n\ncrispy thai shrimp with spicy pineapple sauce - <mark>Shrimp</mark> were huge!  spice just right.\n\nentrees:\n<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura of <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> - wasabi crust not too overwhelming as wasabi can be.  filet cooked at medium with just the right pink to the meat.\n\n<mark><mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> Noodles</mark> - best <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> ever....\n\nsoy ginger <mark>Glazed Salmon</mark> with udon noodles and spinach - salmon cooked medium, noodles flavorful. \n\nside dishes:  \n<mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>\n<mark>Spicy Hoi Yin Eggplant</mark>\n\ndesserts:\nchocolate <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> w/kalamansi dipping sauce - omg delish!!!\n\ncrispy fuji apple blossoms serviced with tahitian vanilla bean ice cream - omg delish!!!\nassorted ice creams and sorbets with almond sesame cookies - omg delish!!!\n\n\noverall experience:\nfood:  made sure you bring a big appetite.  the dishes don't skip on portion control.\n\nservice:  outstanding.\n\nd\\u00e9cor:  very asian with a zen like feel.  bring you camera for some great photo opts.  you know us asian just love to take pictures!\n\nprice:  can be pricey, but wouldn't you just want to dine at a place with a zen like atmosphere and enjoy your food with calm....\n\nafter dinner, the restaurant turns into a nightclub, so enjoy the rest of your evening drinking and dancing.  what a way to end the evening!\n\nhighly recommend!\n\nenjoy!"

            "decor is great and the service was nice overall, especially considering it was a nightlife venue. the food was nothing spectacular, but in defense of the restaurant i thought my group ordered poorly. got <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark>, <mark>TAO Angry Dragon Roll</mark> , <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> Noodles</mark>, and a bunch of drinks. i ordered a round of drink for some friends at another table, but one got drunk and they all left, so we have to drink them. i drank so much, i forgot to order the large fortune cookie for dessert. the drinks were ok to good. we got the mango tamarind martini, xi gua tini, lychee martini, tao love potion #9, tao-tini, and some patron. og, the miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (appetizer or entree) was great. miso fish usually is.", 
            "when planning my trip to vegas, this was one place i had heard a lot about and thought i needed to try.  so, we booked reservations a week in advance through open table. \n\ni knew the place was trendy, and in my experience, trendy means pretentious and disappointing.  my first impression, by the automated response i received from open table was not great.  the message they send back asks that you please call the restaurant the day of the reservation to confirm.  isn't that their job???  i was kind of offended.  \n\nanyway, i called to confirm and they were abrupt on the phone.  we got to the restaurant and had to wait in line to check in for our reservation.         once at the stand, i was given a buzzer and told that i needed to wait.  so, we waited 10 minutes.  there's good people-watching, but i'd rather be seated right away then wait when i have a reservation.  \n\nwhen the buzzer went off, we went back up to the desk and this time the man was overly kind, as many people in vegas had been.  he thanked us profusely for waiting, told us that he really hoped we enjoyed our night, and the rest of our stay.  we were escorted to the perfect table on the second level over-looking the 3-story asian figure sitting on a koi pond in front of a wall of candles.  it was gorgeous.  the waitress was really sweet and about 10 minutes in, we were seated with out menus closed and a manager came up and asked us if we were waiting on the waitress of if she was waiting on us.  we told him not to worry that we were relaxing.  he told us that if there was anything he could do to make our meal more enjoyable, we should let him know.  again...so nice...totally unexpected. \n\n in typical fashion, i over ordered.  we had edamame (cold with shaved ginger and sesame seed in maybe sesame oil?)...they were okay, not great.  we also had tempura avocado (i'd never seen that before, and i don't generally like the taste of warm avocado...it wasn't different this time) and zucchini.  and...because i'm a hog and needed 3 appetizers, we ordered the garlic and lime stuffed shrimp, which i was looking forward to most of all.  they were probably the biggest disappointment.  the shrimp tasted like they'd been frozen, and they stuffing was, more than anything, breadcrumbs.  hell, they weren't even stuffed...more like patted on top of the shrimp. \n\n for entrees we ordered the filet (b) and thai seafood stew.  b thought his filet, was good...not as good as at delmonico, but still good.  it was served with <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> (one of the better things served).  the seafood stew had a generous portion of seafood:  crab claws, <mark>Shrimp</mark>, clams, lobster, and squid.  the broth was okay, flavored with cilantro and thai basil.  it was a clear broth, though, which wasn't what i was expecting.  due to the order ordering at the beginning of meal, there wasn't room for dessert.\n\noverall, 4 stars for great service, 3 for food.", 
            "it's probably no coincidence that i scheduled my afternoon full body massage at canyon ranch spa on the day that i was eating dinner at tao. sound body followed by a sound appetite makes scott a happy boy (an old buddhist proverb).\n\ni already knew what to expect from the tao experience, and it was a welcomed seductive relief from the venetian's baroque architectural jitters that hit me between the massage and dinner. feeling relaxed like gumby and dressed in my favorite black d&g suit, i rolled into our private party at tao with a few people on my staff...we were greeted by a friendly and attentive wait staff holding trays of <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>, ginger-chicken ravioli, and chicken ginger dumplings...i was stuffed before the main event.\n\nsince we had a large party, we did tao buffet style. here is the beef & reef sampling that i picked up along the line:\n\n- a piece of miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (delighted my taste buds. superb.)\n- a slice of wasabi-<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> (tender. vibrant. absolutely delicious.)\n- chicken in hoisin sauce (just okay. i've had better at saigon grill here in manhattan)\n- <mark><mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> Noodles</mark> (mildly nutty. tender noodles. the sweet & spicy flavor wasn't balanced enough for me...hey, i'm a <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> snob.)\n\nthe best part was the dessert. nothing is sweeter than watching the \"wtf?\" looks on the faces of people waiting to get into the nightclub as 150 of us are given priority access. oh well, sometimes membership does have its privileges. the rest of my evening is well-documented and sealed inside the vegas city limits ;-)", 
            "tao had a very nice ambience to the place.  i love the koi pond below the big budda statue. \nthe sashimi <mark>Spicy Shrimp, King Crab, and Asparagus Roll</mark> and mojitos were good, but don't eat the duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>. or order the watermelon cock<mark>Tai</mark>. those two were very poor choices. \nthe waitress was kind enough to take back the watermelon cock<mark>Tai</mark> with no charge. \nthe bathrooms were nice, but confusing if you dont know what yin and yang stands for. just take your chances. ;) \nwill probably give it one more chance ...", 
            "food: i heard so many great things about tao so i had high expectations for the food. i ended up ordering the mongolian scallion chicken which was very tasty. i wish portions were a little bigger though. i also tried the squab <mark>Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups</mark> which i loved! they have a nice selection on their menu and also daily specials.\n\nprice: prices here are expensive. my dish was about $27 or so and my appetizer was around $15, i think. you're really paying for the atmosphere.\n\nservice: service is outstanding here. we dined here early but there were plenty of waiters taking care of us. they were all polite, well mannered and very on top of their stuff.\nalso you can make reservations on opentable.com but if you are planning on dining on a friday or saturday night...make them at least a month or so in advance!\n\natmosphere: i loved it. we dined ups<mark>Tai</mark>. considering that we were here for an early dinner, it wasn't loud or anything. very relaxing actually. i would love to see the night club next time. the entrance here is also beautiful. there are rose petal baths! i would love to come here to celebrate a birthday or something.\n\nlocation: located right in the venetian near the exit of the venetian canal shops.", 
            "3.5 stars. i ordered the peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> as my appetizer and fried red snapper as my main course (snapper was the stand out). this restaurant is massive! a friend of mine at dinner exclaimed that this place looked exactly like pf changs (they're like an americanize chinese food place with nicer decor and an american wait-staff). it was a replica of that place, just this one was the super-walmart of pf changs'. \n\nthe <mark>Peking Duck <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> tasted like they were from a pre-packaged roll set they also lack a sizable amount of hoisin dipping sauce which i was looking forward to. i was underwhelmed since they were $14. the red snapper was actually good, i enjoyed and recommend it.\n\nthe music was pretty loud in the place, so i wouldn't bring my family here for a quiet meal.\n\noverall, decent, not memorial except for the semi-naked girls in the bathtubs as we left the restaurant. this is vegas, what do you expect?", 
            "the food was fantastic, and i highly recommend the chef's tasting sampler. the highlights were the <mark>Peking Duck <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark>, <mark>Kobe Beef</mark>, citrus japanese snapper and the dumplings. for drinks, i had the tao-hito, which unfortunately just tasted watered down. also, the decor is well done, as has been mentioned before, the 30-foot buddha wall is sweet. the service was great once the food started coming, but previous to that it was slow and it took some time to get our drinks. lastly, if you go with a group, you may want to limit it to six people only because we had to cram in eight sizable guys around a table designed for six. there were other tables which would've worked, but the majority seemed setup for six.", 
            "i've done 22 reviews so far, and have not yet given a 5-star.  in thinking about the best experience that i've had in a restaurant recently, i'd have to say tao in las vegas.  the combination of the tasty foods, fun decor, and excellent service makes tao las vegas deserving of my first 5-star rating!  of course, the vegas excitement adds to the total experience.\n\nthis isn't one of yelpers' favorite joints to dine at in vegas based on the ratings, so i'll share a couple of tips of what i've done and hopefully that'll be helpful to you folks out there:\n\n- <mark>Maki</mark> reservations here is a must!  without reservations, this place is impossible to get into, unless you know people, or do the ol' slipping a bill into the handshake action.  (if you do, try $20 or higher)\n\n- come with friends that are ready to party, because this is a party joint!  meet at the bar, so that if you have folks coming in from different hotels, you can enjoy the drinks while you wait.\n\n- once you're seated, order sharable appetizers, like the edamame, <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark>, or  thai stuffed <mark>Shrimp</mark>.\n\n- if you like sake, they have a pretty good selection of <mark>Sake</mark>.  if you haven't tried the nigori sake (unfiltered), i'd suggest at least trying that.  the best way is to ask the server to give you the rundown.we had the voice in the mist bottle and it was yummy!\n\n- for your entree, you must get miso-glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>!!  it's my favorite fish entree in the world!  savory white flaky tender bits of tasty fish... oh my.  it definitely melts in your mouth yet creates a flavor explosion.  so good!  my friend likes the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, but i think it's not nearly as good as the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.\n\ni've been to tao now for 3 years.  i've had a great experience every single time.  i now cannot imagine going to vegas without my <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> experience at tao.", 
            "tao is a chic, dim lit asian place at the venetian. the entrance is lined up with empty bathubs filled with water and flowers. when you walk in and pass the lounge into the restaurant, a large buddha statue welcomes you into this beautiful restaurant. i went here before catching a show & loved my food!\ni ordered:\nappetizer- veggie dumplings (sauteed ginger & sesame seeds)\nentree- sushi--spicy tuna, salmon, & <mark>Spicy Shrimp, King Crab, and Asparagus Roll</mark>. (it was amazing) \ndessert- white choc/raspberry fried wontons w/ icecream\n\n*warning*- no free refills. 4 bucks for a glass of sprite filled with ice? eh. anyhow, the ambiance is trendy, the service was quick, the food was delicious & overall..was a great first night out during my vegas trip this past weekend!\n\nmake sure you have reservations well in advance!", 
            "we had a short weekend trip to vegas and decided to check out tao since we were staying at the venetian.  it was our first time going into tao (we later also went to the nightclub), and we found the decor and ambiance to fitting, comfortable, and well-thought.  the four of us kept commenting on the buddha floating over the koi pond, the wall of candles, and the giant portraits that were hanging near our tables.  fortunately, our luck didn't just run out there.\n\nwe ordered two appetizers and four main course dishes and were pleasantly surprised with the quality and the quantity.  the <mark>Scallop</mark> were amazingly tasty, and the <mark>Peking Duck <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> were beyond my expectations.  our entrees were <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>, a red curry chicken, a <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and salmon over udon noodles.  all dishes were exceptionally prepared and the thai dishes were better than you'd find at most specialty thai restaurants.  impressive.  five stars would be awarded if our server had been more attentive and perhaps if the price were just a smidge lower.  dinner ended up running a little long and we were antsy to get over to our cirque du soleil show.\n\nat the end of the meal, we left as a happy group and were extremely glad we stopped in.  i'll definitely be <mark>Maki</mark> another reservation the next time i'm in town.  \n\nbonus: the other perk of eating there for dinner was that we were able to get stamps to return later in the evening for their must-see club experience.  the stamps saved us from a huge wait in line and also got us in without a cover charge.", 
            "so since my cousins and i were on a budget, we decided to all share our orders.  we ordered <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>, shrimp tempura and some <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark>.  \n\nthe <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> wasn't anything extraordinary.  i personally like the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> that i've had at san jose with many ingredients.  tao totally skimped out on us..which brings me to the shrimp tempura. so, when we ordered the shrimp which was $8, we expected there to be at least enough shrimp for the eight of us. however, when the waiter brought out our order, it consisted of two <mark>Shrimp</mark> on a tiny platter. they weren't even prawns, they were those small tiger <mark>Shrimp</mark> that you can buy in bulk at your local asian store for $8 a pack! ridiculous! we expected at least four pieces of good sized shrimp but for a tiny cock<mark>Tai</mark> shrimp?? no, that was a waste of our 8 bucks.  lastly, my favorite has to be the <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark>. maybe i was overcome with hunger but they tasted really good.", 
            "let me start off by saying that i absolutely love tao! the decor is amazing, the staff is very friendly & helpful, and the food is delicious. and if that's not enough for you, inform your waiter that you plan on going to the club after dinner and they will give you a stamp that will get you in for free (both males & females) and let you skip the line. you can't beat that! \n\nwe visited tao (restaurant) on 4/1/10. we made same day reservations and they were able to accommodate us. i had the \"<mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark> with thai peanut sauce\" and my date had the \"soy ginger <mark>Glazed Salmon</mark> with udon noodles and spinach.\" both dishes were great - cooked perfectly, even to the toughest food critic's standards. however, i think the best part of the meal came at the end. like any other asian restaurant, they give you a free fortune cookie with your bill. but these are not your standard boring fortune cookies. the fortunes inside are a little more <mark>Uni</mark> than most. mine said \"you will receive a spanking in your near future\" and they bear the tao logo on the corner. definitely made us laugh at the end of a really great meal. \n\non the down side, prices are a little high here, but that is expected from any nice restaurant in las vegas. don't let this deter you - this place is worth the splurge! i highly recommend tao - i know i will make time for tao every time i go to vegas!", 
            "the only thing i really liked about this place were the drinks and the atmosphere. it's a see-and-be-seen kinda place which i knew to expect. three of us waited 1 hour on a monday night to eat here, which wasn't really a problem since we sat at the bar for that hour, but it was also 10 pm!! we made friends with the bartender who was a really cool, down to earth girl who shared stories of celeb sightings and poured plenty of alcohol in our drinks to make them worth $15 (she also told us about the bizarre rules that tao had for their staff, only to be expected at a hot vegas spot). by the time we got seated it was clear that our waitress was either exhausted or could not handle the amount of tables she had because frankly - she sucked. she forgot drinks, forgot to put in orders, took 20 minutes to bring over the check, and wasn't even friendly or apologetic. i sampled a few things - the duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> which were ok, the <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark> which were decent but nothing to write home about, and some sushi <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark> which was again - just ok. anything else we had was not memorable. like i said at the beginning, the drinks were fabulous but obviously pricey - hey it is vegas! but i could've drank the \"geisha girl\" martini all night. i definitely won't be back there to eat but would consider going for a few cock<mark>Tai</mark> or hitting the nightclub.", 
            "i love everything about this place!  it's a restaurant/night club at the venetian.  when we called for reservations, the frist available time was at 11:15 pm. one of my male friends said that he and his friends had a difficult time getting in the last time they were in vegas.   \n\nwe got there and we had to wait a few minutes at the lounge for our table.  people were already partying and they got us free drinks, yes!\n\nthis place is very trendy, very hip.  the decor and lighting was perfect and  there were at least 2 giant buddhas that i saw.  it was a very nice touch, added to the elegance of the place.\n\nthe one thing we did not like is that it's hard to talk to everyone at the table during the meal.  loud music was busting from the night club.  if you are looking to get that intimate conversation going on, this is not a good place.  but then,  that gave us time to just enjoy our great meal.\n\nwe had ordered:\n<mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>\npork <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with thai chili sauce\nblack pepper sizzled <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with udon noodles\n<mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>\nmandarin sizzled <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with <mark>Lacquered Roast Pork</mark>\n<mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>\nchai kiss\nchocolate lave for dessert\n\ni won't even try to describe each of them.  everything on our table was oh so good.  there was nothing that we didn't like.  we also ordered cock<mark>Tai</mark> and they were refreshing.  all was good good good.\n\nafter dinner, we hit the club.  we liked the kind of music they were playing.  the dance floor was great.  it was packed and crowded. \n\nwe just had a good time here.  this is definitely a must go restaurant/nightclub in vegas.", 
            "weak. i would say to go here only if you want to skip the line and get into tao nightclub.\n\nto get in you'll need to order one of their entree dishes or two sushi rolls. i got some sushi that i can't remember. i think it was the angry dragon and a spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark> with asparagus. both were just okay. some of my buddies got the black pepper <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with udon noodles. how would i describe it? salty! it was like they poured in some soy sauce and decided to leave the bottle titled while they cook the food. that dish was dissapointing. maybe we got some bad dishes, but gotta be more consistent than this!\n\nservice was pretty good, but the food was meh. go here if you want entry into the club. i wouldn't recommend it otherwise.", 
            "the best asian fusian food i've ever had. our group had the <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark>, <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>, sushi, chicken ... it was all fantastic! the service was even better. i will gladly return!", 
            "so disappointed in this place! i've been going to vegas for some time now and i've always wanted to try this place. we sat at the sushi bar area since there was a wait. our waiter was nice and attentive. we ordered pot stickers, not a bad choice. then we got kung pao chicken and <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>. eh, the chicken was bad and i did not enjoy that dish at all. the shrimp was dry but it had a good flavor. they were big shrimp too.\n\nthe drinks were amazing but i went for the food. at the end of dinner we got a pass stamp for tao night club. we didn't go.  honestly, if i had to chose between tao and pf changs, pf would win.", 
            "where to begin... birthday dinner treat from the best friend. and what a treat it really was! started off with a mix of shrimp and vegetable tempura, moved on to chicken <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> and this delicious prawn <mark>Shrimp</mark> encrusted with coconut breading. sipped on their specialty martini. sweet and yummy! and their delicious hot green peach tea! for dessert the giant fortune cookie was beautiful... a giant fortune cookie dipped with white and milk chocolate with fresh fruits (berries, lychee, banana, etc). once u run out of chocolate and fruits, the cookie alone is kinda blahh. but i loved it, i mean atmosphere and service alone won me over.",

            "cool, trendy, delicious.\n\nquick tips:\n\n1.  stick to small plates and starters.  most creative.\n\n2.  skip the nigiri sushi.  expensive and not spectacular.\n\n3.  lots of spicy, hot flavors from chili and wasabi.  this is drinking food.\n\nif you must have sushi, top props to the <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> with black tobiko, <mark>King Crab California Roll</mark> (made with real king crab), and the <mark>Crispy Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll served with a yuzu mayonnaise.  all are familiar just made with top quality ingredients and a good flavor twist that makes you long for a second bite.\n\nsmall plate standouts include an unexpectedly good grilled <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> served with a satay sauce. never thought what is essentially peanut butter would go so well with fish.  the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> with mango chili sauce while not purely crab meat just pairs so well with the sauce.  well balanced.  the spicy tuna tartar <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> crackers, a great twist on the classic.  outstanding.  bold flavor, cool tuna, <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> cracker.  so much contrast make for a delicious bite of food.  finally the  <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> sashimi with fresh wasabi; yum.\n\ndo not pass on the peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with hoisin sauce or the lobster and shrimp <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with spicy pineapple sauce.  big bold flavors.  textual contrast at its best.\n\nfinally, if you never had avocado tempura try it.  the warm avocado has the creamy texture of uni.  very different.  very good.\n\nnote:  dining at tao should be social so bring a group of friends.  the food is meant to be shared.  \n\nspecial note:  for the guys, dining at tao does not give you any special vip privileges to enter the tao nightclub later in the evening.  ladies, work the magic.\n\n\nrecommended.", 
            "i went to tao for the 2nd time tonight for dinner.  the last time i went i had some sort of a groupon or something, and tonight my friend had a gift card she was given as a gift.  i think that's the only way i would dine here.  i think the food is overpriced, and if you're going to spend this much on a meal, there's other places in town i'd rather go.  maybe it's just me.\n\nwe started with two appetizers... the spicy tune <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> and the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>.  we had the tartare last time and really enjoyed it.  we enjoyed it again this time, but it wasn't as magical as it was last time.  the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>... well, they tasted like the best wontons i've ever eaten, but i could barely taste the lobster.  the flavor was drowned out from the broth, i thought.\n\nfor a main course, we split the most expensive omakase sushi menu, which was like $58.  very underwhelming how little food we got: one roll, 7 pieces of nigiri, and 6 slices <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark>.  granted, one of the nigiri was toro, and the roll was a <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> of some sort, but for $58, i'd expect a little more.  throw some salmon nigiri in there!\n\nwe also split the coconut crusted shrimp with peanut sauce, which was really delicious, though the breading on the shrimp was too thick.  that was made up for in quantity of shrimp, as i think there were like 8 or so large shrimp.  it also came with a side of rice, and some sort of salad in the middle of the plate.\n\nlastly, we tried the avocado tempura since we both love avocado.  very tasty.\n\nwe stuck with water, and when our bill came, it was $140 after tax.  we did have a lot of food, but that seems like way too much to pay for a meal at a place like tao.  the service was top notch, and the ambiance is typical loud music, dark vibe that you'd expect in vegas.  so 4 stars for me.", 
            "came here after being in vegas for a week to be around a fun crowd and enjoy a tasty dinner.  went with the crab <mark>Spicy Shrimp, King Crab, and Asparagus Roll</mark> which was prepared very well and tasted fresh.  sided with some edamame, i can say i left with a full stomach and didn't break the bank.\n\nas for the drinks, the bartenders poured all vodka with a splash of water which was fine with me.  if you're going to be paying vegas prices, you mine as well be getting your money's worth.\n\ndefinitely coming back not just for the scene but for the food as well.",

            "yum!  i had the <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark> and it was delicious.  the dinner prices were not bad, mine was $31.00, and i thought it was well worth it.  everything is a la carte but they do come with rice.  my plate had a large serving and i did not need anything else to go with it.  my hubby also enjoyed his dinner, he got the kung pao chicken ($28).  the drinks on the other hand were ridiculous...$8 for an iced tea and one bottle of sapporo was $12! overall it was very good, and i would definitely go back.", 
            "this is one of my new favorite restaurants in vegas. i can't stop thinking about how good their <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is! if you go here, order this. you will not be disappointed. \n\none thing to keep in mind is that you should probably make reservations. we went here on a monday night at 9:30 p.m. thinking we would get seated right away. apparently not. the hostess looked at us like we were crazy when we said we didn't have reservations. the wait ended up being an hour but luckily we were staying at the palazzo so we went back up to the room for some drinks to kill some time. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (amazing), the <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark> and udon noodles. the shrimp was really crispy and the sauce on it was so good. the udon noodles were whatever. i don't really like udon noodles in general so i can't really give an honest opinion.\n\nwe tried their sake sampler but i realized that i'm not a sake fan. it's too strong. their mixed drinks are pretty good though. \n\nsince we came here on a monday, the club was closed. i'd imagine that when the club is open it could get pretty loud. there was music playing but i don't remember it being overbearing. \n\nif you're looking for some where to eat in vegas i'd recommend this place for sure.", 
            "omg amazing!  we went as a group of 9 people.  we all ordered drinks and the waitress was really helpful in helping us decide which ones to choose.  for appetizers we had the spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> roll and some scallop/<mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark>, gyoza, and some fried triangle thing.  the sushi rolls and gyoza were my favorite.  the triangle thing was good but it wasn't as good as the other appetizers.  i specifically ordered <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> pot lobster and other seafood.  it was good.  i tried my friends <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and it was delicious.  i only had a piece but it was perfect.  i would definitely recommend it!  the only thing is that it's kinda dark and after a cer<mark>Tai</mark> time the music starts to get clubby.",

            "after eating here a couple time this last experience was lack luster. the beef tarter rolls were so disgusting we didn't even eat more than 2 bites. it was slightly warm, mushy, and the texture made my skin crawl. the signature <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is why i usually like coming to eat here and it's been always great in the past but the combination duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was hard and seemed like it had been sitting out. the fried whole fish was pretty good, i ate everything from the <mark>Tai</mark> to the eyeball and was pretty pleased with it. the <mark>Peking Duck <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> were bland and our <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> were tasteless and chewy which wasn't good at all. during this last dinner at tao we ordered $240.00 worth of food between the 2 of us and was only happy with the snapper, <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. the appetizers were all a disappointment and even our 4 drinks weren't made to our liking. \n although i've had a good experience at tao before, this last one wasn't good at all. not sure if we will return again but who knows what will happen while in vegas right?", 
            "group of 5 ladies, came here on a saturday night during the 4th of july holiday. first of all, the hostess with the blonde hair and orange dress was a total petty bitch and did not want to seat us. had us waiting for over an hour for a table when we saw several open. we would have at least ordered drinks and  appetizers but there was no service in the waiting area. the waiting area was blaring with loud edm music, not at all conducive for dinner or lounge talk and definitely scared us a bit thinking that the club would be the same. meanwhile, troops of people with questionable attractiveness and boldly comfortable physiques would trapes in every few minutes heading over to the nightclub area. we were already on the guestlist for the party but having had good history with their sister company, lavo, we wanted to try the food first,  but in these moments, both the dinner and club scene here were so off putting. the night started off quite weak. once we were seated, after 12, finally the service came pouring in. at least 3 or 4 servers came to our table to excuse the slackness and eager to be of service. nice view of the big buddha statue in the center. food was decent, we enjoyed the pan fried <mark>Chicken Gyoza</mark>, the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> and the <mark>Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups</mark> were ok, we kind of got full off of just appetizers cause again, large portions. my cousins miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> entree was good. strong miso flavor, but if you're cool with that, its good. big portion <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> by someone else. i dont like <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> or peanut tastes so i didnt taste it but she enjoyed. looked big and fresh. i split the shrimp, lobster, scallop in bean sauce entree with someone else because it sounded big and also to cut costs and have more things on the table to taste. was really looking forward to it, it has all of my favorite meaty chewy seafoods. it was shockingly bad, dont know if there was an error made in the sauce recipe, but i have had plenty of similar dishes in the past, never have any been half as bad, and it came highly recommended by the waiter and was amongst the most expensive so we were surprised that it was so bitter. the table tasted and agreed that the sauce had an unpleasant taste. the waiter took it off of our bill gracefully and we left a great tip in exchange. in this moment, the great service that we are accustomed to from lavo, was thankfully shining through here at tao as well. a nice chick came to our table to stamp us and set us up for the complimentary club access. as i said before, we were already on the guestlist so didnt need it, but its nice that they have that additional incentive for dining there, as lavo used to do. will continue nightclub review in other yelp page.", 
            "great atmosphere! my husband and i came here right after we landed in vegas and arrived at our hotel (venetian). our flight was delayed and they were very amenable to delaying our reservation. the ambience is very loungy though the nightclub is ups<mark>Tai</mark> which has a very different feel (you would never know though!). \n\nour food was excellent. my husband got the <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>, i got <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and we shared shrimp <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> they were all very good. but the start of the show surprisingly was the maki roll we ordered for our appetizer, crispy spicy tuna with avocado. we love sushi and this was one of the best sushi experiences we have ever had. we're considering going back for just sushi. it was so fresh and tasty. \n\nlastly, if you eat at tao restaurant, you get free admission into the nightclub which was a little intense for me but worth checking out! overall great experience. would definitely go back on my next visit to vegas.",

            "i am giving tao 4 stars based on my other experiences in las vegas, particularly on the strip.  restaurants there are generally over-priced.  you have to remember that las vegas is far from any port so if you are visiting from a town where they choose their fish daily from the port side fish market and you like seafood, they have a bit of a challenge here.\nwe went with a group of 7. we enjoyed both the bar and the restaurant.  another yelper complained about the glass wine list, i don't mind trying new wines so i actually thought it was a good list.  \nthis is not a place to go for group discussion, you can't hear across the table.  but so long as you have good dinner partners on either side of you, you'll have a great time.  beautiful people watching gets an a+.  the vibe and the atmosphere is definitely fun.\nmost of our party got the miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> which as someone mentioned miso fish (officially called \"saikyo\" preparation in japanese) is always good.  i was very happy with my seafood hotpot that included nice sized <mark>Scallop</mark>, shrimp and chunks of lobster.  \nat the bar they serve complementary wasabi dried peas that are totally addictive.\nwe were at the venetian for a trade show and had a big day following so we didn't take advantage of the vip tickets to the club that they gave us with our dinner.", 
            "so far i have to say that this is my favorite restaurant in las vegas. i haven't had any of the sushi here but bet it is good. i've had <mark>Scallop</mark> that were delicious and the <mark>Miso Soup</mark>. omg!\n\nfirst of all this place gets a 5 for ambiance. the two-story tall buddha statue looks like something i would put in my house if i was a millionare. i love asian decor. i have a much smaller red buddha in my condo as we speak. i love the koi pond and this place is just cool. what can i say. it's not just the place. it literally makes you feel like a cooler person when you walk in here. the food is awesome. nothing on the menu is bad. i've had steak entrees that were great and everything else is just delicious. the miso clam soup is soo good. they put whole clams in the shell into your soup. i don't know who thought this would work but it actually does! delicious. i love tao.", 
            "i've eaten here twice, on separate trips to vegas, and i've never tried a dish i didn't really like. it's cer<mark>Tai</mark> expensive for what's on the plate, but you're also paying for the ambiance and the exclusivity -- this place is a hot ticket in vegas. last night i sampled the appetizer of steamed chicken potstickers (very tasty) and the fish hot pot main course, which was full of delicious shellfish in a lovely spicy broth that smacked of lemongrass, garlic, chili, etc. sooo good. after finishing off the lobster, clams, <mark>Scallop</mark>, shrimp and calamari that were floating around, i pretty much wanted to drink the bowl dry, the broth was that good. my date had the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, which came with <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> and a few greens. i tried a piece of his steak and it was a really tender, delicious filet. our table was a group of 8 in total, and there was a special occasion to celebrate, so we asked what they could do -- they ended up bringing out a special sampler dessert for the table, replete with sparkler, and even wrote a message on the plate in chocolate sauce, as we'd requested. even the dessert (a giant fortune cookie filled with vanilla and chocolate mousse, a mochi sampler, and ice cream), was really tasty.",

            "we had a short weekend trip to vegas and decided to check out tao since we were staying at the venetian.  it was our first time going into tao (we later also went to the nightclub), and we found the decor and ambiance to fitting, comfortable, and well-thought.  the four of us kept commenting on the buddha floating over the koi pond, the wall of candles, and the giant portraits that were hanging near our tables.  fortunately, our luck didn't just run out there.\n\nwe ordered two appetizers and four main course dishes and were pleasantly surprised with the quality and the quantity.  the <mark>Scallop</mark> were amazingly tasty, and the <mark>Peking Duck <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> were beyond my expectations.  our entrees were <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>, a red curry chicken, a <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and salmon over udon noodles.  all dishes were exceptionally prepared and the thai dishes were better than you'd find at most specialty thai restaurants.  impressive.  five stars would be awarded if our server had been more attentive and perhaps if the price were just a smidge lower.  dinner ended up running a little long and we were antsy to get over to our cirque du soleil show.\n\nat the end of the meal, we left as a happy group and were extremely glad we stopped in.  i'll definitely be <mark>Maki</mark> another reservation the next time i'm in town.  \n\nbonus: the other perk of eating there for dinner was that we were able to get stamps to return later in the evening for their must-see club experience.  the stamps saved us from a huge wait in line and also got us in without a cover charge.", 
            "have been here several times & i will come here again & again just for the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables ...it is sooo good!  just melts in your mouth.  thai fish hot pot with lobster, <mark>Scallop</mark>, shrimp, squid and clams also great.  hong kong xo shrimp with <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark> and <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark> is good, but i have had better.  the japanese seaweed salad sampler is okay...i guess i don't like seaweed that much.  martinis also yummy...had a watermelon martini which was refreshing.\n\nservice is fast, great.  decor is great...get a 2nd floor table on the edge for a great view of the giant buddha...hey, there is a koi pond under there!!  (didn't notice my first time here).  \n\nhighly recommend before coming to vegas or when in vegas...call for reservations!  or expect a very long wait, dinner @ 11:30 pm or forget about eating there that night.  this last weekend we were there & settled for an early dinner due to their anniversary celebration & with the with likes of p. diddy there that night...getting in at any other time would have been impossible.  also pricey, but hey it is vegas.", 
            "friday, january 8, 2010\n\nas being my first trip into this restaurant i have to say this: it's packed! reservations were at 9:30 and we arrived about 5 minutes after 9 and still weren't seated until 9:45. all i was thinking was: the food better be outstanding. and it was very very very good. \n\nappetizers: lobster <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> & wontons\n\nmain dishes: spicey whole lobster & lobster, prawns & <mark>Scallop</mark> in a black bean sauce.",

            "my bf and i had dinner here one of the nights of our vegas stay. we were seated immediately. the decor was beautiful. i love the large buddha statue in the restaurant. the music was super loud. i suppose i was okay with that since i knew it turned into a nightclub afterwards. the actual nightclub is just located ups<mark>Tai</mark>. the service was okay. i didn't mind since my beverage cup was never empty and my food came out in a timely manner. \nwe had ordered yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce, <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>, <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark>, an assortment of tempura, miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, sand pot lobster/shrimp/<mark>Scallop</mark> with black bean sauce, <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark> and <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark>. everything we ordered was pretty much delicious. i cer<mark>Tai</mark> will be back to try other things on the menu. \ni loved how after dinner, we were allowed to walk ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the club without waiting in line or paying an entrance fee. we were stamped and set for the night. :)", 
            "the decor was nice. the entrance was beautiful!\n\nthe food.. eh. everything was so salty. i had the <mark>Scallop</mark> with curry. it was too spicy and salty. everyone else's food was salty too.\n\nthe server was wonderful though. 2 of my friends left early for a show and needed to come back to get a \"line pass\" stamp for the club that night. he was so nice about it. and told me exactly what i needed to do to get it. the nightclub on the other hand... that's a separate review.", 
            "riddle me this:\nhow do you get eight guys into one of vegas' more popular and busier nightclubs during one of its busiest weekends without purchasing bottle service or bypassing the massive queue to get in without greasing any of the bouncers?\n\nanswer:\nunder almost all circumstances it's practically impossible.  dining at tao asian bistro, however, allowed us (eight guys) to get a \"line pass\" stamp so that after we had finished dinner we would bypass the main line to get into tao nightclub and tao beach and pay only half the cover charge allowing us access into both. \n\nwith regards to the food, i ordered the diver sea <mark>Scallop</mark> in red curry sauce which was actually quite good.  a little on the pricier side but seeing as how ordering main entrees got us all line passes and a discounted cover into tao nightclub, i'd say it was worth it.", 
            "tao asian bistro is located in the venetian hotel right next to tao nightclub. deciding what to order here was not easy since there is a variety of dishes to choose from but eventually we ordered the <mark>Scallop</mark>, sashimi and <mark><mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> Noodles</mark>. everything was delicious as well as our drinks. this place is perfect for a date or with friends. we asked our waiter if we can get in the night club after dinner without having to wait in those long lines and he was very nice enough to direct us with the right people. we got stamped and had immediate access to the club. food and service here is awesome!", 
            "if you haven't read, most clubs in las vegas are extremely hard to get into without paying a host. xs, marquee are probably the hottest night clubs right now in vegas but don't count out tao. once midnight hits and the patio is open tao is shoulder to shoulder busy with people all over the place partying.\n\nwe all took advantage of the popularity of tao nightclub by eating at tao which provides expedited access to their night club.\n\nmy initial impressions of tao was a restaurant trying to cash in on the asian theme. when you walk into tao and see how it opens up however, you're quickly reminded that a lot of thought had gone into designing the space. lights are dim to set the mood which plays off the color scheme quite well. a giant buddha statue sits in the middle of an open hall that spans two floors. asian art is hung everywhere with bamboo vegetation. at the same time, it wasn't hokey, i really appreciated what they were trying to do here.\n\nonto the food itself, our parties ordered a large number of appetizers which were delectable. i suggest the sashimi platter which had bite-sized party-in-your-mouth morsels of deliciousness.\nmy main meal was a deep sea dive <mark>Scallop</mark> in basil curry. if you had a bowl of rice to this dish, it is such a full complete meal considering. the sauce was rich and the <mark>Scallop</mark> itself were very large.\n\ni would definitely recommend you explore other sea food dishes as my samplings of them were also quite rich.", 
            "had a 7:45 reservation: was seated at 8:30. <mark>Scallop</mark> were rubbery, <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> wasn't as stellar as the server was raving about. lobster kimchee <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> wasn't anything to write home about. the only things we enjoyed were the appetizers: <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> and lobster ravioli. for the price, i'd rather go to hakkasan.", 
            "very good asian cuisine. the atmosphere and service were superb. i had the red curry <mark>Scallop</mark>. they were cooked perfectly. the sushi is very fresh. my only criticism is; the portion size is not adequate given the price.", 
            "this place is expensive, but absolutely worth it.\n\nevery time i go to vegas, i check this restaurant out. a few things i have tried here are the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, diver sea <mark>Scallop</mark>, and assorted sushi rolls. the wasabi crusted filet is amazing, however, i typically eat fish dishes here now.\n\nthe peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> are a great appetizer here amongst other things.\n\nas for drinks, i am not a martini fan in general, but i make an exception at tao. i will usually have a lychee martini here, and it is expensive like everything, but again reallllllllllly tasty. i have also tried the tao-tini and one other drink, and they were both tasty as well.\n\nfor dessert, molten chocolate cake. let me repeat that... molten. chocolate. cake. worth every last calorie consumed. save room for dessert, which will be hard, but trust me on this one.\n\ni have always received outstanding service here, and excellent food.", 
            "the best food i've ever had in vegas.\n\ni got a sushi roll (was advised against anything with salmon in it by our waiter) & it was divine. just enough for me. my boyfriend got the thai peanut sauce shrimp & it was amazing. light, delicate, spicy, lemongrass....i still dream of it!! we also split tempura <mark>Scallop</mark> which was $10 for 2 (our waiter kindly advised us) & delicious.\n\nour friends also loved their food, including sushi rolls. people devoured the <mark>Chinese Five Spice Short Ribs</mark>.\n\nour waiter comm<mark>Uni</mark> well with us as the sushi was made in one spot & other food in the kitchen. the waiter felt the ribs wouldn't be enough for 2 people but our friends got stuffed & ended up sharing.\n\nwe also got a free desert (with naughty fortunes) for our friends birthday.\n\neveryone was shocked by how much we actually paid - it seemed so little for the quality!!!\n\npros: selection, food, waitstaff, speed, decor\ncons: the guys next to us trying to hit on every girl that would sit down.\n\nprotip: apparently the bathrooms aren't labeled....",

            "a friend and i visited tao's restaurant and club in vegas during memorial weekend 2015 and we were definitely impressed. \nthe restaurant itself is beautiful and spacious. the entrance to the restaurant itself was very <mark>Uni</mark>! walking into the restaurant there were bath tubs full of naked women tastefully covered in flowers. no pictures were allowed but i tried unsuccessfully anyway. we sat in the bar area until out table was ready and had a drink. the bartenders were helpful and courteous but the bar was very full. \nonce we were seated for dinner we decided to share a meal of their lobster <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> as well as the <mark>Glazed Salmon</mark>. both dishes were absolutely delicious and the salmon was cooked perfectly. however, we both thought the lobster <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was very salty and way too greasy. their was literally a pool of grease in the bowl of rice which we were surprised they did not drain a little before serving it to us.\nafter having dinner in their restaurant we were informed that entrance into their club was complimentary for all diners. this was a big plus because it allowed us to avoid the $30.00 per person cover charge.\nthe club was very much like the restaurant - beautiful and full of both naked and costumed woman but this time they were all dancing instead of lounging like the ladies in the bathtubs at their restaurants entrance. like at the restaurant bar the club bar served very good drinks. snoop dogg was the enter<mark>Tai</mark> for the night i was there. when the club let out the staff surprisingly handed out flip flops to all the women. but on the downside the flip flops were all the same size but this didn't stop any of the women from using the slippers lol. my friend said they were a relief from her high heels. i simply took mine home as a souvenir. the take home slippers were definitely a <mark>Uni</mark> touch.\nthe only negative that i could recall beside the one size fits all slippers was the greasy rice but the rest of my experience was wonderful. i'd definitely return when i'm in vegas again."

            "let me start off by saying that i absolutely love tao! the decor is amazing, the staff is very friendly & helpful, and the food is delicious. and if that's not enough for you, inform your waiter that you plan on going to the club after dinner and they will give you a stamp that will get you in for free (both males & females) and let you skip the line. you can't beat that! \n\nwe visited tao (restaurant) on 4/1/10. we made same day reservations and they were able to accommodate us. i had the \"<mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark> with thai peanut sauce\" and my date had the \"soy ginger <mark>Glazed Salmon</mark> with udon noodles and spinach.\" both dishes were great - cooked perfectly, even to the toughest food critic's standards. however, i think the best part of the meal came at the end. like any other asian restaurant, they give you a free fortune cookie with your bill. but these are not your standard boring fortune cookies. the fortunes inside are a little more <mark>Uni</mark> than most. mine said \"you will receive a spanking in your near future\" and they bear the tao logo on the corner. definitely made us laugh at the end of a really great meal. \n\non the down side, prices are a little high here, but that is expected from any nice restaurant in las vegas. don't let this deter you - this place is worth the splurge! i highly recommend tao - i know i will make time for tao every time i go to vegas!", 
            "the only thing i really liked about this place were the drinks and the atmosphere. it's a see-and-be-seen kinda place which i knew to expect. three of us waited 1 hour on a monday night to eat here, which wasn't really a problem since we sat at the bar for that hour, but it was also 10 pm!! we made friends with the bartender who was a really cool, down to earth girl who shared stories of celeb sightings and poured plenty of alcohol in our drinks to make them worth $15 (she also told us about the bizarre rules that tao had for their staff, only to be expected at a hot vegas spot). by the time we got seated it was clear that our waitress was either exhausted or could not handle the amount of tables she had because frankly - she sucked. she forgot drinks, forgot to put in orders, took 20 minutes to bring over the check, and wasn't even friendly or apologetic. i sampled a few things - the duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> which were ok, the <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark> which were decent but nothing to write home about, and some sushi <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark> which was again - just ok. anything else we had was not memorable. like i said at the beginning, the drinks were fabulous but obviously pricey - hey it is vegas! but i could've drank the \"geisha girl\" martini all night. i definitely won't be back there to eat but would consider going for a few cock<mark>Tai</mark> or hitting the nightclub.", 
            "i love everything about this place!  it's a restaurant/night club at the venetian.  when we called for reservations, the frist available time was at 11:15 pm. one of my male friends said that he and his friends had a difficult time getting in the last time they were in vegas.   \n\nwe got there and we had to wait a few minutes at the lounge for our table.  people were already partying and they got us free drinks, yes!\n\nthis place is very trendy, very hip.  the decor and lighting was perfect and  there were at least 2 giant buddhas that i saw.  it was a very nice touch, added to the elegance of the place.\n\nthe one thing we did not like is that it's hard to talk to everyone at the table during the meal.  loud music was busting from the night club.  if you are looking to get that intimate conversation going on, this is not a good place.  but then,  that gave us time to just enjoy our great meal.\n\nwe had ordered:\n<mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>\npork <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with thai chili sauce\nblack pepper sizzled <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with udon noodles\n<mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>\nmandarin sizzled <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with <mark>Lacquered Roast Pork</mark>\n<mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>\nchai kiss\nchocolate lave for dessert\n\ni won't even try to describe each of them.  everything on our table was oh so good.  there was nothing that we didn't like.  we also ordered cock<mark>Tai</mark> and they were refreshing.  all was good good good.\n\nafter dinner, we hit the club.  we liked the kind of music they were playing.  the dance floor was great.  it was packed and crowded. \n\nwe just had a good time here.  this is definitely a must go restaurant/nightclub in vegas.",

            "so disappointed in this place! i've been going to vegas for some time now and i've always wanted to try this place. we sat at the sushi bar area since there was a wait. our waiter was nice and attentive. we ordered pot stickers, not a bad choice. then we got kung pao chicken and <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>. eh, the chicken was bad and i did not enjoy that dish at all. the shrimp was dry but it had a good flavor. they were big shrimp too.\n\nthe drinks were amazing but i went for the food. at the end of dinner we got a pass stamp for tao night club. we didn't go.  honestly, if i had to chose between tao and pf changs, pf would win.", 
            "yum!  i had the <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark> and it was delicious.  the dinner prices were not bad, mine was $31.00, and i thought it was well worth it.  everything is a la carte but they do come with rice.  my plate had a large serving and i did not need anything else to go with it.  my hubby also enjoyed his dinner, he got the kung pao chicken ($28).  the drinks on the other hand were ridiculous...$8 for an iced tea and one bottle of sapporo was $12! overall it was very good, and i would definitely go back.", 
            "this is one of my new favorite restaurants in vegas. i can't stop thinking about how good their <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is! if you go here, order this. you will not be disappointed. \n\none thing to keep in mind is that you should probably make reservations. we went here on a monday night at 9:30 p.m. thinking we would get seated right away. apparently not. the hostess looked at us like we were crazy when we said we didn't have reservations. the wait ended up being an hour but luckily we were staying at the palazzo so we went back up to the room for some drinks to kill some time. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (amazing), the <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark> and udon noodles. the shrimp was really crispy and the sauce on it was so good. the udon noodles were whatever. i don't really like udon noodles in general so i can't really give an honest opinion.\n\nwe tried their sake sampler but i realized that i'm not a sake fan. it's too strong. their mixed drinks are pretty good though. \n\nsince we came here on a monday, the club was closed. i'd imagine that when the club is open it could get pretty loud. there was music playing but i don't remember it being overbearing. \n\nif you're looking for some where to eat in vegas i'd recommend this place for sure.", 
            "exceptional service & food... we had a table of 9 our waiters were attentive and our food was exceptional... i personally loved the <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> & <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>.   the reviews almost scared me away.  i am glad i gave tao a try... loved the ambience of the restaurant.  we were seated right next to the large budda.. everyone in our party was pleased and had a great time...  thank you tao ... until next time", 
            "great location, great menu, great vibe, great waiter, fun creative food.\n\nfor starters we did the crunchy spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> roll and the alaskan salmon crab and avocado roll - would have been happy if all we'd had was the sushi!  for dinner we had the <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>, the tile fish special (my favorite), a filet shabu shabu (asian fondue) and the mandarin sizzled <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with shrimp - loved it. i loved it all.....\n\njust go for yourself - it's worth the ride!", 
            "great atmosphere! my husband and i came here right after we landed in vegas and arrived at our hotel (venetian). our flight was delayed and they were very amenable to delaying our reservation. the ambience is very loungy though the nightclub is ups<mark>Tai</mark> which has a very different feel (you would never know though!). \n\nour food was excellent. my husband got the <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>, i got <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and we shared shrimp <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> they were all very good. but the start of the show surprisingly was the maki roll we ordered for our appetizer, crispy spicy tuna with avocado. we love sushi and this was one of the best sushi experiences we have ever had. we're considering going back for just sushi. it was so fresh and tasty. \n\nlastly, if you eat at tao restaurant, you get free admission into the nightclub which was a little intense for me but worth checking out! overall great experience. would definitely go back on my next visit to vegas.", 
            "i don't get it. we had a reservation for 9:45pm and after inquiring several times, finally got seated at 10:30 pm. so, i thought, this must be amazing food! the food here was no better than your average pei wei/pf changs. $13/a small bowl (less than 2 cups) of <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> is outrageous. we ordered <mark>Scallop</mark>, <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> $39, <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> $28, and <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark> for 4 of us. my husband and i had green tea and the other couple had one drink each. the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the shrimp were the better of the four dishes, in my opinion. the <mark>Scallop</mark> were large, there were 4. they were soaked in a curry sauce, which i did not care for. the service was just o k, although the server said one dish of rice would be plenty, but after each one of us had 2-3 tablespoons, another dish was ordered (another $13)f the bill was probably $230 including tip.\n\nthe worst of all was the noise level. there were bunches of girls in short dresses with 6 inch heels scampering ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the nightclub at $60 a head. the noise, oh the noise! we had to sit in silence while eating because the music level and the bass was so incredibly deafening, we could not hear anything but bass.  by the time we were done with dinner, i had a horrible headache. \n\nif you don't need to worry about how much you spend, and you like very trendy, loud restaurants with mediocre food and naked girls in bathtubs, then this place is for you!",

            "friends were in town and they wanted to try the very popular tao restaurant.  (it's been reported that the tao restaurant is one of the highest gross-ranking restaurants in vegas!)  just as we were about to enter the hallway, this very large bouncer asks if he could help us and we mention we have reservations and then he allows us to proceed further.  talk about intimidating, and this was for a 7 pm dinner!\n\nwe were seated ups<mark>Tai</mark> on the balcony overlooking the huge buddha.  as menus were presented to us, the waitress asked if she could get us some water.  as i perused the flimsy two page menu, front and back, i didn't even know where to begin.  my fellow dining companions were quick to notice the 16 oz. grilled kobe sirloin for $150 and the individually priced nigiri pieces ranging from $3-$15 a piece.\n\nthe menu suggests that all items were going to be served family style, so we asked the waitress for a few suggestions.  i could barely hear her over the hum of the restaurant.  (i would not consider tao to be romantic at all.)\n\nin the end we decided to start with four different appetizers and two entrees.  and this is what we got:\n\n<mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark> ($14) - this came with five lettuce leaves.  a decent amount to fill all the leaves.  the squab mixture was a bit too moist and the bf found it too sweet.  i had squab juice stuff dripping all over my hands right off the bat.  there was a lot of flavor though and crunch, probably from the celery.\n\n<mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> ($16) - a clay pot arrived with 5 lobster-filled wontons.  very flavorful with slices of shittake mushrooms laid out too.  a very light and delicate dish.  \n\nsashimi of <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> with fresh wasabi sauce ($28) - beautifully presented on a circular clear plate with herbs on top.  we couldn't determine if they were already sliced apart or what, but with the meat being so delicate, just grab a piece and pull and the meat will tear gently apart.  lovely taste and clean.  however, i didn't recall a wasabi sauce or flavor to it.\n\npork <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with thai chili sauce ($11) - this order came with 3 triangles filled with pork, so we requested another order so we could all have a taste.  the <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> was decent, nothing particular special about it.  the thai chili sauce tasted store bought though.\n\nmiso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables ($34) - very good, but i guess the better question is when have you had a bad piece <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>?\n\n<mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark> ($26) - we must have misheard the waitress because we thought she said it came in a coconut curry.  it did not, but rather a sweet sauce with about five pieces <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> in it, including the drumstick.  it was okay, nothing particularly special about it.\n\n<mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark> ($4) - of course we had to order some rice!  we got two orders which is just enough for four people who aren't heavy rice eaters.\n\noverall, the food was good.  definitely overpriced though, and it's catered to a cer<mark>Tai</mark> kind of clientele.  you'll be amused to find things like kung pao chicken ($26) and grilled prime porterhouse with wasabi dipping sauce ($88) on the same menu.  we decided to pass on dessert as the waitress-recommended giant fortune cookie ($10) or fuji apple <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> ($8) didn't appeal to us enough.  (we actually drove over to luv-it frozen custard instead!)\n\nservice is a huge component of what makes this experience worth it or not, and tao fails in this department.  i was not impressed with the chatty young waiters who dropped (not placed) the silverware onto the table, reached across the bf to put things in front of me, and who 'hid' the menus behind my guest on his chair.  (uh, who does that?!)  as they moved our glasses and silverware to make room for our dishes, they did it in such an unorganized and messy fashion.  i felt like i was staring at someone's hands trying to do a card trick.  i'm used to the staff performing such tasks in an unnoticed way as to not disrupt the private conversation the dining guests are having.  the waitstaff should take a few lessons from rosemary's restaurant's waitstaff.  that's what i call service!\n\nat the very end of our meal, someone did come by and ask if everything was okay.  and it was...just okay.  they asked if we were going to the club afterward and i said yes and asked if they had any passes.  what they do have is a \"line pass,\" which is really a simple stamp on your inner left wrist so you can supposedly bypass the long line outside.  however, you will still have to pay cover.  (i think this part is rather ridiculous.  they should at least offer a discount on the cover instead.)  with the stamp being so simple, a washing of my hands right after dinner washed it right off.  not the best pass i would say.\n  \ntao restaurant is the kind of place you say you've been to and that's it.    there are better places where service is valued higher.\n\n$185 total, including tip and tax, no drinks", 
            "everyone loves buddha, right? who doesn't? tao's got one, a 20-foot golden buddha gracefully staring down at you. now, that's what i'm talking about. this is vegas, baby, and it's all about money.  fyi, tao was the highest grossing indepenent restaurant in the us in 2006. ($55 mil, that's $16 mil more than no.2). they must be doing something right.\n\ntao's service was surprisingly great although we arrived 8-ish without reservation. we were seated promptly with courtesy. our server was super nice and informative, as he explained every single dishes we've ordered as they arrived at our table.\n\ninterior deco was as usual. check it out for yourself on their website. \n\nsome of the dishes we've tried:\n\nsmall plate: thai stuffed shrimp with garlic, lime, and thai chili sauce \nsmall plate: <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok roasted asparagus\n<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura of <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>\nchef's roll\ndesert: chocolate zen parfait\n\nthe food was all excellent, but this place is really more about the vibe and the people-watching. tao is a popular destination for private parties among celebrities. the bill came out to be around $130, including a couple of drinks. not bad for a fun dinner in vegas.\n\ni would definitely visit there again next time i go to vegas.", 
            "i've been planning my birthday for the past 2 months and tao restaurant was my destination.  reservations were for friday night 8:45pm. note: your required to confirm the day of the reservation before noon.  checked in with the matre' d was pleased to be escorted directly to our table.  it was already crowded with people at the lounge having drink while waiting for their own table?? there was 3 of us for dinner-2 guys and myself.  we were lead toward the back and seated at a table close to the sushi bar. before you read any further this review is truly dedicated the service and to our waiter vs. the food.  in celebration of my birthday we ordered a bottle of the yellow label and voss sparkling water. after reviewing the menu, i asked the waiter what recommendations he had, and even though we ended up not getting anything that was mentioned, i thought it was great that he had extensive knowledge about the food.  we ordered:  <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with grilled asparas, wasabe <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>, duck friend rice,noodles and short-ribs.  the food honestly was mediocre for the price that you are paying.  there are so much more comparable quality food here in sf  that don't cost and arm and a leg.  needless to say i wasn't too disappointed as my expectations weren't that high, and i was paying to be part of the scene.  now kudos for the service, the waiter was extremely courteous, came at the right times to offer service,and always made sure that glasses were always filled.  i'm a lightweight and only drank a glass of champagne, i thought it was wonderful  that he was so observant and only filled up my companions glasses and only towards the end of dinner did he offer me more.  and lastly because there was a male to female ratio at the clubs, even with a $300 dollar dinner i still wouldn't have been able to get in, he worked the magic and got all 3 of us line passes for the club because it was my birthday.  above and beyond.  \nin summary: tao restaurant is a place to see and be seen, just don't have too hight expectations about the food.  especially for those of you who live here in sf.",

            "large parties dining at tao should know this....\n___________________________\nto my surprise, 4 stars for the food, but an overall 2 stars for the ridiculous way we were charged for the food and how our complaint was handled.  i dined at tao with a group of 9 for a bachelorette party the weekend of august 13, 2007. although i was disappointed with tao, i still had a great time with my fabulous girlfriends. \n\ni don't remember everything we had, but i enjoyed the <mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark>, <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. least favorite was the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> (one of the worst i've had) and chicken skewers. \n\nreason for 2 stars:\nafter we were seated, our waitress didn't come by for what seemed like 10 minutes to introduce herself. when she came by, she was friendly but did not comm<mark>Uni</mark> clearly how she was taking our order. since it was so loud and our waitress didn't have a very loud voice, 3 different members of our group asked her to clarify how much food she thought we should order. she specifically told us that we should order 3-4 starters and at least 5 main dishes. that took me by surprise b/c i thought this is small plates and how could that be enough food? so i repeated what she said to me just to clarify that 3-4 appetizers would enough food for 10 girls? we decided to just order as much as she recommended and we can order more if necessary. \n\nwhen the dishes arrived, we were all suprised at the large portions. what we found out when we got the receipt was that the waitress doubled and tripled each order (as she saw fit) so it would be enough for our table of 9. she never once said she was going to do this and we were upset because we had so much leftover food and even ate more than we wanted so it wouldn't be wasted.\n\nif we had known this is what she was going to do, we would have ordered different items. i can't remember if she tripled any main dishes but the end result was a very large bill and wasted food. \n\nwhen we brought this up to our waitress, she insisted she explained it and after she left, she never returned to our table. we then spoke to the manager who said he could only give us 2 drink tokens to compensate for the miscomm<mark>Uni</mark>. this is so lame and such a cheap gestere to rectify the situation. the least he could have done was get us into the nightclub for free afterwards. \n\ni have never, ever, gone to a restaurant where they took the liberty of doubling or tripling your order without telling you. i've always said, i want 1 order of this, 2 orders of this, etc.\n\ni would not go back to this restaurant again. food was good but not worth the price. \n\nthe club is ok if you get in early but by 1pm it gets too crowded to walk around and check things out. we got free line passes but had to go out, get in smaller line, pay $20pp at the door + get a hand stamp, then headed ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the night club. seems like a classy place but i find it offensive that they have skanky girls taking baths and playing with each other surrounded by all these bhuddas.", 
            "so we're in vegas--my first time, and i'm luv-in' it!  we went to tao tonight for drinks and dinner, sponsored by a trade association whose board my husband sits on.  so dinner was not on our dime, i never looked at a menu with prices, so i can't comment on how pricey the place is.\n\ni can say that the decor is the first thing that amazed me--loved it!  it takes a tremendously imaginative and talented person to create an atmosphere like this--which keeps you looking ahead to see what's around the corner and wondering what will astound you next\n\nthe next thing i noticed was the music being piped through the place--very hip!  loud but in a good way.  a later trip to the ladie's room revealed that there's a talented dj responsible for the tunes.  \n\nthe drinks kept coming and when it was time for dinner, we were presented with a lovely salad, followed by dinner served family style, including <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, an unbeleeeevable <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a gingery-garlicky yumminess to it, teensie weensie string beans, <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, and sauteed <mark>Sake Braised Shiitake Mushrooms</mark>.  ummmm..hello!  after dieting for 2 weeks in anticipation of this trip, my taste buds were trippin'!!\n\nnext up was an assortment of desserts, including a fuji apple tart-y thing with ice cream, a bowl of fruity stuff like tangerines, lychees, blackberries, raspberries and ice cream, chocolate lava cake and ice cream...on and on....this meal was planned to show me some love...ice cream and i, why, we're lovers!!!\n\nthe service was absolutely and completely im-pecc-able.  there was a staff of 5 or 6 dedicated to our group of about 40.  my water glass was never empty (or even close to it) and when i asked for a glass of sharp, dry white wine and the server came back with \"all she had on hand\" which was a chardonnay and i politely declined, she returned a couple of minutes later with an unbelievable pinot grigio that hit the spot.  \n\nall in all, a fabulous experience, and one i wouldn't hesitate to repeat on my second trip to this cool-ass town!", 
            "if i could, i would give this place 3.5 stars.  to start with, we had our reservations at 10:15 but didn't actually get seated until well over 10:30.  the interior decor was very exotic and i loved the big buddha inside.  \n\nthe food: i ordered the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>.  to be honest, i could not taste the wasabi much and the <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> were a bit too dough-y.  the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> was not very flavorful so i don't know if i would order that again.  the other dishes my friends had were delicious, especially the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the <mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark>.  \n\nthe drinks: my friends ordered lychee martinis and they were quite good.  i'm not a fan of sweet drinks but it had the perfect amount of lychee in it. \n\nthe dessert:  get the giant fortune cookie!!! \n\nthe service: it seemed like the waiter only forgot my things.  he forgot my drink... then he forgot the limes for my drink... other than that he was alright.\n\nthe layout:  the tables are very close together so it was annoying to keep bumping into the backs of people's chairs or have the waiters/busboys bump into the chairs.  also it was very loud in the restaurant.  i wouldn't recommend it for parties bigger than 4 because you cannot hear what people are saying. \n\nthe dj:  the guy who was spinning the night we ate there was awesome", 
            "like a good jewish girl, i had to have chinese food for christmas.  tao had a fun vibe, with a huge buddha and bathtubs full of rose petals, but the food just wasn't that impressive.  most of the dishes tasted like syrupy american chinese food that you could get for $10 - and i don't want to tell you how much i spent.  the drinks were good, the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> our waiter recommended was great, and desserts were delish, but overall i just wasn't blown away.\n\nplus, the fire alarm kept going off!  at first we thought it was a strobe light, but it quickly became annoying.  \n\nfinal weird note: we talked to out waiter about sex.  i'll leave the de<mark>Tai</mark> to your imagination.",

            "loved the food here. <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was to die for! this place was soo good i went back there the second night in lv! i ordered the ny steak and it was equally good. the steak is nicely sliced up for you, i.e. ez to eat. loved the asian fusion sauce they drizzled over it with a bed of shitake mushrooms. mmmhhmmm.\nwish there was a tao here in sf... /sigh.", 
            "a group of my friends and i went to tao last night to celebrate a birthday dinner for eight.  the service was absolutely horrible. i made a reservation several weeks ago for 8 pm and they made us wait for 45 minutes.  once we got seated, it took another 20 minutes for them to take our order then we waited another 20 mintues between appetizer and the main courses.  when my friend complained, the waitress responded by saying, \"i was trying to time it right,\" then proceeded to bring out the rest of the remaining dishes (all six of them) in one shot!  \n\ngratuity for a large group is automatically  added at 20%, so i got the impression that  they take no pride in taking care of their guests once you're seated.\n\nmy rankings are the following: \nservice: one star\nfood: two 1/2 stars\n\nthe <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the new york strip steak were decent.  the potstickers were average.  the noodles and the xo string beans were over seasoned and soggy.  you can get better chinese food elsewhere for 1/4 the price. we paid $57 per person.\n\nbottom line is you pay for the ambiance mostly at tao, but the food is mediocre at best.  a dinner that should have taken 1 hour and 1/2, took 3 hours due to poor service and lack of attention.  i would think a restaurant of their caliber would take more pride in treating their guests right.", 
            "i've done 22 reviews so far, and have not yet given a 5-star.  in thinking about the best experience that i've had in a restaurant recently, i'd have to say tao in las vegas.  the combination of the tasty foods, fun decor, and excellent service makes tao las vegas deserving of my first 5-star rating!  of course, the vegas excitement adds to the total experience.\n\nthis isn't one of yelpers' favorite joints to dine at in vegas based on the ratings, so i'll share a couple of tips of what i've done and hopefully that'll be helpful to you folks out there:\n\n- <mark>Maki</mark> reservations here is a must!  without reservations, this place is impossible to get into, unless you know people, or do the ol' slipping a bill into the handshake action.  (if you do, try $20 or higher)\n\n- come with friends that are ready to party, because this is a party joint!  meet at the bar, so that if you have folks coming in from different hotels, you can enjoy the drinks while you wait.\n\n- once you're seated, order sharable appetizers, like the edamame, <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark>, or  thai stuffed <mark>Shrimp</mark>.\n\n- if you like sake, they have a pretty good selection of <mark>Sake</mark>.  if you haven't tried the nigori sake (unfiltered), i'd suggest at least trying that.  the best way is to ask the server to give you the rundown.we had the voice in the mist bottle and it was yummy!\n\n- for your entree, you must get miso-glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>!!  it's my favorite fish entree in the world!  savory white flaky tender bits of tasty fish... oh my.  it definitely melts in your mouth yet creates a flavor explosion.  so good!  my friend likes the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, but i think it's not nearly as good as the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.\n\ni've been to tao now for 3 years.  i've had a great experience every single time.  i now cannot imagine going to vegas without my <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> experience at tao.", 
            "i've been here four times and aside from a minor intoxicated mix up on bottle vs. drink service made by moi and group and small service lapse whilst sitting alone, this is dining nirvana. \n\nlocated inside the venetian, which already smells great, the entrance and gift shop have the wonderful smell of sandalwood. the stone \"baths\" greet you as you walk to the hostess station...each time i've visited they have been filled with water, rose petals and candles. i've heard mention that there may be events where buddha nymphs are soaking in the tubs...could be urban legend, could be wishful thinking by drunken pigs. either way, i wish i was a tao bath girl.... \n\nbut i digress...back to the food. whether dining alone at the sushi bar, partying with friends, or starting at a special someone this place accommodates the mood. dark wood, candle light, ginormous statues of the buddha, fresh flowers, small medium and large buddha statues abound. i have not yet had the pleasure of seeing the club - but dining here has been enough satisfaction. \n\nthe sushi is divine and overpriced...individual order are great but if you really want to be impressed, throw your credit card to the wind and go for the \"chef's special\". - otherwise known as sushi roulette in vegas. you give them an amount to spend and then wait for monster plate. the sashimi of <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> (think carpaccio) is glorious, buttery, melty goodness and even better with the smokey sauce that accompanies the avocado tempura (sin on a plate). \n\npeking duck <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark>, <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> meal or satay small plate, <mark>Scallop</mark>...you could spend forever savoring. the sake menu is amazing and must be sampled - probably the reason i have never gotten to desert. but then again, there are great places within the venetian to venture to for liquid desert!\n\nif you like asian food or sushi it's a must visit for the food and the atmosphere.  and no, the swanky couches in the front room are not for the uncool to lounge upon and think they can order drinks from - bottle service only and all that goes with it!", 
            "first time diner, long time clubber. me and eleven other \"bachelors\" enjoyed an incredible time at tao for a friends stag party.\n\nafter three glasses of wine i honestly can't remember what appetizers we had but they were the bomb-ass rap song. if you don't believe me, ask l.a. lakers robert horry - he was at the table next to us saying hells yeah... or maybe, \"as usual, i'll take the check.\" i wonder if he knew that the hot red head sitting next to him just came over to our table and advertised the strip club where she would be working later that night?\n\nour server sereka was the cats meow. not only could she handle 12 crazy men, but she helped us haze the groom. she hand picked a table of bachelorettes for us to send a comp bottle of champagne. imagine the groom-to-be's surprise when 10 boa-clad bachelorettes came over and personally thanked him for the bubbly.\n\noh, and definitely get the miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> - delicious!\n\n4.5 * stars", 
            "the girls and i decided to dine here on saturday night at 5:15pm.  yes, we dined that early.  i called to reserve a table for nine a couple of days before we dined, so we got a choice of the 5:15pm or 10:45pm seating.  since we had to get back to our rooms at wynn to get ready for clubbing at xs, we opted for the 5:15pm seating.   i loved the asian d\\u00e9cor...muted lighting makes the restaurant appear like an elegant lounge.  our round table was good for eating family style...and was located right in front of the huge buddha statue.  \n\ndishes my friends and i tried and their star ratings (with 5 stars being the best):\n\n* edamame (4 stars / $7) - edamame is edamame...what else can i say?\n    \n* <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> (4 stars / $16) - i didn't get a chance to taste this, but my friends loved it.  \n\n* miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables (5 stars / $34) - i loved this dish.  so tasty...the fish was so flaky and tender.  \n\n* <mark>Spicy Hoi Yin Eggplant</mark> (4 stars / $9) - i kept hearing raves from my friends about this eggplant dish.    \n\n* mandarin sizzled <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with peking duck (4 stars / $14) - my friends loved this dish, but i thought it was just ok...it could have done with more peking duck.  as it was, the duck slices were too thin and too few.    \n\n* <mark><mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> Noodles</mark> with shrimp (4 stars / $22) - again, my friends raved about this dish, but i found it to be so-so.  i'm picky about thai dishes, so i expect more.  i have to say i was surprised by the large serving of <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> since other dishes we ordered came in small servings. \n\n* giant fortune cookie (4 stars / $10) - this fortune cooked is filled with white & dark chocolate mousse.  so pretty to look at...and the filing provided a nice taste and texture to a regular fortune cookie.  our server also provided nine separate fortunes with our cookie, so that was a nice touch.  \n\n* chocolate raspberry wontons (4 stars / $9) - the crisp wontons filled with raspberry filing tasted wonderful with the vanilla bean ice cream.  \n\nthe wine list had a lot of good options, but we stayed away from alcohol during dinner as we were saving our drinking for our bottle service at xs the same night.  overall, tao has great ambiance, good food and great service.  our server is one of the best i have ever encountered in my years of dining.  he was very patient with our group and answered our questions with a smile.  i would definitely dine here again.", 
            "i was pleasantly surprised!  much less pretentious than i thought, but the waitor was a little on the pushy side.  i suppose with the economy, vegas is hurting too so he's gotta \"make it work\".  other than that, here's the rundown:\n\n-sushi:  we shared a few rolls for appetizers and they were good, but definitely $$ for the portion.  we had a spicy, crunchy <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> and something else with yellow<mark>Tai</mark>; like i said, good, but i've had better at sushi wabi in chicago.  \n\n-drinks:  sake martini, waaaaay too heavy on the vodka.  left a stinging sensation in my mouth and not in a good way.  the other tini's were on the sweet side.  \n\n-dinner:  we had <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark>...must try.  it was tender, flavorful and a great portion size.  friends had chicken curry, nice and spicy and <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, also delicious.  i thought the entrees were all reasonably priced, especially for vegas.  \n\n-atmosphere:  lots of typical d-bags yelling \"vegas baby!!\" and lots of typical chippees in slutty outfits (us included).  but overall, no complaints.  we were seated on time, the service was efficient (our food came out really fast!) and $110 per person (dinner for six, split 5 ways for b-day girl) seemed like a pretty good deal for as much as we ate and drank.",

            "been here a few times, always a lively and fun atmosphere. the lounge is a nice area to people watch as you wait for your table or if you have no reservation, you can eat there on a first come-first serve basis. we always get a plate of sushi for starters. the <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> is good. had the wasabi crusted filet w/ <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>, decent. the wasabi was a different twist on things, but i think i can do without. also previously had the miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with peking duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> as a side, both were decent as well. service has always been pretty good. \ni would reserve a table a couple of weeks in advance or you'll be dining late. i mean starting dinner at 11:30pm late. \ni've learned when you go to a trendy asian-fusion place the food is going to be mix results. sushi is usually good, but main dish can be a hit or miss. if you're looking at tao then you heard about the nice decor. the vibe is vegas/hollywood glam, seen someone famous every time. if you dine here, you also get a line stamp for the club. you can impress your friends and said you had dinner at the highest grossing restaurant in the country, which tao is. the place is more about the scene than the food. but worth checking out once to see what the fuss is all about.",

            "tao is always one of my favorite restaurants in las vegas. not just for the great food but for the ambiance as well. the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> is so good. the filet itself is great but the added flavor of the wasabi crust make it both different and delicious as the same time. the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> though may be the star of the menu here. one of the tastiest pieces of fish i've ever had and anyone who i've ever been with here loves it. the spicy tuna on crispy race is great but not as good as the one at koi (although the portion size is bigger here). if you want to enjoy a great environment while you eat, hit up tao restaurant.", 
            "we had a short weekend trip to vegas and decided to check out tao since we were staying at the venetian.  it was our first time going into tao (we later also went to the nightclub), and we found the decor and ambiance to fitting, comfortable, and well-thought.  the four of us kept commenting on the buddha floating over the koi pond, the wall of candles, and the giant portraits that were hanging near our tables.  fortunately, our luck didn't just run out there.\n\nwe ordered two appetizers and four main course dishes and were pleasantly surprised with the quality and the quantity.  the <mark>Scallop</mark> were amazingly tasty, and the <mark>Peking Duck <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> were beyond my expectations.  our entrees were <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>, a red curry chicken, a <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and salmon over udon noodles.  all dishes were exceptionally prepared and the thai dishes were better than you'd find at most specialty thai restaurants.  impressive.  five stars would be awarded if our server had been more attentive and perhaps if the price were just a smidge lower.  dinner ended up running a little long and we were antsy to get over to our cirque du soleil show.\n\nat the end of the meal, we left as a happy group and were extremely glad we stopped in.  i'll definitely be <mark>Maki</mark> another reservation the next time i'm in town.  \n\nbonus: the other perk of eating there for dinner was that we were able to get stamps to return later in the evening for their must-see club experience.  the stamps saved us from a huge wait in line and also got us in without a cover charge.", 
            "so you want to get into the tao nightclub guaranteed without waiting in line for hours??  have dinner here first !!\n\nwe were a party of five (bachelor party).  three of us had the steak, another had the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and i had the sword fish.  we also had the <mark>TAO Angry Dragon Roll</mark>, two servings of rice, dessert but no drinks.  the total came out to around $52 a head (remember we didn't buy drinks) but here's the best part...\n\nafter dinner, they will stamp your left wrist that says \"line pass\".  once you get this stamp, go outside of the restaurant and show it to the guy at the front door.  he will then give you a stamp on your right wrist (chinese character) that will \"get you in and out of the nightclub as much as you want all night long, no waiting in line\".\n\nso really, you can pay cover charge of $30 and wait in line for hours and hours (the line went outside the casino) or you can have a nice dinner and be able to get in and out all night long and not wait in line for an extra $22.  \n\nand by the way, i was pleasantly surprised with their food!  it was actually very good.  at first they said it was a la carte, so i thought their entrees would be small but surpringly they were not.  take our word coming from five grown men that by the end of dinner we were actually pretty full!\n\ndinner was very good but the ' in and out as much as you want, no waiting in line ' option was very much well worth it !!",

            "this place is your typical vegas restaurant.  large, loud, and expensive.  fortunately, the food is actually pretty good too.  i enjoyed the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and made a sound sake decision.  it's just hard to fall in love with a cavernous theme restaurant regardless of all of the other factors.  you are in vegas though so this is the norm.  i actually walked by mike tyson who was waiting in line to get a table.  overall, the place serves good food in a disney like setting.", 
            "i've been to the club here before, which will be reserved for a seperate review.  dining at tao is one of those vegas experiences that you will remember.  located at the venetian, which is like a lego-land comprised of the gritti palace and the royal danieli with st. mark's and the grand canal thrown in for good measure, tao is a buddhist temple amid this garbled baroque mess.  \n\nyou will need reservations here and expect to have a drink at the bar, which isn't all too bad considering the loads of eye candy hanging around, as if they are apart of the scenery, so you will be sure to see something that you like.  take the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to order a grey goose and soda, sit on one of the couches, and look at all the hot asian broads w/their raven tresses and wasp-thin waists, and the european bitches in their milanese high heels and tossed-boob salad exploding out of their wrap-dresses.  yes, yes, tres chic, i know. \n\nthe dining room is dim, crowded, and there's a thousand conversations going on at one and the same time.  not sure if i'd come here for a \"special occasion\" type of dinner, as in ask your girl to marry you or to tell your mistress you're married.  our waiter was cool, reminded me of a socal dude, like he'd hang out in venice beach.  \n\nfor dinner we started off with the spicy tuna tartare and <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> shashimi - both were to die for (the tuna was crisp and crunchy, and the <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> was like eating kobe tai, go figure).  with our main course (we both got the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>) we paired it up with the lobster and kimchi rice (again, an excellent choice). \n\ni'm a sake novice and was open to suggestion: we started off with the sake sampler, and with our dessert got the sake dessert sampler, i believe, and me and my bud both agreed that the cloudy voices in the mist was our least favorite - i walked out of here a bit rocked.  for dessert we opted for the giant fortune cookie.  \n\nin the end, $244.00 <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark> before tip, which, in my opinion, isn't bad at all considering what we got.  will definitely make it here again and do our best to revitalize the economy.", 
            "went here this past saturday for a friend's birthday dinner.  we were only able to get a 6:45pm spot because we called to make a reservation the day prior to arrival.  \n\ni love the dim lighting and overall ambiance of tao restaurant.  the place is bit noisy to be a romantic dinner date spot, but it suited our needs for the birthday dinner.  the club music playing in the background pumped us up for later.\n\nwe hung out at the lounge while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive and took advantage of the photo ops.  this place offers eye candy galore for both men and women...bonus!  \n\nitems we ordered:\n\n* <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> ($18) - my friends said this was tasty.  i didn't try any, so can't attest to the taste...although it smelled wonderful.  the wontons were served in a clay pot, simmering gently in it's <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>. \n\n* miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables ($34) - this dish was once again very delicious.  the fish was cooked just right...crisp on the outside and flaky on the inside.  the stir-fried veggies and fried tofu pieces rounded out the dish perfectly.  \n\n* <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> ($16 / six pieces) - i really enjoyed this roll, which consisted of spicy minced tuna spread thickly <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> cakes (cut into rectangular pieces).  \n\n* <mark>TAO Angry Dragon Roll</mark> with eel & kabayaki sauce ($15 / eight slices) - i enjoyed this roll, but it's just your standard eel roll...nothing special about it.  \n\n* kobe tartar tempura ($19 / eight slices) - the minced <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> was wrapped in seaweed, which was then encased in sushi rice and deep fried.  on the side was a bed of marinated, sliced <mark>Sake Braised Shiitake Mushrooms</mark> (which was sweet and delicious).  \n\n* black pepper sizzled <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with udon noodles ($29) - can't say much about this since i didn't get a bite, but it looked and smelled good.  the serving was plentiful, compared with the other dishes.\n\n* molten chocolate cake ($10) - this came with coconut ice cream, but they honored our request for vanilla ice cream instead.  \n\n* assorted ice creams and sorbets ($8) - served with a couple of almond sesame cookies.  \n\ndrinks: glass of scarbolo pinot grigio ($10) / tao-tini ($13) / orange dragon ($13) /  bottle of corona ($8).  \n\nfor our enter<mark>Tai</mark>, we witnessed this drunk lady that somehow ended up on the lap of the huge buddha.  she was posing for pics until security escorted her out.  i guess we're not supposed to sit on the buddha's lap?  darn!  \n\nanother great experience at tao restaurant.  i will always make it a point to dine here on every las vegas trip.", 
            "i tried giving tao restaurant a second chance, but it has still failed to redeem itself from previous experiences. a huge factor in my poor rating for this venue was the lackluster service. i called about 2 weeks in advanced to make a reservation for 7 and we still had to wait over 40 minutes for our table to be set. what's the point of <mark>Maki</mark> a reservation if we're stuck waiting in the lounge anyway? the hostesses were not very helpful or friendly either. \"your table will be ready in a few minutes\" turned into a dreadful prolonged standstill in our evening. i have the slightest feeling they dragged it out intentionally just to entice us to order drinks in the lounge, but we did not cave.\n\nfinally seated in the nippy upper level right in front of an overpowering ac system, us poor gals decked out in vegas-appropriate dresses shivered as well browsed through the menu. the fish clay pot i had my eyes set on was taken off the menu, so i played it safe and ordered the black peppered <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> w/ udon once again. it took me a while to regain the sensation in my tongue from the blazing hot flavor, but the rest of my friends thought it was pretty tasty. the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was one of the best dishes at the table. who knew such a thick, buttery, succulent filet accompanied by a pile of spinach could be so worthy of drooling-status. \n\ni still think the prices are overpriced for what you're getting. $18 for <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> is just flat out absurd. the only reason we decided to dine here was to get stamped for the nightclub so we could pass up the entire line with free cover. smart idea if you plan on dancing the night away at tao, but after this experience, i'd much rather scout for vip passes on the strip or find a promoter for a hook up.\n\nps: don't forget to bring floss if you order the black pepper <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>. i walked out front door with black specks all over my teeth. hawtness.",

            "pleasantly surprised by the food. i wanted to experience a trendy vegas restaurant and heard mixed reviews on tao (ny and vegas). however, i really enjoyed my dinner here.\n\nfirst of all, the decor is beautiful, albeit ridiculous. a restaurant called tao, filled with numerous buddha statues including the nearly twenty feet tall one in the main room, large photographs of sumo wrestlers in one dining area, and large color photographs of buddhist priests of varying ages decorating the hallway to the restroom, and the overall opulent decor? not to mention the crowd of tourists and revealingly dressed beautiful and less beautiful people. not sure this is what buddha intended but overall a very beautiful lounge and restaurant.\n\nwe had a reservation (thank goodness; the place was packed) but had to wait about a half and hour. we got a drink at the bar. yes, well drinks were expensive but not surprising for vegas. once we were seated, we had a nice view of the gigantic buddha. our server was very friendly and informative. i felt in general the waitstaff was attentive, even though the restaurant was so busy.\n\nas appetizers, we ordered the lobster dumplings in shitake mushroom broth, spicy ahi tuna on top of crispy <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark> (basically like nigiri) and the <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark>. the dumplings and broth were excellent but the skin of the won tons were a little thick. the spicy ahi tuna was yuuummmy. the <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark> was the weakest dish. the fish was not very prominent, which was disappointing since i love toro. this roll was also topped with some sort of crunchy, sweet cracker-like topping that i did not love. \n\nwe also had two entrees: the black pepper flank steak and udon noodles, and miso-glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. the steak and udon noodles were okay; nothing special. the miso-glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was delicious and perfectly cooked. the vegetables it came with were somewhat of an afterthought but the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was so beautifully cooked that i didn't care too much.\n\ndefinitely a fun, vibrant, loud environment. overall, i was impressed by the quality and flavor of the food and i enjoyed the atmosphere.",

Kobe Ribeye</mark> our waiter suggested), the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (he suggested two appetizer portions as opposed to one main which was the same price and we got more fish), and the buddha's vegetables. all were delicious and the perfect amount of food for the group. \n\nwe finished off with the oversized fortune cookie which came with a fortune for everyone and was fun to share. \n\noverall it was a fun dining experience as long as your are ok with sharing plates (which i am).", 
            "this is a review for the tao restaurant:\n\ni know what you're thinking: style over substance.  i was thinking that too when i first walked into this restaurant.  it is like eating in a nightclub or lounge.  lots of well-dressed good looking people, and relatively loud music.  this place is a scene.  but you know what?  the substance was actually there for the meal that i had.\n\nwe shared a series of small dishes and main courses and were very impressed.  the substance was actually there in the food and the service was friendly and attentive.  a nice treat considering that i was expecting the worst.\n\nfor our starters we had the shrimp with peanut sauce, <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark>, the <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>, and the spicy eggland dish.  all of the dishes were quite good, flavorful, and had a good portion size.  the dish that really stood out here was the <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> which ranks up there with one of the best rolls i've had -- it packed a nice kick and the fish was fresh.\n\nfor the main courses, we shared the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, the <mark>Typhoon Lobster</mark>, and the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>.  the main courses were all delicious.  the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was fantastic as was the lobster.  it was all decadent and delicious.\n\ni would come back here as the food lived up to the style of the restaurant.  plus, you can a line pass if you eat here which allowed us to bypass the huge line into the tao nightclub and enter the club with no cover charge.  a nice bonus!", 
            "nothing about tao restaurant would make someone who knows me well think i would like it.  the music's too loud, the food's too expensive, and it's just too long to sit down for me when i'm in vegas and there's a ton of stuff i want to make sure i have time to do.  but i come here for one reason, and one reason only.  <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  this place has orgasmic fish-orgy-in-your-mouth watering <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> ($34).  i look forward to eating this dish every time i go to vegas, simply accompanied by a side of <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>.  i also had some $14 appetizer of tuna tartare which was delicious but i could have done without.  topped off with a nice bottle of sake and we kicked off the night right.\n\ni was a little apprehensive about eating here with my friends on a bachelor party trip.  the thought of 10 guys eating at tao together late night made me think like we'd look like a bunch of freaks, but literally every table there was a large group of males or females, but not both.  makes sense right?  no one wants extra baggage in vegas.\n\nlast point....when you order water you better say tap or they're gonna bring you some voss and charge you $7 for it.",

(the correct door for us is \"yang\", gentlemen.  and you're welcome.)  seriously, i'm all for going against convention, but practical applications for practical purposes.\n\nthe inside is very nice, and gives a great ambiance. the servers were always ready to to proved respectable service, and the food was tasty, if a little smaller than my likings.  but not a bad experience overall.",

            "went to tao for dinner with my wife on thurs nite, waited at the lobby area where they have some comfy couches. ordered the taotini which was excellent n the waitresses serving drinks are hotties!! had the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> for main course which was superb! my wife is veg & ordered a few things off the menu but none of the veg items were good unfortunately. go with the chocolate zen parfait for dessert....it so rich n delicious! the waiter offered to get us in for free at the tao nightclub n we didn't even have to wait in line. totally worth it!", 
            "loved the presentation. we had the pleasure of having the family style dinner where the chef picked the menu for us. i loved the concept and the food was very good. the best dish- <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  it literally melted in your mouth.", 
            "mmmmm the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>...yummy buttery in my tummy! i love the ambiance, the flavors, and the service.  the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the giant fortune cookies were the best items i had, others such as the <mark>Crispy Soft Shell Crab</mark> sushi, duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, etc were just ok. but i definitely make an effort to dine here when i have a chance while in vegas just for those two items.", 
            "my bf and i had dinner here one of the nights of our vegas stay. we were seated immediately. the decor was beautiful. i love the large buddha statue in the restaurant. the music was super loud. i suppose i was okay with that since i knew it turned into a nightclub afterwards. the actual nightclub is just located ups<mark>Tai</mark>. the service was okay. i didn't mind since my beverage cup was never empty and my food came out in a timely manner. \nwe had ordered yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce, <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>, <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark>, an assortment of tempura, miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, sand pot lobster/shrimp/<mark>Scallop</mark> with black bean sauce, <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark> and <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark>. everything we ordered was pretty much delicious. i cer<mark>Tai</mark> will be back to try other things on the menu. \ni loved how after dinner, we were allowed to walk ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the club without waiting in line or paying an entrance fee. we were stamped and set for the night. :)", 
            "cool, trendy, delicious.\n\nquick tips:\n\n1.  stick to small plates and starters.  most creative.\n\n2.  skip the nigiri sushi.  expensive and not spectacular.\n\n3.  lots of spicy, hot flavors from chili and wasabi.  this is drinking food.\n\nif you must have sushi, top props to the <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> with black tobiko, <mark>King Crab California Roll</mark> (made with real king crab), and the <mark>Crispy Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll served with a yuzu mayonnaise.  all are familiar just made with top quality ingredients and a good flavor twist that makes you long for a second bite.\n\nsmall plate standouts include an unexpectedly good grilled <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> served with a satay sauce. never thought what is essentially peanut butter would go so well with fish.  the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> with mango chili sauce while not purely crab meat just pairs so well with the sauce.  well balanced.  the spicy tuna tartar <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> crackers, a great twist on the classic.  outstanding.  bold flavor, cool tuna, <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> cracker.  so much contrast make for a delicious bite of food.  finally the  <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> sashimi with fresh wasabi; yum.\n\ndo not pass on the peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with hoisin sauce or the lobster and shrimp <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with spicy pineapple sauce.  big bold flavors.  textual contrast at its best.\n\nfinally, if you never had avocado tempura try it.  the warm avocado has the creamy texture of uni.  very different.  very good.\n\nnote:  dining at tao should be social so bring a group of friends.  the food is meant to be shared.  \n\nspecial note:  for the guys, dining at tao does not give you any special vip privileges to enter the tao nightclub later in the evening.  ladies, work the magic.\n\n\nrecommended.", 
            "i came here for a friend's birthday expecting the worst, but was actually pleasantly surprised.\n\ni didn't even know tao had a restaurant until the night i ate here. the restaurant is huge and surprisingly busy for dinner. the service was impeccable, with knowledgable and attentive servers. the food is expensive, but you're in the wrong city if that is a deal breaker. i definitely recommend the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, order it and everyone at the table will be stealing bites. \n\nif you come here for dinner be sure to get your hand stamped so that you can get into tao nightclub for free.", 
            "i'm disappointed, tao. the first two times i went, you had this amazing delicious black <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> udon noodles dish that was an orgasm in my mouth. then you took it off the menu. now, you are not only overpriced and loud with crappy service, your food is mediocre at best.  \n\nwe had table reservations for 10:15 pm, and we were seated at 11:30 pm. granted we went on the night that jay-z went to tao the club, but still. \nour food took 30 minutes to come out. i wasn't even hungry anymore at this point and my friend took a nap at the table stone cold sober because we were so tired and bored. \nwaiter definitely didn't give a crap about us at that point in the night and didn't bother checking back on us. \nmy friend ordered the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and it was good, very soft and chewy. a bit too sweet. \nanother friend ordered the salmon on a bed of udon noodles and she said the noodles were not good. \ni ordered the wasabi crusted steak. it was good, but not worth the 2 hour wait and $35 price tag. \n\ni would not recommend. however, if you do go, definitely make reservations and try not to go on a weekend or when a huge star is <mark>Maki</mark> an appearance...haha. \n\ngreat sake selection. tao's a pretty awesome place to drink and dance (aka go for the club, not for the restaurant) and to see hot girls.", 
            "the ambiance is great.  very cool artistic stuff on the walls.  unfortunately we had reservations for 10 and they put us at a table that in no way should have held more than 6 or 8.  i have never been so cramped in all my life at a dinner.  that is a minus for this review.\n\nafter trying about 10 different appetizers at our table, i was probably hovering around a 3-star review.  the food was average for asian food at best.  what do you expect, right?  it's an restaurant with food from all different asian cuisines, probably not doing any of them real justice.  then i got my entree which was miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  omfg.  i eat lots and lots and lots of fish and seafood.  when i go out to eat, that's pretty much all i ever eat.  the fillet was over 1\" thick and cooked to absolute perfection.  it friggin' fell apart with hardly any pressure of the fork.  the miso was perfect.  just a light coating which really enhanced the flavor of the fish itself instead of drowning or masking the taste of the fish.  so the hero of the plate?  the fish.  ding ding!!!  we have a winner.  so many times i get fish and the hero of the plate is the sauce on top.  if you have a very fresh fish cooked properly the sauce should be mild and minimal.  i was jumping for joy.  seriously, i've had miso cod and miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and this has to be the best i've ever had.\n\nluckily for me before ordering the entree, i told everybody i wasn't interested in sharing.  i had enough beef and other types of meat in the appetizer round that i had no interest in anymore.  nobody else wanted to order fish or real seafood, so i didn't try any of the other entrees.  i'm so glad - the fish was put on my plate from heaven.\n\nothers at the table that were sharing their entrees were saying the pepper beef was really good, too.  i had no interest in trying it.\n\nif i went back, there's no way i'd even try another entree because quite honestly, i doubt it will be anywhere nearly as good.  the appetizers were average - 3 stars.  however, the fish was a 5++++ star, so that averages out to 5 star.  i have a strong feeling that most of the entrees are not nearly as good.  i'll never find out because i'm not going to try them!  based on what i saw others eating and their responses, they seemed to think the entrees were of similar level as the appetizers and were just decent.", 
            "my first trip to vegas started out great.  we were staying in the palazzo so we decided on dinner and some drinks at tao.  we started with the tuna tartare with <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>.  it was definitely delicious.  my friend said it was the best she's ever had.  i don't know if i'd go that far, but i'd order it again.  for my main dish, i had the miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> which was a really great choice.  it was moist and flavorful and cooked to perfection.  my friends had some sushi and the chicken <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> and they were all very happy.  our server was friendly and quick, the decor was hip, and the food was great.", 
            "dropped by for dinner before heading ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the club portion of the establishment.\n\nwe ordered waaaaayyy too much food, which was fine by me since it was my last night in vegas on this trip.  might as well go out with a bang right? \n\nanyways, some highlights of the meal included the following:\n\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>\n-<mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>\n-<mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers\n-toro sashimi\n-<mark>Salmon Sashimi</mark>\n-mini donuts for desert\n\nthe thing that amazed me about this place is that the food is worth eating.  the dining room is a scene and it is enormous.  it is quite a feat that the kitchen is able to keep up with the dining room considering how large it is.  and given the people watching here, some restaurants might try to get away with the fact that their dining room is filled with a large number of scantily clad women.  tao avoids that trap and serves up some pretty tasty asian dishes and has the service to see that it gets served right.", 
            "i love the food but so pricey, long wait (even with reservation).  my fave dish is the small plate (<mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>).  small portions, so you can leave hungry unless you spend a fortune.\n\nloud on weekends (dj and lots of people).  can get crowded/tight space.", 
            "i have eaten at both taos in las vegas and nyc many times. delish! \n\nthe decor is similar in both establishments (large stone buddha, lots of red and black). service has always been on point and it's great for groups because the atmosphere is loud and fun.\n\nsome of my favorite menu items are:\n\n-cloudy sake\n-lychee martini\n-<mark>Salmon Sashimi</mark> appetizer (with jalepeno)\n-<mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> (which has tuna on it)\n-miso-glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>\n-giant fortune cookie\n\nsome of their menu items are also found on tao beach's menu.\n\noh, and remember to always read your fortune out loud and end it with \"in the bed.\"",

            "our vacation in las vegas started with a romantic dinner at tao...we had to race over to not miss our reservation, the restaurant is gorgeous. i loved the dim lighting and the hip music playing, they even honored my request for a booth. well the booth was actually sofa cushions and throw pillows hehe. our server was nice but as other yelpers have mentioned the service is fast, so fast i feel like you can't really enjoy your evening. bussers constantly hoover around like ninjas to clear items right away <mark>Maki</mark> me feel rushed but i'm sure its because they have a lot of reservations. started with the <mark>King Crab California Roll</mark> , very good and then we had the miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>. the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was so delicious just like butta! recommend this dish , the duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> my guy seemed to enjoy and for dessert we had the molten chocolate cake mmmm delightful!", 
            "damn!! they got us on the free admission to the club. when you do the math is not worth it. guys pay 40 and girls free. but our bill for 4 people was three hundred plus. ha! ok on to what we liked:\n\nambiance: great- kinda loud so good for groups.\nservice: this was good too, i guess it will depend on your waiter.\nfood: we had the kang pao chicken, shrimp coconut, <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> and the damn <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. (yes they push the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> to you)!! \n\nok, yes portions are small, but everything is very tasty. so basically you are paying for the chefs <mark>Maki</mark> it. we paired it with a bottle of wine. oh and the water. careful here, it is 8 dollars for distiller water. hahaha .. \n\nafter dinner we literally had to step out the restaurant to stand in a special line just to be directed to go back in. that's silly if you ask me. you will get stamped twice, that is silly too. at around 10pm when the club opens the crowd is not bad. however, this place gets ridiculous full of women. so men ... enjoy!", 
            "the cons:\n-we had a long wait(over an hour atleast) even though we had late night reservations, but it wasn't so bad. we had some drinks at the bar, talked to the bartender a bit and people watched. \n-when we were seated, i have to admit, i was a little disappointed with our table. it was one of those where you are right next to the neighboring table and share a booth with the stranger next to you. not that big of a deal really.\n-my husband had the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> w/ <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>. he was pretty disappointed. i felt bad bc i had talked him into getting this dish due to all the great reviews.\n\nthe pros:\n-my dish alone is the reason i would go back to tao and the reason i gave it 4 stars... the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was outstanding! best fish i've ever eaten. just the perfect amount of sweetness and it melted in your mouth like butter. \n\n\nsomewhere in the middle:\n-for an app. we had the <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>- good, not great. i was hoping it would taste like a similar dish i had once at katsuya in hollywood and it just didn't stack up. \n\n\nwill we be going back? doubtful. maybe if i go to vegas with some girlfriends in the future i'll have a chance to eat some more of that delicious fish, but i will not likely be going back with the husband.",

            "note: this place is quite asian (food-wise)\n\nthis place is great. fabulous.  wonderful.  not just the food, but also the service.  my girlfriends and i went to vegas for spring break and decided to try out tao.  there were 6 of us, and being poor college students, we did not want to splurge too much on the first day of vacay.  as such, we spent almost 20 minutes trying to decipher the menu and decide what to order -- i think our server came up to us at least 3 times in those 20 minutes.  finally, we got over our shyness and asked him what he would recommend for us.  our server was friendly, and directly asked our price range; we stated $30-$40 per person, at most.  he offered to put together a \"tasting menu\" just for us.  we were really grateful, and we immediately accepted the offer.  \n\ndishes:  most famous for their <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>; our waiter ordered 3 appetizers <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (2 sticks per order, so we each got one stick), a ravioli thing (i think?), and some other noodle and dumpling dishes.  when the food arrived, our server explained that he had given us a mix of the most popular dishes of their restaurant, and the dumplings and noodle things were just to \"fill us up.\"  indeed, between the delicious food and omg-i-can't-get-over-the-sea-bass, we were extremely full by the end of dinner, and each person's bill averaged less than $30. \n\nwe were so happy with the food and service that we decided to tip more (i think we tipped like 25% lol).\n\nso for my rating: \n\n<mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>: 5/5; all other food: 4/5\n\nservice: 5/5",

            "tao is one of those places that you feel is a must whenever you're in vegas. in my opinion, it is one of those places that is a bit overrated.\n\nmy friends & i had reservations for 10pm at tao about two fridays ago to celebrate a friends birthday. when we first walked in we had to make a line in order to have our ids checked. it was extremely crowded & noisy as we made our way up the line. once inside we were given a beeper that would alert us when our table was ready. during that time we were waiting around & people kept rushing/pushing past us to get ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the club.\n\nlet me get to the service & food. after we were seated we had a friendly waiter who suggested a couple of the restaurant's signature dishes. i discretely told him the fact that it was my friend's birthday in order for them to bring out a cake or special dessert for her (which they did - a mousse filled fortune cookie). he was great and started stating some random facts about the club after i whispered in his ear so she wouldn't catch on. so kudos to that. service all around was amazing.\n\nthe food was decent. honestly, what stood out to me was the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. i could have ate that & that alone all night long. everything else was okay from the noodles to the several appetizers we did try out. i can't remember everything we ordered exactly.\n\nif you're trying to go to the nightclub & are in the mood to eat something before hand then you should come check it out for yourself. with the purchase of an entree you don't have to pay the cover charge for the club.\n\nwill i be back? not likely.", 
            "my hubby and i ate here at tao the first time we visited vegas for his birthday and loved it.  we made reservations since they tend to get very busy.  the decor and ambiance is just amazing.  waiter was super nice and helpful.  we had various sashimi and sushi for appetizers and the hubby ordered a steak and i hade the grilled <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  everything was just yummy!  this place is cool if you want a romantic dinner but fun and hip enough if you and some friends want to hang out.  definitely coming back when we visit vegas again.",

            "i admit, the ambiance is pretty cool, but if you're looking for a place to dine and chat it's a bit difficult to do that at tao. i thought the noise level was a bit too loud among the music and various side conversations from neighboring tables.\n\nour group of 14 decided to order family style. dishes that stuck out to me:\n\n * <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>: one of my favorite things i ate at tao. if you're afraid of spicy food, this wasn't too spicy. i enjoyed the textures and flavors this dish provided.\n\n*<mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark>: delicious and easy to wrap.\n\n*lobster wonton: i thought the wonton was overcooked, which had that \"mushy\" texture. pass.\n\n*miso glazed chillian <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>: another favorite dish i enjoyed eating. i highly recommend this dish.\n\nour bill at the end of our meal came out to $45 for 13 of us. although the food was enjoyable, i personally thought that it wasn't worth $45. then again, i had no input on what we ordered since one of the girls in our party was responsible for that. i wouldn't mind coming back and giving it another try though.\n\n*edit 9-26-12*\n\ni should clarify that each girl paid $45...not $45 for the total bill. if you're all about the food, you might as well head to a good chinese restaurant and pay half the price.", 
            "came here a while ago and had a great time!  only word of advice is to definitely make dinner reservations.  when we arrived, we were seated promptly.  seating for us is a bit different with bench seating with a much lower-stance table.  our server was very helpful and was efficient.  the ambiance was great with low-lit lighting with buddha statues surround the whole restaurant.  walking around and even taking notice of how much thought was put into the decor is mind-blowing.  \n\ni ordered the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and was amazing! it was tender and flavorful and was would definitely order again when i come back to vegas.  drinks are expensive, but what isn't pricey in lv? \n\npros:\n- great service\n- great ambiance\n- <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>!!!\n\ncons:\n- price", 
            "very disappointed in this place. i got hyped up by the 5 start reviews but tao is far from 5 stars. we were politely greeted by our server who was very enthusiastic about the place. i asked him what the most popular dish was & he responded with \" miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> \" . the fish was cooked properly, tasted & looked great. we also ordered \"omakase\" style sushi which means that the consumer trusts the chef to create a plate based on his skills & tastes. this is where i was very disappointed, we payed $58 for 6 or 7 pieces <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, dull sushi. nothing creative or original. if i may add i personally think that whole foods sushi is gourmet compared to tao sushi. after a disappointing dinner i had conversed with our waiter for a few minutes about fine dinning & how tao is not anywhere near that. once he realized that i am a true connoisseur of fine cuisine he immediately started to blame the restaurant for catering to people who don't get to try asian cuisine & wont expect a 5 star quality, and thats why i wouldn't be impressed by anything there. he himself recommended us to a few 5 star sushi restaurants around town. for $120 with gratuity i feel like this place is not only a rip off but very hyped up for absolutely no reason besides the decor inside. never going to dine at this establishment again.",

            "***we had a large party menu (fixed) at tao's and that could have contributed to the experience; the food was mediocre with some of the courses being decent, but more of them with a quality and flavor similar to a pf chang's***\n\ntao has never been high on my list to try in las vegas, but i've definitely heard a lot about it--especially since it is both a restaurant and, i believe, a nightclub after dinner ends.  tao was also featured on the food network's best thing i ever ate where duff goldman selected their <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> as his favorite thing in las vegas.\n\ntao is located in the venetian and it is a big spot with a dark decor (very loud as well).  tao's huge menu is very modern asian or asian fusion with a wide variety of items including sushi, sashimi, edamame, satay, tuna tartare, <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark>, dumplings, <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>, bbq meats, tempura, wok-fried meat, poultry and seafood dishes, <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, and noodles.\n\neverything was kind of okay, but while a few dishes were noticeably better than what you would get at a pf chang's, a lot of it wasn't (and tao carries a much higher price tag though part of that is because tao is in las vegas).  we did have a fixed party menu so maybe more freshly prepared dishes would have stood out more though the flavors were not exciting or memorable.\n\nservice was fine.  the food came out at a good pace.\n\nas mentioned, prices were high for a just okay asian fusion restaurant.\n\ntao does offer many different dishes and it brings in a lot of customers to make for a lively atmosphere so if either of those two qualities appeal to you, tao might be worth checking out.  but if you are looking for high quality food or good value, tao might not be the best choice on the strip.\n\nlike other las vegas casinos on the strip, the venetian offers both free self and valet parking.", 
            "i will start by saying that this was once my favorite restaurant in las vegas, but i doubt that i will be back. i actually ate here twice on this trip to las vegas and i was extremely disappointed both times. the first time we went we ordered a couple of appetizers and a few sushi rolls. the lobster wonton was good but the sushi rolls were not. they came out 2 minutes after ordering them meaning that they had been made well in advance and they were no where near as good as in the past. we also got several piecess of salmon, tuna and yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi. in the past they would have brought us one big tray with all of this sushi as well as lemon, cucumber and other extras that drastically change the flavor of the sushi in a good way. this time it was quickly thrown on a small plate and it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while.\n\ni ended going again because some other friends had just gotten in town and wanted to try it out. once again i was disappointed. the sashimi was still way over priced. we go the yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi with jalapenos and ponzu and it was good but not $20 good for 4 small (really small) pieces. the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was good but not good enough to out weigh the negatives.\n\nthe atmosphere is still fun but it is slightly louder then i remember. you can tell that the place is going downhill in popularity as well since there were over 50% of the tables were empty on a friday night at 9:00.",

            "i've been here twice, the first time awhile back and i remember loving it. but as my taste have changed i wondered if it would be as good the second time around. we started off with a couple drinks, all of which were delicious. we then had the duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> that came with a delicious sauce. the next course we had was a mix of raw fish. i enjoyed this dish as well it was very fresh. for the main course we ordered the chicken sausage <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> and the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.\n\nthe <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was really really good. they even put a fried egg on top and then the server mixed it. i had <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> previously and remember it being delicious. it did not disappoint. it was just as good as i remembered it it was totally succulent. i will dream of that <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>!\n\nour server was great and the atmosphere was really great. overall i enjoyed the meal and would try it again!",

            "this place is expensive, but absolutely worth it.\n\nevery time i go to vegas, i check this restaurant out. a few things i have tried here are the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, diver sea <mark>Scallop</mark>, and assorted sushi rolls. the wasabi crusted filet is amazing, however, i typically eat fish dishes here now.\n\nthe peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> are a great appetizer here amongst other things.\n\nas for drinks, i am not a martini fan in general, but i make an exception at tao. i will usually have a lychee martini here, and it is expensive like everything, but again reallllllllllly tasty. i have also tried the tao-tini and one other drink, and they were both tasty as well.\n\nfor dessert, molten chocolate cake. let me repeat that... molten. chocolate. cake. worth every last calorie consumed. save room for dessert, which will be hard, but trust me on this one.\n\ni have always received outstanding service here, and excellent food.",

            "my girlfriend and i went to tao saturday night. we ordered the saki sampler which is 3 different shots of saki. if you are not familiar with saki this is a great introduction. for my entree i ordered the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, this was the highlight of the meal, subtle flavors of ginger, fish melting in your mouth.  my girlfriend ordered the buddah chicken. the chicken is marinaded with a sweet <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> flavor, also very good and bit less pricey then the other dishes (29.00) we ended up spending 150.00 for 2 people including appetizers and drinks which i felt was a good value. price range between 150-200.00 for 2 people which is not bad at all considering the quality.",

            "tao has to be a top five place for me. if there was one close to  my home i'd go at least once a week. only problem about that is their are only two in the states! one thing i love about tao is the atmosphere is way different then anything else i've ever attended. i love the budda statue, the dark/night time atmosphere, and also guys, the ladies dress up stunningly. even with all these great features it all comes down to the food. the food well.... it's absolutely amazing!!! the <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> is so wonderful! very tender of course. the peking duck is flavorful with a great hosin sauce. with all these great choices the best to me was the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with miso glaze.", 
            "very nice dining experience, food is amazing! for appetizer we ordered lobster dumplings and spice tuna tartar, love them both. entr\\u00e9e we had omakase chefs choice sushi plate and <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, both were delicious! price is reasonable and i'm positive that i'll visit them again for my next trip to vegas!", 
            "amazing!  my second visit was as wonderful  as my first.  i was in vegas with my kids and really wanted to go to tao since it was incredible 18months ago when my husband and i went alone.  we made an early reservation and dined ahead of the night club crowd.  the food was so delicious.  my son who loves asian food said it is the best and my picky daughter left stuffed.  <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, lobster won tons, spicy wonton soup, <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark>- everything was fresh, full of flavor and perfectly prepared.  the donuts were a tasty ending.  the staff was very attentive.  the ambiance is great - it is an experience!", 
            "the food is average at the best, especially for the price.  between myself and my party we had the ribeye steak, kung pow chicken,  <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with pork, and the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was the only thing good...oh and donuts dessert was horrible!... i can't believe how many people give this place such a high rating.", 
            "the best item to order isn't even on the menu: the tasting menu.  i didn't know about this secret the first time i ate there and had wound up ordering the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, which i found to be overly hyped.  the tasting menu consists of a multi-course meal of items selected by the chef depending on your food preferences and your price point ($60-$120 per person).  if you're in town for a short time and don't see yourself visiting again any time soon, the tasting menu is what to request!", 
            "this review comes after my 3rd trip to tao in the last year while visiting vegas on various occasions.\n\ni made my reservations on open table each time.  no issues, and the restaurant called to confirm on the morning of...unusual for an open table reservation in my experience, but not out-of-line in my opinion.  we have never waited for our table...always when we have arrived we are immediately taken back.\n\nfood, and drinks each visit have been exceptional.  my husband has had the <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> with shrimp toast, <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>, and the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  he loved them all.  i have tried the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> (before i was gf), the <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>, the pad <mark>Thai Duck <mark>Lobster and Kim Chee Fried Rice</mark></mark> noodles with chicken, and the <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> with peanut sauce.  if i could get this food from home, i would be eating here once a week...without a doubt!  \n\nwe have had great service on each trip with an offer of a stamp to enter the club as a vip after it opened for the night (bypassing the line, and the cover).  the club is a different review, but also a definite must-see at least once while in vegas.\n\nhint:  to address the \"which is which\" that people seem to have trouble with at the bathrooms entry... there is a statue outside each door.  one has boobs, and one has a penis.  this seems pretty self-explanatory to me, and i figured it out for myself on my first visit, after a few drinks.  seems like it shouldnt be such a big question?", 
            "after eating here a couple time this last experience was lack luster. the beef tarter rolls were so disgusting we didn't even eat more than 2 bites. it was slightly warm, mushy, and the texture made my skin crawl. the signature <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is why i usually like coming to eat here and it's been always great in the past but the combination duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was hard and seemed like it had been sitting out. the fried whole fish was pretty good, i ate everything from the <mark>Tai</mark> to the eyeball and was pretty pleased with it. the <mark>Peking Duck <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> were bland and our <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> were tasteless and chewy which wasn't good at all. during this last dinner at tao we ordered $240.00 worth of food between the 2 of us and was only happy with the snapper, <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. the appetizers were all a disappointment and even our 4 drinks weren't made to our liking. \n although i've had a good experience at tao before, this last one wasn't good at all. not sure if we will return again but who knows what will happen while in vegas right?", 
            "pretty much all you need to do as a white person to determine if an asian or asian fusion type restaurant is worthwhile is to simply glance around the room at your fellow restaurant goers. are they mostly asian? if so, the food will be delicious at an appropriate dollar-per-dollar rate. if not, you are either probably getting crappy take out or are about to get food-fleeced.\n\ndon't get me wrong: the cuisine my fellow bachelor party-goers and i had here, from the admirable <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> to the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> was incredibly well-executed and tasty. but while i still enjoyed actually eating the meal in a flawlessly decorated room with its truly hip atmosphere, the ever-present knowledge that i could have had everything we ordered for a fraction of the price at many places in the san gabriel valley still sunk the experience.\n\nthat's just me though. i think if you're keen on unloading a boatload of money and you also happen to want asian food in a super-cool environment, tao could fit the bill. if you want something that's just as special and more reasonably calibrated, price-wise, there are a ton of other places in lv you might want to visit instead.", 
            "i've been to tao las vegas twice, and both experiences are in the top 5 best meals i've ever had. \n\ni think the key here is to get the tasting menu - basically, tell your server how much you'd like to pay per person, note any food preferences, and your server will put together a tasting menu which is perfect for groups who want to try a little bit of everything. \n\nfirst off all, we had incredible service. there were 5 us celebrating my friend's 30th birthday, and our server was energetic, passionate, and delivered a great experience. his manager was also phenomenal, and ended up comp'ing us with a second bottle of perrier-jouet champagne after he mispoured a glass. \n\nour server (i can't remember his name) told us that $50 per person would be more than enough to get everything we wanted, and he was right about that. all in all, he brought out three courses - two rounds of appetizers and tasting plates, and one round of entrees. it felt like we tried everything on the menu, and were so stuffed by the third round. highlights included:\n\n- <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with asparagus - honestly, out of this world. melt in your mouth, incredibly flavourful. \n\n- <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>\n\n- <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> with avocado and <mark>Soy Paper</mark> - probably the best sushi i've ever tasted\n\n- <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> - every bite was an explosion of delicious flavour\n\nin addition to the wonderful food and service, tao also has a great atmosphere - beautiful decor, good music, very trendy and sleek, filled with beautiful people. bonus is that you get free entry to tao nightclub after dinner, though we didn't find it that great (it was crowded and not fun). \n\nwould highly recommend tao for dinner!", 
            "went here for a bachelorette party and the food was amazing. our server was really friendly and made great suggestions, we ordered everything he mentioned and we were not disappointed. you must try the spicy tuna tartar <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> appetizer and the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> entree.", 
            "i came to tao as a side trip for edc, and about half way through the meal, i felt like i came to vegas for tao, and edc was just a side trip. \n\ni ate at tao with a group of 8 people - family and friends, all a bunch of young adults in our twenties. we ordered family style (many plates in the center of the table to share), and in total, we destroyed 8 delicious dishes and a beautiful dessert smorgasbord. every single thing we tried was delicious. i am spoiled in that my parents take me to nice places on occasion, and tao is at the top 5 of my list of best meals i've ever eaten. one friend who ate with us said - and i quote, \"this is probably the best meal i will ever eat in my life.\" i am going to new york this fall or winter and plan to eat at the tao restaurant in new york with my boyfriend. you can expect to hear another review on that restaurant soon. \n\nmy favorite dishes of the meal we had include: \n- the flavorful 28 days aged new york steak which melted in my mouth\n- the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> which tasted like it was injected with the best sauce ever created. every bite gave you a gush of flavor, and it was cooked just right.\n- the crispy <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark> roll with edamame which came with a not-too-spicy wasabi dipping sauce.\n- the delicious mixed sashimi platter which had a wide variety <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark> including fatty tuna. \n- the gorgeous display of desserts (also ordered family style) which came with a hilarious and delicious giant fortune cookie and sweet dipping cream. the fortunes were vegas-themed and made us laugh. \n\nthe atmosphere was nice and our server, jeffery, was amazing. he always came at the right time, promptly filled our glasses, and was extremely helpful with the ordering process. he was absolutely hilarious, and super friendly. his language is what puts him over the top. the way he described the food as we were ordering was something from a movie or commercial. he used 2-3 descriptive - and one would even say seductive - adjectives for each dish. it's hard not to order them when he describes them that way. my brother put it best when he asked jeffery, \"could you please describe the food to me like that as i'm eating it?\" about a quarter of the way into our meal, the manager even came out to make sure we were all enjoying our food. \n\nall in all, it was a perfect dinner, and a fantastic way to start our crazy night at the electric daisy carnival.", 
            "group of 5 ladies, came here on a saturday night during the 4th of july holiday. first of all, the hostess with the blonde hair and orange dress was a total petty bitch and did not want to seat us. had us waiting for over an hour for a table when we saw several open. we would have at least ordered drinks and  appetizers but there was no service in the waiting area. the waiting area was blaring with loud edm music, not at all conducive for dinner or lounge talk and definitely scared us a bit thinking that the club would be the same. meanwhile, troops of people with questionable attractiveness and boldly comfortable physiques would trapes in every few minutes heading over to the nightclub area. we were already on the guestlist for the party but having had good history with their sister company, lavo, we wanted to try the food first,  but in these moments, both the dinner and club scene here were so off putting. the night started off quite weak. once we were seated, after 12, finally the service came pouring in. at least 3 or 4 servers came to our table to excuse the slackness and eager to be of service. nice view of the big buddha statue in the center. food was decent, we enjoyed the pan fried <mark>Chicken Gyoza</mark>, the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> and the <mark>Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups</mark> were ok, we kind of got full off of just appetizers cause again, large portions. my cousins miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> entree was good. strong miso flavor, but if you're cool with that, its good. big portion <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> by someone else. i dont like <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> or peanut tastes so i didnt taste it but she enjoyed. looked big and fresh. i split the shrimp, lobster, scallop in bean sauce entree with someone else because it sounded big and also to cut costs and have more things on the table to taste. was really looking forward to it, it has all of my favorite meaty chewy seafoods. it was shockingly bad, dont know if there was an error made in the sauce recipe, but i have had plenty of similar dishes in the past, never have any been half as bad, and it came highly recommended by the waiter and was amongst the most expensive so we were surprised that it was so bitter. the table tasted and agreed that the sauce had an unpleasant taste. the waiter took it off of our bill gracefully and we left a great tip in exchange. in this moment, the great service that we are accustomed to from lavo, was thankfully shining through here at tao as well. a nice chick came to our table to stamp us and set us up for the complimentary club access. as i said before, we were already on the guestlist so didnt need it, but its nice that they have that additional incentive for dining there, as lavo used to do. will continue nightclub review in other yelp page.", 
            "hostess could use a lil help with customer service, other than that the waiter was great, definitely made up for the hostess lack of customer service.  the ambiance is hip and music is loud.  good place to hang out for birthday, bachelor, bachelorette or girls/guys night out.  food is really good.  my favs are the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Kobe Beef</mark>  sashimi and anything on the sushi menu.",

            "i love tao. i don't care what anyone says or thinks. i make it a point to come here each time we visit and when my husband and i are in vegas for a few months we try to come here often to support the establishment. \n\ni must admit that one of my best friends is a lead sever here so i can expect spectacular service as well as i can trust her to bring me out what i like. \n\nas far as flavor goes, i rate it brimming the top notch for asian fusion. nothing i had was bland. some things were not up my alley, like some of the sushi (we had a shit load of sushi), but i can be a sushi purist. the entrees are fine dining experience whether the taste speaks to you or not. deal with it. it's sweet dishes and there's lots of teriyaki flavor and the like, and i really don't understand people calling this a cop out. asian fusion is supposed to be sweet sometimes. right? \n\nthe <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> is my sh*t! drunk, sober, day, night, at the pool, at the restaurant, begging for it at the club bar. my husband will have to stock up when i'm pregnant. \n\ni love the hamachi sashimi in their ponzu (?) sauce and topped with jalape\\u00f1os. even though you can find this everywhere in vegas, like all the top hotels are required to serve it or something. whatever. i'll take 10. \n\nthe <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> were seriously good but honestly i think it's because i fall for the hype of lobster like allllll the time, it's seriously annoying. i forget that there's a way to do any lobster anyway and as long as it's not like eating a sea shoe i love it. so know that before you take my advice on these <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>. i love lobster ravioli and this was like that but with an asian flare and swimming in a soupy like base. like wor gau gee soup if it were rich. like a little china in...seattle or something. \n\nwe had the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> and i approve. not like this is the place you must get your <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark>, but let's be predictable and order the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> shall we? \n\nwe had some kind of hot dish thing that came in a cast iron bowl and our sever mixed it for us at the table. my hubs loved it and i thought it was a-okay. \n\nthe <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is my entree of choice. it should be yours too if it's your first rodeo. truly good stuff and don't you tell me otherwise! \n\nthe rest of the food we had and can't remember was yummers and some very well worth the price. however, the 85$ ribeye is not worth it no matter if it's a damn good steak. a lot of truly good ingredients at tao are ridiculously priced if i'm to be 100 about it. like $38 for the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with no carbs is kind of annoying. sometimes, too much is too much and your bill here should definitely not be cheap. \n\nthis is the sexiest restaurant on the strip in my opinion. just try this place. or at least go at night to see the girlies in the bath tubs. oh and if you have dinner here you can enter the club for free apparently. \n\nthe atmosphere and ambiance is beautiful and and a very well done asian theme. the lighting is low and dimmer than dim. i will admit my first time i was not drunk enough and complained about how in the world i would be able to eat let alone see my food. totally falls in line with the club vibe, and i guess you can make out over dinner? \n\nservice is phenomenal and i am leaving my friend out of it. i mean, she is phenomenal, her name is heather ask for her, but to be fair this rating is for the rest of the team. the boh is obviously doing something right and the foh is really great in my personal experience. from serving staff to the folks who only bring out our drinks to the hustling bussers, i have to applaud the management and training protocol. like for real, let me see your protocol so i can steal it. \n\nthere seem to be mixed reviews of the place and i have to venture to wonder if a lot of the negative is competitive haterism. tao has done significantly well for themselves in the nightlife industry and in a very short amount of time. that can be an envious thing and something we all hope to experience in vegas if we are in the business. sad to see some bad reviews on the food, as i do believe they meet expectations in a las vegas sense. so make your own idea of the place. give it a go and ask for my girl heather. tell her to go away if she's too nice to you. she won't take it personally. she's just amazing like that.",

            "this place is great if you're a 19 year old bachelorette and your posse of girlfriends is outfitted in tiaras and feather boas. if, however, you're on a family vacation in sin city (what? reserve your judgments, please) then you'll have to contend with terrible service and fairly mediocre food. my favorite dish was the wasabi-crusted filet with onion ring tempura, not because the meat was silky and tender (which it was - credit where credit is due) but because the onion ring tempura resembled an <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> alien pod ship. but otherwise it took us half an hour for our tea to arrive, and i know it doesn't take half an hour to boil water. or to steep tea. or both. and the desserts were a royal disappointment - i mean people, godiva chocolate should not be listed on a menu. it's not impressive, nor is it good, and - dare i say it - it's not even chocolate. i'd skip the dinner in favor of drinks where you can enjoy the real reason for going - bachelorette party watching.",

            "after watching an <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> trippy show by elton john at caesar's palace (i swear i needed drugs to fully appreciate that show)me, my sister, my cousins and their friends headed over tao for a late (and i mean late - it was a 10:45pm reservation!) dinner. i was little bit skeptical about going to eat at this place.  first off, i'm from san francisco - it's hard to top the taste of bay area asian foods that sell for a cheaper rate than tao, and 2nd - it was ridiculously loud because tao night club is right above the restaurant.  we had a reservation and still had to wait about 30 minutes.  fine... i got that it was busy.  but after not having dinner, and being a little loopy after the elton john show - i wasn't a very happy camper and i wanted to bail.\n\nbut the dinner was for a birthday and i didn't want to disappoint by being a crabby patty.  so i dealt with it.\n\nsince we were a large group of 10, we were seated in a nice little alcove in the very back of the restaurant.  it was nice and cozy and i felt at ease.  thank heavens we weren't in the middle of the restaurant where it was crowded. i was crabby enough as it was to have to deal with the lack of space.  \n\nwe had a nice view of mike tyson as he sat at the table behind us with a lovely female friend.  we tried to be slick in taking pictures of him as each one of us placed our order.\n\nwhen the food came out, i wasn't so impressed by the presentation but i figured i shouldn't judge by looks alone.  i ordered the chicken yellow curry.  the smell was heavenly. i saw the little pieces of lemongrass in it. that was different for me. i've never had chicken yellow curry with lemongrass. i poured some curry on my rice and took a spoonful... it was fantastic that i had to offer some over to everyone else for a taste.  the chicken potstickers on the table tasted fresh and succulent.  my sister had a beef dish that was just divine.  but my favorite was the dish i ordered.  and today i still crave for that wonderful burst of flavor on my tongue.  as i always say... \"party in my mouth...heeeeyyyyy!!!\"",

            "so the best meal of the whole vacation goes to... tao. what do you think of when you think of tao, besides winnie-the pooh, maybe a pathway or a philosophy of the true nature of the world? tao restaurant located in the venetian has found their \"pathway\" through their food. \n\nunbeknownst to me, tao is one of the hottest places on the strip. not only is it a restaurant but a lounge, banquet hall, a club, and celeb hot spot. i guess i know how to pick them! what i like is that the service treats everyone like royalty. the service here is <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> fast and they have more then enough staff on hand. we met one host and then got seated by another, then our server, a water guy, a guy that brings out food, and then a guy that takes it all away. the decor was <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> too, dark rich colors, all kinds of fabrics, very bold and very de<mark>Tai</mark>. of course the 16 foot tall buddha stands out just a little. \n\nthe most impressive attribute about tao is their food. tao specializes in hong kong chinese, japanese, and thai cuisines. i know it's a lot but this location is huge so they room for it all. the <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> was unbelievable and all it consisted of was fresh tuna in a roll with a crispy outer ring of something (they wouldn't tell me what is was). <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> and veg <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark> were surprisingly filling and were perfectly cooked. of course you have to get something tempura, i recommend the asparagus, it wasn't greasy at all, we loved them. so for dessert you have to get the giant fortune cookie (it's almost the size of your head), yeah it's cheesy but it's filled with white and chocolate mousse and you won't be able to put your spoon down. \n\nother then the drinks tao is relatively cheap, at least compared to most of vegas. but even if it wasn't tao is worth the visit.", 
            "i would give tao zero stars except it deserves credit for being a really cool looking place.  the food is mediocre, <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> salty, and totally overpriced.   the sushi is not on par with any good sushi restaurant in la or vegas, and the rest of the menu is like katana's.  the service is horrendous and the attitude is a joke.", 
            "ok when i think about restaurants on the strip i generally don't think i'm going to have any sort of meal that is satisfying, tastes out of this world and is not pretentious. tao has really taught me a lesson in that department. don't judge until you've tried. \n\ni've come to tao two times to eat and both times my socks have been blown off. not really...cos both times i wore heels that were way too high and uncomfortable and ended the night walking around without shoes. note to self: do not wear ridiculous shoes when you intend to walk more than 3 steps. \n\ni digress...i digress...back to tao. contrary to popular belief, both times i was here (once with 8 people and once with 4), we were able to get tables (the first time we called the night before and the next time we just walked in) on saturday nights. as you enter tao, there are these flower-petal filled mini earthen bath tubs...haha...if i had a couple of their super strong lychee martinis i would go take plonk myself in one of these. they look that zen and inviting. \n\nthis latest visit i made to tao started with drinks at the bar while waiting for our table. lychee martinis...i made sure to ask for \"extra strong\" martinis and that was delivered. a great start to the night. the waiter we had was very knowledgeable about the food. he knew exactly what went in each dish. tao is also very vegetarian friendly. they can substitute tofu in many dishes and there are many veggie options. ok now to the dishes:\n\n1. <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark> - yum yum...very nice and interesting. never had these before. i probably wouldn't order these if i didn't have more than 4 people in my party. rather large portion and the taste is interesting only the first couple of bites\n\n2. sake infused mushrooms - ok i am going to go <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> right now. this was soooo good....i hate sake and i'm salivating all over my laptop right now. i can't even describe this dish. you just need to get it. need to i tell you\n\n3. steamed veggie dumplings - the dumplings itself were pretty normal. nothing out of the regular dumpling world. don't get me wrong, they were good...just nothing to write a paragraph about (although i guess i already have). now, the dumplings came with this amazing crunchy cucumber side. ok...seriously...cooked cucumbers. sounds icky but yum yum yum. very very nice...\n\n4. <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with veggies - wow. crispy lettuce, perfectly cooked tofu, simple flavors and you wouldn't even know you are eating <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> (i don't like <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>). tastes sooo good. this is literally the best <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> i've had outside of asia. and i've eaten many a <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>\n\n5. mango tamarind martini - this one tasted sooooo good. masked the taste of alcohol (i can't stand the taste of alcohol) and tasted interesting with just a hint of tamarind. a perfect complement to the meal. the drink still packed a good punch even though you couldn't taste the \"punch.\"\n\nwe ended the meal with the 4 of us sharing a chocolate cake of some sort. i'm not a fan of chocolate cakes in general so i can't really remember how it tasted. the girls seemed to like it though. \n\nwe even got our hands stamped to get into tao (the club area) after we ate. totally worth the price!\n\nif you are in vegas and up for a nice dinner on the strip i would suggest tao for sure. great food, amazing drinks, good service and the ambiance is of course wonderful.", 
            "how do i say this, ok the food is mediocre at best. it's not terrible just average and not worth the hefty prices they charge for entrees. the best dish we had was the side of eggplant, it was really tasty and so much of it enough for 5 people. \n\nthe cock<mark>Tai</mark> were good but overpriced as well. \n\nthe best thing i can say about tao is the service they are very attentive which i'm sure isn't easy considering how dark and loud it is in there. what makes having dinner at tao worth the money is you get your hand stamped and don't have to stand in the unbelievable line that is waiting to get in the hottest club in vegas. once we finished our dinner we went downs<mark>Tai</mark> and out to get in the no-line, line we waited 5 minutes at the most. the club is <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> and i'm glad we went to dinner so we could just walk right in. \n\nnext time i go to vegas if i want to go to the club again i would go for dinner first, i would definitely go early the crowd is unbelievable. \n\nif your not planning on going to the club there are better asian-fusion restaurants so save your money.", 
            "omg amazing!  we went as a group of 9 people.  we all ordered drinks and the waitress was really helpful in helping us decide which ones to choose.  for appetizers we had the spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> roll and some scallop/<mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark>, gyoza, and some fried triangle thing.  the sushi rolls and gyoza were my favorite.  the triangle thing was good but it wasn't as good as the other appetizers.  i specifically ordered <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> pot lobster and other seafood.  it was good.  i tried my friends <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and it was delicious.  i only had a piece but it was perfect.  i would definitely recommend it!  the only thing is that it's kinda dark and after a cer<mark>Tai</mark> time the music starts to get clubby.",

            "tough for words to describe.  the evening is an event.  it starts at the bar and then to your table.  it's a very complete menu.  every item is prepared fresh.  standouts were <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> pot (lobster,<mark>Scallop</mark>, shrimp, and fish ).  the peppercorn filet is excellent. if you like traditional peking duck you will love this.  the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> is very different and a standout. for dessert be sure to get the donuts and the stuffed fortune cookie",

(going to vegas with all guys, never again!) that's fine by me, except the waiter said it in a mean spirited way and was pretty rude overall in my opinion. however the food was tao's saving grace. i also had the prime rib and <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> which was super yummy.\n\nmy friend ordered the kobe steak, which was amazing! it was so good, it deserves its very own paragraph! perfectly cooked and just made me fall in love with steak all over again. my friend was kind enough to share that delicious steak with the rest of our party. one phrase stands out to me from that night, \"the kobe steak was like an orgasm in my mouth.\"  i think the steak definitely bumped my rating from 3 stars to 4. again, it was really awesome.", 
            "went here for a birthday dinner.  it's my second time here and it was much like the first, fun because both times were celebrations and i enjoyed the company i was with but other then that this place is beyond overrated and i wouldn't come here on my own accord.  i had the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> which honestly could have come from pf changs where i would have gotten more and paid much less.  didn't bother with drinks because i'm just not willing to spend $14 for a drink.  waitress also tried to overcharge us for something that was her mistake and acted like she would try and fix it.  she did but acted like it was big deal.  i thought the large fortune cookie dessert was the best part of the evening.  very creative and shared with a group of seven.  some would recommend this place for date night but i probably wouldn't unless you like yelling to be heard.", 
            "grossly over priced chinese food that is mediocre at best. the pepper filet was ok. the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> was downright bad. \n\nthe pros are the dumplings and the atmosphere is nice.", 
            "first night in vegas and this was the first place we ate.  honestly, i have no idea what was ordered since i was able to enjoy the sharing plates that were already chosen by someone else at the table.  don't think of this as an authentic venture into asian cuisine, but rather a high end of your americanized favorites.  everything that came out was very tasty, a particular stand out was the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> which was outrageously good.  the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>, <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark>, various skewers of meat, ice cream mochi, were all tasty.  there wasn't a single dish that was ordered that i would have regretted ordering.  the waitstaff was a little kookey (his personality was incredibly bubbly in an odd sort of way) but he was very, very attentive to our table.  at no point did my drink empty, always presented dishes on the right, and people cleared our table quickly once items were finished.  the kitchen was equally able to keep the wait times between courses very minimal.\n\nambiance of the restaurant is pretty nice, kind of reminds me of sea in brooklyn.  they also had some pretty intense club music playing during the entire meal, apparently next door is a club so i guess that's kind of expected but it was definitely a club kind of atmosphere while we ate since the music was so loud.", 
            "when in vegas i like to experience different restaurants because there's so many to chose from. but tao is the one place i have no problem being a repeat offender at. the food and cock<mark>Tai</mark> are perfect!\n\nthe <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> is ah-mazing (i'm not a meat eater, but when i go on vacation i do, and i'm super picky about it). it tasted so so good. also, go for the avocado tempura. i've never tasted anything like it.", 
            "we ate at tao this past weekend for our groups official bachelor party dinner and it was a major success. i set up the dinner about a month in advance for our group of 14.  i did a lot of research at other spots for a nice set menu dinner, and we ended up choosing tao based on what they offered for the given price, and their great location on the strip. we almost did a steakhouse dinner elsewhere, but it would have come with less courses, and about $100 more per person.  \n\nanyway, working with the tao group was great. they provided us with a nice custom set menu, which really gives the dinner an 'official' feel, and always impresses the guest of honor. we all arrived and were greeted and escorted to the semi-private dining room which overlooks the restaurant. i was a bit shocked because i thought we needed 16 to get the room, but i guess based on our time slot and availability, we were able to be seated there.  this was awesome, and the whole group was way impressed already. \n\nwe had a great spread of food, and they did a wonderful job with the portions and dividing it up well based on the seating. it wasn't tons of food, but it was still a good amount to leave everyone happy. the peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> were a huge hit during the appetizer course. for our entrees, we went with <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> and the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, and then a bunch of sides. both were big hits, especially the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark>.  then the dessert course came, which was ridiculous. the spread they brought out could have filled everyone up if that was the only thing we ate. everything was amazing. \n\nalso the service was great throughout the event. no one seemed to be waiting for a drink which was awesome.  we were probably loud with speeches/toasts/etc, so having the semi-private area was perfect. \n\nall in all, everything went so smoothly from course to course, and we all left there in great spirits for the night ahead. every one of the guys kept giving me props setting the dinner up and praises for how the food was just right in terms of what we got and how much we got of it.  it was an awesome feeling and confirmed that we definitely chose the right place for our bachelor parfy dinner, so i wanted to share some of the credit by writing this review. \nbravo.", 
            "let me preface this by saying i made reservations for my hubs bday here before a show in the hotel, and notified the staff we had right at an hour and were in a timeline....as we walked in. i also before the apps and drinks were ordered notified the server of the time constraint and she said we were going to be fine. \n our drink order was taken and within 15 min or so had the apps and sushi we asked for. it all went downhill from there. as we ordered apps we also ordered entrees. i timed and it took 45 to 50 mins to get med rare seared tuna and <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark>. these item normally shouldn't take that long to cook if there are no large parties. i've worked in food and beverage service ,so i know. not once during this wait did our server walk by, apologize or offer excuses or even offer complementary items while we waited. i don't ever expect a comp in a place this fancy...but money or not, they wasted my time.  finally after the server came back by i grabbed her attention and demanded the manager. \n  with five minutes til show there was no way we would be able to scarf down, get the check and make it on time. the birthday dinner, and show were ruined. i ended up telling the mgr how this was a special event and that i had warned the server and hostess of our timeline and even asked if they could serve us in time or if we should come back. he offered a bottle of champagne and dessert. in tears i asked if i could just call him tomorrow if we ever decided to come back. he gave his card and apologized. \n  we made it to the show in the nick of time. later the next day i called the mgr and asked if we could just have our same dinner again, to which he agreed. ***** edit, i paid the $150 tab from the night we ate there that night and still left a tip of 15%***although i do not feel it was deserved, i will never stiff a server.  turns out dinner was lovely, relaxed and delish. we did add the mandarin sizzle <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> above the original order, but got the complementary bday fortune cookie to make up for the prior night. the entire tab was comped. i tried asking the mgr to let me at least buy the rice so i could tip the new server but he declined and said he hoped in november we'd visit the tao in nyc since we told him we were going. great food all in all but if you have a special event or are on a timeline please tell the mgmt staff to avoid a ruined bday.",

            "my boyfriend and i decided to visit tao after watching a cirque show. we were quite tired and hungry from all the walking, so all we wanted was a place to sit, relax, eat, and drink. tao seemed like the pretty obvious choice since we were staying at the venetian, but we were definitely wrong.\n\nwe walked into the dimly lit establishment and we were greeted by 3 individuals at the door. as if the doormen didn't scream \"pretentious\", we just had to walk in to find out more.\n\none of the hostesses walked us over to our table and said that the waiter would be over shortly. we waited, and waited, and waited and waited until my boyfriend looked at me with pity because i appeared to be very thirsty and no one had come to take our drink orders after 20 minutes! this is beyond ridiculous, imo, especially when there were about 3 waiters circulating in our area. as he grabbed my hand to pull me out of there, a waitress came by (in the nick of time), to say \"oh, where are you going?\" when we proceeded to say \"we were just about to leave\" when her slew of apologies came flourishing out and we felt obliged to stay. at about 25 minutes into our stay, we finally received our glasses of water. \n\nthat night, i decided to order the chicken <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> while my bf had the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark>. our waitress put a rush order in for our food and we were served in less than 15 minutes.\n<mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>- flavorless and watery. it almost felt like a pad <mark>Spicy Thai Dumpling Soup</mark>. i thought letting it sit for a bit would cool it down and let the sauce thicken, but that didn't help\n<mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark>- it was good, but it wasn't amazing. \n\nour waitress then decided to go on break and left us waitressless. we asked about 3 people for our bill because we had had enough, but it wasn't until 15 minutes later that we finally received our bill. my bf and i religiously tip our waiters, but this was just a downhill battle that tao would not win. tip? provide better service and don't rely on the hype around your establishment to make your food taste better.",

            "i have no idea what people are seeing in this restaurant.  this place is like a mediocre p.f. chang's you wait twice as long and pay twice as much for.  there are too many amazing restaurants in vegas to waste your time here. turn around and head out, do not pass go and save your $200.  seriously, if you have any sort of culinary expectations look for another option.  if you're looking for naked girls in bathtubs, this may be your place (although, no girls in the bathtubs the night we came). \n\na group of co-workers were all here for a conference and decided to try this place out since we were staying at the venetian.  we made a reservation for 8:30 and when we arrived were told we would be seated 'in a few moments' 40 minutes later (and a few times getting the run around by the guy in charge of seating), we finally got to a table.   \n\ntao highlights the modern asian fusion movement on their menu.  unfortunately they also have tried to mask their lack of flavor in dishes by <mark>Maki</mark> them overly salty or overly sweet.  this makes everything taste like it's a microwave dinner or some sort of bad chinese takeout.  \n\nwe tried the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> (way too much sauce that was overly sweet with very little spice element, kinda tasted like one you can buy out of a bottle), <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> (decent, but the shrimp toast was the highlight), <mark><mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark> Bao Buns</mark> (the pork was again way too sweet and the bun had too much dough to pork ratio, this was barely edible),  <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> (another overly sweet dish that was deemed not even as good as chinese takeout), <mark>Grilled 12 oz. Kobe Ribeye</mark> (no way this is real kobe, despite assurances from our server. it was tough and hard to cut, we had real kobe at gordon ramsey's the next night and there was no comparison) and a few sushi/<mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark> (decent, but the rice wasn't well flavored. we had better sushi at the buffet). \n\nour waiter was very nice and attentive, but there were cer<mark>Tai</mark> elements of dishes that were left off (rice for the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark>, asked for sauce on the side for a couple dishes that wasn't done).  all in all a truly regrettable experience from start to finish. their fortunes for their cookies were pretty funny though.",

            "friends were in town and they wanted to try the very popular tao restaurant.  (it's been reported that the tao restaurant is one of the highest gross-ranking restaurants in vegas!)  just as we were about to enter the hallway, this very large bouncer asks if he could help us and we mention we have reservations and then he allows us to proceed further.  talk about intimidating, and this was for a 7 pm dinner!\n\nwe were seated ups<mark>Tai</mark> on the balcony overlooking the huge buddha.  as menus were presented to us, the waitress asked if she could get us some water.  as i perused the flimsy two page menu, front and back, i didn't even know where to begin.  my fellow dining companions were quick to notice the 16 oz. grilled kobe sirloin for $150 and the individually priced nigiri pieces ranging from $3-$15 a piece.\n\nthe menu suggests that all items were going to be served family style, so we asked the waitress for a few suggestions.  i could barely hear her over the hum of the restaurant.  (i would not consider tao to be romantic at all.)\n\nin the end we decided to start with four different appetizers and two entrees.  and this is what we got:\n\n<mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark> ($14) - this came with five lettuce leaves.  a decent amount to fill all the leaves.  the squab mixture was a bit too moist and the bf found it too sweet.  i had squab juice stuff dripping all over my hands right off the bat.  there was a lot of flavor though and crunch, probably from the celery.\n\n<mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> ($16) - a clay pot arrived with 5 lobster-filled wontons.  very flavorful with slices of shittake mushrooms laid out too.  a very light and delicate dish.  \n\nsashimi of <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> with fresh wasabi sauce ($28) - beautifully presented on a circular clear plate with herbs on top.  we couldn't determine if they were already sliced apart or what, but with the meat being so delicate, just grab a piece and pull and the meat will tear gently apart.  lovely taste and clean.  however, i didn't recall a wasabi sauce or flavor to it.\n\npork <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with thai chili sauce ($11) - this order came with 3 triangles filled with pork, so we requested another order so we could all have a taste.  the <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> was decent, nothing particular special about it.  the thai chili sauce tasted store bought though.\n\nmiso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables ($34) - very good, but i guess the better question is when have you had a bad piece <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>?\n\n<mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark> ($26) - we must have misheard the waitress because we thought she said it came in a coconut curry.  it did not, but rather a sweet sauce with about five pieces <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> in it, including the drumstick.  it was okay, nothing particularly special about it.\n\n<mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark> ($4) - of course we had to order some rice!  we got two orders which is just enough for four people who aren't heavy rice eaters.\n\noverall, the food was good.  definitely overpriced though, and it's catered to a cer<mark>Tai</mark> kind of clientele.  you'll be amused to find things like kung pao chicken ($26) and grilled prime porterhouse with wasabi dipping sauce ($88) on the same menu.  we decided to pass on dessert as the waitress-recommended giant fortune cookie ($10) or fuji apple <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> ($8) didn't appeal to us enough.  (we actually drove over to luv-it frozen custard instead!)\n\nservice is a huge component of what makes this experience worth it or not, and tao fails in this department.  i was not impressed with the chatty young waiters who dropped (not placed) the silverware onto the table, reached across the bf to put things in front of me, and who 'hid' the menus behind my guest on his chair.  (uh, who does that?!)  as they moved our glasses and silverware to make room for our dishes, they did it in such an unorganized and messy fashion.  i felt like i was staring at someone's hands trying to do a card trick.  i'm used to the staff performing such tasks in an unnoticed way as to not disrupt the private conversation the dining guests are having.  the waitstaff should take a few lessons from rosemary's restaurant's waitstaff.  that's what i call service!\n\nat the very end of our meal, someone did come by and ask if everything was okay.  and it was...just okay.  they asked if we were going to the club afterward and i said yes and asked if they had any passes.  what they do have is a \"line pass,\" which is really a simple stamp on your inner left wrist so you can supposedly bypass the long line outside.  however, you will still have to pay cover.  (i think this part is rather ridiculous.  they should at least offer a discount on the cover instead.)  with the stamp being so simple, a washing of my hands right after dinner washed it right off.  not the best pass i would say.\n  \ntao restaurant is the kind of place you say you've been to and that's it.    there are better places where service is valued higher.\n\n$185 total, including tip and tax, no drinks", 
            "if i could, i would give this place 3.5 stars.  to start with, we had our reservations at 10:15 but didn't actually get seated until well over 10:30.  the interior decor was very exotic and i loved the big buddha inside.  \n\nthe food: i ordered the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>.  to be honest, i could not taste the wasabi much and the <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> were a bit too dough-y.  the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> was not very flavorful so i don't know if i would order that again.  the other dishes my friends had were delicious, especially the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the <mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark>.  \n\nthe drinks: my friends ordered lychee martinis and they were quite good.  i'm not a fan of sweet drinks but it had the perfect amount of lychee in it. \n\nthe dessert:  get the giant fortune cookie!!! \n\nthe service: it seemed like the waiter only forgot my things.  he forgot my drink... then he forgot the limes for my drink... other than that he was alright.\n\nthe layout:  the tables are very close together so it was annoying to keep bumping into the backs of people's chairs or have the waiters/busboys bump into the chairs.  also it was very loud in the restaurant.  i wouldn't recommend it for parties bigger than 4 because you cannot hear what people are saying. \n\nthe dj:  the guy who was spinning the night we ate there was awesome", 
            "i went to tao with three friends and we were very disappointed in our experience.   we were rushed through the entire meal.  the server kept hovering around the table to take our order even though we were just seated.  after we placed our order, he forgot to bring one of the appetizers.  then, our entrees were brought out before we finished our appetizers.  we were asked about dessert before the table was cleared.  it is unusual for four women not to want dessert, but we were just not up for any with the remains of dinner in front of us.  we did like the atmosphere.  the food was good, although i wish my meal, the <mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark>, was a larger portion.  overall, we were really looking forward to a nice night and meal, and tao did not measure up due to service issues.", 
            "when we called to make the reservation, they told us that you only need to order $5 + appetizers to get a stamp to get into the club for free and bypass the long line. however, when we arrived there, we were informed by our server that we must each order 1 entree from the sea, the land, or the sky, or 2 rolls, which would be 25+ for each. didn't turn out to be a big deal because everyone was pretty hungry. \n\ni would definitely recommend the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. it was delicious! but be sure to order a side or rice because it'd be too sweet without it. \nthe <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> doesn't resemble anything from panda express and comes in a large portion with a side of rice. not bad, but i'd prefer the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. \n<mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark> is a mystery. i am not quite sure what it is exactly, but it was juicy and tasty nontheless. \n\nand we got our stamps and got into the club with no troubles for the rest of the night. the dinner average out to about $40 / person.", 
            "wow....this place is wayyyyy overrated! this is coming from a chinese san franciscan who has had her fair share of real chinese food and the attempted crappy asian fusion foods.\n\nso a few friends and i made reservations two days in advance and this is how it works; if reservations are made they call us the day of to make sure we are still coming. i thought, okay they wanna make sure so when we come by they have a table ready for us....how spiffy. was i wrong! we all got there 5 minutes before our expected arrival hoping to get some food and then head to the club ups<mark>Tai</mark>. to my surprised, we get a pager and we are told to wait until a table is ready in ten to fifteen minutes. wtf?!! we confirmed earlier that we will be there and we come early and we still had to wait?!?!? mind you that we have not eaten and we are all starving so, we were pretty frustrated....and after fifteen minutes....no pager action so we head to the front and ask when we will be seated. the host looked flustered and told someone to lead us to the table. wow such \"wonderful\" service and it doesn't end there.\n\nwhen we finally got seated (also i was looking around when we were taken to our seats....there were plenty of open tables), i looked through the menu and decided what to order in like 5 minutes. i kept a timer near by me because i saw how much the waiter was passing us and it took them 20 minutes from handing out our menus to actually take our orders down. \n\nwhen we finally got our food, the only good thing about it was probably the plate it was on. i ordered the <mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark>. when i ate my first piece of it, i realized that the chicken was dry....not the way i like my chicken to be cooked. in addition, the chicken was coated with a ton of very sweet sauce. i tried using the sauce to moisten the chicken up but the sauce did not complement the chicken. i was very disappointed with that. i even a bite from my boyfriends food...meh it was alright.\n\nmy overall review for this place, we came in at 9 and didn't leave until 11 due to waiting for service to come by. i think we spent probably a good 75% of the time just waiting. so what do i say about the service, that it sucks! the food was not worth the taste or the price. i wasn't very pleased with the place and will not be returning to the restaurant to eat ever again.",

            "this restaurant caters more to the average night club goer than to the acclaimed food aficionado. with this in mind, the food was decent-one step above your local p.f. changs. we ordered a <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> dish with an egg as well as <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark> to start. the <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark> were fine but not anything great. the <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> dish came out with a whole cooked egg on top and the server continues to chop it and mix it throughout the dish. this creates an interesting <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> concoction. the appetizer created an almost creamy pasta like texture and taste. a pretty good take on the popular <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> dish. as for the main course, we ordered a few sushi rolls along with a chicken entree. the sushi came back average to below. the rice was cooked well, but i think the fillings held the sushi back. some tasted very cheap. the chicken dish (<mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark>) was very hearty, but extremely sweet-too sweet. onto the ambiance. the restaurant sported a cool modern asian decor.  what we couldn't get by was the extremely loud music, pounding in our ears, coming from the night club partitioned from the main restaurant. as far as the service, it was pretty good. our meal came out reasonably quickly, and our drinks were not empty for long. tao seems like a hit for the night club, but falls short for any major foody looking for gourmet asian cuisine.", 
            "a coworker and i ate here after our last night working a multi-day event in vegas.  we were exhausted and grabbing the redeye a few hours later back to boston.\n\nlet's say this first: every restaurant in vegas over-salts their food, because it's part of the bigger plan to drink your face off.  knowing this, i can't really complain about how salty the food was (which it was), because that's just sort of the foundation that vegas sets for you.\n\nmy coworker and i shared <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark>, a sushi roll, and an order of the pad <mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark>.\n\n...it was all really delicious.  i was honestly pretty shocked.  i come to vegas about 4 times a year for work, and i've managed to eat at my fair share of restaurants on the strip.  i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.\n\nwe also got an excellent table in the back of the room, but i think that's because a coworker called ahead to her contact at tao for us, since she'd done a reception there recently.  not sure if that affected our service, but the waiter was very friendly and chatty.",

            "they may say tao is meant to be a spiritual dining experience, but after our terrible night there i was closer to wrathful sin than enlightenment. \n\ni made a reservation at tao for the second anniversary of the first date i had with my girlfriend. we came all the way to vegas from san diego, and we were curious about tao's because of the interesting decor etc. \n\nquite literally the moment we arrived the atmosphere became oppressive. our biggest concern and the truly unforgivable factor in this ordeal was that the very second we arrived, there was a security guard playing on his phone who for some reason or other determined we were criminals of some sort.. he was large, caucasian, and messy haired (i only write this in the hopes that the management will read this review at some point and give him a stern talking to), this lummox of a man took one look at us and apparently instantly decided we were up to no good. i have no idea why, we were a young couple, well dressed, happily chatting etc. he didn't take his eyes off of us for the entire night, he followed us when we went to the host to claim our reservation (which just fyi took about ten minutes or so after our reservation time), he followed us to our seats, glowering the whole time. he checked in on us every now and again, just standing a bit away from us trying (and failing) not to be obvious about it. when we had eaten and we started to head out he was coming back to check on us again, the moment he saw us he turned back around and started speaking into what i assume was an earpiece. not subtle at all... my girlfriend at this point was incredibly upset; she didn't know if he was sizing us up as criminals, drooling over her (she is very attractive), or if he thought her mid length skirt was a sign she was a hooker or something (no way...her outfit was very tasteful). either way she walked straight out. i however walked up to our forboding shadow and asked if there was a problem and why he had been glowering at us all night. he responded with \"oh its just... nothing...\" and looked away. very nice, tao... treat your patrons like criminals and then halfheartedly try to cover it up with lies... \n\nbut that aside on to the restaurant itself. \n\nthe atmosphere at tao is admittedly very nice, trendy music playing constantly beats like the pounding heart of the restaurant. clumsy asian inspired art does its job in setting an oriental-fusion mood for the dining hall, watched over by a giant buddha, overdone but altogether nicely set. \n\nunfortunately the atmosphere is the best part of the restaurant. we had two people help us with our meal, a bus boy who was obviously better trained than any other member of their staff came, introduced himself, welcomed us to the restaurant and got us some water in a cordial yet amiable manner. i wish i had a better memory for names because if i could single him out for the managers i'd say he deserved a promotion.\n\nour actual waiter on the other hand never even bothered introducing himself, he was rushed and a bit curt if i'm being honest. but he did take our orders and get our food to us so there's that much... in his defense he did seem to have a full load in his section but it was still off-putting, that he didn't even say \"hi\", just \"so what can i get for you folks tonight\"... \n\nthe food itself was well... okay... i mean it was nice, don't misunderstand, it was good food. just not great, definitely not worth what they asked for. i had the <mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark> which almost seemed like it came out of a frozen meal package, and my lady had <mark>Spicy Chili Chicken</mark> which oddly enough was less spicy than my dish, in fact the chicken itself was rather bland. so the food was a bit of a let down too. \n\nthey were also out of most of my favorite beers, tiger, sapporo etc. so i settled for a warm kirin out of the bottle. not much to say other than well, warm beer. \n\nall in all i sadly have to warm away anyone who actually wants to have a good time in vegas. tao is rife with ridiculously bad staff and disappointing food. do not ruin your evenings as we did by frequenting this travesty of a restaurant.\n\nboy i wish we had just ordered room service..."

            "this restaurant sucks. service is crap!!!!! my boyfriend had made reservations through open table at 12:30am and so we got there and the hostess seated us. then........we waited a million gazillion bajillion years for someone to take our order. we got drinks first and that took another infinite amount of time. and after some more damn waiting.. the manager person man came up to us and was like, well no one is serving you because the kitchen is closed and this isn't open seating and you can't seat yourself. wtf?!?!? you're f'ing hostess sat us down retard... and we made a reservation so kiss my ass. then he got all pissy and that ruined the night so then when they opened the kitchen again we ordered two things to make their life miserable. opening the kitchen <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark> small things. service sucked ass at this place don't ever eat here. they wouldn't even come to us to give us the check so we just saw ourself out.\n\n\nedit: okkkkk it says on their website dining hours for dinner fri-sat are 5pm-1am.. how can we get seated at 12:30 and not get food?!?!?!?", 
            "i was pleasantly surprised!  much less pretentious than i thought, but the waitor was a little on the pushy side.  i suppose with the economy, vegas is hurting too so he's gotta \"make it work\".  other than that, here's the rundown:\n\n-sushi:  we shared a few rolls for appetizers and they were good, but definitely $$ for the portion.  we had a spicy, crunchy <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> and something else with yellow<mark>Tai</mark>; like i said, good, but i've had better at sushi wabi in chicago.  \n\n-drinks:  sake martini, waaaaay too heavy on the vodka.  left a stinging sensation in my mouth and not in a good way.  the other tini's were on the sweet side.  \n\n-dinner:  we had <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark>...must try.  it was tender, flavorful and a great portion size.  friends had chicken curry, nice and spicy and <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, also delicious.  i thought the entrees were all reasonably priced, especially for vegas.  \n\n-atmosphere:  lots of typical d-bags yelling \"vegas baby!!\" and lots of typical chippees in slutty outfits (us included).  but overall, no complaints.  we were seated on time, the service was efficient (our food came out really fast!) and $110 per person (dinner for six, split 5 ways for b-day girl) seemed like a pretty good deal for as much as we ate and drank.", 
            "is it fair for me to review a restaurant just based on the bar scene? stopped in for a few drinks with the wife on a wed night (dead). nice lounge feel to the front, cool music and the mood lighting created a nice relaxing atmosphere. \n\ndrinks were super strong; but so was the bill! $28 <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark> well drinks and ouch!!!\n\nthis place gets uber packed on a friday or saturday night so remember to bring your patience. flagging down one of the bartenders can become a rather trying , and frustrating task. oh yeah, sometimes they stick women in these bathtubs up from for a \"sexy\" look the club. kind of odd, but still cool nevertheless", 
            "i have been to tao before, though usually earlier in the evening and we liked it enough to go back. well, that is the last time i will be going there and also the last time i will recommend that anyone else go either. \n\nlike many of the other reviewers i had made a dinner reservation (far in advance) for a sat night dinner. the best time we could get was 10:15. after waiting in line for the \"reservation check-in\" we were told they would call us when our table was ready and they gave us a pager. well wait we did. we didn't get seated until and hour later! what kind of restaurant operation takes reservations and then makes you wait an hour anyway? that is really poor front of the house operation. \n\nfood: the shabu-shabu filet was terrible. it tasted like they had left the raw meat sitting out for hours. the <mark>Garlic Green Beans</mark> we all ordered tasted like they drenched them in fish sauce, and i could tell that they had not changed the oil in their fryer in quite some time as the <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> (both appetizer and dessert kind) tasted like rancid oil and were too hard to bite through! not one person at our table commented on liking their food. \n\nthe wait staff seemed to be attentive but that was only the first time our waiter came to the table. after that time we had to try and find our waiter to flag him down. when it came time to pay and we were obviously done for quite some time, he was nowhere to be found. even worse, three of us paid to have sparkling water instead of just tap water and when we were about half way done with our glasses, someone actually came around and refilled them with with tap water! if you are going to hire people who can pay attention or at least ask the question, then maybe you should serve your waters in different glasses since there are three options.\n\nafter our mediocre and ridiculously overpriced meal we went to go to the club ups<mark>Tai</mark>. they came around and gave us stamps at the table that would allow us access without waiting in the long line and without paying. when the first person got to the front of the smaller line he was charged entry <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark> to get in ($50!!). immediately we said, \"wait we don't have to pay\" instead of being able to credit him back for the charge or just giving him cash, the manager came over and gave him drink tickets instead. he acted like he was being soooo nice by giving him and the girl he paid for a ticket and then a second one each. what, 4 drinks for $50, not including tip?? geee, thanks so much for the generosity. to top it all off, the club sucks. cheesy, bad flow and really bad air flow. we decided to go up the tao beach instead to get outside and that was better as far as being able to move around and breath, but the cockroaches running around were a bit of a turnoff.\n\nwith all of the choices in vegas now, this place needs to step up their service and food quality or be replaced.",

            "although i love tao nightclub, tao restaurant pales in comparison.  we went for dinner and the food is decent, but slightly over-priced for the quality and portion size.  we had a nice bottle of wine, the <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark>, black pepper <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, and <mark>TAO Lo Mein</mark> with <mark>Lacquered Roast Pork</mark>.  the duck seemed a bit over-cooked, the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> was excellent, and the <mark>TAO Lo Mein</mark> was probably a poor choice and i'm pretty sure we've all had better at our local chinese restaurants...\n\nthe waitstaff was friendly, albeit a bit slow because it was so busy, and the decor was really gorgeous.  a bit loud, but the nightclub is right ups<mark>Tai</mark> so it's not surprising!\n\nbut the best part of the dining experience by far was the dessert!  we shared a truly awe-inspiring huge fortune cookie filled with white and dark chocolate mousse, complete with a huge paper fortune inside.  amazing and the main reason for the extra star!", 
            "i've been to the club here before, which will be reserved for a seperate review.  dining at tao is one of those vegas experiences that you will remember.  located at the venetian, which is like a lego-land comprised of the gritti palace and the royal danieli with st. mark's and the grand canal thrown in for good measure, tao is a buddhist temple amid this garbled baroque mess.  \n\nyou will need reservations here and expect to have a drink at the bar, which isn't all too bad considering the loads of eye candy hanging around, as if they are apart of the scenery, so you will be sure to see something that you like.  take the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to order a grey goose and soda, sit on one of the couches, and look at all the hot asian broads w/their raven tresses and wasp-thin waists, and the european bitches in their milanese high heels and tossed-boob salad exploding out of their wrap-dresses.  yes, yes, tres chic, i know. \n\nthe dining room is dim, crowded, and there's a thousand conversations going on at one and the same time.  not sure if i'd come here for a \"special occasion\" type of dinner, as in ask your girl to marry you or to tell your mistress you're married.  our waiter was cool, reminded me of a socal dude, like he'd hang out in venice beach.  \n\nfor dinner we started off with the spicy tuna tartare and <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> shashimi - both were to die for (the tuna was crisp and crunchy, and the <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> was like eating kobe tai, go figure).  with our main course (we both got the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>) we paired it up with the lobster and kimchi rice (again, an excellent choice). \n\ni'm a sake novice and was open to suggestion: we started off with the sake sampler, and with our dessert got the sake dessert sampler, i believe, and me and my bud both agreed that the cloudy voices in the mist was our least favorite - i walked out of here a bit rocked.  for dessert we opted for the giant fortune cookie.  \n\nin the end, $244.00 <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark> before tip, which, in my opinion, isn't bad at all considering what we got.  will definitely make it here again and do our best to revitalize the economy.", 
            "i ate here at the bar with my sis-in-law since we were going to the club afterward. it turned out to be a great idea, not only for the convenience of being downs<mark>Tai</mark> from the club, but also because the food was pretty good and the atmosphere was very fun. the decor was awesome and the layout of the bar/lounge was cool, except it gets really crowded before the club opens. our bartender was on top of everything the entire time (except for one thing that i'll get to at the end for emphasis) and our food came at a reasonable pace. the sushi here is about average based on what we got. some yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi and a special roll. tasty, decent portions, the usual. i have loved this place ever since <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark> reasons: the sake menu is extensive and the <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> carpachio is incredible! it's the best i've ever had and i've been craving it ever since! we had a great time at the bar and had some good food for the price... it didn't seem all that expensive to me for what we got. all in all, a great start to the night. \n\nnow here's the one thing that the bartender dropped the ball on and remember this if you eat there before the club:\n\nturns out you have to get a stamp from your server to get in ups<mark>Tai</mark>. even if you have a freakin receipt for $200 at that very place! so back to the bartender we go, then she says go to the front because she was busy i think. by then the front is getting slammed with bodies all wanting to get into the club so talking to the folks at the front was near impossible, not to mention maneuvering through the masses. so finally after badgering the people at the front, and some nifty work by my sister getting in with another crowd already lined up for the stamp guy, we got em and were good to go. that's a whole 'lotta nonsense for a stamp i know and just remember to get yours when you pay for your meal. lucky i didn't give 'em three stars for that cluster f#@$!", 
            "so after promising myself i wouldn't come back to tao to eat, here i am again with my fiance because it was 1130 pm at night and tao is one of the few restaurants still open. unless you want to eat mcd or panda express of course...which ain't nothing wrong with that. \n\nwe got good service but the waiter was so pushy about ordering drinks. sir, it's almost midnight and we plan to go to bed after this meal, we do not want your specialty rose flavored cat sake no matter if it's in season! \n\nwe ordered:\n\n<mark>Chicken Gyoza</mark> pan fried - super delicious. great with the barely sweet soy sauce it came with. \nbeijing <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark> - freshly sliced duck with crispy skin and crisp scallions on the side. plum sauce was good and did not overwhelm. moo shi pancakes were freshly made and melted in your mouth. \n\nso a good meal, although it is a bit pricy for the value of the food. i don't know what it is about tao, but it's also busy so it takes forever to get your food. we got our appetizer in 25 min and then another 20 min wait for the duck after that. \n\nkept our waters refilled and our dishes cleared. i guess i'd come back again for lunch, dinner just takes too long. \n\nvery very loud and dark.", 
            "tao is a beautiful restaurant and the food is very good.  especially the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> it was to die for.\n\nhowever the service was very bad.  our server was non-existence.  only came a couple of times and it took 10 minutes to take our order.\n\nhe seem pre-occupied and even when he took our order he was looking elsewhere. \n\nwe spent $200 <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark> people but i had way better service at denny's.\n\ni wish i had brought it up to the manager at the time but we were in a rush to get to a club.  i guess it's a hit and miss reading some of these reviews.  all else equal this would of been a 5 star but service was so bad it warrants only 2.", 
            "made a reservation, got seated in no time. had the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> which was pretty good. for entree i had the <mark>Typhoon Lobster</mark>. the lobster was delicious and surprisingly big. i had one piece of the <mark>Tai</mark> and couldn't eat anymore so i asked the waiter to pack it to go. by the time i got to my hotel and checked my leftovers, only potatoes and one piece of lobster was in the plate. i have no idea what they did to the remainder of what was left but i paid for it, therefore nothing should have been missing. real disappointment and it's hard for me to eat there again considering they showed me they are not trustworthy. when you're paying over $200 <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark> people to eat, they should have more respect for their customers!!!", 
            "my friend and i dined at tao on a saturday night and had reservations at 8pm and were immediately seated. this place was overall an amazing experience. the ambiance is beautiful, the staff is very friendly and the food was delicious. my friend and i started with the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> as an appetizer. perfect portion size and had a <mark>Uni</mark> and very flavorful taste. for our entree we ordered the <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark> and a side of the sausage <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> which comes with a fried egg on top and is mixed at your table in front of you. everything we ordered was exceptional! highly recommened for large groups or even a couple.", 
            "tao is the best ever. having eaten at their downtown location in manhattan, i was ecstatic to see that vegas had a location as well. i had an incredible, delicious, mouth watering meal here, but who would really expect any less from tao!?\n\nmy writing cannot possibly do the ambiance of this place justice. the vibe is dimly lit, serene, meditative, buddhist style meets sexy, bold, modernism. the decor is absolutely incredible, and we loved overlooking the giant buddha statue sitting on top of the coy fish pond. i could not get enough of how sexy and awe inspiring the decor was, hard to believe it is located within a resort. so, so, soooooo beautiful! everything is trendy and asian inspired.\n\nthe outstanding service goes beyond words. every staff member from waiter, to hostess, to bus boy was beyond friendly, high energy, had big personality, helpful, and professional. whoever trains the staff here needs to give lessons to every dining establishment in the country.tao does it right. the ambiance and price makes you feel like you're somewhere exclusive, but the service lets you know without a doubt that your service is appreciated. bravo, bravo, bravo. cannot say enough. \n\nnow...the reason there's a collective pile of saliva under me....the food. we can never decide what to order at tao, so we close our menus and make our waiter order for us, and they are always spot on. ordered the lobster dumplings as an appetizer. so flavorful, large dumplings with a delicious, full bodied sauce with mushrooms amazing. i couldn't even finish my share. for a meal we split the <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark>. the closest i've ever had to an out of body experience. holy _____. the crispiest, best, most tender, most juicy, most perfect duck i have ever had. we tried a new rice with chinese sausage and a fried egg on top whipped together right at the table for you...amazing. despite the full term food baby inside my stomach, and the hatred i had for myself for eating so much, i forged on and demanded that we try the fried bread pudding with vanilla ice cream, chocolate sticks, and bananas foster sauce...biggest smile ever. servers gave us awesome suggestions on things to do after dinner, but guess what i did? nap! :) \n\ni am so impressed with tao and this location lived up to every expectation i had. my favorite restaurant ever! \n\n**make a reservation!! we made ours a month in advance and got the best table ever, overlooking the 1st floor and right in front of the coy pond**", 
            "previously dined at tao on numerous occasions and had a satisfactory experience.  this time was different.\n\nmade a reservation for an 8 o'clock dinner <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark>.  arrived at 8 and the host informed us that it would \"be a while.\"  waited in the lounge to be seated for 45 minutes before we decided to leave.  i informed the host that we had been waiting 45 minutes past our reservation and still hadn't been seated.  he did not acknowledge me.  no apology, no explanation, not even a glance in my direction.  carried on with his business, whatever his business may be--it cer<mark>Tai</mark> doesn't involve hosting duties.  \n\ndespite having dined here before and having an overall positive experience, due to this most recent experience i will no longer be dining at tao."

            "i was in las vegas for a work event and two of my colleagues and i decided to try tau out for dinner. \n\nwe had reservations but still waited almost 20 minutes to be seated and were only seated at that time because my colleague went back up to the host stand. i understand that the restaurant was busy but expected that if the wait was that long (with a reservation) that the host would let us know. \n\nonce we were seated we decided to let the waiter (who had been there for 5 years) decide how we would attack the menu. his recommendations were spot on. we started with the <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> (which was tasty but had too much rice for me) and the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> (wontons were light and the lobster and sauce were rich - delicious). \n\nhe had us move onto sushi and had the <mark>Surf and Turf Roll</mark> and the yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce. the yellow<mark>Tai</mark> has a great balance of flavor and while the <mark>Surf and Turf Roll</mark> was good, it had almost too many flavors going on. \n\nwe moved onto heartier dishes like the wok-seared new york sirloin (which was good and way less expensive than the 12 oz <mark>Grilled 12 oz. Kobe Ribeye</mark> our waiter suggested), the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (he suggested two appetizer portions as opposed to one main which was the same price and we got more fish), and the buddha's vegetables. all were delicious and the perfect amount of food for the group. \n\nwe finished off with the oversized fortune cookie which came with a fortune for everyone and was fun to share. \n\noverall it was a fun dining experience as long as your are ok with sharing plates (which i am).",

            "they may say tao is meant to be a spiritual dining experience, but after our terrible night there i was closer to wrathful sin than enlightenment. \n\ni made a reservation at tao for the second anniversary of the first date i had with my girlfriend. we came all the way to vegas from san diego, and we were curious about tao's because of the interesting decor etc. \n\nquite literally the moment we arrived the atmosphere became oppressive. our biggest concern and the truly unforgivable factor in this ordeal was that the very second we arrived, there was a security guard playing on his phone who for some reason or other determined we were criminals of some sort.. he was large, caucasian, and messy haired (i only write this in the hopes that the management will read this review at some point and give him a stern talking to), this lummox of a man took one look at us and apparently instantly decided we were up to no good. i have no idea why, we were a young couple, well dressed, happily chatting etc. he didn't take his eyes off of us for the entire night, he followed us when we went to the host to claim our reservation (which just fyi took about ten minutes or so after our reservation time), he followed us to our seats, glowering the whole time. he checked in on us every now and again, just standing a bit away from us trying (and failing) not to be obvious about it. when we had eaten and we started to head out he was coming back to check on us again, the moment he saw us he turned back around and started speaking into what i assume was an earpiece. not subtle at all... my girlfriend at this point was incredibly upset; she didn't know if he was sizing us up as criminals, drooling over her (she is very attractive), or if he thought her mid length skirt was a sign she was a hooker or something (no way...her outfit was very tasteful). either way she walked straight out. i however walked up to our forboding shadow and asked if there was a problem and why he had been glowering at us all night. he responded with \"oh its just... nothing...\" and looked away. very nice, tao... treat your patrons like criminals and then halfheartedly try to cover it up with lies... \n\nbut that aside on to the restaurant itself. \n\nthe atmosphere at tao is admittedly very nice, trendy music playing constantly beats like the pounding heart of the restaurant. clumsy asian inspired art does its job in setting an oriental-fusion mood for the dining hall, watched over by a giant buddha, overdone but altogether nicely set. \n\nunfortunately the atmosphere is the best part of the restaurant. we had two people help us with our meal, a bus boy who was obviously better trained than any other member of their staff came, introduced himself, welcomed us to the restaurant and got us some water in a cordial yet amiable manner. i wish i had a better memory for names because if i could single him out for the managers i'd say he deserved a promotion.\n\nour actual waiter on the other hand never even bothered introducing himself, he was rushed and a bit curt if i'm being honest. but he did take our orders and get our food to us so there's that much... in his defense he did seem to have a full load in his section but it was still off-putting, that he didn't even say \"hi\", just \"so what can i get for you folks tonight\"... \n\nthe food itself was well... okay... i mean it was nice, don't misunderstand, it was good food. just not great, definitely not worth what they asked for. i had the <mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark> which almost seemed like it came out of a frozen meal package, and my lady had <mark>Spicy Chili Chicken</mark> which oddly enough was less spicy than my dish, in fact the chicken itself was rather bland. so the food was a bit of a let down too. \n\nthey were also out of most of my favorite beers, tiger, sapporo etc. so i settled for a warm kirin out of the bottle. not much to say other than well, warm beer. \n\nall in all i sadly have to warm away anyone who actually wants to have a good time in vegas. tao is rife with ridiculously bad staff and disappointing food. do not ruin your evenings as we did by frequenting this travesty of a restaurant.\n\nboy i wish we had just ordered room service...", 
            "it kills me to write this review. this is maybe the most disappointing dining experience i've ever had in las vegas. i brought a group of 11 here last thursday night. our waiter's name was bobby. he strongly suggested a pre-fixe menu due to the size of our party - it would come with appetizers, main dishes and dessert for $60 a person (pre-fixe means we have no choice in what gets brought to out table, fyi).\n\nso after we agree to the dinner, the appetizers made it out in about 20 minutes; and honestly, they were great. fried <mark><mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark> Bao Buns</mark>, <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>, <mark>Chinese Five Spice Short Ribs</mark>, some kind of seafood dumplings and three rolls of sushi. our table of 11 seemed satisfied with the amount of food we received for the first course. also, i thought all of it was delicious. \n\nunfortunately, this is where our fun ended. about an hour later, our waiter comes to our table for the first time since our appetizers were dropped off and asked if we were ready for dessert. we said, \"ummm, we'd like our dinner first!\". he acted shocked that we hadn't eaten yet. he left, came back a minute later and said that all of our food was delivered to another table accidentally and that he'd have a new round of food brought to us very quickly, maybe 10 minutes. well, 20 minutes later, we started to get upset. i told bobby that we had been waiting too long for our dinner. he tried to claim we had only been waiting 45 minutes, including the mistake. but i disagreed and he got a little upset with me. he told our table 3 minutes and our food would be out. so we waited. again. ten more minutes went by and i walked over to an assistant manager and asked him to please get our bill right away because we were leaving. i said we'd be happy to pay for our drinks and all the appetizers. he said that was fine. moments later the food finally came out. but it was too late.almost 90 minutes had passed and four people had left our party. \n\ntwo minutes later, bobby comes back to the table and announces that dessert is on the way - mind you, we didn't get any dinner. i told him to talk with his manager - we had already agreed to pay for what we consumed and we wanted to leave. he got more and more visibly upset with me and our group - he was also having words with the assistant manager after i demanded the bill.\n\nwe finally got the bill and it was $327 and change. for appetizers and about 13 drinks. we tipped %15 percent, even though our service was awful; and he never gave a true apology for screwing up our dinner. \n\nwhat stinks, is that i was the reason my group went to dinner here! i convinced them to go - and we all had an awful experience. even worse, literally no one from the restaurant seemed to care in the least. seriously, even the assistant manager admitted it was a long time to wait for dinner, yet after being there for a total of 2 hours, they didn't even comp the drinks. \n\nneedless to say, i will never go there again. and 10 other people will never go again either. its a good thing las vegas has so many awesome places to dine. and for that reason, you should avoid this establishment!!!",

            "i enjoyed tao very much.  my 2 colleagues and i had (family style):\n\n<mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark> - 'city chicken' with veggies, and hoisin and nice crisp lettuce leaves to wrap it up in.  one of the party was a little apprehensive but he ended up enjoying it quite a bit.\n\n<mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark> in a soy yuzu sauce. - these are so fun!  3 or so sweetish peppers then bam your mouth's on fire from a hot one.\n\n<mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark>\n<mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark>\nmr. wong's <mark>'Mr. Wongs' Jumbo Shrimp</mark>.\n\nall very tasty.  for beverage i had 2 mai <mark>Tai</mark> and they were excellent.", 
            "this is a really fun place to go with a group of friends and the food was well-liked by everyone in our 10-person group - especially the ladies. a bit pricey, but quite enjoyable nonetheless. \n\nwhen you have a large group, as we did, i would advise getting a lot of plates to share. you can always get more of anything you love. we started with sushi and moved on to <mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark> and <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark>, all of which was very tasty. personally, i love dim sum and i felt the <mark><mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark> Bao Buns</mark> to be about my favorite dish of the night. the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was probably the most popular dish among the group. tao also has several wagyu beef offerings and i haven't found too much fault with any of them.\n\nall in all, a great dinner in a great venue with plenty of ambiance. if the girls are having a good time, then i'm having a good time!"

            "it's probably no coincidence that i scheduled my afternoon full body massage at canyon ranch spa on the day that i was eating dinner at tao. sound body followed by a sound appetite makes scott a happy boy (an old buddhist proverb).\n\ni already knew what to expect from the tao experience, and it was a welcomed seductive relief from the venetian's baroque architectural jitters that hit me between the massage and dinner. feeling relaxed like gumby and dressed in my favorite black d&g suit, i rolled into our private party at tao with a few people on my staff...we were greeted by a friendly and attentive wait staff holding trays of <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>, ginger-chicken ravioli, and chicken ginger dumplings...i was stuffed before the main event.\n\nsince we had a large party, we did tao buffet style. here is the beef & reef sampling that i picked up along the line:\n\n- a piece of miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (delighted my taste buds. superb.)\n- a slice of wasabi-<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> (tender. vibrant. absolutely delicious.)\n- chicken in hoisin sauce (just okay. i've had better at saigon grill here in manhattan)\n- <mark><mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> Noodles</mark> (mildly nutty. tender noodles. the sweet & spicy flavor wasn't balanced enough for me...hey, i'm a <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> snob.)\n\nthe best part was the dessert. nothing is sweeter than watching the \"wtf?\" looks on the faces of people waiting to get into the nightclub as 150 of us are given priority access. oh well, sometimes membership does have its privileges. the rest of my evening is well-documented and sealed inside the vegas city limits ;-)", 
            "friends were in town and they wanted to try the very popular tao restaurant.  (it's been reported that the tao restaurant is one of the highest gross-ranking restaurants in vegas!)  just as we were about to enter the hallway, this very large bouncer asks if he could help us and we mention we have reservations and then he allows us to proceed further.  talk about intimidating, and this was for a 7 pm dinner!\n\nwe were seated ups<mark>Tai</mark> on the balcony overlooking the huge buddha.  as menus were presented to us, the waitress asked if she could get us some water.  as i perused the flimsy two page menu, front and back, i didn't even know where to begin.  my fellow dining companions were quick to notice the 16 oz. grilled kobe sirloin for $150 and the individually priced nigiri pieces ranging from $3-$15 a piece.\n\nthe menu suggests that all items were going to be served family style, so we asked the waitress for a few suggestions.  i could barely hear her over the hum of the restaurant.  (i would not consider tao to be romantic at all.)\n\nin the end we decided to start with four different appetizers and two entrees.  and this is what we got:\n\n<mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark> ($14) - this came with five lettuce leaves.  a decent amount to fill all the leaves.  the squab mixture was a bit too moist and the bf found it too sweet.  i had squab juice stuff dripping all over my hands right off the bat.  there was a lot of flavor though and crunch, probably from the celery.\n\n<mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> ($16) - a clay pot arrived with 5 lobster-filled wontons.  very flavorful with slices of shittake mushrooms laid out too.  a very light and delicate dish.  \n\nsashimi of <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> with fresh wasabi sauce ($28) - beautifully presented on a circular clear plate with herbs on top.  we couldn't determine if they were already sliced apart or what, but with the meat being so delicate, just grab a piece and pull and the meat will tear gently apart.  lovely taste and clean.  however, i didn't recall a wasabi sauce or flavor to it.\n\npork <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with thai chili sauce ($11) - this order came with 3 triangles filled with pork, so we requested another order so we could all have a taste.  the <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> was decent, nothing particular special about it.  the thai chili sauce tasted store bought though.\n\nmiso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables ($34) - very good, but i guess the better question is when have you had a bad piece <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>?\n\n<mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark> ($26) - we must have misheard the waitress because we thought she said it came in a coconut curry.  it did not, but rather a sweet sauce with about five pieces <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> in it, including the drumstick.  it was okay, nothing particularly special about it.\n\n<mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark> ($4) - of course we had to order some rice!  we got two orders which is just enough for four people who aren't heavy rice eaters.\n\noverall, the food was good.  definitely overpriced though, and it's catered to a cer<mark>Tai</mark> kind of clientele.  you'll be amused to find things like kung pao chicken ($26) and grilled prime porterhouse with wasabi dipping sauce ($88) on the same menu.  we decided to pass on dessert as the waitress-recommended giant fortune cookie ($10) or fuji apple <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> ($8) didn't appeal to us enough.  (we actually drove over to luv-it frozen custard instead!)\n\nservice is a huge component of what makes this experience worth it or not, and tao fails in this department.  i was not impressed with the chatty young waiters who dropped (not placed) the silverware onto the table, reached across the bf to put things in front of me, and who 'hid' the menus behind my guest on his chair.  (uh, who does that?!)  as they moved our glasses and silverware to make room for our dishes, they did it in such an unorganized and messy fashion.  i felt like i was staring at someone's hands trying to do a card trick.  i'm used to the staff performing such tasks in an unnoticed way as to not disrupt the private conversation the dining guests are having.  the waitstaff should take a few lessons from rosemary's restaurant's waitstaff.  that's what i call service!\n\nat the very end of our meal, someone did come by and ask if everything was okay.  and it was...just okay.  they asked if we were going to the club afterward and i said yes and asked if they had any passes.  what they do have is a \"line pass,\" which is really a simple stamp on your inner left wrist so you can supposedly bypass the long line outside.  however, you will still have to pay cover.  (i think this part is rather ridiculous.  they should at least offer a discount on the cover instead.)  with the stamp being so simple, a washing of my hands right after dinner washed it right off.  not the best pass i would say.\n  \ntao restaurant is the kind of place you say you've been to and that's it.    there are better places where service is valued higher.\n\n$185 total, including tip and tax, no drinks", 
            "everyone loves buddha, right? who doesn't? tao's got one, a 20-foot golden buddha gracefully staring down at you. now, that's what i'm talking about. this is vegas, baby, and it's all about money.  fyi, tao was the highest grossing indepenent restaurant in the us in 2006. ($55 mil, that's $16 mil more than no.2). they must be doing something right.\n\ntao's service was surprisingly great although we arrived 8-ish without reservation. we were seated promptly with courtesy. our server was super nice and informative, as he explained every single dishes we've ordered as they arrived at our table.\n\ninterior deco was as usual. check it out for yourself on their website. \n\nsome of the dishes we've tried:\n\nsmall plate: thai stuffed shrimp with garlic, lime, and thai chili sauce \nsmall plate: <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok roasted asparagus\n<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura of <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>\nchef's roll\ndesert: chocolate zen parfait\n\nthe food was all excellent, but this place is really more about the vibe and the people-watching. tao is a popular destination for private parties among celebrities. the bill came out to be around $130, including a couple of drinks. not bad for a fun dinner in vegas.\n\ni would definitely visit there again next time i go to vegas.", 
            "i've been planning my birthday for the past 2 months and tao restaurant was my destination.  reservations were for friday night 8:45pm. note: your required to confirm the day of the reservation before noon.  checked in with the matre' d was pleased to be escorted directly to our table.  it was already crowded with people at the lounge having drink while waiting for their own table?? there was 3 of us for dinner-2 guys and myself.  we were lead toward the back and seated at a table close to the sushi bar. before you read any further this review is truly dedicated the service and to our waiter vs. the food.  in celebration of my birthday we ordered a bottle of the yellow label and voss sparkling water. after reviewing the menu, i asked the waiter what recommendations he had, and even though we ended up not getting anything that was mentioned, i thought it was great that he had extensive knowledge about the food.  we ordered:  <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with grilled asparas, wasabe <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>, duck friend rice,noodles and short-ribs.  the food honestly was mediocre for the price that you are paying.  there are so much more comparable quality food here in sf  that don't cost and arm and a leg.  needless to say i wasn't too disappointed as my expectations weren't that high, and i was paying to be part of the scene.  now kudos for the service, the waiter was extremely courteous, came at the right times to offer service,and always made sure that glasses were always filled.  i'm a lightweight and only drank a glass of champagne, i thought it was wonderful  that he was so observant and only filled up my companions glasses and only towards the end of dinner did he offer me more.  and lastly because there was a male to female ratio at the clubs, even with a $300 dollar dinner i still wouldn't have been able to get in, he worked the magic and got all 3 of us line passes for the club because it was my birthday.  above and beyond.  \nin summary: tao restaurant is a place to see and be seen, just don't have too hight expectations about the food.  especially for those of you who live here in sf.", 
            "i had the pleasure of dining at tao this weekend. we had reservations at 7, which is early by vegas standards, but reservations were really hard to come by over labor day weekend! the atmosphere is drastically different than the rest of the venetian. i totally loved it. from the large buddha statue to the lighting, tao definitely has an awesome ambiance! i had the wasabi-<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>. this was to die for...i'm still thinking of it as i type! the wasabi gave the beefiness of the filet the perfect edge. i scarfed it all down! the rest of my party had sushi, which they thoroughly enjoyed. the best part is that we received stamps to enter tao nightclub as well. i highly recommend giving tao a try!", 
            "not sure how many places serve a deep fried <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> tartare sushi roll but i would gladly go to any place that does.  the wife and i really enjoyed pretty everything about this place.  the price wasn't so bad since we split the entree.  we got the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> which was very good.  \n\nsome of the prices of stuff we didn't order did seem a bit outlandish.  like $15 <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> (does that come with a foot massage?).  but whatever.  its a fun place for couples or groups.  we went on a wednesday night when the club was closed so it was semi-chill.", 
            "so we're in vegas--my first time, and i'm luv-in' it!  we went to tao tonight for drinks and dinner, sponsored by a trade association whose board my husband sits on.  so dinner was not on our dime, i never looked at a menu with prices, so i can't comment on how pricey the place is.\n\ni can say that the decor is the first thing that amazed me--loved it!  it takes a tremendously imaginative and talented person to create an atmosphere like this--which keeps you looking ahead to see what's around the corner and wondering what will astound you next\n\nthe next thing i noticed was the music being piped through the place--very hip!  loud but in a good way.  a later trip to the ladie's room revealed that there's a talented dj responsible for the tunes.  \n\nthe drinks kept coming and when it was time for dinner, we were presented with a lovely salad, followed by dinner served family style, including <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, an unbeleeeevable <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a gingery-garlicky yumminess to it, teensie weensie string beans, <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, and sauteed <mark>Sake Braised Shiitake Mushrooms</mark>.  ummmm..hello!  after dieting for 2 weeks in anticipation of this trip, my taste buds were trippin'!!\n\nnext up was an assortment of desserts, including a fuji apple tart-y thing with ice cream, a bowl of fruity stuff like tangerines, lychees, blackberries, raspberries and ice cream, chocolate lava cake and ice cream...on and on....this meal was planned to show me some love...ice cream and i, why, we're lovers!!!\n\nthe service was absolutely and completely im-pecc-able.  there was a staff of 5 or 6 dedicated to our group of about 40.  my water glass was never empty (or even close to it) and when i asked for a glass of sharp, dry white wine and the server came back with \"all she had on hand\" which was a chardonnay and i politely declined, she returned a couple of minutes later with an unbelievable pinot grigio that hit the spot.  \n\nall in all, a fabulous experience, and one i wouldn't hesitate to repeat on my second trip to this cool-ass town!", 
            "if i could, i would give this place 3.5 stars.  to start with, we had our reservations at 10:15 but didn't actually get seated until well over 10:30.  the interior decor was very exotic and i loved the big buddha inside.  \n\nthe food: i ordered the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>.  to be honest, i could not taste the wasabi much and the <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> were a bit too dough-y.  the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> was not very flavorful so i don't know if i would order that again.  the other dishes my friends had were delicious, especially the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the <mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark>.  \n\nthe drinks: my friends ordered lychee martinis and they were quite good.  i'm not a fan of sweet drinks but it had the perfect amount of lychee in it. \n\nthe dessert:  get the giant fortune cookie!!! \n\nthe service: it seemed like the waiter only forgot my things.  he forgot my drink... then he forgot the limes for my drink... other than that he was alright.\n\nthe layout:  the tables are very close together so it was annoying to keep bumping into the backs of people's chairs or have the waiters/busboys bump into the chairs.  also it was very loud in the restaurant.  i wouldn't recommend it for parties bigger than 4 because you cannot hear what people are saying. \n\nthe dj:  the guy who was spinning the night we ate there was awesome", 
            "it's more like 2.5 stars but i didn't pay my boss did, and i don't want to know how much he spent either.\nover all this place was okay.\ni admit the servers were very good, attentive, talkative, the atmosphere was not bad either but the food........ unbelievably average!!\ncoming from los angeles, i guess we are so used to good quality, high standard asian bistro type of food.\nmost of the food we had were so salty. i started to wonder if they wanted us to keep ordering wines and beers to wash it down.\n<mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> - tender and juicy good portion of beef , but why wasabi flavor bread crumbs outside???\nwe were impressed with the desserts, everything was yummy.  i can give 4 stars to their desserts.", 
            "i liked it.  not the best, not the worst.  my friend and i walked in at 8ish on a saturday night with no reservation.  (we'd tried to get one, but were told the earliest possible was 11pm).  the host was great and said he could get us a table in 20 to 30 minutes (yes, we were looking our gorgeous best that night).  turned out to be about 45 minutes, but was happy to wait since we grabbed a seat at the bar, ordered a glass of wine, and snacked on the wasabi-coated edamame, which were so very tasty.  \n\nafter our buzzer went off, we were seated at a perfect little corner table.  would have been perfect for a date, but alas, it was just my girl friend and i.  not that i mind. ninety-nine percent of the time i'd rather be with her than a date, anyway.  beautiful, opulent decor.  our server was very friendly.  recommended a half bottle of wine when we were both ordering a glass, which gave us more bang for the buck.\n\nwe shared the chicken dumplings (fine), the crabcake appetizer special (so, so good), and the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> (tasty and perfectly cooked). \n\noverall, a good experience. plus we got front of the line passes for the club. definitely tops it off nicely.", 
            "i've eaten here twice, on separate trips to vegas, and i've never tried a dish i didn't really like. it's cer<mark>Tai</mark> expensive for what's on the plate, but you're also paying for the ambiance and the exclusivity -- this place is a hot ticket in vegas. last night i sampled the appetizer of steamed chicken potstickers (very tasty) and the fish hot pot main course, which was full of delicious shellfish in a lovely spicy broth that smacked of lemongrass, garlic, chili, etc. sooo good. after finishing off the lobster, clams, <mark>Scallop</mark>, shrimp and calamari that were floating around, i pretty much wanted to drink the bowl dry, the broth was that good. my date had the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, which came with <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> and a few greens. i tried a piece of his steak and it was a really tender, delicious filet. our table was a group of 8 in total, and there was a special occasion to celebrate, so we asked what they could do -- they ended up bringing out a special sampler dessert for the table, replete with sparkler, and even wrote a message on the plate in chocolate sauce, as we'd requested. even the dessert (a giant fortune cookie filled with vanilla and chocolate mousse, a mochi sampler, and ice cream), was really tasty.", 
            "i read that you still had to wait with reservations. i think we waited like 15 minutes past our reservation time.  we were enter<mark>Tai</mark> by some strong cock<mark>Tai</mark> and a wandering saxophonists playing to the house beats the dj was spinning. i tried to avert the saxophonist but homeboy just could not let up.\n\nit is a beautiful restaurant. we were not thinking it would be a quiet romantic dinner. the husband and i did sharesies and had the spicy tuna tartare appetizer which looked like a roll, the rice had a crunch as if they put in on a frying pan...it was good.  memorable was the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>. it had a little kick only wasabi would bring. also memorable the crunchy spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> roll with crushed <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>. the <mark>TAO Lo Mein</mark> with pork- ah okay...but you can get that anywhere i think. the lobster and shrimp dumplings were good.\n\ndrinks were really good.  we enjoyed the people watching and the pulsing beats of the djs. it's vegas so don't expect bible study groups-it's all about the bachelors/bachelorettes and general party people. oh and ask for the stamp so you don't have to wait in the awful line", 
            "this place made my night.\n\ni must have gotten lucky because everything i ordered to eat was delicious (see my pics).  i shared the wasabi-en<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, sea-bass, <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, and salmon with udon noodles.  the rice wasn't anything special but each of the other dishes was delicious.  the sea-bass was amazingly cooked and the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> hit the spot.\n\nwe had a group of 15 and the service was ultra-efficient and super smooth.  i'm a huge fan of the decor of tao nightclub, and can say the same holds true with the design of the restaurant (tho it is a bit dark.)  \n\nthe servers were super friendly to us and at the end of the night as a perk for eating there, we got vip stamps to get into the club.  and i'm not talking about \"vip\" status where you get into a \"vip\" line and wait another f-ing hour.  at 10pm we left the restaurant and were in the club in under 10 minutes even though a line was building up outside.  considering i spent about $40 on the food, and entry into the club would have been about $20 anyways...well that's what i think anyone would call a good deal.\n\nif you're going to come and complain about the \"noise level\" take a pause and think about it.  what do you expect from a resaurant sitting below the club (with the same name, mind you).\n\nthe only weird thing to me now is that two of my favorite places in vegas have the same place ..tao and tao.  nightclub and restaurant.", 
            "okay, so this place is really hyped up .... but it didn't fall short.  really, the food is excellent -- the service pretty good -- the ambiance is exactly what you'd want or expect it to be.  they actually kept our reservation pretty close to the time we made it for.  so, the experience was a great one!  \n\nmy party of eight got a varied mix of food but i had the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> udon noodles and i have to say, they were pretty damn good.  surprisingly good.  :-) i came out feeling very satisfied -- and so did my entire party.  \n\ni really want to find out where that picture of the older asian man smoking the opium pipe can be found ... it was really beautiful.  anyway, enjoy tao folks.  :-)",

(if you do, try $20 or higher)\n\n- come with friends that are ready to party, because this is a party joint!  meet at the bar, so that if you have folks coming in from different hotels, you can enjoy the drinks while you wait.\n\n- once you're seated, order sharable appetizers, like the edamame, <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark>, or  thai stuffed <mark>Shrimp</mark>.\n\n- if you like sake, they have a pretty good selection of <mark>Sake</mark>.  if you haven't tried the nigori sake (unfiltered), i'd suggest at least trying that.  the best way is to ask the server to give you the rundown.we had the voice in the mist bottle and it was yummy!\n\n- for your entree, you must get miso-glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>!!  it's my favorite fish entree in the world!  savory white flaky tender bits of tasty fish... oh my.  it definitely melts in your mouth yet creates a flavor explosion.  so good!  my friend likes the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, but i think it's not nearly as good as the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.\n\ni've been to tao now for 3 years.  i've had a great experience every single time.  i now cannot imagine going to vegas without my <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> experience at tao.",

            "this place was surprisingly good. the interior is beautiful with asian influences, spacious, simple yet elegant, and very dim. the service was very good and timing of the dishes perfect! atmosphere was nice and seems like a nice, trendy, romantic place.\n\n- <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>: good, rice was crispy, sauce good\n- <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> udon noodles: delicious beef, noodles were good, balanced peppery flavor\n- seafood claypot: saucy, variety of seafood, <mark>Scallop</mark> were excellent\n\neverything was good and not overly seasoned as most fusion places do it. service was great and the atmosphere was nice. quite a pleasant surprise as i did not expect this hot club spot to have such good food.", 
            "tao is always one of my favorite restaurants in las vegas. not just for the great food but for the ambiance as well. the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> is so good. the filet itself is great but the added flavor of the wasabi crust make it both different and delicious as the same time. the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> though may be the star of the menu here. one of the tastiest pieces of fish i've ever had and anyone who i've ever been with here loves it. the spicy tuna on crispy race is great but not as good as the one at koi (although the portion size is bigger here). if you want to enjoy a great environment while you eat, hit up tao restaurant.", 
            "scrumptious! loved tao, we had an early reservation, 5 p.m. as we were going to see phantom of the opera, so i cannot verify the issues of other reviews who had to wait a long time even with a reservation.\n\nwe were promptly seated, and hats off to titus our server. he was fabulous. when asking for recommendations he was honest and truthful offering an explanation as to why he felt the way he did about a dish. he was attentive, friendly and fun to interact with during our dining experience.\n\nnow to the food, we started with the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, steamed and not fried and exquisite. the lobster was perfectly cooked, and the <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> was amazing, 5 wontons was a great starter, but left us wanting many more.\ni ordered the wok seared new york strip, it was seared to  perfection with a nice crust on the outside, yet tender on the inside. the sauce is bursting with strong asian flavors that are a perfect accompianment.\ntony ordered the omakase, which is sushi <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark> and is the chef's choice. he was thrilled with everything served on the plate. \n\nthe food was wonderful,so  we decided to break with tradition and order dessert, that turned out to be a good decision. we ordered the chocolate <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark> served with an orange dipping sauce, again, truly amazing, there is nothing better than something with a crunch and oozing warm melted chocolate. \n\ncan't wait to go back!",

            "good food, good service, good atmosphere. nice place to come if you're craving asian fusion or are celebrating something special. i do recommend you come with a fair amount of people so you'll be able to sample a little of everything as it is family style portions. items that stood out for me on the menu were the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, shitake mushrooms, and udon noodles. lots of mushroom which i like and you can taste a hint of the sake they used in it. the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was very fresh, tender, a bit fishy though so if you don't like the fish taste, i wouldn't recommend it. and last but not least, the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> was nicely peppered, grilled, and complimented the udon noodles well. all the other stuff we ordered like <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>, kung pao chicken, or the lobster wonton didn't excite my taste buds. the kung pao chicken had more vegetables then it did chicken. boo. the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> was dry and not enough sauce, also i found it odd to serve a thai dish at a chinese fusion restaurant. the lobster wonton were mediocre. would have been better if they were smaller or maybe fried. they had too much filling and were soggy. the little fortune cookies they give you at the end are kind of fun. they're chocolate cookies with your not so everyday fortunes :) service was amazingly fast, 3.5 stars for you tao!", 
            "although i love tao nightclub, tao restaurant pales in comparison.  we went for dinner and the food is decent, but slightly over-priced for the quality and portion size.  we had a nice bottle of wine, the <mark>Peking Duck for Two</mark>, black pepper <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, and <mark>TAO Lo Mein</mark> with <mark>Lacquered Roast Pork</mark>.  the duck seemed a bit over-cooked, the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> was excellent, and the <mark>TAO Lo Mein</mark> was probably a poor choice and i'm pretty sure we've all had better at our local chinese restaurants...\n\nthe waitstaff was friendly, albeit a bit slow because it was so busy, and the decor was really gorgeous.  a bit loud, but the nightclub is right ups<mark>Tai</mark> so it's not surprising!\n\nbut the best part of the dining experience by far was the dessert!  we shared a truly awe-inspiring huge fortune cookie filled with white and dark chocolate mousse, complete with a huge paper fortune inside.  amazing and the main reason for the extra star!", 
            "went here this past saturday for a friend's birthday dinner.  we were only able to get a 6:45pm spot because we called to make a reservation the day prior to arrival.  \n\ni love the dim lighting and overall ambiance of tao restaurant.  the place is bit noisy to be a romantic dinner date spot, but it suited our needs for the birthday dinner.  the club music playing in the background pumped us up for later.\n\nwe hung out at the lounge while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive and took advantage of the photo ops.  this place offers eye candy galore for both men and women...bonus!  \n\nitems we ordered:\n\n* <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> ($18) - my friends said this was tasty.  i didn't try any, so can't attest to the taste...although it smelled wonderful.  the wontons were served in a clay pot, simmering gently in it's <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>. \n\n* miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables ($34) - this dish was once again very delicious.  the fish was cooked just right...crisp on the outside and flaky on the inside.  the stir-fried veggies and fried tofu pieces rounded out the dish perfectly.  \n\n* <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> ($16 / six pieces) - i really enjoyed this roll, which consisted of spicy minced tuna spread thickly <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> cakes (cut into rectangular pieces).  \n\n* <mark>TAO Angry Dragon Roll</mark> with eel & kabayaki sauce ($15 / eight slices) - i enjoyed this roll, but it's just your standard eel roll...nothing special about it.  \n\n* kobe tartar tempura ($19 / eight slices) - the minced <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> was wrapped in seaweed, which was then encased in sushi rice and deep fried.  on the side was a bed of marinated, sliced <mark>Sake Braised Shiitake Mushrooms</mark> (which was sweet and delicious).  \n\n* black pepper sizzled <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with udon noodles ($29) - can't say much about this since i didn't get a bite, but it looked and smelled good.  the serving was plentiful, compared with the other dishes.\n\n* molten chocolate cake ($10) - this came with coconut ice cream, but they honored our request for vanilla ice cream instead.  \n\n* assorted ice creams and sorbets ($8) - served with a couple of almond sesame cookies.  \n\ndrinks: glass of scarbolo pinot grigio ($10) / tao-tini ($13) / orange dragon ($13) /  bottle of corona ($8).  \n\nfor our enter<mark>Tai</mark>, we witnessed this drunk lady that somehow ended up on the lap of the huge buddha.  she was posing for pics until security escorted her out.  i guess we're not supposed to sit on the buddha's lap?  darn!  \n\nanother great experience at tao restaurant.  i will always make it a point to dine here on every las vegas trip.", 
            "i tried giving tao restaurant a second chance, but it has still failed to redeem itself from previous experiences. a huge factor in my poor rating for this venue was the lackluster service. i called about 2 weeks in advanced to make a reservation for 7 and we still had to wait over 40 minutes for our table to be set. what's the point of <mark>Maki</mark> a reservation if we're stuck waiting in the lounge anyway? the hostesses were not very helpful or friendly either. \"your table will be ready in a few minutes\" turned into a dreadful prolonged standstill in our evening. i have the slightest feeling they dragged it out intentionally just to entice us to order drinks in the lounge, but we did not cave.\n\nfinally seated in the nippy upper level right in front of an overpowering ac system, us poor gals decked out in vegas-appropriate dresses shivered as well browsed through the menu. the fish clay pot i had my eyes set on was taken off the menu, so i played it safe and ordered the black peppered <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> w/ udon once again. it took me a while to regain the sensation in my tongue from the blazing hot flavor, but the rest of my friends thought it was pretty tasty. the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was one of the best dishes at the table. who knew such a thick, buttery, succulent filet accompanied by a pile of spinach could be so worthy of drooling-status. \n\ni still think the prices are overpriced for what you're getting. $18 for <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> is just flat out absurd. the only reason we decided to dine here was to get stamped for the nightclub so we could pass up the entire line with free cover. smart idea if you plan on dancing the night away at tao, but after this experience, i'd much rather scout for vip passes on the strip or find a promoter for a hook up.\n\nps: don't forget to bring floss if you order the black pepper <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>. i walked out front door with black specks all over my teeth. hawtness.", 
            "dinner here was amazing.  we made sure to get an earlier reservation (6:30) on a friday evening, so we didn't have to worry about the night club crowd coming or having our reservation be bumped.\n\ni had originally asked for a private table after reading reviews on here about some tables being too close to one another.  we were seated on the third level over looking the main floor and the table couldn't have been more perfect.\n\nthere were two of us having dinner this evening, and tao didn't disappoint (at this time slot) for a romantic evening.  the lighting, decor, and music were all absolutely perfect.\n\nwe started out with the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> and veggie dumplings.  he had a gin and tonic, i ordered a shirley temple  (unfortunately he brought me a roy rogers, but i wasn't going to whine about it and have him run down three flights of s<mark>Tai</mark> for another soda for this pregnant chick).  entrees were <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> and <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> with pork <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>.  phen-o-menal.  i have never had such good food enter my mouth.  i hate steak, and my husbands cut of meat almost turned me into a convert.\n\ndessert was fruit and sorbet, <mark>Maki</mark> for a perfect food ending to the experience.\n\nour server was just ok, but the young man doing the clean up work was the one who deserved the kudos.  just an over all pleasant guy.\n\ni suggest this restaurant to anyone...just make sure you go earlier in the evening, and i think you'll be hard pressed to bitch about anything.",

            "i was in las vegas for a work event and two of my colleagues and i decided to try tau out for dinner. \n\nwe had reservations but still waited almost 20 minutes to be seated and were only seated at that time because my colleague went back up to the host stand. i understand that the restaurant was busy but expected that if the wait was that long (with a reservation) that the host would let us know. \n\nonce we were seated we decided to let the waiter (who had been there for 5 years) decide how we would attack the menu. his recommendations were spot on. we started with the <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> (which was tasty but had too much rice for me) and the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> (wontons were light and the lobster and sauce were rich - delicious). \n\nhe had us move onto sushi and had the <mark>Surf and Turf Roll</mark> and the yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce. the yellow<mark>Tai</mark> has a great balance of flavor and while the <mark>Surf and Turf Roll</mark> was good, it had almost too many flavors going on. \n\nwe moved onto heartier dishes like the wok-seared new york sirloin (which was good and way less expensive than the 12 oz <mark>Grilled 12 oz. Kobe Ribeye</mark> our waiter suggested), the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (he suggested two appetizer portions as opposed to one main which was the same price and we got more fish), and the buddha's vegetables. all were delicious and the perfect amount of food for the group. \n\nwe finished off with the oversized fortune cookie which came with a fortune for everyone and was fun to share. \n\noverall it was a fun dining experience as long as your are ok with sharing plates (which i am).", 
            "this is a review for the tao restaurant:\n\ni know what you're thinking: style over substance.  i was thinking that too when i first walked into this restaurant.  it is like eating in a nightclub or lounge.  lots of well-dressed good looking people, and relatively loud music.  this place is a scene.  but you know what?  the substance was actually there for the meal that i had.\n\nwe shared a series of small dishes and main courses and were very impressed.  the substance was actually there in the food and the service was friendly and attentive.  a nice treat considering that i was expecting the worst.\n\nfor our starters we had the shrimp with peanut sauce, <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark>, the <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>, and the spicy eggland dish.  all of the dishes were quite good, flavorful, and had a good portion size.  the dish that really stood out here was the <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> which ranks up there with one of the best rolls i've had -- it packed a nice kick and the fish was fresh.\n\nfor the main courses, we shared the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, the <mark>Typhoon Lobster</mark>, and the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>.  the main courses were all delicious.  the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was fantastic as was the lobster.  it was all decadent and delicious.\n\ni would come back here as the food lived up to the style of the restaurant.  plus, you can a line pass if you eat here which allowed us to bypass the huge line into the tao nightclub and enter the club with no cover charge.  a nice bonus!", 
            "we went to the tao asian bistro that is a celebrity hangout in the venetian.  it is over 42,000 square feet, that boasts a nightclub, lounge and restaurant.\n\nthe decor is lush velvets, waterfalls , many <mark>Uni</mark> buddha sculptures and a hand-carved 20-foot tall buddha floating over a pond. \n\nthe food was awesome. kudos to sam hazen the executive chef who has created a menu that features specialties from china, japan and thailand. not going to list everything ordered, as that would make for a very long blog. but the highlights were the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, the addictive edamame, <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, a <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> dish that was unlike anything that i have ever had, and of course all topped off with a hot sake.\n\nthe only downside to the visit - even though we had reservations -  we had to wait an hour for a table. \n\nbut i will go back just for the dessert - chocolate and raspberry wontons served with tahitian vanilla bean ice-cream.

            "weak. i would say to go here only if you want to skip the line and get into tao nightclub.\n\nto get in you'll need to order one of their entree dishes or two sushi rolls. i got some sushi that i can't remember. i think it was the angry dragon and a spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark> with asparagus. both were just okay. some of my buddies got the black pepper <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with udon noodles. how would i describe it? salty! it was like they poured in some soy sauce and decided to leave the bottle titled while they cook the food. that dish was dissapointing. maybe we got some bad dishes, but gotta be more consistent than this!\n\nservice was pretty good, but the food was meh. go here if you want entry into the club. i wouldn't recommend it otherwise.", 
            "we really enjoyed our recent visit to tao. you really can't go wrong at this restaurant. there is something on the menu that anyone can enjoy. i am not a sushi lover but there were plenty of wonderful selections of other items. made our reservations in advance through open table and were seated promptly at the appointed time. our server was fantastic. very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. he made drink and wine suggestions and also brought me a sample of a wine he thought i might like since they didn't carry the one i asked for. these are the items we ordered: pan fried dumplings filled with <mark>Chicken Gyoza</mark> with napa cabbage and soy dipping sauce, <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark>, miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables, black pepper sizzled <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with udon noodles, and we were graciously presented with the giant fortune cookie which is filled with white and dark chocolate mousse for dessert as we were celebrating an anniversary. the decor is absolutely fabulous. you feel like you are in an exotic asian wonderland. there is a giant buddah in the dining room with a koi pond underneath. the restaurant has a lot of energy and is noisy. it's an exciting adventure both visually and culinary to visit tao.", 
            "we celebrated at the restaurant for my birthday.  the food our party ordered was absolutely delicious.  granted, i was a tad bit wasted by then.. but i remember thinking how great everything tasted.  i ordered the lobster kimchi <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, others ordered the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> noodles, and i forgot the rest.  in any case, i tasted all the dishes and have nothing negative to say.  at the end, the waiter brought me a giant fortune cookie which was scrumptious!  we had made reservations, but ended up waiting way too long.  besides the wait, i highly recommend tao.  great asian food and awesome ambiance.", 
            "food: 6/10 lobster wonton - not bad. the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was decent and the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> was pretty damn good. the presentation of dishes needs to be more de<mark>Tai</mark> oriented and creative. \n\nsake: 10/10 great sake! one of the best collections i've experienced outside of japan\n\nservice: 6/10 slow service. nonetheless friendly staff. \n\natmosphere: 8/10 a lot of buzz ... cool decor. \n\nvery underwhelmed on the whole as i had high expectations. one of the places i would recommend going to in vegas. \n\nun abrazo ;)", 
            "it was a crowded night when we went for dinner around 8ish. we got seated at the sushi bar and our waiter was with us right away. \n\nfood: arrived on a timely manner.\nsashimi special that was expensive- salty 9 piece with 3 different kinds of fish. the fishes had way too much salt on them! it did seem like a very good quality though.\nsome sort of <mark>King Crab California Roll</mark>?- good\n<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>- nice and tender with lotsa flavor.\n\nprice is kind of expensive, but good quality food. we also ordered 1 drink each. after all it is vegas. save up a lot of money so you can splurge!", 
            "tao restaurant is like pf chang's with tighter skirts, louder music and higher prices. (in case you didn't pick up on it - i didn't use pf chang's as a positive reference). \n\ni went with the fixed price menu and had the salmon which was okay. definitely had better for half the price. \n\ni did really like their <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>. we subbed out the wasabi that it comes with but it was a damn good <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>. \n\ni know tao nightclub is ups<mark>Tai</mark> but damn it was loud in the restaurant and i'm one of those people who always tell others to relax when they say a place is too loud. it really was way too loud. \n\nfixed price menu is $55. \n\nhonestly, it was only worth it so we could get stamped to get into the nightclub.", 
            "we,ll my first time here wasn't so great. aside from the food being pretty good. and the decor being super nice. the waiter was just being a dick to me and my gf at the time. prices were a bit steep as well. mind you this was a few years ago. so a couple of weekends ago, thought i'd give tao restaurant one more shot. to my surprise i was pleased. made reservations about 1045 pm. arrived around 1030 pm. waited no more then 20 mins, which wasn't bad. seated ups<mark>Tai</mark> overlooking most of the restaurant which was pretty bitchin. nice and dim lighting, asian writing on the ceilings. music i gotta say was a bit loud. to the point where i had to yell my order out to the waiter. but nothing too bad. had the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> and noodles. which was good. brother had the sausage egg and noodles. which to me sounds like a breakfast but he enjoyed it. my friend had the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark>. which was very similar to panda express, no joke. had some drinks and a bottle of cold sake. yeah with tip and all. still manage to keep the bill under $200. which i have to say is damn good. because at the end of our meal, we all got stamps to the club, with very little wait. all in all not bad. i might make another round here if i'm ever in vegas. only pet peeve the individual sushi prices were outrageous. lol.", 
            "7:30pm reservation.  arrived on-time and seated promptly.  the place was already packed and there was a good vibe.  not too loud, not too quiet.  our waitress was very friendly, responsive, and timely.\n\ndrinks- tao-tini..  they were good.  smooth and wound up putting back quite a few through the dinner.  didn't really feel the effects so i'm thinking the \"smoothness\" was perhaps just a lack of alcohol.\n\nthere was a chef's tasting menu being offered this night for an unbelievable $55.  super cheap.  both the gf and i went with this option.  first course- spicy tuna tartare over <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>.  yum.  she went with the thai stuffed shrimp.  again yum.\n\nsecond course-  <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>.. eh ok.  she went with the <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark>.  neither of us enjoyed as they were extremely bitter and wound up each only taking two bites.\n\nthird course-  wasabi crusted filet with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>.  two others at the table also ordered this and theirs was cooked perfect medium.  unfortunately i ordered the same temperature and was brought a completely rare piece of meat.  after taking the piece back to the kitchen, it returned 5 minutes later completely charred on the outside yet still very much rare on the inside.  i'm not one to send a piece of steak back twice, so i just left it alone.  i finished the 1/2 of my gf's perfectly cooked filet.\n\nfourth course-  chocolate <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> and a citrus dipping sauce.  very good and very rich.  j<mark>Uni</mark> apple blossom with vanilla ice cream.  nothing special, but good none the less.\n\nif we didn't get such a great deal with the tasting menu, i know my review would be completely different based on my <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> not being cooked to order two times, and eventually just giving up on that course.  with that aside, i did enjoy myself and the majority of the meal was very good.... btw... if you order a coffee with bailey's, it is brought out in a mug large enough to wash your hands.", 
            "came for dinner at tao hoping it would be similar to the nyc location. vegas was better in terms of service: arrived on time for our reservation and seated immediately and the servers were friendly, efficient, and extremely attentive. the atmosphere and decor is interesting and fun, and plenty of big tables for large groups. \n\non the other hand, tao las vegas is not so good with the food. same menu and in fact, we ordered several of the same dishes(salmon nigiri, peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>, <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, black pepper <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with udon) but they just didn't taste fresh and as the hubby says \"it tastes very vegas\" (translation: food made for the masses). it's a fun place for the ambiance but if you are there for the cuisine, there are too many other great places in vegas to try. i will save my next visit to tao for my next trip to nyc.",

            "i'm disappointed, tao. the first two times i went, you had this amazing delicious black <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> udon noodles dish that was an orgasm in my mouth. then you took it off the menu. now, you are not only overpriced and loud with crappy service, your food is mediocre at best.  \n\nwe had table reservations for 10:15 pm, and we were seated at 11:30 pm. granted we went on the night that jay-z went to tao the club, but still. \nour food took 30 minutes to come out. i wasn't even hungry anymore at this point and my friend took a nap at the table stone cold sober because we were so tired and bored. \nwaiter definitely didn't give a crap about us at that point in the night and didn't bother checking back on us. \nmy friend ordered the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and it was good, very soft and chewy. a bit too sweet. \nanother friend ordered the salmon on a bed of udon noodles and she said the noodles were not good. \ni ordered the wasabi crusted steak. it was good, but not worth the 2 hour wait and $35 price tag. \n\ni would not recommend. however, if you do go, definitely make reservations and try not to go on a weekend or when a huge star is <mark>Maki</mark> an appearance...haha. \n\ngreat sake selection. tao's a pretty awesome place to drink and dance (aka go for the club, not for the restaurant) and to see hot girls.", 
            "i went to tao for the 2nd time tonight for dinner.  the last time i went i had some sort of a groupon or something, and tonight my friend had a gift card she was given as a gift.  i think that's the only way i would dine here.  i think the food is overpriced, and if you're going to spend this much on a meal, there's other places in town i'd rather go.  maybe it's just me.\n\nwe started with two appetizers... the spicy tune <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> and the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>.  we had the tartare last time and really enjoyed it.  we enjoyed it again this time, but it wasn't as magical as it was last time.  the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>... well, they tasted like the best wontons i've ever eaten, but i could barely taste the lobster.  the flavor was drowned out from the broth, i thought.\n\nfor a main course, we split the most expensive omakase sushi menu, which was like $58.  very underwhelming how little food we got: one roll, 7 pieces of nigiri, and 6 slices <mark>Trio of Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi</mark>.  granted, one of the nigiri was toro, and the roll was a <mark>Spicy <mark>Lobster and Shrimp Spring Roll</mark></mark> of some sort, but for $58, i'd expect a little more.  throw some salmon nigiri in there!\n\nwe also split the coconut crusted shrimp with peanut sauce, which was really delicious, though the breading on the shrimp was too thick.  that was made up for in quantity of shrimp, as i think there were like 8 or so large shrimp.  it also came with a side of rice, and some sort of salad in the middle of the plate.\n\nlastly, we tried the avocado tempura since we both love avocado.  very tasty.\n\nwe stuck with water, and when our bill came, it was $140 after tax.  we did have a lot of food, but that seems like way too much to pay for a meal at a place like tao.  the service was top notch, and the ambiance is typical loud music, dark vibe that you'd expect in vegas.  so 4 stars for me.", 
            "damn!! they got us on the free admission to the club. when you do the math is not worth it. guys pay 40 and girls free. but our bill for 4 people was three hundred plus. ha! ok on to what we liked:\n\nambiance: great- kinda loud so good for groups.\nservice: this was good too, i guess it will depend on your waiter.\nfood: we had the kang pao chicken, shrimp coconut, <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> and the damn <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. (yes they push the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> to you)!! \n\nok, yes portions are small, but everything is very tasty. so basically you are paying for the chefs <mark>Maki</mark> it. we paired it with a bottle of wine. oh and the water. careful here, it is 8 dollars for distiller water. hahaha .. \n\nafter dinner we literally had to step out the restaurant to stand in a special line just to be directed to go back in. that's silly if you ask me. you will get stamped twice, that is silly too. at around 10pm when the club opens the crowd is not bad. however, this place gets ridiculous full of women. so men ... enjoy!", 
            "the cons:\n-we had a long wait(over an hour atleast) even though we had late night reservations, but it wasn't so bad. we had some drinks at the bar, talked to the bartender a bit and people watched. \n-when we were seated, i have to admit, i was a little disappointed with our table. it was one of those where you are right next to the neighboring table and share a booth with the stranger next to you. not that big of a deal really.\n-my husband had the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> w/ <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>. he was pretty disappointed. i felt bad bc i had talked him into getting this dish due to all the great reviews.\n\nthe pros:\n-my dish alone is the reason i would go back to tao and the reason i gave it 4 stars... the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was outstanding! best fish i've ever eaten. just the perfect amount of sweetness and it melted in your mouth like butter. \n\n\nsomewhere in the middle:\n-for an app. we had the <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>- good, not great. i was hoping it would taste like a similar dish i had once at katsuya in hollywood and it just didn't stack up. \n\n\nwill we be going back? doubtful. maybe if i go to vegas with some girlfriends in the future i'll have a chance to eat some more of that delicious fish, but i will not likely be going back with the husband.",

            "my husband and i were in vegas celebrating our recent marriage and we made reservations at tao for dinner. we were staying at the venetian, so it seemed appropriate that we went here for dinner, plus we heard you get free access to lavo (the other club at the palazzo) if you eat there.\n\nwe had 8:30 reservations and when we got to the place on a tuesday night, we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. the place did not seem that crowded, especially for a weeknight. anyways, once we were seated, we told the waiter about the reason for our trip and he said we would be taken care of! after browsing the menu we settled on <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> ($35) and <mark><mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> Noodles</mark> with chicken ($19) and we each had a specialty cock<mark>Tai</mark>. the <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> might have been the best thing i have ever eaten. it was fabulous. i know it was my husband's favorite meal of the entire trip. i mean, <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> from most chinese restaurants is pretty good, but then when you add <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> to the dish- it takes it to a whole new level! the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> was pretty good too, but the star of the meal was the <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark>.\n\nafter our meal, our waiter brought us over 2 glasses of champagne and we weer able to choose a dessert for free. we selected the yuzu sugar dusted donuts with a trio of 3 dipping sauces. omg these were amazing. they were warm and crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. the dipping sauces made this dessert extra special. \n\nwe had great service here, the decor was very romantic and i would definitely go back to this place next time i am in vegas!", 
            "the sushi i ordered was very good, but that's about it. the menu is extremely overpriced. so overpriced that the good sushi <mark>Lobster and Kim Chee Fried Rice</mark> isn't enough to bring it up to 2 stars. if i hadn't come here with gift cards i'd have been super pissed. the food would be 2- or maybe 3-star material if it was 1/3 the price, because given the quality of the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> in my main dish i promise you it wasn't worth the $40 they're asking. serving sizes are also small at any price, but especially for the prices they charge.\n\nthe filet is actually 7 or 8 very small pieces of meat, maybe the size of a mcdonalds chicken nugget. the whole dish is covered in an extremely artificial just-came-out-of-a-box tasting sauce, and the peppers lack flavor. the chicken that my fianc\\u00e9 ordered had potential and she was happy with the way it was cooked, but it was overall \"only okay\" as she says. i had a taste and hated it, but that was just the flavor. not something i would have ordered. also, i was probably jaded by my garbage steak already.\n\nwe ordered a side of pork <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> also. this was a semi-bright spot on the night. the rice was very good, and there were a lot of vegetables which we liked. big fans of veggies. but the pork in the rice was bad. it was small chunks and also tasted and felt like it had come right out of a box and popped into the microwave.\n\nnow the sushi was amazing. i don't remember what it was called but it was their special for the day or week or something, and included salmon, real crab, avocado, caviar, ginger (i think), and a spicy-ish sauce. this roll was absolutely delicious, and i devoured it in like 5 minutes.\n\nas a side note, the service was good. the waitress could have stopped by a little more frequently but it wasn't a big deal overall. she was very nice and our order was correct and our drinks were eventually filled.\n\ni have money left on my gift card after paying $150 for some of the most mediocre, fast-food level, processed tasting, overall low quality steak i've had in a long time. i'll use it for sushi or drinks but after it's used up i definitely won't be back.", 
            "exceptional service & food... we had a table of 9 our waiters were attentive and our food was exceptional... i personally loved the <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> & <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>.   the reviews almost scared me away.  i am glad i gave tao a try... loved the ambience of the restaurant.  we were seated right next to the large budda.. everyone in our party was pleased and had a great time...  thank you tao ... until next time", 
            "you can get a 5 star experience her if ...\n\nyou need order really well. the menu is hit and miss. both times i've been her i have had wonderful dishes ... and the well documented \"over priced chinese food.\" i'd personally go for the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>. if tao put as much love into all there dishes as they put into the atmosphere ... this place would be a slam dunk. but as it is both of my experiences left me wanting more attention place on some of the items we ordered.\n\ni would also recommend you take advantage of the free night club entry. otherwise you may feel like you paid way to much for the experience.", 
            "i appreciate a fine dining experience as much as the next guy and am cer<mark>Tai</mark> not opposed to dropping the kind of coin it cost for such an experience. however, tao in the venetian in las vegas was nothing short of a major disappointment. our dinner consisted of two people, one drink each, two apps, two entres (i had the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>) and one dessert. tab with tip was just short of $180.\n\nthe service was exceptional as expected but the food, our primary reason for booking this visit, was just average. i would suggest ra as i have eaten there a number of times and it never disappoints.", 
            "absolutely gorgeous restaurant located at the venetian. the d\\u00e9cor is incredible and although the restaurant is big, it's still intimate because the tables are located on different levels. we had the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> and both ordered the wasabi crusted filet. excellent food bursting with flavor. my husband normally doesn't eat seafood and he loved the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>. with the purchase of a main entr\\u00e9e, you do get access to the nightclub, but we were too tired to go at the end of the day. servers are very knowledgeable and professional. hostesses are gorgeous but very friendly.", 
            "you will read that this place is expensive, but i promise the food, the atmosphere, and the service is totally worth the money. if your tight on cash and can't afford to go big, then i suggest you order just one thing and that is the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables. it is just as good as the reviews claim it to be. buttery and tender <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> that melts in your mouth with a delicious miso reduction.\n\ni also loved the spicy tuna tartar bites served atop crispy <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>. there were 6 of them on the plate and the spicy aoili-like sauce on the plate was fabulous. \n\nlooking for a good bang for your buck?!? try the <mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark>, which are delicious and plentiful. we comfortably fed a table for six with them as an appetizer and asked for more lettuce \"shells\" to stretch them even further. \n\nohhhh if you are trying to go big, ordered the wasabi en<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>. the beef is super tender and the wasabi seasoning on the outer edge is <mark>Uni</mark> and incredible. the beef was also cooked to the perfect temperature.\n\ni would skip out on the satay, the sushi, and the chicken dishes. they are just so-so and i feel like that is when people walk away feeling ripped off.", 
            "we ate at tao this past weekend for our groups official bachelor party dinner and it was a major success. i set up the dinner about a month in advance for our group of 14.  i did a lot of research at other spots for a nice set menu dinner, and we ended up choosing tao based on what they offered for the given price, and their great location on the strip. we almost did a steakhouse dinner elsewhere, but it would have come with less courses, and about $100 more per person.  \n\nanyway, working with the tao group was great. they provided us with a nice custom set menu, which really gives the dinner an 'official' feel, and always impresses the guest of honor. we all arrived and were greeted and escorted to the semi-private dining room which overlooks the restaurant. i was a bit shocked because i thought we needed 16 to get the room, but i guess based on our time slot and availability, we were able to be seated there.  this was awesome, and the whole group was way impressed already. \n\nwe had a great spread of food, and they did a wonderful job with the portions and dividing it up well based on the seating. it wasn't tons of food, but it was still a good amount to leave everyone happy. the peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> were a huge hit during the appetizer course. for our entrees, we went with <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> and the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, and then a bunch of sides. both were big hits, especially the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark>.  then the dessert course came, which was ridiculous. the spread they brought out could have filled everyone up if that was the only thing we ate. everything was amazing. \n\nalso the service was great throughout the event. no one seemed to be waiting for a drink which was awesome.  we were probably loud with speeches/toasts/etc, so having the semi-private area was perfect. \n\nall in all, everything went so smoothly from course to course, and we all left there in great spirits for the night ahead. every one of the guys kept giving me props setting the dinner up and praises for how the food was just right in terms of what we got and how much we got of it.  it was an awesome feeling and confirmed that we definitely chose the right place for our bachelor parfy dinner, so i wanted to share some of the credit by writing this review. \nbravo.", 
            "**** review is for summer restaurant week 2013 menu ****\n\na friend joined me here for dinner last night before the human nature show and we both ordered from the restaurant week menu.  for the first course, my friend ordered the <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> with peanut sauce.  i got the \"crunchy spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> roll with spicy mayonnaise.\" we both enjoyed our dishes.  we didn't try each others dishes because paula doesn't eat sushi and <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> is just <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark>.  i did try the peanut sauce and it was good.\n\nfor course two, paula got the <mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark> with choy sum, sweet chili, and lime.  i got the <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> with shitake mushroom, bell pepper, and <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark>.  i did have some of the <mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark> and it was very tender and the sauce was excellent.  the <mark><mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Pepper Steak</mark> was very good.  the filet was sliced and barely <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark> with the vegetables.  the stand out was the sauce again!  it was rich and very flavorful.\n\nfor dessert, we again took different paths.  paula got the crispy fuji apple blossoms with tahitian vanilla bean ice cream and i got the chocolate <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>\n with kalamansi dipping sauce.  the rolls were good but they weren't stuffed with chocolate as i hoped they would be.  rather, there was some melted chocolate on a leaf and the rolls were placed on the chocolate.  regardless, they were good.  the dipping sauce was non-descript.  i really couldn't say it had much of a flavor.  it tasted more like mango than orange.  for paula's apple blossoms, they were triangle puff pastries with apple filling.  they were good.\n\nservice was very good.  my iced tea was refilled when it got halfway down.  the table was bussed quickly.  our server was very pleasant and he was pleased to know there was at least one local having dinner at tao.\n\nthe room is quite nice.  dark and woody with a large buddha in the center along one wall.  we got our cameras/phones out so we could get a photo of it.  it would be a good place to take a date if you wanted to impress.\n\ni can only can fit in two places for this restaurant week, and i'm glad tao was one of them!",

            "i went here with a group of friends to celebrate a \"birthday\" which turned out to be something else. the interior was nice but the food was a bit marginal for the price. i mean, c'mon! duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> for $15? <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> for $19-22? for one person? i'm not one to look at the price but this place made me do it. i could go to any asian restaurant for the same food but for less money and better taste.\n\nwe started the night with some tasty cock<mark>Tai</mark>. i wanted to try love potion #9 (grey goose cherry noir, cranberry and lychee puree) but angela h beat me to it so to be different,  i got a dragon slayer (bacardi dragonberry, ginger liqeur, strawberry and togarashi spice) instead. black pearl ((henessy black, blackberries, yuzu and agave nectar). the drinks were pretty awesome!\n\nwasabi-<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>:\nthis one was the best value for $38. good and tender filet. however,  this one came with fat...and i'm not a fan of animal fat.  the wasabi crust was great and not overpowering/sinus-clearing. 3.5/5\n\nmandarin sizzled <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with peking duck:\nthe duck was great and overall this was good <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>. but for $15 and a serving for 1 person? not so much. 3/5\n\n<mark>Lacquered Roast Pork</mark>:\nchinese bbq pork is what this is. you get about 7 slices of pork. i mean, it wasn't bad but it wasn't spectacular either. go to chinatown instead. 2/5\n\nthe highlight of the evening was the dessert sampler. it was a huuuge plate with all kinds of crazy chocolate desserts. we had a chocolate mousse, a giant fortune cookie filled with cream and chocolate, ice cream, souffle, wontons with chocolate, fruits...crazy!", 
            "if i was rating just the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, it would be a 4 star easily!  it was the rest of the items that pulled the review down slightly, as was the bang/buck ratio.\n\nthe <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> ($40) with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>. this was great! a little fatty which i loved, perfectly cooked, and the crust was very flavorful but not overpowering. a good deal considering the prices of the other dishes! go with the steak!!\n\nmandarin sizzled <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with peking duck ($15). this was good! it had lots of flavor, and a slightly larger portion than i was expecting...but still a little spendy overall.\n\n<mark>Lacquered Roast Pork</mark> ($13). this was a little chewy and the sauce was pretty thick. can't touch the cheaper versions in chinatown!  pass\n\nand to finish, the dessert platter. this thing was huge!! enough food for the 10+ of us! we said our dinner here was for an anniversary, so this monster was gratis! there were some goodies there...nothing amazing, but all were good! \n\nso again, if you come here...go with the steaks!  i wasn't impressed with the rest of the meal personally.\n\npics :",

            "this place is expensive, but absolutely worth it.\n\nevery time i go to vegas, i check this restaurant out. a few things i have tried here are the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, diver sea <mark>Scallop</mark>, and assorted sushi rolls. the wasabi crusted filet is amazing, however, i typically eat fish dishes here now.\n\nthe peking duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> are a great appetizer here amongst other things.\n\nas for drinks, i am not a martini fan in general, but i make an exception at tao. i will usually have a lychee martini here, and it is expensive like everything, but again reallllllllllly tasty. i have also tried the tao-tini and one other drink, and they were both tasty as well.\n\nfor dessert, molten chocolate cake. let me repeat that... molten. chocolate. cake. worth every last calorie consumed. save room for dessert, which will be hard, but trust me on this one.\n\ni have always received outstanding service here, and excellent food.",

            "pretty much all you need to do as a white person to determine if an asian or asian fusion type restaurant is worthwhile is to simply glance around the room at your fellow restaurant goers. are they mostly asian? if so, the food will be delicious at an appropriate dollar-per-dollar rate. if not, you are either probably getting crappy take out or are about to get food-fleeced.\n\ndon't get me wrong: the cuisine my fellow bachelor party-goers and i had here, from the admirable <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> to the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> was incredibly well-executed and tasty. but while i still enjoyed actually eating the meal in a flawlessly decorated room with its truly hip atmosphere, the ever-present knowledge that i could have had everything we ordered for a fraction of the price at many places in the san gabriel valley still sunk the experience.\n\nthat's just me though. i think if you're keen on unloading a boatload of money and you also happen to want asian food in a super-cool environment, tao could fit the bill. if you want something that's just as special and more reasonably calibrated, price-wise, there are a ton of other places in lv you might want to visit instead.", 
            "i've been to tao las vegas twice, and both experiences are in the top 5 best meals i've ever had. \n\ni think the key here is to get the tasting menu - basically, tell your server how much you'd like to pay per person, note any food preferences, and your server will put together a tasting menu which is perfect for groups who want to try a little bit of everything. \n\nfirst off all, we had incredible service. there were 5 us celebrating my friend's 30th birthday, and our server was energetic, passionate, and delivered a great experience. his manager was also phenomenal, and ended up comp'ing us with a second bottle of perrier-jouet champagne after he mispoured a glass. \n\nour server (i can't remember his name) told us that $50 per person would be more than enough to get everything we wanted, and he was right about that. all in all, he brought out three courses - two rounds of appetizers and tasting plates, and one round of entrees. it felt like we tried everything on the menu, and were so stuffed by the third round. highlights included:\n\n- <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with asparagus - honestly, out of this world. melt in your mouth, incredibly flavourful. \n\n- <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>\n\n- <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> with avocado and <mark>Soy Paper</mark> - probably the best sushi i've ever tasted\n\n- <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> - every bite was an explosion of delicious flavour\n\nin addition to the wonderful food and service, tao also has a great atmosphere - beautiful decor, good music, very trendy and sleek, filled with beautiful people. bonus is that you get free entry to tao nightclub after dinner, though we didn't find it that great (it was crowded and not fun). \n\nwould highly recommend tao for dinner!",

            "what an experience this evening was for me and my colleagues! i wanted to go to this restaurant because quite honestly it is always in the gossip magazines as the celebrity hangout. i had stopped by last year for a glass of wine but had never gone for dinner until last week.\nthe entrance is absolutely gorgeous with two rows of what looks like baths filled with roses. it has a low light vibe to it and a gigantic buddha that stands from ceiling to floor in the center of the restaurant. ambiance is fabulous. bring a light so that you can read the menu though! \nour server was lawrence who was an absolute delight from beginning to end. great humor and a lot of fun. i recognized him from an unfortunate episode on the kardashian's reality show. lovely lovely guy. \nwe started our meals with an array of delicious appetizers. the standout was the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>. my friend and i practically licked the bottom of the bowl. unbelievable. \ntwo of my friends ordered the steak which they both loved. the steaks came with three huge and gorgeous <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>. great presentation. my other friend ordered the sushi which was a hit as well. the entrees didn't hold as much interest to me as the appetizers so i \"settled\" on the coconut fried shrimp with spicy thai peanut sauce. i asked if i could get it not fried but told i couldn't. i think it is because of the volume of guests they have each night. disappointing as i would have been perfect if not fried. i was only able to eat two of them before it was just too much. i felt such a waste to leave all that food. the portions are very generous. \nwe finished the evening by sharing an order of the sugar coated doughnuts that came with vanilla and dark chocolate sauces and a caramel one as well. my one friend would not stop talking about them so even though we were full we had to at least try them. again we licked the bottom of the plate!! what a fabulous way to end the meal.\nthe food and the ambiance were both outstanding. to top it off though was the service. everyone we interacted with was just so friendly and professional. special shout out again to lawrence our server. i did stop dave (another server) at one point and he graciously took care of getting some sauces for me for the shrimp - at no charge and with a smile. i found the fact that the service to be so good of somewhat of a surprise. this is basically a tourist place and so i wouldn't have great expectations for the service and the fact it was exceptional makes this place even more special.",

            "beautiful restaurant, exceptional staff, and good food; my only negative was you're paying for ambiance and service, not <mark>Uni</mark> or authenticity of the meals.\n\ntao has an asian fusion vibe, not authentic, but not fake either.  the buddhist iconography and kanji gave a mostly chinese feel.  the restrooms were clean, but unfortunately had an attendant.  the restaurant was very crowded and popular, especially around the s<mark>Tai</mark> leading to the (disappointing) nightclub.  i loved our table; it was a cozy and comfortable booth, but was near the kitchen so my coat was repeatedly knocked off my chair.\n\nour waitress that evening was perfect; friendly, efficient, and nice.  we had the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>; it was succulent and i enjoyed lightly cooking each piece.  i enjoyed a beer and tea with dinner.  the host staff was funny and made me feel like our comfort was tantamount.  \n\nthe conversation was the best part of dinner, while people watching and taking in the ambiance.  this is a good place to try among the culinary smorgasbord present in las vegas.", 
            "great ambiance. i had the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, cooked rare of course, and was amazing. came with 3 lightly fried <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>.", 
            "this was my first visit here, for my birthday, definitely felt like a celebrity, seeing as though all the celebrities do eat here.  my girls made reservations for us, they did so good.  we were a tad bit late, but the hostess was nice enough to seat us within a good 15 minutes.  that was really sweet of her, because the place was packed, and i'm sure that's nothing new.\n\nonce we were seated, our waiter, i hate that i forgot his name, greeted all of the ladies with a smile, told us all about the specials, what's popular, all that good stuff to help us decide.  the restaurant was very dim, very dark, very sexy.  honestly, it was a little too dark, made it very difficult to read the menu, but that was nothing big to complain about.  because it was a group of girls, we all made the executive decision to order 3 or 4 appetizers, 3 or 4 dinner entrees, make it like family style.  pass everything around the table, everyone gets to taste everything.  now, i don't know if i got my hopes too high up for tao, but the overall meal, it was...good. not great, but good.  i wasn't disappointed, but i guess i was expecting out-of-this world cuisine.  \n\nhonestly, the best things, were the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> and the <mark>Pork Potstickers</mark>.  full of flavor, full of filling, the mango chili sauce on the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> was really good, so was the chili sesame glaze on the potstickers.  that was my favorite.  now, the entrees, it's not like they were bad, but i wasn't blown away.  if i had to pick one of my favorites, it would have to be the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>.  cooked perfectly, tender, flavor was awesome and the tower of <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> were a great match. a fun match.  i ordered the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, which melted in my mouth like butter, tender and flaky, but the seasoning was a little off.  it's like there wasn't enough.  but the quality was top notch.\n\nit was so sweet that they did bring me this giant fortune cookie, with a giant fortune on the inside, filled with sweet, smooth, velvety vanilla and chocolate mouse.  i mean it was so good and the cookie was just the cutest and so delicious.  the fresh fruit with the chocolate, i mean it was literally a sweet ending.\n\noverall, i would definitely recommend tao, it is definitely the place to be, always jumpin', always poppin' and it's really just a pretty cool place!", 
            "great environment and awesome decor that totally fits in with their asian theme of spiritualness. the food was alright and for the value it wasn't worth it. as most places are in venetian it was very expensive but the quality wasn't the best. if you want a nice restaurant with delicious reviews you should probably go outside the casino.\n\ni got the shabu shabu <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> with wasabi dipping sauce and the udon noodles with vegetable. the shabu shabu <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> was really good, though i don't prefer my meat rare done they recommended cooking it in the broth for 3 - 5 minutes which made it way to well done. so i was able to cook it 30 seconds and it was the perfect texture and juiciness. i mixed the wasabi sauce with real wasabi and that made the sauce for the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> even better. i enjoyed my main dish a decent amount and would give that a 4.5 / 5\n\ni didn't like the udon there was way too much salt and too much sauce, the sauce literally drenched the udon noodles and vegetables. the udon tasted very typical and nothing great, i'd rate the udon a 2 star.\n\neven though the ambience was really great our service wasn't the best, the waitress didn't seem to respect us (maybe because we were young) and not give us great attention nor was she the most polite.\n\nwent with 11 people and most of the people didn't enjoy their food because it was super expensive and the food was just average. if you want high-class food you'll want to try somewhere else."

            "lily s reviewed this place from her recent trip, and i was reminded to review it myself. i was there in march 2006, and i still dream about it. \n\nupdate: i found a stream-of-consciousness blog post i wrote about tao, so i am pasting it here:\n\nthe food- oh, the food! we ate at tao, the swanky upscale gorgeous gorgeous zen styled restaurant in the hotel, where our waiter looked like a cross between bruce lee <mark>Lobster and Kim Chee Fried Rice</mark> gere. both gene and i fell in love with him. we sat under a 30' high buddha who perched on a koi pond, ate delectable food and exquisite drinks. i had a mango something martini, which accompanied the loverly 'buddha's harmonized vegetables <mark>Buddha's Harmonized Vegetable Feast for the Minor Gods</mark>', among other sumptuous dishes. the place is so incredibly beautiful, in that <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> huge budget kind of way. the entry way is lined with bathtub looking pools, filled with rose petals and orchids, with floating candles in them. the walls are lined with buddhist statues inset in thier own little cubbies, the rooms are divided by floor to 50' ceiling white sheers. incredible. not usually does the food match the decor, but in the name of all things holy, it was incredible. each thing was more delicious than the next, and i don't know how they made the chocolate dessert thing we ate, but it was the most velvety, creamy incredible thing i might have ever eaten.", 
            "i enjoyed the food and the atmosphere when i was there.  i liked the giant buddha in the restaurant and the opiate pipes along the wall.  we ordered the lobster and shrimp dumplings and <mark>Buddha's Harmonized Vegetable Feast for the Minor Gods</mark> and enjoyed them.  the tuna pate was just alright, but then again i rarely enjoy tuna.  they also had a great coffee martini. oh and the giant fortune cookie was delicious!", 
            "if you stay at the venetian hotel in las vegas, it's hard not to see all the ads for tao. my boyfriend and i failed to get into the nightclub the night we arrived, but he wanted to give their \"spiritual dining\" a chance, so we ate dinner here the night before we left.\n\ntao is huge. and i love their asian-themed decor. but it looks like it'd be impossible to get a seat without a reservation. they just get that much traffic, and we still had to wait about 10 minutes before getting our reserved table. our server darren was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu and specials. there were lots to mention. just like sushi roku, we discovered that it's customary (at least in these fine dining places) to have two servers: one to take your order and check-in, and the other to bring you your food and drinks.\n\nit took us forever to order, but because it took us 5 mins. to figure out we had to close our menu to order. lesson learned! i started off my appetizers with an orient express cock<mark>Tai</mark> ($13) with kahlua and vanilla liqueur.  my <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> (which were green!) and crunchy cucumbers (japanese style, bitter like ginger) for $10 satisfied my grumbling stomach quite well. \n\nmy main was <mark>Buddha's Harmonized Vegetable Feast for the Minor Gods</mark>, which was an entree-sized udon in sesame & black peppercorn sauce with red pepper, onions, bok choy, asparagus, and brussel sprouts to top it off ($17). a vegetarian feast indeed. the dish came in a bowl which made it less messy than it probably would have been had it come on a plate, but i wasn't expecting the amount of spice. still, a great veggie entree (maybe the only veggie entree!).\n\ntip: the restrooms say \"yin\" and \"yang.\" yin is for the women and yang is for the men. \n\ndarren offered us a menu of \"temptation\" which was the right word for it. i could barely get any more food in my stomach so i wanted ice cream. and i got to choose 3 different scoops: white chocolate & yuzu, cocunut, and green tea with almond cookies and even pocky sticks ($8) - bonus. the thing is, i think the yuzu (a japanese fruit much like tangerine) was overpowering the white chocolate, or else they were two separate flavours and they brought me the wrong one. i couldn't finish the scoops anyway, because we also got two chocolate fortune cookies!\n\nthe vegas magazines say this restaurant is only a $30 meal, but we spent about double that including drinks, appetizers and dessert.\n\ntao restaurant is truly a religious dining experience as they say. you probably have to be the type to appreciate asian food, the 20-foot buddha foun<mark>Tai</mark>, and the ancient pipe display on the wall, but i'm glad i dined here on my trip - it's a restaurant like no other i've seen in any of my travels."

            "perhaps because kim kardashian, her mom, & co. were to the table to my right, and david spade and colin firth of snl were to the table to my left, tao failed to give me one thing i would have needed - a lobster bib.\n\nthat is the only thing that my tao restaurant dining experience lacked and who knows, had i asked, maybe they would have had one on hand. we had reservations for saturday night for 8:30pm to celebrate my 30th birthday. friends were gathered from chicago, nyc, and san francisco. we had a 45 minute delay in being seated at our table but that came as no surprise given the busy night. we were seated in the first floor dining area near the majestic two-story tall buddha statue. our server was courteous, attentive, and knowledgeable on the menu items.\n\nthe standouts for me appetizer-wise were the <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> and <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark> (i'm pescatarian and do not eat meat). my carnivore friends seem to enjoy the dragon <mark>Tai</mark> <mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark> and meat potstickers. through it all, the wine kept pouring.\n\nour entrees came and i was dazzled by my <mark>Typhoon Lobster</mark> with fingerling potatoes and spicy <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark>. this is when the bib would have come in handy because when i was done it looked like i had massacred an aquatic beast! fine food, great conv, surrounded by top notch friends -  this was an evening to be remembered. \n\ni will mention that the pair who ordered the peking duck for 2 were indifferent to it. the description had sounded amazing but did not live up to their expectations. everyone else enjoyed their food immensely though. then came what would make for buzz that this meal was a contender for best meal ever - the dessert platter.\n\nover the off-key singing of 'happy birthday' came the mother of all dessert platters. it included a scoop of ice cream, sorbet, molton chocolate cake, fruit, and a giant fortune cookie filled with white and dark chocolate mousse and chocolate buddhas. simply incredible and i am not generally a dessert person. \n\nfrom the moment you walk in to the moment you leave tao you feel as though you are experiencing something <mark>Uni</mark>, exotic, and daring. the decor is chic and sexy, the vibe hip and happening. thank you tao for <mark>Maki</mark> my birthday dinner one i will never forget.", 
            "my bf and i had dinner here one of the nights of our vegas stay. we were seated immediately. the decor was beautiful. i love the large buddha statue in the restaurant. the music was super loud. i suppose i was okay with that since i knew it turned into a nightclub afterwards. the actual nightclub is just located ups<mark>Tai</mark>. the service was okay. i didn't mind since my beverage cup was never empty and my food came out in a timely manner. \nwe had ordered yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce, <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>, <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark>, an assortment of tempura, miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, sand pot lobster/shrimp/<mark>Scallop</mark> with black bean sauce, <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark> and <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark>. everything we ordered was pretty much delicious. i cer<mark>Tai</mark> will be back to try other things on the menu. \ni loved how after dinner, we were allowed to walk ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the club without waiting in line or paying an entrance fee. we were stamped and set for the night. :)",

            "since we were staying at the venetian, we chose tao for our dinner destination the last night of our vegas weekend... my dad made the reservation in advance and let them know we were celebrating a birthday.  there were six of us in the party, and we actually all arrived right on time!  the hostess said it would be a few minutes, so we sat at a table in the lounge area, ordered some drinks, and snacked on some of the wasabi peas.  the waitress that took our cock<mark>Tai</mark> orders was sweet, and she made some great taojitos for the group!  at 8:30, we were wondering why we had to wait so long and getting a bit ansy... we finally were taken to our table around 8:40.\n\ndinner was amazing once we were seated.  chris was our server and took great care of us.  we enjoyed a round of appetizers including lobster dumplings, crispy tuna tataki, edamame, duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>, and eggplant tempura.  we also did dinner family style and shared wasabi steak, <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> with shrimp, crispy snapper, seafood in black bean sauce, <mark>Spicy Hoi Yin Eggplant</mark>, curry shrimp tempura maki, and pork fi<mark>Pork Belly Red Rice</mark>.  it's two days later, and i am writing this all from memory - it was that good!  (usually i would have to look back at the menu to remember what we ordered, but it all made a lasting impression in this case).  we literally cleaned all of the plates - everything was great, and quick too!\n\nluckily, even with all of that food, we saved room for dessert.  chris brought out a beautiful birthday cake for the birthday girl and boy (my bro and sis are twins).  i'm talking really quality, beautiful gourmet cake (like aj's in az).  it had \"happy birthday a & z\" written on it in chocolate and it was a vanilla layer cake of sorts.  \n\ni didn't pay the bill, and i'm sure it was expensive, but this was by far the best meal we had on the trip, and i'm sure it was worth it!  the only reason i'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the wait we had upon arrival - other than that, tao was amazing!  beautiful ambiance too - i'll have to go back next time to check out the nightclub!",

            "i understood this was more of a fusion restaurant and i really enjoy fusion, which is what this place is trying to pull off. i was hoping it would be somewhat of a glorified pf changs. i ordered the filet dish, however it was the most disgusting thing i have ever had. it was way too salty. they drowned the filet in black bean sauce. it was as if they had poured an entire jar of black bean sauce right over it. i wanted to finish my $80+ meal and plus i was hungry, but i could not get myself to swallow it was so salty. my friend ordered the kung pao chicken. she was gagging because it was so salty. we also ordered a side of <mark>Chinese Broccoli</mark>. how can you go wrong with gai lan?? again it was drenched in oyster sauce. we hardly touched our food because it was so disgusting. i am not exaggerating when i say you can get better tasting food from panda express. meanwhile we overheard one of the gentlemen sitting at the next table going on and on about how great his kung pao chicken was. i guess we all have our opinions and he obviously does not have any tastebuds. \ndon't go here. food is disgustingly salty. spend your money at the buffet instead.\ni noticed that vegas steak houses tend to make their steak extremely salty as well. maybe it's a vegas thing?"

            "to be honest, i actually loved this asian fusion restaurant. and normally, i'm not down with places where there's more caucasian people than asians. but tao is totally an exception. our party of 14 had reservations at 8:15 on a saturday night, and we got seated exactly at 8:15 (give or take a couple minutes). we had to get 2 tables, but our waitress was fabulous! she was sooo nice, i was expecting her to be sort of snobby because well, it's tao. i ordered the xo shrimp with rice and <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark> (beware, some items don't include sides such as rice and veggies. ask the waitress/waiter which ones do). it was fantastic. the shrimp was perfectly cooked, and the beans were so tasty. the rice was also cooked well, something i didn't expect, since it's so americanized at tao. boyfriend ordered the salmon with udon noodles. holy cow! i wish i'd ordered that, too! (not instead, but too!). luckily, he always has a small appetite, so we got to share!  perfectly cooked salmon, too. not dry at all, or bland. from what my brother said, the shabu shabu was also really yummy, and the broth that it's cooked in is nicely flavored.\n\nnot only was the food great, the service was incredible. people kept asking us if we were enjoying ourselves, and our waitress and waiter were not rude one bit, which made my cousin's 30th birthday so special for her. they recommended the dessert sampler, $65 for a variety of desserts (a huge fortune cookie, chocolate mousses, molten lava cake) and they stuck a sparkler in there so we can sing happy birthday to her. she loved it! and it fed all 14 of us. the desserts are fabulous! our party spent $845 a good amount of food, a couple bottles of sake, and a bottle of wine. not bad at all, in my opinion. i will for sure be there the next time i'm in vegas!", 
            "tao is located in the venetian. this place was packed on the wednesday evening i went. it has low lighting and a lounge-like feel to it. very trendy and popular. to start, i had the tao-tini. it obviously did its job since i barely remember dinner.\n\nfor dinner had:\nedamame-always a delicious choice\nalaskan salmon, crab and avocado roll (...i think...i don't remember...)\nhong kong xo shrimp with <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark> and <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>\n\nnow, that night was a little fuzzy, but i do remember the food being delicious! i hate <mark>Garlic Green Beans</mark>, so when i saw shrimp on a bed of rice, with green <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark> circling my plate, i was convinced i made the wrong choice. turns out long <mark>Garlic Green Beans</mark> aren't really <mark>Garlic Green Beans</mark>. they're just <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark>.",

            "this is a review for the tao restaurant:\n\ni know what you're thinking: style over substance.  i was thinking that too when i first walked into this restaurant.  it is like eating in a nightclub or lounge.  lots of well-dressed good looking people, and relatively loud music.  this place is a scene.  but you know what?  the substance was actually there for the meal that i had.\n\nwe shared a series of small dishes and main courses and were very impressed.  the substance was actually there in the food and the service was friendly and attentive.  a nice treat considering that i was expecting the worst.\n\nfor our starters we had the shrimp with peanut sauce, <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark>, the <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>, and the spicy eggland dish.  all of the dishes were quite good, flavorful, and had a good portion size.  the dish that really stood out here was the <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> which ranks up there with one of the best rolls i've had -- it packed a nice kick and the fish was fresh.\n\nfor the main courses, we shared the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, the <mark>Typhoon Lobster</mark>, and the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>.  the main courses were all delicious.  the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was fantastic as was the lobster.  it was all decadent and delicious.\n\ni would come back here as the food lived up to the style of the restaurant.  plus, you can a line pass if you eat here which allowed us to bypass the huge line into the tao nightclub and enter the club with no cover charge.  a nice bonus!", 
            "this was my second time dining at tao and this was a far better experience than the first. we were seated promptly in a romantic booth on the far side of the restaurant near the gigantic buddha on the first floor.\n\nif there was a way to take home and/or replicate the decor of tao, i would in an instant. (i'm a sucker for asian decor, but i digress.)\n\nthe service was phenomenal. our waiter was extremely knowledgeable on the menu, although he did try to sell us on the most expensive things available (go figure.) we had show reservations at nyny and we were finished with more than enough time to spare.\n\nmy boyfriend had the hamachi (yellow<mark>Tai</mark>) to start with. the fish was fresh and delicious, although the sushi rice left something to be desired. for an entree, he had the hong kong xo shrimp with <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark> and <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>, which he loved.\n\neating out for me has been pretty rough lately since i developed some weird food intolerances. there's very little in the way of flavorful food that i can have without giving me a terrible stomachache. \n\nsince i'm not a fan of seafood, i decided to go with the <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> with crunchy cucumbers and a side of <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>. these were the best dumplings both my boyfriend and i had *ever* had (and probably will ever have.) if you like vegetables at all, you have to get these. so full of flavor and healthy to boot! we joked at the end of the meal that we'd come back and just get four orders of these dumplings.", 
            "my bf and i had dinner here one of the nights of our vegas stay. we were seated immediately. the decor was beautiful. i love the large buddha statue in the restaurant. the music was super loud. i suppose i was okay with that since i knew it turned into a nightclub afterwards. the actual nightclub is just located ups<mark>Tai</mark>. the service was okay. i didn't mind since my beverage cup was never empty and my food came out in a timely manner. \nwe had ordered yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce, <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark>, <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark>, an assortment of tempura, miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, sand pot lobster/shrimp/<mark>Scallop</mark> with black bean sauce, <mark>Asian Green Stir Fry</mark> and <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark>. everything we ordered was pretty much delicious. i cer<mark>Tai</mark> will be back to try other things on the menu. \ni loved how after dinner, we were allowed to walk ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the club without waiting in line or paying an entrance fee. we were stamped and set for the night. :)",

            "so we're in vegas--my first time, and i'm luv-in' it!  we went to tao tonight for drinks and dinner, sponsored by a trade association whose board my husband sits on.  so dinner was not on our dime, i never looked at a menu with prices, so i can't comment on how pricey the place is.\n\ni can say that the decor is the first thing that amazed me--loved it!  it takes a tremendously imaginative and talented person to create an atmosphere like this--which keeps you looking ahead to see what's around the corner and wondering what will astound you next\n\nthe next thing i noticed was the music being piped through the place--very hip!  loud but in a good way.  a later trip to the ladie's room revealed that there's a talented dj responsible for the tunes.  \n\nthe drinks kept coming and when it was time for dinner, we were presented with a lovely salad, followed by dinner served family style, including <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, an unbeleeeevable <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with a gingery-garlicky yumminess to it, teensie weensie string beans, <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, and sauteed <mark>Sake Braised Shiitake Mushrooms</mark>.  ummmm..hello!  after dieting for 2 weeks in anticipation of this trip, my taste buds were trippin'!!\n\nnext up was an assortment of desserts, including a fuji apple tart-y thing with ice cream, a bowl of fruity stuff like tangerines, lychees, blackberries, raspberries and ice cream, chocolate lava cake and ice cream...on and on....this meal was planned to show me some love...ice cream and i, why, we're lovers!!!\n\nthe service was absolutely and completely im-pecc-able.  there was a staff of 5 or 6 dedicated to our group of about 40.  my water glass was never empty (or even close to it) and when i asked for a glass of sharp, dry white wine and the server came back with \"all she had on hand\" which was a chardonnay and i politely declined, she returned a couple of minutes later with an unbelievable pinot grigio that hit the spot.  \n\nall in all, a fabulous experience, and one i wouldn't hesitate to repeat on my second trip to this cool-ass town!", 
            "sort of embarrassed to say that we ate here twice on our 4-day trip - once to get into lavo nightclub free (although we thought the tao club would be open that night) and the second time to get into tao for free right after.\n\nvery good, perhaps slightly overpriced, (but barely) asian fusion food.  gorgeous, sexy d\\u00e9cor and lighting.  i had dumplings to start both nights, and veggie <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> the second night followed by a veggie sampler the second.  the <mark>Sake Braised Shiitake Mushrooms</mark> we had as a side dish were very rich on the second night.\n\na great value if you're interested in going to either club, but we weren't especially impressed with either club.  still a decent dinner choice on the strip.", 
            "my experience with tao's restaurant started before we even sat down to eat! i actually set up a reservation for a party of 11 with maria - the res manager a week before we were in town. she just had me fill out a very simple cc auth and we were good to go. \n\ngetting to the hostess stand can be a little bit of a journey as by the time you are getting in for dinner, people are already lined up to get into the club. once you make it to the bathtubs (best part of tao hands down) you are golden! \n\nand on to the food... \n\nstarted the meal with pork or chicken (sorry, i forget) gyoza. it was good but cmon baby, gyoza is gyoza. we also had the <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> with crunchy cucumber salad. both were so light and refreshing. \n\nmy entree was a wassabi crusted fillet with <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark> and a side of <mark>Sake Braised Shiitake Mushrooms</mark>. the mushrooms were so tastey and perfectly tender. i had when shiitake's get mushy. the fillet came out a true medium rare and the wassabi crust set it over the top. my spoiled ass even found a cab from napa on the wine list. **side note - don't you have being out of california and seeing whack wines on the menu?** \n\ntoo bad i didn't leave room for that giant fortune cookie i keep hearing about. \n\nafter dinner you can also get a stamp that can get you another stamp that gets you into the club for free!", 
            "went here this past saturday for a friend's birthday dinner.  we were only able to get a 6:45pm spot because we called to make a reservation the day prior to arrival.  \n\ni love the dim lighting and overall ambiance of tao restaurant.  the place is bit noisy to be a romantic dinner date spot, but it suited our needs for the birthday dinner.  the club music playing in the background pumped us up for later.\n\nwe hung out at the lounge while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive and took advantage of the photo ops.  this place offers eye candy galore for both men and women...bonus!  \n\nitems we ordered:\n\n* <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> ($18) - my friends said this was tasty.  i didn't try any, so can't attest to the taste...although it smelled wonderful.  the wontons were served in a clay pot, simmering gently in it's <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark>. \n\n* miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables ($34) - this dish was once again very delicious.  the fish was cooked just right...crisp on the outside and flaky on the inside.  the stir-fried veggies and fried tofu pieces rounded out the dish perfectly.  \n\n* <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> ($16 / six pieces) - i really enjoyed this roll, which consisted of spicy minced tuna spread thickly <mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark> cakes (cut into rectangular pieces).  \n\n* <mark>TAO Angry Dragon Roll</mark> with eel & kabayaki sauce ($15 / eight slices) - i enjoyed this roll, but it's just your standard eel roll...nothing special about it.  \n\n* kobe tartar tempura ($19 / eight slices) - the minced <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> was wrapped in seaweed, which was then encased in sushi rice and deep fried.  on the side was a bed of marinated, sliced <mark>Sake Braised Shiitake Mushrooms</mark> (which was sweet and delicious).  \n\n* black pepper sizzled <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with udon noodles ($29) - can't say much about this since i didn't get a bite, but it looked and smelled good.  the serving was plentiful, compared with the other dishes.\n\n* molten chocolate cake ($10) - this came with coconut ice cream, but they honored our request for vanilla ice cream instead.  \n\n* assorted ice creams and sorbets ($8) - served with a couple of almond sesame cookies.  \n\ndrinks: glass of scarbolo pinot grigio ($10) / tao-tini ($13) / orange dragon ($13) /  bottle of corona ($8).  \n\nfor our enter<mark>Tai</mark>, we witnessed this drunk lady that somehow ended up on the lap of the huge buddha.  she was posing for pics until security escorted her out.  i guess we're not supposed to sit on the buddha's lap?  darn!  \n\nanother great experience at tao restaurant.  i will always make it a point to dine here on every las vegas trip."

            "friends were in town and they wanted to try the very popular tao restaurant.  (it's been reported that the tao restaurant is one of the highest gross-ranking restaurants in vegas!)  just as we were about to enter the hallway, this very large bouncer asks if he could help us and we mention we have reservations and then he allows us to proceed further.  talk about intimidating, and this was for a 7 pm dinner!\n\nwe were seated ups<mark>Tai</mark> on the balcony overlooking the huge buddha.  as menus were presented to us, the waitress asked if she could get us some water.  as i perused the flimsy two page menu, front and back, i didn't even know where to begin.  my fellow dining companions were quick to notice the 16 oz. grilled kobe sirloin for $150 and the individually priced nigiri pieces ranging from $3-$15 a piece.\n\nthe menu suggests that all items were going to be served family style, so we asked the waitress for a few suggestions.  i could barely hear her over the hum of the restaurant.  (i would not consider tao to be romantic at all.)\n\nin the end we decided to start with four different appetizers and two entrees.  and this is what we got:\n\n<mark>Squab Lettuce Wraps</mark> ($14) - this came with five lettuce leaves.  a decent amount to fill all the leaves.  the squab mixture was a bit too moist and the bf found it too sweet.  i had squab juice stuff dripping all over my hands right off the bat.  there was a lot of flavor though and crunch, probably from the celery.\n\n<mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> ($16) - a clay pot arrived with 5 lobster-filled wontons.  very flavorful with slices of shittake mushrooms laid out too.  a very light and delicate dish.  \n\nsashimi of <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> with fresh wasabi sauce ($28) - beautifully presented on a circular clear plate with herbs on top.  we couldn't determine if they were already sliced apart or what, but with the meat being so delicate, just grab a piece and pull and the meat will tear gently apart.  lovely taste and clean.  however, i didn't recall a wasabi sauce or flavor to it.\n\npork <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with thai chili sauce ($11) - this order came with 3 triangles filled with pork, so we requested another order so we could all have a taste.  the <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> was decent, nothing particular special about it.  the thai chili sauce tasted store bought though.\n\nmiso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables ($34) - very good, but i guess the better question is when have you had a bad piece <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>?\n\n<mark>Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken</mark> ($26) - we must have misheard the waitress because we thought she said it came in a coconut curry.  it did not, but rather a sweet sauce with about five pieces <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> in it, including the drumstick.  it was okay, nothing particularly special about it.\n\n<mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark> ($4) - of course we had to order some rice!  we got two orders which is just enough for four people who aren't heavy rice eaters.\n\noverall, the food was good.  definitely overpriced though, and it's catered to a cer<mark>Tai</mark> kind of clientele.  you'll be amused to find things like kung pao chicken ($26) and grilled prime porterhouse with wasabi dipping sauce ($88) on the same menu.  we decided to pass on dessert as the waitress-recommended giant fortune cookie ($10) or fuji apple <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> ($8) didn't appeal to us enough.  (we actually drove over to luv-it frozen custard instead!)\n\nservice is a huge component of what makes this experience worth it or not, and tao fails in this department.  i was not impressed with the chatty young waiters who dropped (not placed) the silverware onto the table, reached across the bf to put things in front of me, and who 'hid' the menus behind my guest on his chair.  (uh, who does that?!)  as they moved our glasses and silverware to make room for our dishes, they did it in such an unorganized and messy fashion.  i felt like i was staring at someone's hands trying to do a card trick.  i'm used to the staff performing such tasks in an unnoticed way as to not disrupt the private conversation the dining guests are having.  the waitstaff should take a few lessons from rosemary's restaurant's waitstaff.  that's what i call service!\n\nat the very end of our meal, someone did come by and ask if everything was okay.  and it was...just okay.  they asked if we were going to the club afterward and i said yes and asked if they had any passes.  what they do have is a \"line pass,\" which is really a simple stamp on your inner left wrist so you can supposedly bypass the long line outside.  however, you will still have to pay cover.  (i think this part is rather ridiculous.  they should at least offer a discount on the cover instead.)  with the stamp being so simple, a washing of my hands right after dinner washed it right off.  not the best pass i would say.\n  \ntao restaurant is the kind of place you say you've been to and that's it.    there are better places where service is valued higher.\n\n$185 total, including tip and tax, no drinks",

            "pleasantly surprised by the food. i wanted to experience a trendy vegas restaurant and heard mixed reviews on tao (ny and vegas). however, i really enjoyed my dinner here.\n\nfirst of all, the decor is beautiful, albeit ridiculous. a restaurant called tao, filled with numerous buddha statues including the nearly twenty feet tall one in the main room, large photographs of sumo wrestlers in one dining area, and large color photographs of buddhist priests of varying ages decorating the hallway to the restroom, and the overall opulent decor? not to mention the crowd of tourists and revealingly dressed beautiful and less beautiful people. not sure this is what buddha intended but overall a very beautiful lounge and restaurant.\n\nwe had a reservation (thank goodness; the place was packed) but had to wait about a half and hour. we got a drink at the bar. yes, well drinks were expensive but not surprising for vegas. once we were seated, we had a nice view of the gigantic buddha. our server was very friendly and informative. i felt in general the waitstaff was attentive, even though the restaurant was so busy.\n\nas appetizers, we ordered the lobster dumplings in shitake mushroom broth, spicy ahi tuna on top of crispy <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark> (basically like nigiri) and the <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark>. the dumplings and broth were excellent but the skin of the won tons were a little thick. the spicy ahi tuna was yuuummmy. the <mark>Toro Toro Roll</mark> was the weakest dish. the fish was not very prominent, which was disappointing since i love toro. this roll was also topped with some sort of crunchy, sweet cracker-like topping that i did not love. \n\nwe also had two entrees: the black pepper flank steak and udon noodles, and miso-glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. the steak and udon noodles were okay; nothing special. the miso-glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was delicious and perfectly cooked. the vegetables it came with were somewhat of an afterthought but the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was so beautifully cooked that i didn't care too much.\n\ndefinitely a fun, vibrant, loud environment. overall, i was impressed by the quality and flavor of the food and i enjoyed the atmosphere.", 
            "nothing about tao restaurant would make someone who knows me well think i would like it.  the music's too loud, the food's too expensive, and it's just too long to sit down for me when i'm in vegas and there's a ton of stuff i want to make sure i have time to do.  but i come here for one reason, and one reason only.  <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  this place has orgasmic fish-orgy-in-your-mouth watering <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> ($34).  i look forward to eating this dish every time i go to vegas, simply accompanied by a side of <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>.  i also had some $14 appetizer of tuna tartare which was delicious but i could have done without.  topped off with a nice bottle of sake and we kicked off the night right.\n\ni was a little apprehensive about eating here with my friends on a bachelor party trip.  the thought of 10 guys eating at tao together late night made me think like we'd look like a bunch of freaks, but literally every table there was a large group of males or females, but not both.  makes sense right?  no one wants extra baggage in vegas.\n\nlast point....when you order water you better say tap or they're gonna bring you some voss and charge you $7 for it.", 
            "my friends and i were doing it big in vegas for a friends' 40th birthday and chose here for the celebratory dinner.  we had a 10pm reservation but had to wait an hour to be seated as it was *a busy friday night*.  come on it's always a busy night in vegas!  once seated we were greeted with such a sweetheart of a server all was well again.  taojitos and taotinis flowed while waiting for our entrees.\n\nthe <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> was good, nothing over the top.  the coconut prawns  were huge and well worth the wait.  chicken with veggies and <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark> weren't anything to brag about either.  $50+ per girl was expected in the venetian, but in the real world nothing was spectacular about the meal.  they did bring out a giant fortune cookie filled with pastry cream and topped with fresh fruit and chocolate drizzle for the bday girl, a definite added plus to make good on the hour wait.\n\nas a bonus you get in free to the club for dining first, but make sure to get the *line pass* stamp before leaving your table!!!", 
            "delicious!!!\n\nfirst time at tao and it was great! it was a 20min wait w/o reservation, which wasn't that bad if you are starving. anyway, had a drink at the bar and chilled until we were called....\n\nfor app--<mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> w/ mango chili sauce--amazing!\nentree--kun pao chicken w/ <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>....tasty!  \n\ni really enjoyed the food and the service was great! one of the waiters stamped our hand for the lavo niteclub...a pity we never made it there lol.\n\nnext time i'm in town, i will be stopping by...yep yep!", 
            "this was my second time dining at tao and this was a far better experience than the first. we were seated promptly in a romantic booth on the far side of the restaurant near the gigantic buddha on the first floor.\n\nif there was a way to take home and/or replicate the decor of tao, i would in an instant. (i'm a sucker for asian decor, but i digress.)\n\nthe service was phenomenal. our waiter was extremely knowledgeable on the menu, although he did try to sell us on the most expensive things available (go figure.) we had show reservations at nyny and we were finished with more than enough time to spare.\n\nmy boyfriend had the hamachi (yellow<mark>Tai</mark>) to start with. the fish was fresh and delicious, although the sushi rice left something to be desired. for an entree, he had the hong kong xo shrimp with <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark> and <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>, which he loved.\n\neating out for me has been pretty rough lately since i developed some weird food intolerances. there's very little in the way of flavorful food that i can have without giving me a terrible stomachache. \n\nsince i'm not a fan of seafood, i decided to go with the <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> with crunchy cucumbers and a side of <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>. these were the best dumplings both my boyfriend and i had *ever* had (and probably will ever have.) if you like vegetables at all, you have to get these. so full of flavor and healthy to boot! we joked at the end of the meal that we'd come back and just get four orders of these dumplings.", 
            "before we even arrived in vegas, my friend let me know that he had made reservations here for saturday night. i was skeptical. call be biased or snobby, but i don't like to pay a lot for asian food when i can get amazing food in chinatown for half the price. \n\nbut i went along with it anyway. \n\nwe arrived a few minutes before our 7:45pm reservation. my friend (who knows more about the nba than anyone i've ever met) caught sight of a small sign sitting outside the restaurant. the poster showed a just a pair of eyes and some small text. of course, my friend recognized right away that these were no ordinary eyes. these were lebron james's eyes. he read the sign with urgency. turns out, lebron was going to make an appearance at tao nightclub after eating at tao asian bistro. my friend almost fell over with excitement. \"i don't care what it costs, that's where we are going afterwards.\" i laughed and agreed that we would inquire. \n\nwe walked through the hall of little basins filled with water and rose petals, and the hostess welcomed us immediately. \n\nshe walked us through the restaurant, which is dimly lit and has a huge buddha on the first floor. the ceiling is decorated with large canvases of calligraphy writing. stunning displays of portraiture line the back wall and restroom hallway. the hostess seated us on the second floor. the ambiance was just the right combination of bustling, formal/casual, and you know, that vegas \"je ne sais quoi\". \n\nour waiter appeared promptly. he gave excellent cock<mark>Tai</mark> and entree suggestions, and when asked, informed us that i (as a lady) would get in free to the lebron party, and my friend would pay about $25. which i'm sure was deeply discounted. not only that, but we got stamps on our wrists to bypass the line. \n\ni ordered the blueberry/pomegranate martini and it was delicious. my friend loved the orient express (a coffee-based martini). the tuna tartare was amazing, and i ordered the special (which was a short rib udon). the food blew our expectations away. sure, it's a very expensive meal, but it's las vegas. \n\ni thought they did an excellent job of offering a fusion selection that didn't over-complicate. they stayed true to asian flavors and i liked that. \n\nthe service was hands down the best we experienced in las vegas. the chocolate fortune cookies at the end of the meal gave us fortunes that were hilarious, full of sexual innuendo, and right on point. \n\ni would definitely recommend tao. our meal was pretty much flawless, outside of the $5 bowl of <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark> (really? five dollars? it was perfect rice, but come on, i can feed a family for a month with $5 worth of rice). more to come when i write up the review of the lebron party at the tao nightclub.", 
            "i always make reservation here every time i am here in vegas. i love the atmosphere and the food is absolutely amazing! my favorite so far i would have to say the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> peppered steak with <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark> on the side. the cock<mark>Tai</mark> are strong and delicious. and on top of that if everyone in your party order an entr\\u00e9e it's free admission to the night club. it's definitely worth every penny.", 
            "this review comes after my 3rd trip to tao in the last year while visiting vegas on various occasions.\n\ni made my reservations on open table each time.  no issues, and the restaurant called to confirm on the morning of...unusual for an open table reservation in my experience, but not out-of-line in my opinion.  we have never waited for our table...always when we have arrived we are immediately taken back.\n\nfood, and drinks each visit have been exceptional.  my husband has had the <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> with shrimp toast, <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>, and the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  he loved them all.  i have tried the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> (before i was gf), the <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>, the pad <mark>Thai Duck <mark>Lobster and Kim Chee Fried Rice</mark></mark> noodles with chicken, and the <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> with peanut sauce.  if i could get this food from home, i would be eating here once a week...without a doubt!  \n\nwe have had great service on each trip with an offer of a stamp to enter the club as a vip after it opened for the night (bypassing the line, and the cover).  the club is a different review, but also a definite must-see at least once while in vegas.\n\nhint:  to address the \"which is which\" that people seem to have trouble with at the bathrooms entry... there is a statue outside each door.  one has boobs, and one has a penis.  this seems pretty self-explanatory to me, and i figured it out for myself on my first visit, after a few drinks.  seems like it shouldnt be such a big question?",

            "okay i will start by saying that the food was not at all what i was expecting when i made reservations at this restaurant.  upon arrival, the decor was very nice and i thought i was in for a treat.  well i was wrong.  \n\nwe started with a few cock<mark>Tai</mark>, which were good.  we ordered some starters, the edamame sampler (was good and the garlic wasabe edamame was an interesting twist on a favorite), <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> with shrimp toast (my soup was pitch black, and the shrimp toast was burnt on the outside but mushy on the inside?), and <mark>Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings</mark> (were overcooked, the skins were mushy).  \n\nfor entrees we ordered the <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, kung pao chicken (which was basically like sweet <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> chicken at most chinese fast food restaurants, but not fried), eggplant, and noodles.  after seeing the food i think the prices are absolutely ridiculous for what they provide.  the food is not flavorful in any way and i definently think that tao needs to revamp their dishes (all of them were <mark>Uni</mark>)\n\nat the end of our meal we did get a dessert which was a sampler of many of their desserts.  i have to say this was definently the highlight of a disappointing meal.  they had a sparkler on the dessert platter when they brought it out and the thing that caught my attention was the gigantic fortune cookie (which has white chocolage mousse on one side and chocolate mouse on the other side).  they also had some sort of chocolate cake with a melted chocolate inside, and a fried dessert <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark>.  \n\noverall i would recommend for the money you can find much better places to eat in las vegas.", 
            "i have to give tao five stars based on the fact that there was a waiter in las vegas who knew how to accomodate to a vegan. make that one that even knew what a vegan was. (i got some strange looks and questions on how to spell v-e-g-a-n from concierges at some pretty prestigious hotels/restaurants) \n\nso the vbf was happy and so was i. our waiter was nice and honest about what a vegan could eat and what was cooked with chicken stock. had egg, etc. he also mentioned meat/chicken/fish dishes that could be substituted with tofu. i loved my duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> and my roll was delicious. plates were well-timed and we didn't have to do much waiting. the decor is pretty much like every asian fusion higher-end restaurant in the west coast. prices are very reasonable.\n\ntry their version of the mojito, it's delicious!!", 
            "this place made my night.\n\ni must have gotten lucky because everything i ordered to eat was delicious (see my pics).  i shared the wasabi-en<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>, sea-bass, <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, and salmon with udon noodles.  the rice wasn't anything special but each of the other dishes was delicious.  the sea-bass was amazingly cooked and the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> hit the spot.\n\nwe had a group of 15 and the service was ultra-efficient and super smooth.  i'm a huge fan of the decor of tao nightclub, and can say the same holds true with the design of the restaurant (tho it is a bit dark.)  \n\nthe servers were super friendly to us and at the end of the night as a perk for eating there, we got vip stamps to get into the club.  and i'm not talking about \"vip\" status where you get into a \"vip\" line and wait another f-ing hour.  at 10pm we left the restaurant and were in the club in under 10 minutes even though a line was building up outside.  considering i spent about $40 on the food, and entry into the club would have been about $20 anyways...well that's what i think anyone would call a good deal.\n\nif you're going to come and complain about the \"noise level\" take a pause and think about it.  what do you expect from a resaurant sitting below the club (with the same name, mind you).\n\nthe only weird thing to me now is that two of my favorite places in vegas have the same place ..tao and tao.  nightclub and restaurant.", 
            "i totally get it.  the promoters/owners lure you into tao restaurant, ply you with yummy food and drink, and then convince you that tao nightclub is just as upscale and well-done.  don't fall for it!  just eat the food, drink the booze, and leave!  you'll have a better night for it.\n\ntao restaurant is amazing.  i loved the decor, the service, the short wait, and of course the food.  this behemoth of a restaurant does asian fusion right.  i had the tao-tini (after my requisite dirty grey goose on the rocks).  fruity, strong as all hell, and delicious.  my pic and i started with the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>.  best.  dish.  ever.  next time i go back, that's all i'm ordering.  we also had the lobster dumplings to start.  good.  but definitely not the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>.\n\nwe then ordered the thai fish hot pot, which had a very strong sauce, overpowering on its own, but perfect with steamed rice.  we made the mistake of ordering veggie <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>.  why were we trying to be healthy? anyway, what came was a plate of veggies + mush.  ugh.  panda express makes a better <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> than that!\n\nupon leaving the venetian, my pic and i decided that next time, we're just ordering 6 servings of the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>.  and then heading to jet to shake it all off!\n\np.s.  one of my students told me that her group of friends was offered free dinner + drinks + tao admission the same weekend.  so if you have a group of 10+ cute asian girls, you may get dinner for free!  otherwise, expect to spend about $50/person, not including drinks.", 
            "was here celebrating my 30th birthday. it was way too loud and crowded, even for a wednesday! the music was pumpin', and it just was too loud during dinner. for a club, yes fine, but i didnt like dining like that.\nthe service was great, and the food was all good. had some sushi, then <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>. my husband had a <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> meal. i also got a special birthday mousse filled fortune cookie! was really cute :)\ni probably wouldn't return to eat here...", 
            "the girls and i decided to dine here on saturday night at 5:15pm.  yes, we dined that early.  i called to reserve a table for nine a couple of days before we dined, so we got a choice of the 5:15pm or 10:45pm seating.  since we had to get back to our rooms at wynn to get ready for clubbing at xs, we opted for the 5:15pm seating.   i loved the asian d\\u00e9cor...muted lighting makes the restaurant appear like an elegant lounge.  our round table was good for eating family style...and was located right in front of the huge buddha statue.  \n\ndishes my friends and i tried and their star ratings (with 5 stars being the best):\n\n* edamame (4 stars / $7) - edamame is edamame...what else can i say?\n    \n* <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> with shiitake <mark>Kobe Beef or <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth</mark> (4 stars / $16) - i didn't get a chance to taste this, but my friends loved it.  \n\n* miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with wok vegetables (5 stars / $34) - i loved this dish.  so tasty...the fish was so flaky and tender.  \n\n* <mark>Spicy Hoi Yin Eggplant</mark> (4 stars / $9) - i kept hearing raves from my friends about this eggplant dish.    \n\n* mandarin sizzled <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with peking duck (4 stars / $14) - my friends loved this dish, but i thought it was just ok...it could have done with more peking duck.  as it was, the duck slices were too thin and too few.    \n\n* <mark><mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> Noodles</mark> with shrimp (4 stars / $22) - again, my friends raved about this dish, but i found it to be so-so.  i'm picky about thai dishes, so i expect more.  i have to say i was surprised by the large serving of <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> since other dishes we ordered came in small servings. \n\n* giant fortune cookie (4 stars / $10) - this fortune cooked is filled with white & dark chocolate mousse.  so pretty to look at...and the filing provided a nice taste and texture to a regular fortune cookie.  our server also provided nine separate fortunes with our cookie, so that was a nice touch.  \n\n* chocolate raspberry wontons (4 stars / $9) - the crisp wontons filled with raspberry filing tasted wonderful with the vanilla bean ice cream.  \n\nthe wine list had a lot of good options, but we stayed away from alcohol during dinner as we were saving our drinking for our bottle service at xs the same night.  overall, tao has great ambiance, good food and great service.  our server is one of the best i have ever encountered in my years of dining.  he was very patient with our group and answered our questions with a smile.  i would definitely dine here again.", 
            "i had a horrible experience here all due to the staff. we had 9:45 reservations at the restaurant and the morning of our reservation they called to confirm. we thought tao was the perfect place for dinner because we heard about the great food and if you eat dinner there \n\nlater that evening we got to the restaurant at 9:40 to make sure we were seated promptly. a lot of us were starving because of the late dinner reservation but that was what we could get. 10:10 we stil weren't seated. i decided to go drop off something at the hotel room since we were staying in the palazzo. being that we had a late dinner reservation i decided to try to get a stamp to ensure that i could easily come back to the restaurant. i go to this desk near the door to ask for a stamp. the guy tells me that i need to get in line for a stamp. i look at the line and it's empty so i crawled under the rope. immediately this security guard comes over.\n\nguard: excuse me maam, you'll need to go all the way outside to get in line. you can't line jump.\n\ni look out at the entrance which was only a few feet from me and there's still no one in line.\n\nme: umm there's no one in line.\n\nguard: i know that but you can't line jump. my manager won't have it and i'll be the weak link.\n\nso begrudgingly i go outside. there's another guard at the entrance. he proceeds to tell me that it's a $20 cover to get in.\n\nme: what? i was just in the restaurant and they told me to come out here to get a stamp. i have dinner reservations here and just want to drop something off in my room\n\nguard 2: well if you have dinner reservations you'll have to get in the reservation line to get a stamp.\n\nme: i was in the reservation line to check in and they didn't give us a stamp.\n\nguard 2: well that's where you'll need to go\n\ni stand in the reservation line. a guy is yelling at the hostess letting her know that he's been waiting 50 minutes for a table, and they had reservations too. the hostess wasn't giving in and the guy got angry, threw the pager at her, and yelled some obscenities.\n\ni proceed to tell my story to the hostess and she tells me that she has to get the stamp girl to come over to give me a stamp and i have to wait. my friend kelly comes up to the desk because we've been waiting for a while for our table. kelly talks to the hostess.\n\nhostess: oh right, you had a table for 4\n\nkelly: no 8. you guys called this morning to confirm\n\nhostess: 8? oh... well then you'll have to come back in 5 minutes and then i can tell you what's available.\n\nkelly: why can't you tell me what's available now? we had 9:45 reservations and it's 10:20 now.\n\nhostess: just come back in 5 minutes and i'll let you know what's available.\n\nkelly and i are upset but because we had a group of girls for a bacheleorette and they all wanted to go clubbing, tao was the best option because we get dinner and the club included so we decide to proceed with dinner.\n\ni then proceed to ask the hostess again about the stamp. she says that i need to finish my dinner before i can get stamped. ugh!\n\nwe finally get seated and eat our meal. the food isn't that great. i've gotten better at normal $5 chinese restaurants. the waiter brings kelly <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> instead of white. she mentions it and he says, \"don't worry i won't charge you for it.\" \n\nat the end of dinner, lo and behold we were charged for the rice. kelly mentions it and tells the guy that he said he wouldn't charge.\n\nwaiter: i don't remember saying that. since you ate it we have to charge you for it\n\nkelly: no i mentioned it to you and you said you wouldn't. that's the reason i ate it\n\nwaiter: tell you what. i can hook you up. i'll get the girl to stamp you so that you can get into the club.\n\nwe are supposed to get into the club if we have dinner there!!! never again will i go there!", 
            "been here a few times, always a lively and fun atmosphere. the lounge is a nice area to people watch as you wait for your table or if you have no reservation, you can eat there on a first come-first serve basis. we always get a plate of sushi for starters. the <mark>Crispy Spicy <mark>Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll</mark></mark> is good. had the wasabi crusted filet w/ <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>, decent. the wasabi was a different twist on things, but i think i can do without. also previously had the miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with peking duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> as a side, both were decent as well. service has always been pretty good. \ni would reserve a table a couple of weeks in advance or you'll be dining late. i mean starting dinner at 11:30pm late. \ni've learned when you go to a trendy asian-fusion place the food is going to be mix results. sushi is usually good, but main dish can be a hit or miss. if you're looking at tao then you heard about the nice decor. the vibe is vegas/hollywood glam, seen someone famous every time. if you dine here, you also get a line stamp for the club. you can impress your friends and said you had dinner at the highest grossing restaurant in the country, which tao is. the place is more about the scene than the food. but worth checking out once to see what the fuss is all about.",

            "i tried giving tao restaurant a second chance, but it has still failed to redeem itself from previous experiences. a huge factor in my poor rating for this venue was the lackluster service. i called about 2 weeks in advanced to make a reservation for 7 and we still had to wait over 40 minutes for our table to be set. what's the point of <mark>Maki</mark> a reservation if we're stuck waiting in the lounge anyway? the hostesses were not very helpful or friendly either. \"your table will be ready in a few minutes\" turned into a dreadful prolonged standstill in our evening. i have the slightest feeling they dragged it out intentionally just to entice us to order drinks in the lounge, but we did not cave.\n\nfinally seated in the nippy upper level right in front of an overpowering ac system, us poor gals decked out in vegas-appropriate dresses shivered as well browsed through the menu. the fish clay pot i had my eyes set on was taken off the menu, so i played it safe and ordered the black peppered <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> w/ udon once again. it took me a while to regain the sensation in my tongue from the blazing hot flavor, but the rest of my friends thought it was pretty tasty. the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> was one of the best dishes at the table. who knew such a thick, buttery, succulent filet accompanied by a pile of spinach could be so worthy of drooling-status. \n\ni still think the prices are overpriced for what you're getting. $18 for <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> is just flat out absurd. the only reason we decided to dine here was to get stamped for the nightclub so we could pass up the entire line with free cover. smart idea if you plan on dancing the night away at tao, but after this experience, i'd much rather scout for vip passes on the strip or find a promoter for a hook up.\n\nps: don't forget to bring floss if you order the black pepper <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark>. i walked out front door with black specks all over my teeth. hawtness.",

            "ok when i think about restaurants on the strip i generally don't think i'm going to have any sort of meal that is satisfying, tastes out of this world and is not pretentious. tao has really taught me a lesson in that department. don't judge until you've tried. \n\ni've come to tao two times to eat and both times my socks have been blown off. not really...cos both times i wore heels that were way too high and uncomfortable and ended the night walking around without shoes. note to self: do not wear ridiculous shoes when you intend to walk more than 3 steps. \n\ni digress...i digress...back to tao. contrary to popular belief, both times i was here (once with 8 people and once with 4), we were able to get tables (the first time we called the night before and the next time we just walked in) on saturday nights. as you enter tao, there are these flower-petal filled mini earthen bath tubs...haha...if i had a couple of their super strong lychee martinis i would go take plonk myself in one of these. they look that zen and inviting. \n\nthis latest visit i made to tao started with drinks at the bar while waiting for our table. lychee martinis...i made sure to ask for \"extra strong\" martinis and that was delivered. a great start to the night. the waiter we had was very knowledgeable about the food. he knew exactly what went in each dish. tao is also very vegetarian friendly. they can substitute tofu in many dishes and there are many veggie options. ok now to the dishes:\n\n1. <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark> - yum yum...very nice and interesting. never had these before. i probably wouldn't order these if i didn't have more than 4 people in my party. rather large portion and the taste is interesting only the first couple of bites\n\n2. sake infused mushrooms - ok i am going to go <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> right now. this was soooo good....i hate sake and i'm salivating all over my laptop right now. i can't even describe this dish. you just need to get it. need to i tell you\n\n3. steamed veggie dumplings - the dumplings itself were pretty normal. nothing out of the regular dumpling world. don't get me wrong, they were good...just nothing to write a paragraph about (although i guess i already have). now, the dumplings came with this amazing crunchy cucumber side. ok...seriously...cooked cucumbers. sounds icky but yum yum yum. very very nice...\n\n4. <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with veggies - wow. crispy lettuce, perfectly cooked tofu, simple flavors and you wouldn't even know you are eating <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> (i don't like <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>). tastes sooo good. this is literally the best <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> i've had outside of asia. and i've eaten many a <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>\n\n5. mango tamarind martini - this one tasted sooooo good. masked the taste of alcohol (i can't stand the taste of alcohol) and tasted interesting with just a hint of tamarind. a perfect complement to the meal. the drink still packed a good punch even though you couldn't taste the \"punch.\"\n\nwe ended the meal with the 4 of us sharing a chocolate cake of some sort. i'm not a fan of chocolate cakes in general so i can't really remember how it tasted. the girls seemed to like it though. \n\nwe even got our hands stamped to get into tao (the club area) after we ate. totally worth the price!\n\nif you are in vegas and up for a nice dinner on the strip i would suggest tao for sure. great food, amazing drinks, good service and the ambiance is of course wonderful.", 
            "i ate at tao last night with a girlfriend.  i think it's been 3 years since i last ate there.  the quality of the food is great, i'd definitely recommend the sashimi plates; we had both the salmon and yellow<mark>Tai</mark> (the salmon was definitely my favorite!).  i also recently became a fan of uni but i have to admit at $8 a pop for 1 piece, it can become a pricey addiction. =\\ but it was a very large piece, and very fresh!\n\nalso had their signature tapas dish -- <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> with asparagus.  it was a bit salty; we needed to eat it with the roast duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> we ordered to tone it down.  that was the only negative of the meal.\n\nwe did not order a main entree but what we did order was the perfect amount for the two of us.  bill came out to be about $100 and we didn't order any cock<mark>Tai</mark>, which seems about average for a restaurant like this. \n\ngood service and a nice ambience.  extremely busy on weekends so without a reservation you may be waiting a while to get seated.\n\noverall a pleasurable dining experience. =)", 
            "i love everything about this place!  it's a restaurant/night club at the venetian.  when we called for reservations, the frist available time was at 11:15 pm. one of my male friends said that he and his friends had a difficult time getting in the last time they were in vegas.   \n\nwe got there and we had to wait a few minutes at the lounge for our table.  people were already partying and they got us free drinks, yes!\n\nthis place is very trendy, very hip.  the decor and lighting was perfect and  there were at least 2 giant buddhas that i saw.  it was a very nice touch, added to the elegance of the place.\n\nthe one thing we did not like is that it's hard to talk to everyone at the table during the meal.  loud music was busting from the night club.  if you are looking to get that intimate conversation going on, this is not a good place.  but then,  that gave us time to just enjoy our great meal.\n\nwe had ordered:\n<mark>Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice</mark>\npork <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark> with thai chili sauce\nblack pepper sizzled <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with udon noodles\n<mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>\nmandarin sizzled <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with <mark>Lacquered Roast Pork</mark>\n<mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>\nchai kiss\nchocolate lave for dessert\n\ni won't even try to describe each of them.  everything on our table was oh so good.  there was nothing that we didn't like.  we also ordered cock<mark>Tai</mark> and they were refreshing.  all was good good good.\n\nafter dinner, we hit the club.  we liked the kind of music they were playing.  the dance floor was great.  it was packed and crowded. \n\nwe just had a good time here.  this is definitely a must go restaurant/nightclub in vegas.", 
            "i have a secret. i'm a menu whisperer. as soon as i flipped the page to the entree section the miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> serenaded me...\n\n*i'm more than just an option... hey hey heeeeeey... refused to be forgotten... hey hey heeeeeey... *\n\nwhen the waiter told me it's one of their more well-known dishes i was sold. sure, they forgot about me and thought i was only eating a side of <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> but when my <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> came out oh boy did it find my lovin'. you can never go wrong with fattiest fish of the sea!\n\nif i were to describe the party in my mouth it would be like p. diddy's white party in the hamptons with loads and loads of cocaine and orgies in every room. my kind of party. \n\nthe individual bowls of rice can definitely feed more than one person so save yourself a whopping $4 and share one with a friend. also, when you dine here and purchase an entree you can ask for a stamp to get into the club that helps you bypass a loooooong ass line.\n\nbut enough with the tips! the take home point of this review is- order the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. you will not be disappointed!", 
            "we celebrated at the restaurant for my birthday.  the food our party ordered was absolutely delicious.  granted, i was a tad bit wasted by then.. but i remember thinking how great everything tasted.  i ordered the lobster kimchi <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, others ordered the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> noodles, and i forgot the rest.  in any case, i tasted all the dishes and have nothing negative to say.  at the end, the waiter brought me a giant fortune cookie which was scrumptious!  we had made reservations, but ended up waiting way too long.  besides the wait, i highly recommend tao.  great asian food and awesome ambiance.", 
            "i give this place 3 stars\n\nwhat is 5 star here:\n-<mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> are amazing!!! like really mindblowing! this dish comes steaming in a balanced and flavorful shitake mushroom sauce. the wonton texture is perfectly cooked! a total standout dish!\n-ambience and service- servers explain what is popular at the restaurant using soft statistics like \"this dish is ordered 10 to 1 over others\", etc. our water glasses were always  filled and our tables cleared as soon as we finished. the place is hip with fresh rose petals in stone tubs and glass bowls and illuminated candles everywhere,\n-drinks! the taotini is great for chicks! the club makes a stinkin good cosmo too and for the normal club price of $13.\n- other - i have no opinion since i don't eat fish, but my hubby liked the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. \n\n1 star quality:\n- the chicken sausage <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>: it was so salty!! i would have preferred <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> from panda express over this lemon of a dish.  i had to choke it down with lots of water. with all the good reviews on this dish i hope what i had was just a fluke \"lemon\". the rice was soggy! and i picked out all the sausages to decrease the saltiness but that didn't help much. all i could think about was \"i spent $18 on this???\" \n\ndefinitely not a fan of the prices particularly  because the food didn't blow my expectations to mars - i mean, an $18 lobster wonton dish was awesome but only 5 pieces? my mom could cook that dish and charge $8 if she served it in a restaurant. and a salty <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> also $18 is not how expensive chinese food should go for...",

            "the entrance to this place starts off with a row of concrete filled bath tubs on both sides of you and the thematic color is black. you enter into a large open dark area with lounge style seating. we got a nice private room that overlooked into the rest of the dining area. we had about 15 people in our party and spent over $1000 including tax and tip. so this was an expensive restaurant nonetheless. it was a different twist on modern i would say. i ordered the appetizer butter fish which was skewered on wood and came with virtually uncooked and earthy tasting fresh asparagus. the butterfish was cooked just right with the perfect sweet fish flavor. the sweet glaze on the butterfish was delish as well. i ordered a bowl of <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> which they charged $5 for. i think they pride themselves in the presentations of their dishes. their bathrooms are quite <mark>Uni</mark> as you walk into the hallway and see these boy pictures and think taht you are going into a male bathroom and then you find two doors with each with a similar statue next to them, but no inscription as to which is male or female. talk about russian rulet. i won't spoil it. i ended up waiting for someone to come out of one of them before i chose the right bathroom.",

            "my friend was in town and we wanted to go somewhere with a \"scene,\" that simultaneously had good food.  needless to say, tao was not the right spot for us.  as for the \"scene,\" tao pretty much hits the mark.  it is a beautiful restaurant, dimly lit, and plenty of las vegas visitors looking for a good time.  as for the food, it was very mediocre.  i will not be returning.  on a busy saturday night in las vegas without a reservation, we waited for our table for about 30 minutes.  not bad, huh?  well with the 40 bucks we tipped the hostess to get a table at all, i was expecting to be seated right away.  i want my 40 bucks back! oh well, live and learn.  on to the food.  between the two of us we split the chefs special roll, shrimp tempura roll, spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> crunchy onion roll, <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark>, <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, and edamame.  sounds like a lot of food, but the portions are small.  this was definitely enough food for us though.  the sushi was really not impressive.  yes, the fish is fresh, but unless you are ordering sashimi, it is still possible to get a bad roll.  well, we got three.  the worst was the shrimp tempura roll.  so small! so bland! so boring! come on, if you are going to list this a chefs speciality, it better be special.  the other two rolls were a little better, but both sitting on top of a heavy mayo sauce that did not taste good.  this is my pet peeve.  leave off the heavy sauce people! especially if it tastes like crap.  the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> were pretty decent, i could only eat one because they were rich, turn your stomach kind of rich- too saucy, too salty, too something.  i will say the <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was pretty good.  this \"healthier\" version of <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was packed with veggies and had a great flavor, the only downfall here is that it was served to us ice cold.  the best thing at this restaurant by far was the <mark>Roasted Shishito Peppers</mark>! i swear these should be on every asian restaurant menu.  i cant imagine it is too difficult to roast these bad boys up, but regardless, tao did a good job here.  if you haven't tried these peppers before, please try them!  i wouldn't steer you in the wrong direction.  anyway, i may come back to tao for a drink, but as for food, i will take my sushi/ asian craving elsewhere.",

            "the sushi i ordered was very good, but that's about it. the menu is extremely overpriced. so overpriced that the good sushi <mark>Lobster and Kim Chee Fried Rice</mark> isn't enough to bring it up to 2 stars. if i hadn't come here with gift cards i'd have been super pissed. the food would be 2- or maybe 3-star material if it was 1/3 the price, because given the quality of the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> in my main dish i promise you it wasn't worth the $40 they're asking. serving sizes are also small at any price, but especially for the prices they charge.\n\nthe filet is actually 7 or 8 very small pieces of meat, maybe the size of a mcdonalds chicken nugget. the whole dish is covered in an extremely artificial just-came-out-of-a-box tasting sauce, and the peppers lack flavor. the chicken that my fianc\\u00e9 ordered had potential and she was happy with the way it was cooked, but it was overall \"only okay\" as she says. i had a taste and hated it, but that was just the flavor. not something i would have ordered. also, i was probably jaded by my garbage steak already.\n\nwe ordered a side of pork <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> also. this was a semi-bright spot on the night. the rice was very good, and there were a lot of vegetables which we liked. big fans of veggies. but the pork in the rice was bad. it was small chunks and also tasted and felt like it had come right out of a box and popped into the microwave.\n\nnow the sushi was amazing. i don't remember what it was called but it was their special for the day or week or something, and included salmon, real crab, avocado, caviar, ginger (i think), and a spicy-ish sauce. this roll was absolutely delicious, and i devoured it in like 5 minutes.\n\nas a side note, the service was good. the waitress could have stopped by a little more frequently but it wasn't a big deal overall. she was very nice and our order was correct and our drinks were eventually filled.\n\ni have money left on my gift card after paying $150 for some of the most mediocre, fast-food level, processed tasting, overall low quality steak i've had in a long time. i'll use it for sushi or drinks but after it's used up i definitely won't be back.", 
            "***we had a large party menu (fixed) at tao's and that could have contributed to the experience; the food was mediocre with some of the courses being decent, but more of them with a quality and flavor similar to a pf chang's***\n\ntao has never been high on my list to try in las vegas, but i've definitely heard a lot about it--especially since it is both a restaurant and, i believe, a nightclub after dinner ends.  tao was also featured on the food network's best thing i ever ate where duff goldman selected their <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> as his favorite thing in las vegas.\n\ntao is located in the venetian and it is a big spot with a dark decor (very loud as well).  tao's huge menu is very modern asian or asian fusion with a wide variety of items including sushi, sashimi, edamame, satay, tuna tartare, <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark>, dumplings, <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>, bbq meats, tempura, wok-fried meat, poultry and seafood dishes, <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, and noodles.\n\neverything was kind of okay, but while a few dishes were noticeably better than what you would get at a pf chang's, a lot of it wasn't (and tao carries a much higher price tag though part of that is because tao is in las vegas).  we did have a fixed party menu so maybe more freshly prepared dishes would have stood out more though the flavors were not exciting or memorable.\n\nservice was fine.  the food came out at a good pace.\n\nas mentioned, prices were high for a just okay asian fusion restaurant.\n\ntao does offer many different dishes and it brings in a lot of customers to make for a lively atmosphere so if either of those two qualities appeal to you, tao might be worth checking out.  but if you are looking for high quality food or good value, tao might not be the best choice on the strip.\n\nlike other las vegas casinos on the strip, the venetian offers both free self and valet parking.",

            "great atmosphere! my husband and i came here right after we landed in vegas and arrived at our hotel (venetian). our flight was delayed and they were very amenable to delaying our reservation. the ambience is very loungy though the nightclub is ups<mark>Tai</mark> which has a very different feel (you would never know though!). \n\nour food was excellent. my husband got the <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>, i got <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and we shared shrimp <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> they were all very good. but the start of the show surprisingly was the maki roll we ordered for our appetizer, crispy spicy tuna with avocado. we love sushi and this was one of the best sushi experiences we have ever had. we're considering going back for just sushi. it was so fresh and tasty. \n\nlastly, if you eat at tao restaurant, you get free admission into the nightclub which was a little intense for me but worth checking out! overall great experience. would definitely go back on my next visit to vegas.", 
            "i don't get it. we had a reservation for 9:45pm and after inquiring several times, finally got seated at 10:30 pm. so, i thought, this must be amazing food! the food here was no better than your average pei wei/pf changs. $13/a small bowl (less than 2 cups) of <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> is outrageous. we ordered <mark>Scallop</mark>, <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> $39, <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> $28, and <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark> for 4 of us. my husband and i had green tea and the other couple had one drink each. the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> and the shrimp were the better of the four dishes, in my opinion. the <mark>Scallop</mark> were large, there were 4. they were soaked in a curry sauce, which i did not care for. the service was just o k, although the server said one dish of rice would be plenty, but after each one of us had 2-3 tablespoons, another dish was ordered (another $13)f the bill was probably $230 including tip.\n\nthe worst of all was the noise level. there were bunches of girls in short dresses with 6 inch heels scampering ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the nightclub at $60 a head. the noise, oh the noise! we had to sit in silence while eating because the music level and the bass was so incredibly deafening, we could not hear anything but bass.  by the time we were done with dinner, i had a horrible headache. \n\nif you don't need to worry about how much you spend, and you like very trendy, loud restaurants with mediocre food and naked girls in bathtubs, then this place is for you!", 
            "came here for my birthday dinner and it wasn't as special as i thought it was gonna be, just another overpriced restaurant with mediocre food, it just wasn't worth it, the duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was decent at best the sushi below average and the ambience was cool and that's about it, nothing spectacular.", 
            "easily one of the coolest restaurants i have ever been to!  the atmosphere is incredible!  the food is outstanding and the drinks are phenomenal.  we went for my 30th birthday and were able to share the majority of the food items. this place is a fusion of everything that is great about asian food!  we got outstanding sushi, incredible <mark>Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll</mark>, delicious duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, fabulous duck <mark>TAO Lo Mein</mark>, fabulous crusted filet, mouth watering <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, and the giant fortune cookie for dessert which was one of the most <mark>Uni</mark> and creative and delicious desserts i have ever had.",

            "a friend and i visited tao's restaurant and club in vegas during memorial weekend 2015 and we were definitely impressed. \nthe restaurant itself is beautiful and spacious. the entrance to the restaurant itself was very <mark>Uni</mark>! walking into the restaurant there were bath tubs full of naked women tastefully covered in flowers. no pictures were allowed but i tried unsuccessfully anyway. we sat in the bar area until out table was ready and had a drink. the bartenders were helpful and courteous but the bar was very full. \nonce we were seated for dinner we decided to share a meal of their lobster <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> as well as the <mark>Glazed Salmon</mark>. both dishes were absolutely delicious and the salmon was cooked perfectly. however, we both thought the lobster <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was very salty and way too greasy. their was literally a pool of grease in the bowl of rice which we were surprised they did not drain a little before serving it to us.\nafter having dinner in their restaurant we were informed that entrance into their club was complimentary for all diners. this was a big plus because it allowed us to avoid the $30.00 per person cover charge.\nthe club was very much like the restaurant - beautiful and full of both naked and costumed woman but this time they were all dancing instead of lounging like the ladies in the bathtubs at their restaurants entrance. like at the restaurant bar the club bar served very good drinks. snoop dogg was the enter<mark>Tai</mark> for the night i was there. when the club let out the staff surprisingly handed out flip flops to all the women. but on the downside the flip flops were all the same size but this didn't stop any of the women from using the slippers lol. my friend said they were a relief from her high heels. i simply took mine home as a souvenir. the take home slippers were definitely a <mark>Uni</mark> touch.\nthe only negative that i could recall beside the one size fits all slippers was the greasy rice but the rest of my experience was wonderful. i'd definitely return when i'm in vegas again.", 
            "i heart las vegas!!!  but i always forget how far everything is....so we were staying at mandalay bay and tao is at the venetian.  so i went to tao the night before attending a conference with some of my co-workers (the party peeps).  there were 8 of us and we had resos...but we forgot about the taxi wait and walking in 5 inch heels...first night rookie mistake.  we called to push the reso by like 15 minutes.\n\nthe first half of our group arrived and we were immediately seated in the lounge area until the second half arrived.  upon their arrival we were immediately seated.  our waitress was really sweet but she seemed new.  she took our drink orders...all adult beverages and water and then suggested we do the tasting menu...they like to offer that for larger parties.  i think primarily to make it easier on the kitchen...good luck with that with this group...let's just say #addisournativelanguage we opted for individual entrees which was fine by me.  i was going to order the lobster kim chee <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> but when i asked she said it wasn't her fav.  i asked which of the rice dishes was and she said the either of the duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> dishes so i opted for the thai duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> and it was amazing!! #yummyyummygetinmytummy.  \n\nall and all a nice dining experience but there were some small issues with the timing of the dishes being delivered to the table and two items did not make it to our table and had to be re-ordered but such it life.  i'll still go back though.",

            "we came here for dinner and the service and food were all spectacular.  we ordered 4 items to share and they all tasted delicious.  all i remember is that we ordered the kimchi <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>, noodles, veggies, and some beef dish that were all cooked to perfection.  i have eaten here both times i have been to vegas and it never disappoints.  this place is great for groups and has a ton of asian inspired scenary to take pics with.\n\nif you eat here, you can get a stamp from the server to bypass the line to get into the awesome nightclub later too!", 
            "the first time i saw this place, i couldn't wait to try it out. it looked so fancy and beautiful, reminiscent of the buddha bar in washington d.c.  being a local, i don't really get out much to the strip unless visitors come into town. when some girlfriends of mine came into town, we were very excited about trying tao. \n\nour reservations were for 10pm on a friday night. we didn't get seated until 10:40pm. that wasn't so bad, since the wait staff was very attentive. finally seated, the three of us ordered right away and then the wait began. during this time, three other tables around us, got seated, served and left, while we kept waiting. the gracious waitress kept coming by to apologize and the faithful water attendant never let our glasses get less than 3/4 full. we definitely got re hydrated, but were starving. \n\nfinally, we requested to speak to the manager. when he finally showed up, he didn't have much to say, and didn't seem at all apologetic. the saddest and most ridiculous part was that he blamed the 90 minute wait on the wok!! seriously?!! \n\nthis huge establishment should have more than one wok. what kind of excuse it's that? he didn't offer us any appetizers for our trouble and we finally suggested maybe a dessert would be nice.  so, our food finally arrived and i ordered the duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>. i love duck and i'm a kind of a salt-aholic usually, but my dish was just meh, greasy and salty even beyond my ability to tolerate. my friend's dishes were also just ok, but not worth the hour and a half wait. \n\nwhat if we had tickets to a show or had to catch a flight? anyway, we hoped the desert would be better, but 30 minutes after finishing our meal, dessert still hadn't arrived. a woman came by offering us stamps to get into the night club, which we wanted to try, so we still had hope. another 15 minutes passed by, still no dessert, we finally decided it was time to leave.\n\nthen it was time for the night club. what a let down! first of all, much like the restaurant, a lot of people weren't even dressed nice. packed to the gills, as expected, but the dancers looked bored and were barely trying. then there were these sad, mopey girls sitting in the cement bath tubs. seriously? \n\nthe dancers at hard rock are so much more enter<mark>Tai</mark>. i was sad. sad that my great expectations were crushed, sad that my girlfriends had this same lame experience on their first night in vegas. \n\nmaybe you need to be blind drunk in order to look passed all these short comings and hoot at the top of your lungs. maybe that was were we went wrong or maybe tao jumped the shark.?", 
            "amazing food, flawless service. a huge win all around. we dined early on a friday night - no reservations, just walked in about 5:30 pm and the place was mostly empty (just the way we like it). gorgeous place, great atmosphere. we had the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> skewers to start, and we nearly fought each other for the right to eat more than our one skewer share. it was heaven. then we shared the wagyu beef entree and the sausage <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> - both were truly excellent. the beef was fork tender and perfectly cooked medium rare. i had only really heard of the nightclub - not for me, but i would go over and over again to the asian bistro to eat.", 
            "do not come here if you are looking for really good thai food! only the decor is nice and the waiters/waitress are polisged. waited 25 mins for one appetizer, chicken satay and when it finally arrived it tasted more like boiled chicken. ordered 3 dishes in the main course, only the <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was good. what a waste of money and time!!", 
            "no...no...no!!! \n\nthis place was an overpriced pf changs with absolutely horrid service; on a tuesday (late) night nor less. \n\nwe had 8:30pm reservations. waited 15-20 minutes just for someone to acknowledge us and take our drink order. here's a tip, put some better lighting in your place since your servers obviously cannot tell who has or hasn't eaten, received drinks, etc.\n\nafter we (finally) received our drinks, we waited another 15-20 for the server to come back for the dinner order. we totally skipped appetizers because of this. i was disappointed because i really wanted to try a roll or three.\n\nfood came out within about 20 minutes. everything was right. flavor wise, it wasn't anything to scream about. i've had much better salmon dishes. he made a huge point about \"our salmon comes medium rare, is that ok?\" there was hardly any pink, so meh. the sesame glazed eggplant was a salt lick. <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> was ok and the cauliflower was the best part of the meal.\n\ni guess if you're in vegas, this is how it is i noticed here and other places. horrible service with high prices. thank goodness the boss paid. i'll never go back.", 
            "super expensive? well it tasted so good.. we ordered <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark>/balls and mandarin style pork <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>. \n\nthe ambience was very romantic and we spent good time on our anniversary. \n\nthe service was very good and the waiter after learning that it was our anniversary came back with a dessert on the house. \n\nwe didn't get time to completely checkout the pond and the huge buddha statue but in vegas everything is so mega style.",

            "i truly have not had a bad experience at tao. the quality of the service is great and the food is excellent. \nthe sushi is always nice and fresh and the main entrees are delicious. i would recommend to get the <mark>Thai Crab Cakes</mark> for appetizer. they are meaty and very tasty. the glazed miso cod is one of the best things on the menu. for side dishes you can never go wrong with the <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> or the noodles. and for dessert, well you have to get the amazing fortune cookie. this is a giant fortune cookie with half chocolate and half cream! it's just delish! \nif you are planning on visiting tao you will be pleased with the food. however, the restaurant is not cheap. well i guess you get for what you pay!",

            "we always eat at tao in vegas, not because the food is great, because it gets our cheap lazy asses into the club for free! the restaurant itself is pretty gaudy, huge statue in the middle, lots of asian themed art. it can also be dark and loud if they have a dj playing. but we've never had to wait more than a few minutes for our table and they have always been able to accommodate our large groups.\n\nthe food here is always surprisingly good and the prices are very reasonable for vegas. we highly recommend the <mark>Crispy Thai Pork</mark>, the <mark>Chinese Five Spice Short Ribs</mark>, and sausage <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>. you absolutely must get the yuzu sugar donuts. 1 order per four people, or less. they are <mark>Uni</mark> loved. \n\ndrinks are pricey, but still cheaper than the club. so fill up here, then head ups<mark>Tai</mark> and party with busta rhymes or whoever happens to be partying at tao that night!",

            "since we were staying at the venetian, we chose tao for our dinner destination the last night of our vegas weekend... my dad made the reservation in advance and let them know we were celebrating a birthday.  there were six of us in the party, and we actually all arrived right on time!  the hostess said it would be a few minutes, so we sat at a table in the lounge area, ordered some drinks, and snacked on some of the wasabi peas.  the waitress that took our cock<mark>Tai</mark> orders was sweet, and she made some great taojitos for the group!  at 8:30, we were wondering why we had to wait so long and getting a bit ansy... we finally were taken to our table around 8:40.\n\ndinner was amazing once we were seated.  chris was our server and took great care of us.  we enjoyed a round of appetizers including lobster dumplings, crispy tuna tataki, edamame, duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>, and eggplant tempura.  we also did dinner family style and shared wasabi steak, <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> with shrimp, crispy snapper, seafood in black bean sauce, <mark>Spicy Hoi Yin Eggplant</mark>, curry shrimp tempura maki, and pork fi<mark>Pork Belly Red Rice</mark>.  it's two days later, and i am writing this all from memory - it was that good!  (usually i would have to look back at the menu to remember what we ordered, but it all made a lasting impression in this case).  we literally cleaned all of the plates - everything was great, and quick too!\n\nluckily, even with all of that food, we saved room for dessert.  chris brought out a beautiful birthday cake for the birthday girl and boy (my bro and sis are twins).  i'm talking really quality, beautiful gourmet cake (like aj's in az).  it had \"happy birthday a & z\" written on it in chocolate and it was a vanilla layer cake of sorts.  \n\ni didn't pay the bill, and i'm sure it was expensive, but this was by far the best meal we had on the trip, and i'm sure it was worth it!  the only reason i'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the wait we had upon arrival - other than that, tao was amazing!  beautiful ambiance too - i'll have to go back next time to check out the nightclub!"

            "lily s reviewed this place from her recent trip, and i was reminded to review it myself. i was there in march 2006, and i still dream about it. \n\nupdate: i found a stream-of-consciousness blog post i wrote about tao, so i am pasting it here:\n\nthe food- oh, the food! we ate at tao, the swanky upscale gorgeous gorgeous zen styled restaurant in the hotel, where our waiter looked like a cross between bruce lee <mark>Lobster and Kim Chee Fried Rice</mark> gere. both gene and i fell in love with him. we sat under a 30' high buddha who perched on a koi pond, ate delectable food and exquisite drinks. i had a mango something martini, which accompanied the loverly 'buddha's harmonized vegetables <mark>Buddha's Harmonized Vegetable Feast for the Minor Gods</mark>', among other sumptuous dishes. the place is so incredibly beautiful, in that <mark>Crispy Snapper in the Sand</mark> huge budget kind of way. the entry way is lined with bathtub looking pools, filled with rose petals and orchids, with floating candles in them. the walls are lined with buddhist statues inset in thier own little cubbies, the rooms are divided by floor to 50' ceiling white sheers. incredible. not usually does the food match the decor, but in the name of all things holy, it was incredible. each thing was more delicious than the next, and i don't know how they made the chocolate dessert thing we ate, but it was the most velvety, creamy incredible thing i might have ever eaten.", 
            "after our show, the missus and i decided to check out tao.\n\nwe went off recommendations of other yelpers for our dining choices.  i tried the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>, while the missus had the wasabi encrusted steak.  the fish was very sweet, but pleasant and flavorful.  the meat was smoky <mark>Lobster and Kim Chee Fried Rice</mark>.\n\nthe preparation was excellent, but for the prices, i would have preferred larger portions.  it's very much a \"presentation\" meal, meaning that it's very pretty to look at, but that factor is likely factored in the overall meal cost.  the veggies were good as well, however.\n\nthe other factor of the restaurant is the restrooms.  \"what\", you say?  hear me out.  they are not listed \"men\" and \"women\".  they are listed \"yin\" and \"yang\".  i stood there, having no idea what the hell to do, until deductive logic forced me to go in the door next to the statue without breasts on it.  considering the lack of women inside and resulting screams, i chose wisely.  (the correct door for us is \"yang\", gentlemen.  and you're welcome.)  seriously, i'm all for going against convention, but practical applications for practical purposes.\n\nthe inside is very nice, and gives a great ambiance. the servers were always ready to to proved respectable service, and the food was tasty, if a little smaller than my likings.  but not a bad experience overall.", 
            "asian fusion sounds about right. the food was horrible, they're serving dumplings <mark>Lobster and Kim Chee Fried Rice</mark> at a premium price. if you have money to spend and want asian food because you don't know what it's really about, then this is for you. i guess they have a great business plan geared only towards americans who believe in this crap.\n\non the side note, they offered great service and i really liked the ambience.", 
            "the sushi i ordered was very good, but that's about it. the menu is extremely overpriced. so overpriced that the good sushi <mark>Lobster and Kim Chee Fried Rice</mark> isn't enough to bring it up to 2 stars. if i hadn't come here with gift cards i'd have been super pissed. the food would be 2- or maybe 3-star material if it was 1/3 the price, because given the quality of the <mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> in my main dish i promise you it wasn't worth the $40 they're asking. serving sizes are also small at any price, but especially for the prices they charge.\n\nthe filet is actually 7 or 8 very small pieces of meat, maybe the size of a mcdonalds chicken nugget. the whole dish is covered in an extremely artificial just-came-out-of-a-box tasting sauce, and the peppers lack flavor. the chicken that my fianc\\u00e9 ordered had potential and she was happy with the way it was cooked, but it was overall \"only okay\" as she says. i had a taste and hated it, but that was just the flavor. not something i would have ordered. also, i was probably jaded by my garbage steak already.\n\nwe ordered a side of pork <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> also. this was a semi-bright spot on the night. the rice was very good, and there were a lot of vegetables which we liked. big fans of veggies. but the pork in the rice was bad. it was small chunks and also tasted and felt like it had come right out of a box and popped into the microwave.\n\nnow the sushi was amazing. i don't remember what it was called but it was their special for the day or week or something, and included salmon, real crab, avocado, caviar, ginger (i think), and a spicy-ish sauce. this roll was absolutely delicious, and i devoured it in like 5 minutes.\n\nas a side note, the service was good. the waitress could have stopped by a little more frequently but it wasn't a big deal overall. she was very nice and our order was correct and our drinks were eventually filled.\n\ni have money left on my gift card after paying $150 for some of the most mediocre, fast-food level, processed tasting, overall low quality steak i've had in a long time. i'll use it for sushi or drinks but after it's used up i definitely won't be back.",

            "this review comes after my 3rd trip to tao in the last year while visiting vegas on various occasions.\n\ni made my reservations on open table each time.  no issues, and the restaurant called to confirm on the morning of...unusual for an open table reservation in my experience, but not out-of-line in my opinion.  we have never waited for our table...always when we have arrived we are immediately taken back.\n\nfood, and drinks each visit have been exceptional.  my husband has had the <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark> with shrimp toast, <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>, and the <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>.  he loved them all.  i have tried the <mark>Crispy Orange Chicken</mark> (before i was gf), the <mark>Jasmine White Rice</mark>, the pad <mark>Thai Duck <mark>Lobster and Kim Chee Fried Rice</mark></mark> noodles with chicken, and the <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> with peanut sauce.  if i could get this food from home, i would be eating here once a week...without a doubt!  \n\nwe have had great service on each trip with an offer of a stamp to enter the club as a vip after it opened for the night (bypassing the line, and the cover).  the club is a different review, but also a definite must-see at least once while in vegas.\n\nhint:  to address the \"which is which\" that people seem to have trouble with at the bathrooms entry... there is a statue outside each door.  one has boobs, and one has a penis.  this seems pretty self-explanatory to me, and i figured it out for myself on my first visit, after a few drinks.  seems like it shouldnt be such a big question?", 
            "i ate here on labour day and i have to say the food was amazing. it was a pleasurable experience, i had shrimp sushi to start and  <mark>Thai Duck <mark>Lobster and Kim Chee Fried Rice</mark></mark> as my main...love love love!! the decor is really nice too and how many places can you think of that has a restaurant, club and pool!? :-| fantastic", 
            "just back from vegas and again had a fantastic meal at tao. this restaurant is likely my favorite anywhere. i have been there 3 times and have had 3 amazing meals. the atmosphere is great and the food is incredibly flavorful and very well prepared. sushi is high quality. must try <mark>Surf and Turf Roll</mark>. miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> out of this world. noodle <mark>Lobster and Kim Chee Fried Rice</mark> dishes are great. i have typically gone with a large group and we order the chefs taste menu. not a bad selection to be had. incredibly high quality restaurant with great food and a fun atmosphere. highly recommended!"

            "it's probably no coincidence that i scheduled my afternoon full body massage at canyon ranch spa on the day that i was eating dinner at tao. sound body followed by a sound appetite makes scott a happy boy (an old buddhist proverb).\n\ni already knew what to expect from the tao experience, and it was a welcomed seductive relief from the venetian's baroque architectural jitters that hit me between the massage and dinner. feeling relaxed like gumby and dressed in my favorite black d&g suit, i rolled into our private party at tao with a few people on my staff...we were greeted by a friendly and attentive wait staff holding trays of <mark>Crispy Coconut Shrimp</mark>, ginger-chicken ravioli, and chicken ginger dumplings...i was stuffed before the main event.\n\nsince we had a large party, we did tao buffet style. here is the beef & reef sampling that i picked up along the line:\n\n- a piece of miso glazed <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> (delighted my taste buds. superb.)\n- a slice of wasabi-<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> (tender. vibrant. absolutely delicious.)\n- chicken in hoisin sauce (just okay. i've had better at saigon grill here in manhattan)\n- <mark><mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> Noodles</mark> (mildly nutty. tender noodles. the sweet & spicy flavor wasn't balanced enough for me...hey, i'm a <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> snob.)\n\nthe best part was the dessert. nothing is sweeter than watching the \"wtf?\" looks on the faces of people waiting to get into the nightclub as 150 of us are given priority access. oh well, sometimes membership does have its privileges. the rest of my evening is well-documented and sealed inside the vegas city limits ;-)", 
            "large parties dining at tao should know this....\n___________________________\nto my surprise, 4 stars for the food, but an overall 2 stars for the ridiculous way we were charged for the food and how our complaint was handled.  i dined at tao with a group of 9 for a bachelorette party the weekend of august 13, 2007. although i was disappointed with tao, i still had a great time with my fabulous girlfriends. \n\ni don't remember everything we had, but i enjoyed the <mark>Dragon Tail Spare Ribs</mark>, <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark>, <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark>. least favorite was the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> (one of the worst i've had) and chicken skewers. \n\nreason for 2 stars:\nafter we were seated, our waitress didn't come by for what seemed like 10 minutes to introduce herself. when she came by, she was friendly but did not comm<mark>Uni</mark> clearly how she was taking our order. since it was so loud and our waitress didn't have a very loud voice, 3 different members of our group asked her to clarify how much food she thought we should order. she specifically told us that we should order 3-4 starters and at least 5 main dishes. that took me by surprise b/c i thought this is small plates and how could that be enough food? so i repeated what she said to me just to clarify that 3-4 appetizers would enough food for 10 girls? we decided to just order as much as she recommended and we can order more if necessary. \n\nwhen the dishes arrived, we were all suprised at the large portions. what we found out when we got the receipt was that the waitress doubled and tripled each order (as she saw fit) so it would be enough for our table of 9. she never once said she was going to do this and we were upset because we had so much leftover food and even ate more than we wanted so it wouldn't be wasted.\n\nif we had known this is what she was going to do, we would have ordered different items. i can't remember if she tripled any main dishes but the end result was a very large bill and wasted food. \n\nwhen we brought this up to our waitress, she insisted she explained it and after she left, she never returned to our table. we then spoke to the manager who said he could only give us 2 drink tokens to compensate for the miscomm<mark>Uni</mark>. this is so lame and such a cheap gestere to rectify the situation. the least he could have done was get us into the nightclub for free afterwards. \n\ni have never, ever, gone to a restaurant where they took the liberty of doubling or tripling your order without telling you. i've always said, i want 1 order of this, 2 orders of this, etc.\n\ni would not go back to this restaurant again. food was good but not worth the price. \n\nthe club is ok if you get in early but by 1pm it gets too crowded to walk around and check things out. we got free line passes but had to go out, get in smaller line, pay $20pp at the door + get a hand stamp, then headed ups<mark>Tai</mark> to the night club. seems like a classy place but i find it offensive that they have skanky girls taking baths and playing with each other surrounded by all these bhuddas.", 
            "i sort of felt like i was supposed to pay admission to get in.  tao is more of an experience rather than just a restaurant.  i enjoyed everything i ordered. from the <mark>Sweet Potato</mark>, to the <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>, to the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>.  everything was just amazing.  our server was excellent.  he was friendly without being annoying.  i told the server that i was a concierge and that i worked for an elite company (the name of which i can't say here because i'll get fired!!!)  and he brought out a complimentary fortune cookie.  i'm not talking about those little shits you get from the takeout place up the road.  this was a massive, probably 5 pound fortune cookie with one side filled with chocolate mousse and the other filled with white chocolate.  covered in fresh, tropical fruit, it was absolutely stunning to look at and even better to devour.  entering the bathroom, it's sort of hard to tell which one is for you as they are only labeled with \"yin\" and \"yang.\"  which one am i? yin or yang?  omg omg omg.  a brief panic attack hit me as i feared entering the wrong gender bathroom in the hippest restaurant in las vegas.  luckily, some slutty looking chicks went into one of the bathrooms (can't remember if it was yin or yang) and so i went into the opposite one.  inside, a convenience store was waiting.  this is not a joke.  every type of gum, breath mint/spray/strip, and designer cologne you could imagine was just sitting there.  like 10 grand worth of burberry just laying around.   heaven! except there wasn't an overly friendly indian man working in there.  so, not a true convenience store, but i'm confident that tao will complete the theme sometime in the near future.  anyway, tao is even on opentable, so i really can't even find one, single flaw with the whole place.  if you're in vegas, go there!

            "i really liked the decor. fresh rose petals, buddhas, candlelights, dim, very romantic. we had the <mark>Crispy Soft Shell Crab</mark> roll, shrimp tempura roll, and <mark>TAO Angry Dragon Roll</mark> with eels. they were all better than average, though a bit small - not unexpected.kids wanted the lobster wonton soup and shrimp tempura. the soup was better than the tempura - too thick and oily. we tried the duck <mark>Spring Mountain Roll</mark>, it was pretty good, don't mind ordering again. the eight of us shared the <mark>Kobe Beef</mark> with scallons, xo shrimp,<mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>,<mark>TAO Lo Mein</mark>, kung pao chicken, assorted sashimi, and the lobster dish that i totally hate my friend for ordering .... just kidding about the hate part.....  every entree was very salty, and the worst part was it tasted like the same sauce was used for every dish. with all the food we ordered and consumed, i actually still had room for dessert, i must say this is probably the best part of the meal. the chocolate parfait with godiva liquer was nice, balances out the saltiness lingering in my mouth. tried hubby's lychee sorbet - refreshing, kid's mousse fortune cookie, so-so, but they found it amusing. i actually could eat more, the portions were just too small. we did not see paris hilton, but did see robin leach with a couple young blonds. :)",

(usually i would have to look back at the menu to remember what we ordered, but it all made a lasting impression in this case).  we literally cleaned all of the plates - everything was great, and quick too!\n\nluckily, even with all of that food, we saved room for dessert.  chris brought out a beautiful birthday cake for the birthday girl and boy (my bro and sis are twins).  i'm talking really quality, beautiful gourmet cake (like aj's in az).  it had \"happy birthday a & z\" written on it in chocolate and it was a vanilla layer cake of sorts.  \n\ni didn't pay the bill, and i'm sure it was expensive, but this was by far the best meal we had on the trip, and i'm sure it was worth it!  the only reason i'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the wait we had upon arrival - other than that, tao was amazing!  beautiful ambiance too - i'll have to go back next time to check out the nightclub!",

            "very disappointing, especially for a vegas restaurant that charges an arm and a leg. just for a restaurant itself, very very disappointing. \n\nthis was supposed to be an asian fusion type restaurant but it really lacked in asian authenticity in terms of flavor. it seemed like the chefs just used different types of sauces  to compensate for lack of flavor which resulted in chaos. \n\n<mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with sausage: very small portion. weird \"sweet <mark>Hot and Sour Soup</mark>\" sauce spread over the rice. i would not order again. \n\n<mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>: lacking flavor. some type of sweet taste that i knew after one bite, i would get sick of it after subsequent bites. very unauthentic. i would not order this again either.", 
            "i went here with a group of friends to celebrate a \"birthday\" which turned out to be something else. the interior was nice but the food was a bit marginal for the price. i mean, c'mon! duck <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> for $15? <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> for $19-22? for one person? i'm not one to look at the price but this place made me do it. i could go to any asian restaurant for the same food but for less money and better taste.\n\nwe started the night with some tasty cock<mark>Tai</mark>. i wanted to try love potion #9 (grey goose cherry noir, cranberry and lychee puree) but angela h beat me to it so to be different,  i got a dragon slayer (bacardi dragonberry, ginger liqeur, strawberry and togarashi spice) instead. black pearl ((henessy black, blackberries, yuzu and agave nectar). the drinks were pretty awesome!\n\nwasabi-<mark>Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon</mark> with tempura <mark>Sweet Onion Rings</mark>:\nthis one was the best value for $38. good and tender filet. however,  this one came with fat...and i'm not a fan of animal fat.  the wasabi crust was great and not overpowering/sinus-clearing. 3.5/5\n\nmandarin sizzled <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with peking duck:\nthe duck was great and overall this was good <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark>. but for $15 and a serving for 1 person? not so much. 3/5\n\n<mark>Lacquered Roast Pork</mark>:\nchinese bbq pork is what this is. you get about 7 slices of pork. i mean, it wasn't bad but it wasn't spectacular either. go to chinatown instead. 2/5\n\nthe highlight of the evening was the dessert sampler. it was a huuuge plate with all kinds of crazy chocolate desserts. we had a chocolate mousse, a giant fortune cookie filled with cream and chocolate, ice cream, souffle, wontons with chocolate, fruits...crazy!", 
            "the food here was underwhelming and over priced, while the restaurant itself is very dark and obnoxiously loud.  underwhelming enough that i don't remember everything that i tried, over priced enough that it's 2x - 3x the cost of the same dishes elsewhere, dark enough that phones/flashlights are required to illuminate the menus, and loud enough that you'll be yelling at the person sitting across from you.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> and had a chance to try the <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> and some other dishes, and they were all forgettable.  much of the menu consists of standard rice, noodle, meat and seafood dishes that you can find at other asian restaurants.  the most memorable thing was the dessert platter that was brought out to celebrate an anniversary; pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tao-asian-bistro-las-vegas#qi9v2f49khqexsdtiycxpg\n\ncan't really see myself coming back here.  there are better options within the venetian/palazzo to dine at.",

            "oh, tao - i so badly wanted to give you 5 stars, but your over-hyped restaurant had some sever issues we need to address. 3 out of 5 stars for delicious food but terrible customer service. word to the wise: tao = a place where the customer is always wrong.\n\nhere's the skinny: we dined 11 deep saturday evening while in town celebrating my 32nd birthday. it's memorial day weekend and expected to be a madhouse in vegas, so i made every precaution to secure reservations, be on time for said reservations and ensure my entire party was on time with me. i may not be kim kardashian, but perhaps the manager failed to note that my reservation was made by someone who works directly with them and asked for my party to be taken care of. i'm also assuming they didn't know that i am a celebrity publicist in la and have sent numerous clients to spend thousands of dollars at their establishment. maybe if this was noted my party would have received better service. \n\nfood: my boyfriend and i split the chicken dumplings, the spicy yellow<mark>Tai</mark> sushi roll and the chicken <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark>. more than enough food! the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> seemed to be in a never-ending bowl! it alone would have fed the 2 of us easily. the dumplings were the best choice out of our order. fresh, steamed and flavorful. i only wish there were more in an order! the roll was good, but nothing special. my friend had the bbq pork and it was phenomenal. i'd look into that if bbq meats are your thing. the <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> was pretty standard. it was also good but nothing to write home about. nonetheless, i was pleased with the overall good experience. the crowning glory was the giant fortune cookie that was sent out for my birthday (it is filled with both vanilla and chocolate cream - oh hey ying yang!) - which was the only good move by the restaurant the entire meal.\n\nthe service: this is where things get rough. we sat down for our 8:30pm reservation around 8:45pm. we didn't mind the 15 minute wait. we're a large party and it's saturday night - reservations can take some time. i get it. we sat down and didn't see a waitress for nearly 20 minutes. when she finally came by the table she took our drink order and bounced for another 20 minutes or so. my friend asked for an iced tea that 40 minutes later had never made it's way to the table. when we asked about it, the waitress took another 15 minutes to bring it claiming that they had to \"brew a new pot\". ok. then when we were an hour and a half into our dinner order waiting for more beverages the waitress was m.i.a. we finally called over the manager and asked if we could please get some drinks (one of which had already been ordered and never brought to the table). his response was \"what? are you trying to get something free out of this?\". i'm sorry? no. we are trying to get our drinks and spend more money in your establishment. wow. the next epic failure of this restaurant/nightclub comes from the security guard/staff. my boyfriend got up from the table to take a work related call. it was noisy inside so he stepped outside to take it. when he came back in a security guard grabbed him by his shirt and said \"where do you think you're going?! get in line!\" to which my boyfriend responded - \"i've been sitting with a table of 11 for nearly 2 hours. i just stepped outside to take a call.\" the guard then responded \"yeah right\" and grabbed him by his shirt collar. when he turned around to radio someone my boyfriend just yanked himself free and walked inside. the final straw was when the waitress asked if we'd like to divide the tab. we said yes and tried to be fair by <mark>Maki</mark> a few groups so as not to create 11 separate checks for her. tik-tok - 1 hour later (literally) she plopped down the checks with a look of irritation and left. \n\ntotal time in restaurant (due to slow service) - 3.5 hours!! it was nearly midnight when we finally left!\n\nthe club was hopping but we were not interested in that. we just wanted a nice dinner in what seemed to be only a mildly busy restaurant. a party of 11 would have left a much bigger tip had the service been respectable. i get that everyone wants to dine here, but that doesn't mean you have to stop creating a great customer experience for those choosing your restaurant. there are many other options.", 
            "our first time at tao asian bistro.  we walked through an area with cement bathtubs with floating rose petals.  really pretty!  i had phoned in my reservation but when i got there, they didn't have my reservation!  go figure!  anyway, we got seated promptly.  we ordered the <mark><mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> Noodles</mark> with chicken, <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with kimchee, red <mark>Vegetable Fried Brown Rice</mark> with pork belly, endamame, <mark>TAO Lo Mein</mark>, & <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark>.  \n\nit was just ok.  not fantastic.  it's bordering on westernized chinese food.  the presentation of some of the dishes made me wonder why they selected their china that way.  the bowls were huge and on a pedestal and not your usual rice bowl.  very difficult to eat noodles or rice.  they try to impress that they are using chinese china in an interesting, splashy way but it doesn't make sense.  why use a clay pot for <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark> when there's hardly any beans in the dish?  you have to really look into the pot to grab the <mark>XO Chinese Long Beans</mark>!  \n\nd\\u00e9cor is very nice.  big buddha as the centrepiece.  dark with very low lighting and candles.  i had to get used to it.  there's a wall of pipes, in their own coloured showcases.  interesting.", 
            "group of 5 ladies, came here on a saturday night during the 4th of july holiday. first of all, the hostess with the blonde hair and orange dress was a total petty bitch and did not want to seat us. had us waiting for over an hour for a table when we saw several open. we would have at least ordered drinks and  appetizers but there was no service in the waiting area. the waiting area was blaring with loud edm music, not at all conducive for dinner or lounge talk and definitely scared us a bit thinking that the club would be the same. meanwhile, troops of people with questionable attractiveness and boldly comfortable physiques would trapes in every few minutes heading over to the nightclub area. we were already on the guestlist for the party but having had good history with their sister company, lavo, we wanted to try the food first,  but in these moments, both the dinner and club scene here were so off putting. the night started off quite weak. once we were seated, after 12, finally the service came pouring in. at least 3 or 4 servers came to our table to excuse the slackness and eager to be of service. nice view of the big buddha statue in the center. food was decent, we enjoyed the pan fried <mark>Chicken Gyoza</mark>, the <mark>Lobster Wontons</mark> and the <mark>Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups</mark> were ok, we kind of got full off of just appetizers cause again, large portions. my cousins miso <mark>Satay of <mark>Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass</mark></mark> entree was good. strong miso flavor, but if you're cool with that, its good. big portion <mark>Satay of Chicken</mark> <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> by someone else. i dont like <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> or peanut tastes so i didnt taste it but she enjoyed. looked big and fresh. i split the shrimp, lobster, scallop in bean sauce entree with someone else because it sounded big and also to cut costs and have more things on the table to taste. was really looking forward to it, it has all of my favorite meaty chewy seafoods. it was shockingly bad, dont know if there was an error made in the sauce recipe, but i have had plenty of similar dishes in the past, never have any been half as bad, and it came highly recommended by the waiter and was amongst the most expensive so we were surprised that it was so bitter. the table tasted and agreed that the sauce had an unpleasant taste. the waiter took it off of our bill gracefully and we left a great tip in exchange. in this moment, the great service that we are accustomed to from lavo, was thankfully shining through here at tao as well. a nice chick came to our table to stamp us and set us up for the complimentary club access. as i said before, we were already on the guestlist so didnt need it, but its nice that they have that additional incentive for dining there, as lavo used to do. will continue nightclub review in other yelp page.", 
            "terrible service and not a good experience at all.\n\nit is very clear that this restaurant only welcomes those for whom money is of no consequence as they literally tried to take as much money from us as possible.\n\nfirst of all, we were asked, \"still or sparkling?\" thinking these were our only choices and still must equal tap water, we asked for still. that was a $24 mistake. although we ended up getting the manager to take it off our bill, it caused a huge hassle.\n\nwhen ordering my $14 vegetarian meal, the waiter stopped me mid-sentence and told me i needed to try their kung pau tofu dish. although mildly annoyed to be told my choice was wrong, i was excited to try this off-menu item. \\u00a0it ended up being too spicy for my taste and i switched meals with someone else. \\u00a0fast -forward to when the check came and i found out the meal he had convinced me to order was almost twice the price of the meal i originally had picked out. needless to say, i felt a little cheated.\n\nthe meal i did end up eating was good.... vegan <mark>Drunken Lobster Pad Thai</mark> with gluten free noodles. (yes, it was also appreciated that they had gf options!) \\u00a0we were also able to use their buy-one-get-one promotion for cock<mark>Tai</mark> as it was happy hour. however, everyone at the table was really disappointed and rather indignant at the service that was given.\\u00a0\n\nthe cuisine was good but the experience was marred by the sub-par service and the costly extras.",
