            "overpriced, under-portioned, \"global\" tapas.\n\ni was really underwhelmed with the food.  the best turned out to be the least expensive - the <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark> shooters.  at $6, i should have ordered 6 of them and i would have been so much happier - creamy, tasty and fragrantly truffle-oiled.\n\ninstead, here's what i ordered:\n\ncrab and avocado sphere - not terribly different from a california roll, but a lot less filling.  somewhat refreshing with the watermelon puree.\n\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> - fresh, red tuna but completely boring.  really, cilantro and a slice of jalapeno? where's the creativity, people?  we didn't get any kind of foam on it.\n\nlobster mac n' cheese - mini-ramekin sized, but i enjoyed it.  pasta was a bit overcooked, decent chunks of lobster.\n\nfoie gras mousse with huckleberry gelee - this was not a mousse.  it wasn't even a pate, it was more of a hard cold butter consistency.  together with the huckleberry gelee, it was reminiscent of a bad peanut butter jelly pairing.  \n\nalso, it's a casual, noisy space - on the unfortunate night i was there, we could hear the wailings of bad karaoke going on in the casino floor.", 
            "the truffled <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark> and seared foie gras were amazing.  i could live off of the <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark>.  the foie gras was delicate and the entire dish was perfectly balanced. \n\nthe service was neither here nor there.  the waiter was friendly and cute with his french accent.  the hostess, on the other hand, was a complete mindless bimbo.  \n\nwe had reservations for a late dinner.  the restaurant was pretty empty and she decided to seat us near the drunken fools who were starting to become loud and belligerent.  really?  our waiter switched our tables without a hitch and even commented that he didn't understand why the hostess sat us at the original table.", 
            "3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 because i have mad respect for chef hubert keller and what he's doing here.\n\nthe ambiance and decor:\nfirst, it's great that you can always get reservations for fleur, which is not possible for most of the other top restaurants in vegas. i'm not sure if this is public response on the food, location or marketing, but it's something to consider. the location definitely leaves something to be desired; it's in the back of the hotel, and you end up with a view to some slots and walkways due to the open floorplan. the decor itself is very nice; supple leather, slate, glass, and some random \"edgy\" art pieces. there's also a beautiful wine cellar behind glass. the big detractor for me was the outfit the cocktail waitresses wear. i'm normally not one to argue with ladies wearing short hoochie dresses, but it's totally out of place in an otherwise classy restaurant.\n\nfood:\nfor sure, the two stand out dishes are the <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark> and the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>. in fact, i urge everyone to just order four orders of the tacos as their meal. my friend got the fleur burger (despite the exorbitant price) and really liked it, but i've heard from others that it's quite dry. in general, i hear the menu is hit or miss, but you'll have to read other reviews to see if people can advise you towards some dishes.\n\nservice:\nthe service is impeccable. our waitress was very sweet, gave us time to figure out what we wanted and added in recommendations. her wine pairings were also excellent. the service actually made the meal special, which isn't something you'd normally say in vegas.\n\nbottom line, fleur is worth a visit (or a second visit for me)!", 
            "you made our christmas dinner amazing!\n\nwe booked on opentable.com for our reservation after narrowing down restaurants that are wallet and taste bud friendly.\n\nthe restaurant:\n+ lit with a dim but even lighting (so i can see what i was eating), the room had a wide open classy feel to it even though some tables were quite close. \n+ seating was either provided by plush chairs or bar like chairs at a higher table. my only complaint is with the tall chairs. you can't scoot forward. so once you pull it out to sit and find that you are a bit away from the table, it becomes very hard to scoot a metal chair with your weight across a plush carpet. so leaning awkwardly forward was not my thing...\n+decor was high end and minimal at the same time. but not too much where you are afraid to scratch the table.\n+ music, not too loud and not too soft to hear everyone's conversations. we could not hear the casino area just outside the entrance.\n\nthe food:\n+ we started with the: <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark>: a creamy calm soup. not too intense on the onion flavor but with a hint of truffle oil with a breath taking aroma. (this was out favorite and ordered it to split between me and significant other).\n+next: gyros; not listed on the menu link. made with thick lamb and vinaigrette lettuce/olive mixture. (the lamb was cooked to perfection, not too dry or moist, and seasoned lighly without overpowering the meat).\n+black angus sliders: sadly there were only three. we had to split one and wish we had more. \n+lastly we ordered the chocolate souffle. this was our first so we can't act like experts and critique it absurdly. however we loved every bit and scrambled to grab the last bite. served with oreo ice cream to ease your tongue from too much warm souffle.\n\ni do have a food allergy and appreciated it very much when the waitress was able to recall off the top of her head if a dish contained nuts or not.", 
            "i had an awesome opportunity to dine twice at fleur by hubert keller, a restaurant owned by one of the greatest chefs of our time, hubert keller. fleur is a small-plates restaurant featuring tastes from around the world.\n\none of the most delicious things i've ever had was the <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark> with truffle oil. it was an explosion of flavors, and it was so delicious i had to go a second day in a row, just to eat the soup. the first day, i ordered this delicious flatbread, called the <mark>Tarte Flambe</mark>, which had onions, bacon, truffle oil, shaved asparagus, and creme fraiche. it was simply light and full of flavor.\n\nmy husband ordered the cuban sandwich with fries, and he was very delighted with his meal. for dessert that day, i ordered the brownie cake pops. they were simply divine. they contained milk chocolate mousse, dark chocolate ganache, and cocoa nibs. i love cakepops, and i have to say this was one of the best i've ever had.\n\nthe following day, march 8th, i decided to go downstairs by myself and grab a bite of that delicious <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark> with truffle oil, that i had the day prior. i also ordered the brioche beignets served with vanilla and cherry anglaises sauces. it was so delicious, and as you know, one of my favorite things is a good beignet.\n\nopen entering the restaurant i spotted chef hubert keller himself, i almost fainted. i was looking at his poster outside and said to myself that this couldn't be actually him. i was happy i had the opportunity to tell him how much i was a fan of his work, and how delicious his soup was.\n\nto kick off an even better birthday, i got a delicious chocolate cupcake served by chef keller himself. i was so surprised and almost passed out from shock. i was deeply humbled by the whole experience, and never in a million years thought this could happen to me.\n\noverall, this is simply one of the best restaurants i've ever been to, and it will always serve a special place in my heart. thank you so much to chef keller and the wonderful staff, you made my 30th birthday special, and i will never forget it.", 
            "it was an unusually calm and quiet night in vegas, but there was a party going on in flavortown! ok, so i'm not much of a guy fieri fan, but hubert keller... that's another story. started out with amazing onion soup shooters... fantastic! in fact - the entire dinner was great (duck terrine, grilled octopus, fleur burger with foie & truffles), but the beginning (that <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark>! oh my...) and ending with chef keller's famous gran marnier souffle... magnifique!", 
            "what a fantastic place! i have stayed in the mandalay a few times (i think 5) and i had never been to this restaurant. i think in part that the bar is blocking the lovely ambiance of the back so it looks too casual from the casino side. the manager knew it was my birthday and came baring glasses of champagne and an amazing truffle <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark> shooters in little martini glasses. we then proceeded to order family style:\n\ndelicious <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark>- parmesan, lavash, anchovy, truffle\nseared pork gyoza with garlic ponzu and green onion\nduck terrine which is a duck breast confit terrine with picked veggies and a celery root remoulade\nblack garlic escargot in a puff pastry crouton\nheirloom tomato, smoked duck breast and burrata salad \n\nthey are all amazing and i will definitely be coming back.\n\nat the end of the meal, they brought me a candle in a cake with my name on the plate in chocolate as well as a card with a recipe in it as my gift. i wish i knew what all the ingredients are to make it but i'll attempt one of these days!", 
            "dinner review ...\n\nnote about the \"star\" rating ... i gave fleur five stars. you might ask why given that some of the dishes (as explained below) were just okay, and the reason is that the other dishes were really, really good. ultimately, i like to judge restaurants and food based on whether i'll remember them ... and i'll definitely remember the beef tartare tacos, veloute, and ricotta gnocchi.  in addition, the service was excellent.\n\nhad dinner at fleur before seeing le reve at the wynn. decided on the tasting menu (\"tastes from around the world\"), which was reasonably priced (in a relative sense, given how much - and easily - you can pay at the other celebrity-chef restaurants around las vegas) ... four courses plus dessert (amounting to ten dishes, and i added escargot to boot):\n\ncourse 1 -\n\n1. beef tartare tacos - terrific dish. i'm a big fan of beef tartare; the taco shells added texture; and the beef was great.\n \n2. truffled beef carpaccio - good dish. but i've had the same at other good restaurants; not bad by any means ... again, a good dish, just not necessarily memorable.\n\ncourse 2 -\n\n3. <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark> - terrifc dish again. this was my personal favorite, memorable in a way that the beef carpaccio might not be; the veloute was rich and creamy, with a trace of truffle.\n\n4. gyoza - mediocre dish.  this was my least favortie dish; the gyozas were somewhat uninspired with neither the pillowy-ness of boiled dumplings or the crispy skin of potstickers. \n\ncourse 3 -\n\n5. ricotta gnocchi & braised short rib - very good dish. i really enjoyed the gnocchi (and i've had a lot lately ... with my favorite being at osteria mamma in los angeles), especially the nice pan sear; short ribs were also tasty.\n\n6. grilled octopus - okay dish. not quite as good as the gnocchi, but better than the gyoza.\n\ncourt 4 -\n\n7. grilled skirt steak lyonnaise - very good dish. the steak was cooked well (as is properly, not as in burnt to death) ... always enjoy steak and potatoes.\n\n8. diver scallop - good dish. nicely cooked scallops, but don't remember the pork belly.\n\n9. ratatouille - very good dish.  i really enjoyed the ratatouille; i recall another review saying the vegetables were mushy, but i found the whole dish to be spot on.\n\ndessert -\n\n10. brioche beignets - terrific dish. light, fluffy pilows of goodness ... again, i thought the beignets were terrific (but as a word of caution to set expectations, these are different than the beignets you might expect at cafe du monde).\n\nadditional dish -\n\n11. escargot - good dish. friend had never had snails, so added an order; good dish, but i also don't eat snails often enough to add any insight.\n\nservice - service was friendly and professional; have nothing but good things to say about the staff. \n\natmosphere - comfortable dining room, with an upscale but still casual feel.  for more casual, try the food court, and for fine dining, try aureole next door."

            "now called \"fleur\" and a casual tapas menu.  it is absolutely delicious.  my recommendations would be: <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, skirt steak, mac n cheese and the mussels were my favorite.  you can also order anything off the dessert menu, they are all incredible.  keller was very nice and came to our table to say hello and take a photo.", 
            "i had a chance to meet and chat with hubert and he told me that this is now fleur, which appears to be a more accessible and budget-friendly than before. i believe fleur de lys in sf still remains the same. of course, the best part about the whole experience was meeting hubert! right after we were seated, my bf saw hubert coming out of the kitchen, and he was heading straight to our table to greet us! what an experience!\n\nthey have a tasting menu ($45) which consists of 6 preselected dishes. for us, it was: <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, onion soup, cod fritters, gnocchi with marinara and pesto, sliders, and a trio of <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> (earl grey, honey lavender, cookie dough). my favorites were the onion soup (with a touch of truffle oil!) and the gnocchi, which were so soft, light, and airy! we also ordered some other dishes: crab and avocado sphere, \"shower\" mac n' cheese (calling all top chef master fans!), braised hamachi, and skirt steak. everything was well prepared and executed. \n\nfor dessert, besides the <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark>, we also ordered their cheesecake lollipops. these were great in theory but not so great in application. the cheesecake would start to slide off after one bite, and it was not as cold as i would have preferred. because it was my birthday, they also gave us a vanilla panna cotta with huckleberry sorbet on the house, which was absolutely divine.\n\ni had a fantastic time and the best part of it all is that it is super budget-friendly, so there is no excuse not to try it out! hopefully fellow yelpers come on a day hubert is there, because he is just as humble and welcoming in person as he appears on t.v.!", 
            "(3.5 stars)\n\nmandalay bay's fleur de lys (an offshoot of the michelin star sf restaurant) has been re-imagined as fleur by hubert keller (with a move from fine dining to tapas style).  i am not sure why they made the change.  maybe it was due to the economy and they wanted to provide something less expensive and more approachable.\n\ni never visited fleur de lys, but the decor seems similar.  contemporary room with a warm feel.  high ceilings provide an open feel.  there is enough spacing between the tables to make conversation easy.  the wall still has the fleur de lys' wall decor (stones and rose decoration).  they have swapped out the white tablecloth for simple lacquered wood tables.\n\nwe tried several dishes, which were all well presented.  while most (if not all) of the dishes were probably cooked and tasted okay, they were not very memorable.  also, the portions were dainty (even for tapas) so the food felt a little pricey.  here is a rundown on what we tried.\n\n(cheese platter - 4.5 stars) one of the best cheese dishes i've had.  they had a great assortment of cheeses that ranged in flavor and texture (including a pungent cheese that was presented in delicate ruffled layers like exotic mushroom petals).  good toasts (including a sweet fruit and nut toast).  there were also good garnishes including honey, a fruit paste and a grape salad (that actually looked a lot better than it tasted).\n\n(tiramisu - 4 stars) the tiramisu was good--nice cream, good coffee flavor and good ladyfingers.  simple but satisfying.  the dessert was served with biscotti, which was just okay.\n\n(<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> - 4 stars) these little crunchy tacos featured raw tuna, jalapeno, lime cilantro, and cabbage.  good flavor, fresh and nice contrasting textures.  it was good but would not be among the best tuna dishes i've had.\n\n(peking duck - 3.5 stars) the duck breast was served with sauteed greens, caramelized pearl onions and date puree.  the flavors were mostly sweet and good; the greens did provide a little bitterness.  the duck was pink and juicy though not the best quality; the skin could have been more crisp.\n\n(skirt steak topped with chimchurri, fingerling baked potato and heirloom tomato salad - 3.5 stars) the heirloom tomato salad was fresh and was dressed in a vibrant vinaigrette.  the very tiny fingerling baked potato was topped with creme fraiche and chives.  it was okay, but when something is that small and cute, it needs to be great.  the skirt steak was juicy and tasty.\n\n(yukon gold potato & veal ravioli - 3.5 stars) the pasta was very thin (almost translucent) and looked like asian dumplings.  the inside veal filling was okay but not great.  it tasted pretty good though.  it was served with tallegio cheese, which had a great flavor.\n\n(panna cotta with berries compote and sorbet - 3 stars) the vanilla panna cotta was creamy and light, but it was overwhelmed by the heavy topping of strong and tart berries.  the sorbet was a little too icy.\n\n(foie gras mousse with huckleberry gelee - 3 stars) the cold foie gras mousse was served in a glass and was topped with a gelee of sweet huckleberry (and accompanied by brioche toasts).  good mix of salty and sweet but nothing spectacular.\n\n(hummus and baba ganoush - 2.5 stars) one of the dips had a strong garlic flavor (can't remember which one).  served with pita bread.  okay but pretty standard stuff.\n\n(angus sliders with red onion, cheese and pear - 2.5 stars) the sliders featured juicy meat and good housemade buns.  there was too much onion though; it was overpowering.  there was a little bit of thin matchstick fries, which were just okay.\n\n(chocolate souffle with chocolate ganache and mango ice cream - 2.5 stars) the chocolate souffle looked great.  great rise and a nice design (fleur) on top.  the souffle was not right though--it was way too spongy.  also, the chocolate ganache tasted burnt.  the ice cream was creamy and good.\n\n(cheesecake lollipops - 2 stars) these firm cheesecake lollipops were decorated with graham crackers and chocolate.  they looked good, but they were just okay.\n\n(salt cod fritters - 2 stars) these lightly breaded hush puppies did not have a great fish center--mostly bread.  the outside was kind of soft.  while the fritters were not bland, they had a pretty boring flavor.  the romesco dipping sauce was thick and did not improve the dish.\n\nservice was very good.  great staff with many friendly, polite and attentive team members.\n\nif fleur was a little cheaper and the portions were bigger, i would have liked it more.  the food was decent, but if the food tasted as good as it looked, i would have walked away much more satisfied.  still, fleur was significantly better than the other vegas tapas spot i tried--julian serrano at aria.\n\nlocated in mandalay bay, parking is complimentary (valet or self-parking structure).", 
            "fleur is wonderful.  my husband and i ate there this past weekend and loved it.  \n\nwe had the onion soup (my favorite), the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, the sliders, the gnocci, the prawns, the cheesecake lolipops (hubby's favorite), and the chocolate souffle.  we also had a few cocktails, which were excellent and then added a decadent flight of the chocolate/coffee cocktails with our dessert.  we didn't know what to expect and were very pleasantly surprised by this place.\n\nwe sat at a table towards the back of the bar and were not sitting totally out in the open courtyard area that extends into the hotel walkway, which i preferred.\n\nall in all this place was fantastic and is a must visit on future trips.", 
            "last year i took my wife to fleur de lys for her birthday and we had one of the best meals we've ever had. a year later, we're back. although now it's just called fleur and the concept has changed to a more casual eatery serving small plates (don't call it tapas... it's not a spanish restaurant!). \n\nthey've got a larger \"patio\" and a central bar, along with a new facade that looks like part of a huge wicker picnic basket (i'm not a fan). the inside of the dining area is lighter -- they stripped out all the curtains -- and more open and replaced the roses mounted on the stone wall with corks. they were going with a casual feel and they got it. the space also felt a lot smaller than i remember.\n\nevery dish we tried ranged from good to excellent:\n\noysters ($10) - margarita sorbet, orange pur\\u00e9e. 3 per order. the presentation is cool with the use of dry ice in a rectangular box with stones and seaweed. the sweetness of the sorbet and pur\\u00e9e dominated any trace of the brininess or meatiness of the oysters. it was good, but an overly sweet way to start off the meal.\n\ncrab and avocado sphere ($14) - watermelon gazpacho. another sweet dish thanks to the avocado and watermelon. it was good, but could have used something more savory in it.\n\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> ($11) - jalape\\u00f1os, lime cilantro. amazing! the big, fat chunks of tuna were so fresh and silky smooth. it was the perfect blend of hot and cold and soft and crunchy. i want a dozen of these to go!\n\npeking duck ($15) - greens, pearl onions, date pur\\u00e9e. this is one duck dish that will make me forget about all others. tender, juicy, rich and savory. and, the skin was crispy too. one bite with the other ingredients (that date pur\\u00e9e was damn good) and i was in heaven.\n\nskirt steak ($15) - chimmichurri, roasted fingerling potato, creme fraiche. the greens, tomato, and potato were all good but the steak was a bit tough and chewy. my least favorite dish of the night.\n\ntiramisu ($8) - coffee-marsala ladyfinger, mascarpone, chocolate. i'm no expert at tiramisu, but this was delicious. so good i wanted to lick every last drop out of the dish.\n\nfor beverages, we had two glasses of wine, a chimay grande reserve, and the best porter i've ever had -- a meantime london porter. sure, i don't know much about beer, but it was amazing! it had a sweet, smokey taste and a really smooth finish. \n\nthe service was ok. our waiter was working a few tables so we didn't see him very often. the pace of the meal wasn't bad, just a little on the slow side. we were celebrating my wife's birthday and they did write happy bday on the tiramisu plate, but i was expecting, at the very least, some petit fours or some other complimentary item to end the meal. maybe i was expecting too much but even at a place like applebee's don't they give you something for free on your birthday?\n\ni would definitely come here again to try other items (and order more <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> and another porter or two). but, i would hope that the service picks up. this place is still a little rough around the edges, but very close to being a 5 star dining experience. we ended up spending $165 (incl. tax and tip). in this city and for that kind of food, that's not bad. too many times, at other restaurants, i've spent twice that for inferior food.", 
            "4.5 stars overall? i have to wonder if i was at the same establishment. my experience was a 2-3 star experience max. food was just not up to par for me. we ordered:\n\noysters - i didn't have any, but the table thought they were good overall. \n<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> - nothing spectacular. tasted like something any sushi joint would have, except the sushi joint would probably taste better.\nwings - go for these if you like soy sauce chicken. nasty.\ncod fritters - didn't taste the fish at all. looked like crab, but just tasted like fried dough\npork ribs - tasteless although very tender\nmac and cheese - inedible. worst mac and cheese i've ever had in my life. i thought it was inedible. maybe these were not my style, but i don't like my mac swimming in cheese soup. not cheesy.\nprawns - fruit was good, but nothing you can't get from a regular vietnamese restaurant for a fraction of the cost. $17 for two shrimp - rip! these were shrimp, not prawns.\nhummus and baba ganoush - most uninspired dish of the night, yet it was the best dish of the night.\nmushrooms - extremely salty! paired well with the tasteless ribs.\nsliders - good, but i've had better. \n\nthe food was so blah that we skipped dessert. left very disappointed.", 
            "by elaine and scott harris\n\nchef hubert keller does it again in las vegas with his name sake fleur by hubert keller located in the mandalay bay in the venue previously occupied by his renowned fleur de lys.  chef hubert keller is known throughout the world not only as a classically trained french  chef but an author and tv host has well. \n\n\n\nwe had dined at fleur de lys in las  vegas several times over the years and were always impressed with the classic d\\u00e9cor , unique chefs table, immaculate service and of course great french cuisine as only chef keller could create.  fleur's concept of tapas had us wondering how this would work as we walked into chef keller's newest creation.  \nwalking into fleur you first notice its \" open air \" casual tables and a lively bar with plasma tvs. as we walked past the tables near the bar guided by our hostess to our table in the main dining room we gazed upward to the chefs table overlooking the dining room surrounded by hundreds of bottles of wine which brought back fond memories of fleur de lys . the d\\u00e9cor in the main dining room features earth tones of brown and beige with lighting in the shape of trees which gives guest a warm inviting feeling.\n\"fleur is about globally inspired tapas\" stated gm owen deignan as he met us at our table and welcomed us to fleur.  the word \"global\" inspired us so we put ourselves in the very capable hands of   chef keller and his chef de cuisine  steven wolf.\nour first stop as always,  was  perusing  through the very extensive wine list. the wine list features most of the \"trophy\" wines that you would expect from a venue such as fleur but also offered a nice variety of wines from $ 60.00 and up. we chose a nice cote du rhone that we expected should pair well with whatever chef keller and chef wolf sent out. \n\n\n <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> jalape\\u00f1o, lime cilantro\n \n  when our very attentive server brought out the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> , the dish was so pleasing to the eye we just wanted to stare at before we went any further.  the expression \" you eat with your eyes\"   could not be more true of this dish. the pepper provided just the right heat and a nice avocado foam to cool things down made this a very balanced dish and one of our favorites of the night.\n\nmerguez sausage saffron couscous, harissa\n we waited with anticipation to see where the chefs would take us for our next stop . a north african dish that is also popular in northern europe, the merguez sausage  with saffron gave our palates at treat of some wonderful exotic flavors that chef keller creates better than none other.\n\nangus sliders blue cheese, onion, bacon, pear\nwhat would a tapas restaurant be with out sliders ?  fleur does it as good as anyone with juicy angus sliders with creamy blue cheese , onion , crispy bacon and a nice contrast of pear.  we will come back  just to enjoy this dish once again.\n\n\ncr\\u00e8me brul\\u00e9e trio earl grey, orange, cookie dough  &\nchocolate souffl\\u00e9 chocolate ganache and tobasco ice cream\n\nafter spending most of the night at fluer dining our way around the world with chef keller could we have \"room\"for anything else ?  of course  ! and it was now time for the finale and what a finale it was.  a cr\\u00e8me brulee  trio featuring earl grey , orange and cookie was a exquisite introduction into one of the best chocolate souffle's we have had.  the lightness of the earl grey  was the perfect lead into the souffle at the end. these dishes were decadant, delicious and should not be missed .\n\n\nfluer has a couple great specials to indulge in as well.  for those who enjoy classic french wines and a one of a kind burger chef keller  offers his fleurburger 5000 wagyu beef, foiruffle  gras, with a bottle of 1995 ch\\u00e2teau petrus for $ 5000.00 . \n\nif the fleur burger is a little out of your range. chef kellers \"in the shower\" mac & cheese lobster, brunoise vegetable is a dish that he created for master chefs that really shows off his creativity in layering flavors.  \n\nchef keller has captured what people are looking for in these days and times. his   culinary artistry is now available and approachable for families and many others than m", 
            "overpriced, under-portioned, \"global\" tapas.\n\ni was really underwhelmed with the food.  the best turned out to be the least expensive - the <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark> shooters.  at $6, i should have ordered 6 of them and i would have been so much happier - creamy, tasty and fragrantly truffle-oiled.\n\ninstead, here's what i ordered:\n\ncrab and avocado sphere - not terribly different from a california roll, but a lot less filling.  somewhat refreshing with the watermelon puree.\n\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> - fresh, red tuna but completely boring.  really, cilantro and a slice of jalapeno? where's the creativity, people?  we didn't get any kind of foam on it.\n\nlobster mac n' cheese - mini-ramekin sized, but i enjoyed it.  pasta was a bit overcooked, decent chunks of lobster.\n\nfoie gras mousse with huckleberry gelee - this was not a mousse.  it wasn't even a pate, it was more of a hard cold butter consistency.  together with the huckleberry gelee, it was reminiscent of a bad peanut butter jelly pairing.  \n\nalso, it's a casual, noisy space - on the unfortunate night i was there, we could hear the wailings of bad karaoke going on in the casino floor.", 
            "what a fantastic meal.  amazing food and service, excellent prices, interesting and varied menu.  we are major carnivores, so if you're looking for insight into vegetarian items, this review will be of no interest to you.  \n\nwe decided not to go with the prix fixe because the dishes weren't as appealing to us as those on the regular menu and desserts are usually wasted on us--we really prefer savory items.  at $180/couple, it is a reasonable price, but we just wanted to sample other items.\n\nthe selections were fantastic--we chose 8 tapas (each selection is generally shareable between 2-3 people, with a couple of bites per person) and were completely full after the meal.  with a $45 bottle of wine, the meal came to around $175, which was a steal.\n\nour absolute favorite were the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>--the plate comes with three delicious petite crunchy tacos that combine perfectly with a raw piece of beautiful tuna, serrano, avocado cream, and cilantro.  one of the most well-balanced dishes i've had in awhile in terms of flavor and texture.  i could eat this every day.\n\nother recommendations include the steak tartar, cod fritters, sliders, mussels, and duck, all of which were mouth-wateringly delicious.  would easily order again.  \n\nthe lobster mac and cheese and veal ravioli were both okay--would probably not order again.\n\nslight dings: we could hear the pounding bass music from one of the clubs at mandalay bay, but it's vegas, so what do you expect.  also, we had to wait about 15 minutes past our reservation time for the table, but quickly passed the time in the casino, so no big deal. \n\nbottom line:  this is a perfect place for a delicious, fun, and interesting dinner in vegas if you're not looking to break the bank but also want to stimulate your palate.",

            "small plates seem to be the trend and hubert keller is making his effort to that trend in what used to be fleur de lys, the vegas branch of his highly rated san francisco dining establishment.  i've eaten many times at both the sf establishment and the fdl in vegas.  i have now had two meals in the converted vegas house now simply called \"fleur\".\n\nok, it's a bit pricy for a small plates joint but really, the food is very good.  on my last visit the service may have been a bit too attentive but that's probably because they weren't all that busy for mid week lunch.  food comes out quickly and is very tasty but, as mentioned in another review, isn't all that large.  i think the price/value perception would be better if they added a bit more food on the plate.  there were two of us at the table and one of the dishes order was the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>.  they're small, no doubt but what really bugs me is that 3 sub-mini tacos were served.  3 would be good for a single diner, what if there's 4 people at the table, someone looses and if there's 2 people, well try cutting a micro hard shell taco.  \n\nour bill was $120 bucks for two, including some drinks (sangria,  $35 for a carafe).  we had 4 different dishes.  it's amazing how small changes can change the perception of price/value.", 
            "this is one of mandalay bay's signature restaurants. it's not clear from the outside, what type or style of restaurant fleur is. it's a beautiful restaurant with a high class feel, yet not stuffy.  my wife and i looked over the menu, and still weren't sure what type of eatery this was.  after asking our waiter, he said \"global foods on little plates\". and sure enough, i got it.  wide variety of foods from salads, appetizers, meats, and vegetarian.  he suggested that each person get 3-4 plates and then they share.\n\nwe had 7 different plates between us, and enjoyed all of them: maple glazed pork ribs (yum); <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> (surprisingly tasty); peking duck (ok); crab and avocado sphere (our favorite;  should have ordered 2); angus sliders (ok); hummus and baba ganoush (tasty); burrata (mozzarella cheese 1-step before it becomes mozzarella -  wonderfully creamy and fun to eat). \n\nour only complaint was the price. with 3 cocktails, $135 for two of us.  probably not unusual for las vegas, but still a bit steep. it was tasty enough, though, so we didn't complain about the dinner bill for long. \n\nif the price doesn't scare you, it's a fun dinner experience (small plates) with flavorful and creative dishes.", 
            "culinary perfection all the way around. the food is delicious and is very conducive to sharing with friends. we had the lobster macaroni and cheese, <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, and gnocchi. the service was impeccable. fleur strives for and achieves perfection. definitely worthy of a return visit!", 
            "one line summary: food, yay. price, nay.\n\nif anyone would like to doubt hubert keller's cooking abilities, you'd better be able to back that up with some evidence. all the plates that we had for dinner here had incredible flavor and presentation. the cool thing about tapas places is the variety that you get with every dish and since you're sharing and the large amount of dishes you can order. but that is where fleur fails. the dishes are extraordinarily expensive per bite and they often serve tapas in servings of 3s. now, i'm no expert in the field but i saw that most tables held 4 or some sort of even number so it seemed like a ploy to get you to order 2 plates in order to get enough for a table. not a problem until you factor in the prices of each plate for just a few bites. at an average of $3-4 a bite, you're not talking chump change for anyone. i don't care how freaking rich you are and i'm not even averaging in that crazy $75 standalone fleur burger (or add another $4.9k and get a '95 petrus and bragging rights).\n\ni'm not here to debate the pricing of restaurants, especially those in large-rent las vegas hotels, but fleur seemed to be a bit over-the-top in that department and in that sense, i didn't find the food worth the money even though it was pretty darn spectacular. ergo, i can't give you a five star rating fleur, sorry babe.\n\nhowever, if you do feel a bit spendy and would like to try some one-of-a-kind tapas, go and eat. avocado, crab, and watermelon gazpacho? it was a refreshing taste explosion that i would eat every day if i could. <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>? probably the best little bite i've had in a while. there are a lot of really good sounding items on the menu so don't hesitate to order up. every dish we got was top notch.", 
            "my husband and i went to fleur a couple months ago to celebrate my birthday- and i was not that impressed with the food.  maybe my expectations were too high for this top chef master.  \n\nthe food presentation was pretty, the service was friendly and attentive, but the food was just ok.  none of them \"wow'd\" my tastebuds.  we ordered quite a number of these small dishes, including the foie gras mousse, lobster mac n cheese, <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, angus sliders, crab and avocado sphere, hummus and baba ganoush. with every dish, i was trying my best to find a reason to love it.  sadly, my favorite part was the cheese platter (and that doesn't require any cooking because i am sure they didn't make the cheese themselves). \n\nafter we finished our dessert (which i have since forgotten), the waiter brought out another lobster mac n cheese.  when we told him we already received it- he said it was \"compliments of the chef\".  well, we already ate a whole bowl of mac n cheese- why couldn't they bring it out earlier?!?!  so, they packed it for us so we can share it with our daughter at home. \n\ni'm really bummed that we missed chef keller's original fleur de lys (before they closed it and opted to open fleur instead) because that sounded deeeee-licious!", 
            "note: i would have given fleur 4 stars, but the bar experience we had was simply horrible. (see below for details.)  with that being said,  i'm still dreaming about my meal here from january of this year, but let's just quickly mention the bad. \n\nlong story short, we had 8:15pm reservations, but did not get seated til 9:15. were they busy? no! how do i know? because, as suggested by the hostess and after being told by her that our table would be available on-time, my husband and i decided to wait at the bar (7:45pm) which had a great view of the dining room. 8:15 came and went and after \nasking the oblivious hostess and supposed manager several times about our table, each time getting a, \"let me check on your table.\" or \"we're pgetting your table set-up at this moment,\" we were finally told our table was ready.  \"yay!\" right? not quite the time to celebrate just yet because there was the issue of the bar tab. according to the hostess, the bartender prefers not to transfer the bar tab to the dining tab so we immediately made sure our credit card was sticking out of the check presenter for the bartender to see. while the bartender successfully alluded us, the hostess came back several times asking us if we had paid the tab yet. you'd think that after coming by a second time, she would have called out to the bartender herself to cash us out, but she just walked away and said she'd check back in a couple of minutes- which she did a couple of more times.  extremely disappointed that the bar staff, hostess and manager were sssssssooooooo poorly trained. so not what to be expected at a  hubert keller restaurant. embarrassing.  \nby this time my husband wanted to leave and it took quite a bit of convincing to make him  finally agree to stay. (guess that wasn't as short as i thought it would be.)\n\ncarrying this horrible experience into the dining room with us, we soon realized that the nightmare part of the evening was over! the vibe in  \nthe dining room was relaxed, service was attentive but not overbearing, \nand the food was simply fantastic! (from what i can recall, we had the \nmussels, <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, lobster mac & cheese, chicken terrine, crab & avocado spheres, pork schnitzels, artichoke barigoule, and the almond \npanna cotta.)\n\n loved everything we ordered and can't wait to go back!", 
            "fleur by hubert keller was one of the girlfriend and my first picks when deciding where to go to eat while we were in vegas.  we decided to go for lunch figuring fleur's small plates would be ideal for a satisfying, yet not overly filling, lunchtime meal.  we decided on having the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> ($13), the green gazpacho ($14), the tarte flamb\\u00e9 ($11), and the \"in the shower\" mac & cheese ($18).  \n\nthe <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were a dish comprised of three small, just over bite-size, tacos with sushi grade tuna chunks accompanied by serrano chilies, cilantro, and avocado cream.  the tacos were flavorful, but the dish was a bit pricey given their size.  the green gazpacho was a wonderfully-balanced chilled soup of pureed tomatillos, green peppers and cilantro.  it was served with a small but tasty jonah crab salad sandwich.  the star of this dish, however, was the soup.  very refreshing and perfect for a warm spring day!  the tarte flamb\\u00e9, a flatbread topped caramelized onions, bacon, truffle, asparagus, and cr\\u00e8me fraiche.  it was a veritable tie between the gazpacho and the tarte for top honors for our meal.  last, but sadly least, was the mac & cheese.  it was supposedly made with lobster, brunoise vegetables, and cheese, but what we received was woefully short on the lobster and veggies.  what was there was so finely diced, denying us the opportunity to get any sense of taste of lobster.  there was seemingly a reasonable amount of cheese, but it was surprisingly bland, excessively runny, and didn't really provide the gooey cheesiness that one would expect.  of course, perhaps the \"in the shower\" part of its name referred to the fact that the cheese would be wet and runny by design.  nevertheless, i've had much, much better lobster mac & cheese for much less money.  service throughout the meal was satisfactory.\n\nfleur is a good restaurant, but a bit uneven in its lunch choices.  perhaps the dinner service offers a greater, more even experience.  still, don't get me wrong.  if you order the tarte and the gazpacho (both 4 star dishes), and perhaps the tacos (3 stars), you'll be pleased.  just avoid the mac & cheese (a 1 star effort)!", 
            "this is the \"bistro\" version of hubert keller's restaurant (okay at least in my opinion). it was a must go to since come on - its hubert? right? \n\ni have to say, i'm a little disappointed. \n\nmy bf and i decided to go here for lunch one day. figured it would be a good place to get a small bite since we were planning on a big dinner. we got four appetizers and honestly it was the perfect amount of food. to start with we got the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>. they were actually very good, the taco itself was a crispy (rather than soft) style taco. the sushi grade tuna was accompanied by a bit of spice supplied by some serrano. this was a good dish, if perhaps a bit overpriced, though perhaps since it was sushi grade i shouldn't complain? the second dish was the highlight of the lunch - gazpacho. this was a green gazpacho and it was made from tomatillos. it was delicious, refreshing and made me want more! next came a nice little flat-bread; the caramelized onions, bacon and truffle gave it a sweet/savory bite - very satisfying. the big disappointment of the meal came from the lobster mac and cheese. not only was it not that flavorful, but it was runny! seriously? make it gooey, not runny; it was almost like the pasta wasn't drained prior to adding the cheese. also - the lobster in it was not very plentiful. for the price, i would have expected a better quality dish. \n\nthis was probably closer to a 3.5 star experience and though i might go back, its definitely not up there as a high priority (though if i do go back, i might have to get some more of that soup!)", 
            "ate here for a snack & the food was tasty, but not sure if it's worth the price.  it was quite expensive for a snack tasting, but probably b/c we ordered too many <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>.  \n\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> ($13) - 4 stars for taste; tuna sashimi in a tiny taco...literally one bite each taco with 3 tacos total.  tasty, but pricey for what it is & for it's size.  not sure if it's worth it.  this will surely rack up the bill..we kept ordering more b/c it was so small.\n\nfig flambe ($11) - 3 stars; good portion size. nice warm, slightly crispy crust with blue cheese & figs spread on top. i like cheese in general, but i felt that the blue cheese flavor was too strong.  if they had spread less cheese on here, it would be 4 stars.  but if you love blue cheese, this might be a good dish for you to order.\n\nburrata ($16) - 4 stars; cheese was soft in texture and spread nicely on the crunchy toast.  wish they gave more cherry tomatoes with the dish though.\n\ngnocchi ($16) -  3 stars; good portion size .  pasta was soft and sat in a nice tomato based sauce.  tasty, but the sauce was a bit on the salty side\n\nalmond panna cotta ($10) - 5 stars; must get dessert.  my favorite of all the tastings & the best panna cotta i've had.  the tart raspberry sorbet compliments the cream well, and it has nice almond crunches with each bite throughout the dessert.  i would come here just to order this dessert.\n\ntiramisu ($10) - 4 stars; nice and creamy with a slight rum taste at the bottom..yum! served with biscotti dipped in chocolate. good, but not as good as the almond panna cotta.", 
            "i'm a sucker for all things tiny. so i love small plates.  i just like to share and try a whole bunch of little things.  so this place wins me over on concept alone. \n\nwe tried the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, skirt steak, nampol messa wings, and artichoke barigoule.  the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were good, but a little to big to eat in one bite and a little too messy to not eat in one bite.  they need to be smaller or less crunchy.  \n\nthe skirt steak was good, but it came with one tiny fingerling potato that wasn't really shareable.  i don't think there is a potato crisis right now so pony up a few more.  it came with a ton of tomatoes.  \n\nthe nampol messa wings were extremely tasty.  right amount of spice, meat came right off the bone, and the salad they came with was very tangy and crunchy.  a good contrast to the wings.\n\nthe artichoke barigoule had issues.  the carrots, artichoke hearts, asparagus, and tomatoes were ok but they just tasted like vegetables.  they hadn't soaked up any of the sauce.  the cheese was excellent but we needed more of it.  and we didn't realize that there were spoons on the table in a little box until after they took the dish away.  it may have been better with spoons to get more of the sauce.  i'm not getting the concept of having a box of spoons on the table anyway.  they give you a fork and knife... why are the spoons self-service?\n\none of the things i really liked is their flight of cocktails.  the tropical flight was delightful with a sumo, sparkling peach, and cherry limeade.  the cocktails were large enough to get a good buzz on.  and you get to try three different cocktails!  pretty good for 18 bucks.\n\nthey can make any cocktail with liquid nitrogen for $25.  we didn't go for this.  but we did go for the affogato a la ln2 served tableside for $15.  ln2 stands for liquid nitrogen, by the way.  they mix it right at your table and you get all the smoke and the ooos and ahhs from other tables.  it's a nice touch.  and the dessert is delicious.  i couldn't have much because it has espresso in it, but still very tasty.  also, the pb&j macaroons with tiny rum shakes are to die for.  \n\nthe decor pretty much looks like fleur de lys did, at least when you get into the inside dining room.  feels fancy but then you look at the 300-lb tourist spilling out of his shorts and t-shirt eating with a camera around his neck and think, maybe not. but i'm disappointed that they took out the roses on the wall and just put in tile or something.  i heard the roses were gone and i thought it was because of some major remodel.  but the frame is still there, they just took the roses away.  don't know why because they were charming and everyone raved about them.\n\nservice was very good, except for the spoon issue.  could have let a sister know!  i definitely recommend coming here for the meat dishes or dessert.  the one vegetarian dish we tried needs some work but it might have just been a fluke... or our inability to find the spoons.",

            "alright...so i'm very aware that there are already way too many reviews for this place, but it was such a memorable meal for me, that i really have to pass along my two cents worth.\n\ni went with two girlfriends for lunch to this glorious spot when we were out in vegas for continuing education. (have to give a shout out to my husband for the recommendation!) we waited a very short time for a table considering it was the busy lunch hour. when we were seated, our server came over promptly and began talking with us. i discussed chef keller with him and how excited i was to be eating there, to which he stated \"would you like a picture with him? he is sitting right behind you.\"\n\ni said something to the effect of \"shut the f**k up!!!!\" (not my proudest moment, but it shows you how excited i was that the word vomit just came pouring out). he smiled politely and said he would send him over in a little bit.\n\nwe began ordering, which was quite difficult since everything on the menu looked amazing!! i ordered the cuban panini (might i add, so did chef keller...but i'm not a stalker or anything). this sandwich was perfect. the horseradish mustard gave it just the right kick, and i could feel it all through my sinuses. i also got the homemade gnocchi with pesto. thank god for homemade gnocchi! these little balls of deliciousness were just the right texture and consistency. \n\nmy friends ordered the <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark>, the italian style meatballs with pasta fagioli soup underneath them. they also had the sliders and the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>. all of these items were delicious and perfectly seasoned. the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were the standout item of what my friends ordered...they used very thin slices of <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>, which gave just the right amount of flavor and texture against the crunchy taco shell. we also all shared the macaroni and cheese with lobster. i'm not a huge seafood fan, especially when it is mixed in to one of my favorite comfort foods, but the server recommended it and he was spot on. the only reason we didn't finish it is because we were too full from all our other items, plus...there was the matter of ordering dessert.\n\nfor those of you who know me, i am not a huge fan of dessert to begin with, but everything was so good i just had to have one more course. i ordered (are you ready for this???) my absolute hands down favorite dessert of all time! it was the coconut soup with passionfruit sorbet. sounds weird, i know, but it was unbelievable! they had topped the runny coconut soup/tapioca mixture with cold passionfruit sorbet and crunchy dehydrated fruit. i can't say enough about it. i could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. my friends had the panna cotta, which was good, and fairly standard. we also got a couple cheesecake lollies sent over from the table next to us (apparently, their family of 8 had eaten too much too). wonderful and a very playful take on classic cheesecake.\n\nfinally, chef keller came over to talk with us. we snapped a few photos, told him how delighted we were over meeting him and how much we enjoyed his meal, and then were off to enjoy more of our ce. thank you chef keller!!!", 
            "i wish i could be more enthusiastic about this eponymous restaurant from hubert keller. the staff could not have been more friendly, but they failed to manage their ambiance well, and the food lacked consistency.\n\nthe biggest problem with the restaurant, in my opinion, is that the main dining room is totally open to the casino, which allows the loud cacophony of casino sounds into the ambiance of the dining experience. the clang and whir of slot machines, different rock and roll songs from multiple other open venues, and the continuous mumble and rumble of the migrating hordes intrude on your dining experience continuously. do not expect to \"get away from it all\" at this restaurant. you'll be smack dab in the middle of the action while you try to concentrate on your <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>. music played in the dining room just added to the ruckus and made me wish i had brought earplugs. overall a very jarring experience.\n\nthe food was creative but uneven. of the five \"tapas\" i ordered, only two really satisfied: <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> and lobster macaroni and cheese. the tiny <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> burst with bright flavors that popped in your mouth. my only criticism: teasingly small. the macaroni showed nice restraint -- too many lobster or truffle dishes nowadays coat the mouth with richness. this one comes off as balanced, with a gentle, soothing effect that lingers. happy food.\n\nthe rest of the dishes were less than stellar. the oyster presentation was a bit ridiculous, served atop a martini glass filled with blue steaming liquid. the earthy brine of the oysters did not marry well with the melon balls that were served atop them. creative but not great. they also comped me a deep fried chicken nugget on mayonnaise and nuts. not my thing?\n\nthe wine list showed ambition, but lacked commitment. it covers lots of ground, but most of the producers it features are garden variety.\n\non the other hand the staff was lovely and attentive. dishes were whisked on and off of the table with impressive efficiency. every request was greeted with cheerful enthusiasm, which helped make my overall experience a mildly positive one. \n\ni cannot honestly say i had a great first experience at fleur, but considering the creativity and friendly attitude, i will definitely try it again.", 
            "we ordred 6 dishes and only 2 were worth eating.  the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> and pan con tomato were very, very good.  the onion soup and braised ribs were just ok.  the mac&cheese was fair but we would not want to eat again.  the risotto was very poor - cold, overcooked, and under seasoned; didn't even want to eat it.  the popcorn was also yucky - cold and drenched in oily, salty belch.  were ordered 3 speciality drinks and they were all just ok (nothing as good as segundo sol's drinks!).  the peach blossom was the best of the 3 and it bordered on good.  overall, we were expecting much, much more from hubert keller and manadaly bay.  the server didn't even seem that excited about the food items on the menu (oh, you really want to try that?  the ribs are \"good\").  the atmosphere was nothing special.  glad that others enjoyed this place, but we've had much better meals at much lower price points on and off the strip.", 
            "smaller portions than you would expect but the food is pretty rich and flavorful.  i think of this spot as more of a snack before your real dinner.  i did enjoy the manchego salad and the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> (beware, they are bite size).  if you're concerned about your budget on an empty stomach, i would skip.",

            "i have very fond memories of this restaurant from my summer road trip to vegas. i wanted to eat somewhere nice and i was searching up yummy looking places on my phone, and fleur is where i decided to go with. \n\npartly it was because it was close, but the food really did impress. reservations were made and i didn't even have to go out into the 110 degree weather to get there.\n\nwe were so happy with our meals that we decided to eat here again. yum!\n\ni ordered almost the same thing the second time around. i was delighted with the steak tartare, the prince edward island mussels with basil cream sauce, and their <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>. o-m-g those <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> are delicious. i wish they were full sized tacos, i would totally have made a meal out of them every day. \n\nthe braised short ribs were delicious. we came back and had it again, and tried the skirt steak with chimichurri sauce as well. \n\nthe service on the first day was better than the second day we came, but on our second visit, we got free dessert. i guess it all evens out. \n\ni'm kind of sad that the service was not spot-on for our second visit. the server was arguing with what they had on their menu, even though we had ordered it 2 days prior and was still on the menu. \n\ni was also sad to see that they had a coupon on restaurant.com so i could have saved money on my meal. i was very surprised to see how many great restaurants had coupons on restaurant.com for a great deal. seriously, wtf. next time i will utilize this to my advantage.", 
            "huber keller sighting!!!! i almost fell out of my chair when i saw him in person since i am such a huge fan of top chef!  mr. keller was very gracious and he really is as nice as he is protrayed on television. \n\nand the food was delicious! we had a few stand outs including the spicty <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, chacuterrie plate, and the ribs!  i could have done without the onion soup because it was too rich and onion-y.  we also had a restaurant.com so our meals was only half!  the food was tastier and more innovative than joel robuchon that we had the night before, although their decor and service was more in line with tgi fridays than a fancy restaurant.  we did not get new silverware after each course unlike robuchon whose services was second to none.  \n\ni think with a few tweaks, this place would be worthy of a michelin star.",

            "it was on a trip back to vegas after having lived there for three years that a friend and i finally had the opportunity to try fleur before seeing one of the last performances of the lion king at mandalay bay. i am a huge fan of hubert keller from his appearances on top chef and was excited to try his food! \n\ni purchased a $50 gift certificate from restaurant.com that only cost me $3! the only stipulation was that we spent at least $100 (not including alcohol) and you must tip on the original bill. this worked out great because we wanted to try a little bit of everything! \n\ni started off with a trio of martinis for about $18. they had a very reasonable happy hour including $3 domestic beers,but i wanted to get something i wouldn't normally order. my favorite martini out of the three was the flirtini.\n\nthe plates here are small, but there was definitely a lot of flavor. we ordered the croque monseuir which is pretty much a grilled ham and cheese sandwich. simple but delicious! the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were one of my favorites but didn't impress my fellow diner as much. the braised hamachi with soy ginger foam was a little overdone and salty. not to mention that when one of the servers dropped it off he failed to tell me that the plate was extremely hot. ouch. \n\nthe chicken croquettes were super yummy. only problem was there just wasn't enough on the plate. despite all the small plates we ordered we still had room to order a couple of large plates as well. the braised short ribs were delicious, flavorful and tender. they were slightly sweet but well balanced. the peking duck breast was a little less impressive, the duck was cooked well but i'm not sure it was a $30 dish. probably could have just ordered a few more small plates for less and have been just as satisfied.\n\nfor dessert we ordered the <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> trio. the vanilla was by far the best, followed by pistachio and then raspberry, which was a little too sweet. we ordered coffee (which is pressed at the table) and our server went back and made us fresh whipped cream to go on top. delish! \n\nservice was attentive and friendly. we ate earlier in the evening so there weren't many guests there which is why i think we were so well attended to. atmosphere is great but it is a little dark inside, which can be a good thing i guess. \n\nnot sure if i would put this restaurant on the top of my to do list on my next trip to vegas with all the great food that the city has to offer but it was definitely one of my better experiences at a celebrity chef restaurant.", 
            "i was super excited to finally get a chance to eat at one of hubert keller's restaurants...however, i was super disappointed.  i'm sure he is an amazing chef no doubt. maybe the time we went was just an off day, not sure.  everything we ordered wasn't tasty at all. \n\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>: very simple and not much to it. it was basically tuna topped with a dallop of gaucamole and sour cream.  i mean really...?\n\nlobster mac and cheese:  bland and barely any lobster taste. \n\nsliders: dry...\n\nchimichurri steak: only tasted oil from the chimichurri sauce, no garlic or herb taste. meat was cold upon arrival.  \n\nfoie gras: this was the only decent item we ordered.  cute plating.\n\nthe other good thing was the $3 selected beer, maybe a happy hour deal? \n\nserver took awhile to get to our table upon being seated.  also, he forgot to split the drinks and food on seperate checks..\n\nanyway, the reviews for this restaurant are really great.. which is why i'm so confused why this happened to us!  i so want to like te food!! i still would like to try fleur de lys.. one more shot!",

            "the only reason i'm yelping is to defend the mac and cheese.  i noticed a lot of reviewers hated on the mac and cheese for not being cheesy enough.  however, if you are, like me, a fan of kraft mac and cheese, you will like it.  i personally do not like restaurant mac and cheese that's always way too oily with the 25 different cheeses melted in the noodles with a super heavy bread crumb topping.  i honestly prefer the neon orange crap that costs $1 to make (70 cents on sale).  keller's mac and cheese has that sort of smooth and silky cheese sauce, and feels very light, except with lobster chunks thrown in.  loved it.\n\nthe rest of the meal was hit or miss - some really amazing things like the fried chickpeas and the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> and the manchego salad.  everything else was very decent, but not the best i'd ever had - like the steak tartare, the skirt steak and the moules.\n\noverall a solid meal, and better than average.", 
            "i don't take the time to write many reviews, and i've eaten at some really great restaurants since this but my mind keeps making me want to go back to fleur.  we went in december of 2011 and it was extremely memorable.  it was my typically traditional mom's first time eating tapas and she loved it as well.\n\nshe was surprised to see how small the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were when they came out but we ordered plenty of dishes to keep us full.  the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, basil mussels, steak with chimi churi sauce, and lobster mac and cheese were all amazing.  i didn't try anything i didn't like.\n\nthere were 4 of us and we all ordered 3-4 tapas a peice.  it was a great way for us to all catch up with each other after we hadn't seen each other for awhile while enjoying dinner. they timed the food perfectly so we never had too much on the table or were waiting for food. \n\nwe used the restaurant.com gift certificate which was a great deal so we were all able to get a few cocktails and dessert as well as the tapas for $43 a person. amazing deal. \n\nsave room for desert the creme brule came in original, rasberry, and pistachio, best <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> i've ever had. \n\nall in all best tapas and best place i've eaten at in a long long time!", 
            "braided short rib, peking duck breast, warm almond cakes, <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, fig flambe, pork schnitzel, marinated olives, and ceci frito were all very tasty.  although the portions are small, they allow you to get a lot more variety.  really enjoyed the experience here as the service was on the spot.  can't wait to come back again.", 
            "this place was ridiculous. not only were the \"<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>\" literally one bite each (3 served on the entire plate) but it took 20 minutes and numerous mentions to our server that we needed our check. i was highly disappointed, i expected more from hubert keller :(", 
            "we just happened to be in mandalay bay looking for a place to have lunch on the last day of restaurant week.  we were looking at the various menus an decided that fluer had the best value. we ended up ordering only one special and then we picked from the menu. the special included a small salad (ok) short rib lasagne (great taste, but small) and a chocolate mousse desert (pretty good.  we also ordered the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>  which came with 3 tiny tacos (yummy) the lobster mac and cheese ( light and yummy, but did not taste at all cheesy) and some goat cheese toast (yummy and light). we also ordered a cuban sandwich (good) and the fries that came with it (phenomenal). for 3 of us we end up spending about 85$ pre tip and we were all satisfied, not at all full, but satisfied.  everything was well prepared and carefully crafted, our server was good an brought every thing out appropriately (not all at the same time or too long in between).  i would recommend this place if you were going on a date or want to do things a little fancy...however, if you want to pig out this is not the place!", 
            "i was very saddened when i walked though the back of mandalay bay a while back, only to see the front of fleur de lys boarded up, fearing that i had missed my chance to experience one of the best restaurants in town. but never to fear, fleur de lys has been reborn simply as 'fleur', and whatever they were doing behind those closed doors paid off in spades, because my experience at fleur was one of the best i've had in vegas. as a local who has a fairly impressive vegas fine dining resume, i can assure you that when i say this is securely seated in my top 3 all time, it really means that fleur is something exceptional.\n\nas with any small plate restaurant, sharing is key and part of what makes this dining experience what it is. our group of 5 split about a dozen small plates, plus 2 large plates and 4 desserts; ended up costing a little over $400 (incl. alcohol) before tip. this place can get expensive very quickly; however, it can be done on a budget if you have some self control.  since i originally ate at fleur, i have been back twice with significantly final bills (and once for lunch) and i can say that the quality of food has remained as high as it was the first time i visited back in 2011. \n\nthe standout at fleur has to be the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, which go down as one of the single greatest pieces of food i've ever tasted. there is really no way to accurately convey how incredible these tacos are, you simply have to taste them for yourself. the desserts are also outstanding, highlighted by the pineapple carpaccio and it's sublime combination of lime sorbet and frozen cilantro puree.  there are or course some misses, noticeably the peking duck, but nothing here is bad, and the less than stellar are made up for by the truly great dishes. \n\nthe service is always outstanding. our waiter was rather quiet, but focused and efficient - he left us alone to enjoy our meal, but was always there when we needed to order another round of plates.  the second time i visited i mentioned that we had been there recently and how much we loved the food, and we were given a dessert on the house (this is the first and only time this has ever happened to me in vegas). the food comes out rather quickly, but they are typically staggered to keep from overloading the table (a problem i've noticed at other tapas or small plate restaurants). everything was hot and fresh, and perfectly prepared and plated. the garnished and sides were all completely functional, and added an incredible depth to just about every dish. i feel like i could drone on for pages about how great this place is, but i will stop myself and simply say that this place is one of the top restaurants in vegas, and should not be missed by anyone who is a fan of great food (and keep a sharp eye while you are dining, because unlike most celebrity chefs, chef keller is commonly part of the staff at the vegas location).", 
            "great food!  we had a party of 8 and ordered \"the feast\" which is literally one of everything on the menu (minus a few more expensive items).  it says it feeds 6+ so i figured whatever we really liked we could order more of.  the food was way more than enough for 8 people.  we ended up bringing a bunch of it home.  also, it doesn't say anywhere, but the feast actually included dessert too!  and by dessert i mean every dessert on the menu!\n\nsome people in our group had the absinthe snuff/drink and i had the cocktail sampler which was also very good.  all in all, everyone in our party ate and drank to way excess, we had tons of left overs, and it was all for less than $100/person.  i was amazed at the quality and quantity of food.\n\ni will definitely return!\n\nhighlights include:\n\nsteak tartar\nparmesan paprika popcorn\nonion soup shooter\nburrata\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>\noysters\nceviche\nlobster mac n' cheese", 
            "this is not a romantic french restaurant.  perhaps i didn't do my homework. i obviously didn't do my homework.  and this is a great restaurant but it's not what i was expecting and i was disappointed. i really thought it was going to be french and a bit more elegant.\n\nlet me further preface my review by stating i am a sucker for a celebrity chef.  especially a slightly lesser known celebrity chef than the emerils, pucks and flays of the world.  but i really thought this was going to be a slightly more casual version of the romantic french original in san francisco that i've read about.  my husband and  i were in town for a weekend getaway and were looking forward to a quiet respite away from all the noise of vegas.  since we were staying on the opposite side of the strip, this was a special trip.  this restaurant is located just off the casino floor in mandalay bay.\n\nit was not quiet.  as soon as i saw it, i knew it was not what i wanted but we were there so we stayed.  i asked the hostess to seat us away from the front bar and noise but we were seated just inside the restaurant even though other seats were available.  shame on me for not insisting on the back of the restaurant.  the decor is very contemporary, urban and loft like with a two story ceiling.  the noise level is high from the bar and the club across the hallway in addition to the lounge music playing in the restaurant itself.\n\nthe food is contemporary american small plates.  we had ceviche, wings, sliders, <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> and a few other things.  i really didn't see anything french on the menu.  dare i say it, it's basically elevated bar food.  it's good and for $140 with three cocktails including two signature drinks, it was less than we were expecting to pay.  but this wasn't the dining experience we were hoping for.  the cocktails are very good and probably the highlight of the meal.  no, the souffle was the highlight.  very yummy.\n\ni just can't recomend getting in a cab to travel to the other side of the strip for sliders and buffalo wings.", 
            "it could just have been lunch, but i was really disappointed.  i had been here for dinner 4 times and every time i had dinner there, it was stellar.  this time around we went for lunch and it really was borderline.  not very good at all.  \n\nall of the hot food came out cold.  the service was okay, but nothing to write home about.  the flatbread was soggy and they call it a flambe\\u00e9, but it's a flatbread.  \nthe <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> was meh...  the shell was cold.  we serve our shells hot, which tastes so much better.  the  manchego salad with shrimp was the best item we had, but the salad was $20 and was no more than a 9\" plate.  not worth the price.  i am not an elcheapo for good food.  i will pay any amount, if the food is good, but this salad was not worth $20.  \n\nthe honey coriander sauce on the braised short rib was way too sweet and we had a salmon dish with cucumbers and dill sauce.  it was good, but cold.  \n\noverall - don't go for lunch.  there was only 3 tables in there at 11:30a-1p.  no wonder..... i should have taken that hint.  don't go if the crowd at mandalay is not going there.  bordergrill was packed for lunch.  i wish we had went there.  \n\ni may give dinner another try, as it was real good, but will certainly stay away from lunch.", 
            "i recently stopped in for a quick late lunch at the bar, and to be honest, there is not much to update here, because this place is still fantastic.  the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> are still my favorite single thing to eat in vegas, and the cherry-limade cocktail i had was amazing.  and even though they weren't directly listed on the lunch menu, i finally had a side of the garlic herb fries, which were also top notch.  \n\nfleur has quickly become one of my favorite (albeit, pricey) lunch spots if i'm on the south end of the strip.", 
            "great service, very good food, fairly expensive for what you get. i liked the margarita sorbet oysters but only four per order. the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> had amazing flavor but were also very small. the lobster mac and cheese was not earth-shattering but tasty enough with good size lobster chunks. the steak tartar was larger than i expected and had great flavor, a little more of the pickle flavor than some, but i like and expect that. the best dish by far was the souffle. it was a little smaller than i am used to from other restaurants and a the egg/custard flavor was a little more pronounced than some i have had but it was really, really good. i will have to make a point to return just for the souffle if nothing else.", 
            "came here for a nice lunch before leaving las vegas.  i would recommend the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, which were perfect little bites to whet one's appetite, the flatbread with brie, bacon, and morels (i think...it's not on the online menu, but was available when we were there), and the <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark> which was bursting with truffle-y flavor!  unfortunately, the <mark><mark>Grilled Chicken</mark></mark> sandwich was a little on the dry side.  \n\nfun fact: they serve absinthe here...yes, real european absinthe with wormwood content!  would have loved to have tried it, though probably not a good idea prior taking a flight back home, lol.\n\nthe atmosphere is fun and boisterous as it's \"outdoor\" seating, meaning that it's open to the walkway within the hotel area and service was very friendly and accommodating.", 
            "this place was great.  the service was wonderful. \nwe had the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> and the tuna was so unbelievably fresh. \nwe also had the goat cheese pesto flatbread which was awesome. \nloved it!", 
            "one of the best dining experiences i have ever had. the server was very helpful and willing to suggest her favorites. this place is definitely not high on value and probably turning an enormous profit on some dishes (<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> come to mind, 3 two-square inch tacos for $12), but some of it is really worth it and not enough to make me knock it down from five stars. \n\none thing that would have made me knock it from five stars is the fact that my reservation was not in the computer. luckily there were literally two other tables in the whole place, but had i spent 10 minutes on the mandalay bay reservations line and not gotten a table, i would have been furious and not enjoyed my meal so much, if i would have bothered to stay. a caveat to keep your confirmation number when making a reservation. \n\nwe ordered 9 small plates and a dessert, all for two. i had a restaurant.com coupon and wasn't sure if i would ever be back, so we decided to go all out. the server suggested that we get around 3 per person, but considering how small a few of the small plates were, 9 would have been necessary.\n\nstarting off with the not so great, for myriad reasons:\n-manchego salad - a teeny little dusting of manchego on top of a salad. i was expecting, you know, a lot of manchego considering it is the namesake of the salad. it was good, but somewhat misleading.\n-\"in the shower\" mac and cheese - gourmet mac and cheese with lobster meat in it. i'm sure it's all fantastic quality ingredients, but $18 for a small plate seemed steep.\n-<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> as mentioned\n\nand on to the good:\n-duck confit - little baby spring rolls with duck meat. delicious.\n-fried chickpeas - the best value on the menu at $3\n-flatiron steak with chimichurri - deliciously prepared, though we had a lot of extra chimichurri\n-lemon basil risotto - excellent, though slightly overpriced for the amount\n-brie flambee - nice little flatbread with honey and bacon. the combination of the ingredients made it sort of breakfasty, but still delicious.\n\nand finally, one of the best things i ever ate: the steak tartare. it was fantastic. i had only had tartare one other time, and after you get used to the whole, erm, concept, it was truly wonderful. the flavors melded really well together and the dish made our night. for dessert i had a pistachio meringue with chai ice cream. the meringue was extremely sweet but the ice cream was the right sweetness for such a meal.\n\nhappy hour for $5 wells and $6 glasses of wine. but be careful, after the happy hour they jump to $12 and $14 respectively. \n\none thing we noticed, though, is that it would be very hard to come here with 3-5 people. with 6 or more you could just do the \"eat the menu\" option, but with 2 we each got to have a couple bites of each thing. with more than two, you would be picking and choosing who got to have more bites, particularly for things like the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> and the duck confit. \n\npicking up a restaurant.com certificate will definitely help you on price, too. all in all i will be back but with an edited menu and less of a go-all-out attitude so that i can really enjoy just a few things without putting such a large dent in the old pocketbook.\n\none thing that should be changed both here on yelp and on the mandalay bay website: this place is not dressy. it is in a restaurant row with \"patio\" seating with people wearing jeans and with shopping bags. it's definitely not a place to come in your bathing suit cover up, but it's not \"dressy\" as advertised by both these outlets. i stressed out over what to wear for nothing!", 
            "i'm borderline between 3 & 4 stars.  \n\ni would hate to ever get stuck sitting on the patio where everyone wandering through mandalay bay can gawk at you eating. luckily i've always been seating inside. i've never had an issue with service and have enjoyed pretty much everything i have eaten. \n\nthumbs up to: \nonion soup shooter\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>\noysters w/  sorbet. (fun presentation on dry ice)\nin the shower mac & cheese\n\nafter dining here 4 or so times, last night we tried something new. the summer prix fixe menu. this is by far the best section of plates i have ever had @ fleur. \ntomato/avocado gazpacho, braised short rib lasagna, black cod, nutella french toast!\n\nfor the fun of it, you should get any one of the <mark>Specialty Cocktails</mark> with the liquid nitrogen. the bailys ice cream espresso, but try the espresso martini for the extra buzz!", 
            "this review is from a previous visit to las vegas, so it's a little outdated, but i stand by it... this place rocks!  it is seriously a party in your mouth.\n\nwe had planned to eat at fleur de lys, not realizing it had closed and that hubert keller had created a new restaurant in it's place. when we tried to make a reservation, we realized the situation and decided to eat there anyway. we ate at fleur on 03/02/11 with a group of nine and ordered the menu, which at that time was $415. it was awesome. we were served 37 small plates (including the seven desserts) - they told us that it feeds 6-8, but we all nine left full. it does not include the large plates or indulge menu items, however the 37 dishes were all amazing and i was okay in missing out on those pricier dishes. \n\nof course we had some drinks as well. the plates are small, so not everyone got to taste every item, but it worked out great, there were some things that someone might not want, so the people who did slurped it up. eight people would probably be a little better for divvying up the portions, but wow! \n\nit came to $57 per person, which we thought was very reasonable for this amazing meal.  i think if we had each just ordered our own dishes it would have been a completely different experience.  it also created a great atmosphere, we were all excited to see what was going to come out next as servers just sort of kept bringing more dishes! i highly recommend this experience if you have a party of this size.\n\nour service was very good. the waitress assigned to us was very attentive and kept the food coming. there was one time of about 8-10 minutes when the food stopped and we were uncertain if we were done or not, but then came more. we had a separate \"room\" that was curtained off from the restaurant, which was nice and probably a good thing as we were a little rowdy that night.\n\nthe highlights for me were the mac & cheese, mushrooms, mashed potatos, cheese platter, steak tartare (which i hadn't had before), <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, and these amazing toasted garbanzo beans. the onion soup shooters were to die for and i was loving the sangria, although the drinks were pricey. i even tried a raw quail egg! it was fun and delicious and if you can swing it, you must order the menu. i'm sure i had a better time and liked the meal more than if fleur de lys had still been there.",

            "ive eaten here twice & was more than satisfied both times! service is great, food is amazing, & the setting is beautiful! the oysters are delicious, <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> are a must, & the pork is so tender it melts in your mouth!\n\nthe dishes they have are so creative & different that you cannot get fine dining anywhere like it! everything is cooked to perfection & not only are the special dishes amazing but even sliders & fries are the best on the strip!\n\nfluer is a great place for a dinner date, family get together, or even if you just want a great meal!\n\ni would definitely recommend this place to anyone that loves great quality food! 5 stars!", 
            "ehh i'm kinda disappointed.\n\ni came to the mandalay bay which to be honest, i rarely come because i actually had tickets to the mj one show. after yelping some places to eat around mandalay bay, i was super excited to find out that there were two joints opened by hubert keller!!\n\ni'm a huge fan of hubert keller especially after his debut on top chef masters. i was really rooting for him the first season to win! i also have always wanted to eat at his restaurant in sf at fleur des lys so when i found out he had fleur in mandalay bay, i quickly made a rsvp before the show.\n\nthe restaurant was quite empty when we arrived, given that my rsvp was at 5:30 bc we had the 7:00 tickets to the mj show, and we got sat down inside very quickly. it was super dark inside that we had to request moving to different tables bc it was too dark for some people to read the menu. our waiter was nice, attentive, good at recommendations and any questions we had.\n\nhalf ordered the mj prix fixe menu while half ordered a bunch of little dishes to share. some things ordered was the shrimp ceviche, <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, beef sliders, skirt steak, <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark>, corn soup, and fleur burger. \n\neverything tasted pretty mediocre. i was slightly disappointed especially since i had high expectations of this place and also that i had told my party that dinner would be good. majority of my party was not satisfied with their meal and was highly disappointed as well. the sliders were okay. good meat patties but kinda dry and needed some sort of sauce to it to counteract the dryness. the shrimp ceviche should really not be called ceviche. normally, a ceviche is cooked in the juices of some sort of citrus juice like lemon or lime but this \"ceviche\" was basically drowned in a cold cucumber soup. the cucumber dressing was really bland and had no flavor to it and the accompaniments was really minimal. couldn't find a single tomato or avocado in that small dish. the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were good. good slab of tuna but could have used more sauce in the tiny tiny taco. salad was mediocre and corn was okay. nothing too spectacular just ok. we ended the night with some brownie pops which again, kinda misleading. i was expecting kind of like a brownie cake pop but it's more like a chocolate truffle on a stick with some caramel. it was way too sweet even for a sweet tooth lover like me.\n\noverall, my dinner was fine. but for a highly rated restaurant, i was expecting more especially one that's owned by hubert keller. i think i made the mistake of eating at fleur instead of going to burger bar. maybe next time i'll go back to mandalay bay and have better luck at his burger joint instead.", 
            "happy hour review only\n\nhappy hour at fleur includes some discounted wine, beer, spirits, and small plates. nothing too exciting. the happy hour merlot is perfectly drinkable. we ordered the bbq flat bread and <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> - neither of which stood out. i was disappointed with the flat bread's dough: an odd texture, tasteless, and and greasy. the tacos were fine, but a little plain and unimaginative. the decor of fleur is modern and bland. the two bartenders were attentive and pleasant.", 
            "nice ambiance, had them make a special salmon salad for me and ancho tuna appetizer,  was delicious! comes with chips. the three <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> was cute because it was so mini. the ancho tuna had tomato, avocado, and fresh tuna. the tuna is similar to the stack poke at yardhouse and both delicious!!", 
            "the service at fleur was quite good.  my husband and i arrived on a friday night just before 7pm.  we did not have reservations and we were seated immediately.  the restaurant has a nice relaxed vibe and the servers were very attentive.  we were presented with a tablet so that we could browse through the list of cocktails and wines, which is something i very much liked as you have the opportunity to search for wines you might like by selecting the flavor profiles you enjoy.\n\nin terms of the food, i would say we were 50% impressed and 50% underwhelmed.  we ordered the following:\n\n*  <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>\n*  fried mac and cheese w/ truffle oil peas and ham\n*  braised short ribs\n*  fleur burger - wagyu beef on a brioche bun\n*  chocolate mousse\n\nthe <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were maybe about two and a half inches (3 total) and served on a crunchy shell.  the problem i found with this was that the shells were not crunchy enough.  i'm guessing that they had gotten a bit soggy when the cold tuna was placed in the shell.  as my husband would say, they were \"meh.\"\n\nthe fried mac and cheese (3 total) were about three and a half inches in length and were quite good.  (i love cajun food, so i would have liked a bit more spice, but i think most people would thoroughly enjoy this item as it is.)\n\nbraised short ribs - the absolute best part of the meal.  the short ribs were extremely tender and were served with mashed fingerling potatoes.  \n\nmy husband ordered the fleur burger and he was really excited for it, but he ended up describing it as \"meh.\"  he said that it was cooked very well and it was very juicy, but he said it lacked any real flavor.  - it was served with a side of alfalfa sprouts, ketchup, and some sort of other dark sauce.  i took a bit and thought that it was indeed juicy, but it was kind of boring.  \n\nfor dessert, we ordered the chocolate souffle, which was served with a side of cherry sauce/glaze that was poured over/into the souffle as well as a side of pistachio ice cream.  - i was completely overwhelmed with the dessert.  the souffle lacked any real flavor and was somewhat of a sad follow up to the amazing short rib entree that i had just consumed.  \n\nthe overall experience was pleasant and if we go back, we know that there are certain items we won't enjoy.  - the service is really what made the experience for us.", 
            "<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> to start: shells were a bit \"chewy\". flavor was great.\n<mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark> was very tasty. grace says the white anchovies they used are very delicate (and yummy- perfect amount of \"briny-ness\").\nskirt steak- had to take a picture. incredible flavor and it's tender. now how do they accomplish both? nice job!\ngrace and i both ordered skirt steak (hers medium, mine medium rare). both came out perfectly cooked but mine was half as thick as hers - i kinda got ripped off.  this is my only minus for the night and only reason for 4 stars. \ndesert: tiramisu with blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries.  awesome - custard was light and creamy, top was perfectly browned! if creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e by itself, the cream is a killer!", 
            "this might be one of the best meals i have ever eaten. superb service combined with a divine menu of lovely little tidbits - everything from <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> to a tongue stew, and everything in between. check out their menu beforehand so you can figure out what you'd like to share. ambience is so attractive and a good bar menu as well. besides, the mandalay bay resort is so beautiful, you'll want to come in just for a look-see.", 
            "with all the good reviews of this place, i found it quite below average... sorry, you get a fail.  first i got the wrong salad (arugula) but it was decent (wanted the <mark>Field Green</mark>). i ordered a local craft beer (red hydrant), but it was $14 and really more of an irish red and it tasted very euro (so it was poorly labeled).  i got the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, that were tiny, yet very good, even though the corn taco shell dominated the overall flavor.\ni ordered the braised short ribs, that was really just a giant rib (as in only one big one). it was not that good, and it's really hard to screw up short ribs. it also had this weird foam on top of it that looked like a fuzzy mold. the parsnip puree had a very weird texture. that was poor, d+ but i ate the whole thing...\nthe wild mushrooms were terrible. they had no flavor, nor even tasted like anything was added to them, other than the earthy natural flavor... the polenta wasn't bad, but boring!   \nwe passed on three other restaurants for this place?  dang!", 
            "mmmmm big fan of fleur!\ni have to admit, i usually go back for the same thing. the little <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> are a great little snack to have midday with a glass of wine! i love hitting up fleur during their happy hours. they have a pretty good wine list that is provided on an ipad and you can choose between the bar, or some comfy seats and tables.\ndefinitely good for people watching as it is located in a pretty good central spot.", 
            "great place for tapas! i did the mini tasting for 2 people and it was plenty of food! well worth the money! do not be fooled by the small first course. each course gets bigger and finally ends with a 5th course dessert! everything was delicious and flavorful. the beef carpaccio and <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were light and refreshing. the truffle soup was to die for! the bone marrow was deeply rich. the shrimp and grits were spicy and perfectly cooked. the grilled octopus was a bit unexpectedly acidic but still light. the steak was succulent pairing well with the french fries. the lobster mac and cheese was worth every calorie and tasted even better the following morning. the brioche beignets was a perfect ending to a great meal!", 
            "saw the reviews and was excited to try this place. we were seeing the mj show and thought it would be a perfect place for dinner before the show. apps were very good, but small and a bit overpriced. the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were our favorite, followed by the octopus. unfortunately, it was more potato vs octopus. another octopus app was brought to our table by accident and i immediately noticed that plate had more octopus than ours, meaning inconsistent portions, bad. my husband got a burger, considering this is supposed to be their specialty.  it was over cooked and really nothing special. overall, disappointed.", 
            "i was pleasantly surprised with our first experience at fleur! our meals at other \"high end\" places in vegas were somewhat disappointing, so it was great to finally have a good meal. mandalay bay is a really gorgeous place and we sat at a high-top just outside the restaurant. the service was great - our hostess and waitress were really attentive and nice. we even caught a glimpse of hubert keller visiting a table nearby!\n\nwe started with a shot of absinthe each. we had never had it before and fleur has a wide selection, complete with table side service. if you've never tried absinthe or had the experience of them \"making\" your drink next to our table, i highly recommend it. i ended up settling on the grilled octopus small plate and my boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese small plate. my octopus was delicious! it was layered with mushrooms and a delicious pepper aioli. the mac and cheese was creamy on the bottom and crispy and breaded on top, and the shrimp inside were cooked perfectly.\n\nfor dessert, we ordered the <mark><mark>Brownie Lollipops</mark></mark> and <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark>. the lollipops were okay but the <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> was great. we would definitely go back and i would try the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> next. the menu, though not large, has a variety of dishes so there's likely something for just about everyone.", 
            "there menu looks interesting but failed to impress. i tried their <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> and they were super plain no flavor. <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark> was good but that's hard to mess up. tried their brownie pops for dessert, they were sweet but 75% frosting and only 25% brownie. we went for lunch so maybe their dinner is better.", 
            "fleur used to be on another level when it was fleur de lys. celebrated events here and was beyond thrilled. it was one of my favorite spots on the strip. \n\nfast forward to the recession, fleur de lys wanted to be a little more approachable in a down economy so the concept changed to fleur. small plates, some big plates and it was still good. i think they had too many choices, was often overwhelmed by the menu, but there were some really good dishes among some misses.  \n\nat some point in the last year, the menu changed again. with less items to choose from, almost half the menu is now asian. which would be ok, but if i wanted any type of asian food in las vegas i wouldn't have to go far. \n\n\"small plates\" here is a misnomer, maybe if i was an nfl linebacker they'd be considered small. they say 2-3 per person, but i think it's safer to do 1-2 and keep a menu if you want more later. out of everything here the only must have is the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>. \n\nmost of what we ordered was heavy, it wasn't bad just ok, but after we split two of the dishes i didn't want anything else except a fresh salad to balance it out. even the beet salad was heavy and oily. there was more cheese than beets, and they were covered in oil. to the restaurant's credit, the waitress said it was the winter menu and they'll lighten it up. but, it's winter in vegas, not chicago, don't really have as much of the comfort food craving to keep warm end of march when people are spending the day at the pool. \n\nnot sure if they're suffering from a loss of identity, but every time we walked by they weren't very busy and between spring break and march madness, everywhere else seemed to be.", 
            "my boyfriend and i decided to get dinner at fleur while in vegas with friends since we have been huge fans of hubert keller ever since watching him work his magic on top chef masters. plus, this restaurant was highly recommended by one of his friends. unfortunately, we found the food to be overrated and overpriced and wouldn't eat here again. here's what we tried:\n\n- <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> -  imagine paying $13 for three taco-shaped tortilla chips with a little chunk of flavorless tuna and a sprinkle of cole slaw in each chip. yes, these were tacos portioned for a pescetarian rabbit. gone in two small bites, or maybe three if you practice some restraint. the lack in flavor and seasoning was disappointing. it basically was just sashimi on some tortilla chips.\n\n- foie gras duo - it was ok. i preferred the seared preparation over the torchon. the red wine ice cream was interesting in a good way. again, tiny portions.\n\n- fleur burger - underseasoned burger that is inferior to in 'n' out or five guys... oh, and resist the urge to add the foie gras and truffles - they don't really make the burger better.", 
            "this place is so nice. if you are looking for a nice quiet, delicious meal, this is the place to go. everything we ate was amazing: <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, arugula salad, beats with buratta, pork belly fried rice, braised short rib, and creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e. everything was fresh and cooked perfectly. our server was so accommodating. she didn't try to talk us into anything or order more than we wanted. definitely worth checking out.", 
            "i'm a fan of hubert from tv. now, this branch of fleur is in the mandalay bay, which is a cross between an enormous cruise ship and an enormous mall. so it's a little different.\n\ni popped to the bar midafternoon to get a drink and a snack. my standard sapphire martini was fine.\n\nthe <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> are a small plate - a tapas basically. just what i needed. the tuna was perfect quality, with a smear of wasabi and a tiny slide of jalape\\u00f1o, in a tiny crispy tortilla with a bit of slaw. 3 pieces, equivalent serving to maybe 1 maki roll.\n\nnot a bad spot to kill half an hour and get off your feet.", 
            "i was trying to decide between this place and aureole, which i had already been to before and is my favorite spot in vegas, but in the end i decided i should try something new. my suggestion would be to make a reservation so you can sit inside otherwise you sit on the patio where people passing by gawk at you while you try to enjoy your meal. we did the small plate mini tour. i loved the service there, our waitress kat, was so helpful and very nice, and your water glass is never empty and never has a chance to get warm, but the atmosphere (really wish i had made that reservation) and some of the food were mediocre at best and for the portions and the price it should all be great. the mini tour consisted of 10 dishes. half of them were definitely as good as i expected, the other half were just so-so. the 5 really good ones were the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> (that tuna was fresh!), the carpaccio (this was my favorite, loaded with so much intense flavor), the scallop (it smelled really fishy so i was initially worried about how it would taste but it was great), the garlic fries, and the beignets that were just cooked and melt in your mouth. the ones i wasn't so crazy about, the white onion soup which shocked me because that's what all the yelp reviewers raved about. it must be about taste preference, i prefer savory and this reminded me of a sweet corn chowder. next on the menu, the bone marrow which just seemed lacking in flavor as did the shrimp and grits, and the skirt steak lyonnaise which was a tough piece of meat, but since i have never had it before, who knows maybe that's the way it is supposed to be. the last dish i had mixed feelings about was the octopus. since this was the first time i had octopus i think i need to have it one more time before i decide if i really like octopus or not. overall this was a very fun experience going through these 10 dishes and deciding what you like. next time i think i'd pick what looks good to me instead of going the mini tour route though. i debated  between the 3 or 4 stars, in the end since the food was 50/50, i went with the 4 stars because if i had ordered my own food it may have even been good enough to earn 5 stars, service goes a long way.", 
            "i'm a devoted viewer of top chef, which means i was already inclined to love hubert keller's fleur.  my verdict?  meh.  it wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular in any way - and for what you get, it's pretty overpriced.\n\nwe got the pork belly fried rice (i know, but we're asian and wanted to see his take on it) - the flavors were good, but it was so salty.  i wanted another bowl of steamed rice to mix in because that's how salty it was.  \n\nthe beef carpaccio - eh.  not bad, but it's raw beef, there's not a lot to say.\n\nthe <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were good - but so small.  so, so small.  \n\nwe got one of the flatbread pizzas - i think this was one of the better things on the menu though honestly, i like the flatbread better at seasons 52.\n\nfoie gras - we got this since we don't get this in cali anymore.  it was fine, but nothing special for the price.  \n\nroasted bone marrow - probably the best appetizer we got.  good stuff - greasy, but delicious.\n\nwe all got the fleur burger.  it was cooked just right, but it was missing something.  don't get me wrong, it was a good burger, but it wasn't a phenomenal burger (i think capital grille has the best burger) and for $35, i was a little underwhelmed.  sorry.\n\noverall, it's a decent dining experience.  the ambiance was nice, the wait staff and service were impeccable, but for the money - especially in vegas - you could do much better.", 
            "what a disappointment that we wasted a meal here. the menu looks very good, but that is where the goodness stops. food was mediocre at best. we had four small (tiny) courses, a disgusting \"signature\" cocktail. the meal was rushed and we were done in an hour. the food wasn't bad enough to send back, but it was flavorless and unfulfilling. <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were bite sized and had no seasoning or flavor. $200 later for the two of us, we were questioning why we wasted a night here when there are so many good options in vegas.", 
            "a great restaurant and a chance to enjoy hubert keller without booking six months in advance.  \n\nfirst, wanted to compliment the service.  the waitress asked if we had to make a show and i mentioned i had a flight.  rather than a two or three hour experience, they were great at delivering the dishes promptly.  although it would of been great over many hours, i really like the way they were accommodating without me even having to ask.\n\nalthough there are entree on the menu, they also have small plates separated by territory.  my friends and i shared several:\n--   <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>.  i love tuna and the tuna was perfect.  the crispy taco was a very neat touch.\n--  black angus sliders.  maybe the highlight of the dinner.  while everyone has sliders these days, these were fantastic.  larger than i would of expected and the caramelized onions and bacon came together wonderfully with the meat.\n--  <mark>Tarte Flambe</mark>.  probably the most disappointing dish.  no flambee and overall not much flavor over the bread.\n--  seared foie gras.  i love good foie gras and this foie gras was prepared perfectly, the other highlight of the evening.\n--  bbq pork ribs.  a dish that often goes bad at small plates restaurants, done perfectly at fleur.  ribs were tender, flavorful and meaty.\n--  pork belly fried rice.  okay, another highlight of the evening.  surprisingly, it was not the pork belly that made the dish great but the flavor of the rice.  \n--  green papaya carpaccio.  after the tarte, one of the weaker dishes.  just not much flavor, the carpaccio did not come through.\n--  <mark><mark>Brownie Lollipops</mark></mark>. i am not a big sweets person, but these were very popular with our table.\n\nwith julian serrano, two fantastic options for small plates in vegas.  both are fantastic, fleur maybe a little more consistent but some great dishes in both places.", 
            "had the pleasure to dine here last night with friends for my 50th birthday. what a joy and a pleasure! the gm aaron greeted us and sat us promptly and introduced us to our lovely server gaga. she and another wonderful manager esther provided us with laughter and with witty banter & repartee all evening long. \n\nand the food! we selected the \"world tour,\" which provided us with small (i use the term loosely) portions of many of the most popular and excellent items on the menu. outstanding. phenomenal. of particular note was the flamb\\u00e9 tart, <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, white onion soup & coconut soup shooters (wow!), roasted bone marrow spread, grilled octopus, thai chili chicken wings, and diver scallops. amazing. \n\ni have eaten at many excellent restaurants. it is no exaggeration to say this was one of the best meals i have ever had. well done, staff at fleur!", 
            "how about this for my 200th review!?\n\nthrow out what you think of a vegas resort restaurant.\nfleur merges a casual evening environment with a taste of fine dining for a totally worthwhile experience. \n\ni recommend that you read the whole menu, as there are amazing things \"hidden\" in there. it's just not what you expect.\n\ni highly recommend the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, house special fried rice, and sliders.\ngood beer selection, excellent service (the gm and chef  were stopping by tables checking on everyone), and an unmatched level of quality.", 
            "great <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark> with white anchovies.  <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were fresh and delicious. soups are good and fresh, we love coming here, hubert's restaurants are the best...one complaint...veggie burgers are not house-made...looks like boca burgers...please develop something that is to the hubert and my standards next time", 
            "i had the pleasure to try a variety of small plates from here on my last business trip. \n\nthe stand-outs were...\n-<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>\n-roasted bone marrow\n-foie gras\n-grilled octopus\n-fleur burger\n\ni think the foie gras was my favorite dish. perfect balance of richness to tart and sweetness. also, be careful of the mojitos. i thought it was just a sweet drink until i had 3 of those... then, the night became pretty blurry.", 
            "i was taken here by surprise as i love hubert keller.  he did not disappoint.   we did the tasting menu.  the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> and carpaccio were bites of perfection.  the onion soup was so rich and creamy along with the roast peppers and quinoa salad that added a bit of texture.  the shrimp and grits were possibly the best i've had and the grilled octopus was out of this world.  scallops and tiger prawns cooked to absolute perfection and the flank steak melted in your mouth.  the beignets were light and airy, the perfect way to end the meal.  service was excellent.  only thing we would have liked differently was that we were seated out while we would have rather been tucked back in off the walk of the restaurant area in mandalay bay.  overall,  worth a visit if your up for something out of the norm!", 
            "this place was mediocre at best. we ordered a $200 bottle of wine and afterwards they tell us they are out of artichokes & short ribs at 730pm on a saturday night!!!  we have eaten all over the world if this is your flag ship restaurant get a life boat!! <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>!! imagine el paso taco shells with spicy shit spread on it. waste of $$$$!!! i should have chosen one of the other 4 star restaurants in vegas!! \nwine list limited! ugh", 
            "there are a multitude of fabulous restaurants in vegas; however, fleur is not one of them. i was disappointed by every dish we tried. my <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were lacking flavor and the tuna was hard to bite through. my octopus was overcooked and chewy. the foie gras was paired with a red velvet pancake which didn't seem to work. my truffle beef carpaccio had no truffle flavor. even the beigents left something to be desired. on a side note, the service was great but that could not make up for what the food was lacking - especially for the price! will not return, or recommend this restaurant.", 
            "went here with my wife to celebrate our anniversary, and i have to say that it was one of the better food experiences i've had in recent memory.\n\nwe got the global dinner for two. it had some tasty-sounding dishes that my wife couldn't eat because of a shellfish allergy (shrimp and grits!), and they generously subbed those items out for other entrees that were equally delicious.\n\njust about everything we had was cooked to perfection, delicious, and well presented. our favorites were the grilled octopus, white onion soup, and <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>. the only thing we had that wasn't absolutely amazing was the quinoa-stiffed peppers, but that's only because i find the texture of quinoa to be strange no matter how you make it.\n\nto top it off, the staff was extremely welcoming and attentive throughout the night.\n\noverall, it was a great experience, and i would highly recommend this place.", 
            "3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 because i have mad respect for chef hubert keller and what he's doing here.\n\nthe ambiance and decor:\nfirst, it's great that you can always get reservations for fleur, which is not possible for most of the other top restaurants in vegas. i'm not sure if this is public response on the food, location or marketing, but it's something to consider. the location definitely leaves something to be desired; it's in the back of the hotel, and you end up with a view to some slots and walkways due to the open floorplan. the decor itself is very nice; supple leather, slate, glass, and some random \"edgy\" art pieces. there's also a beautiful wine cellar behind glass. the big detractor for me was the outfit the cocktail waitresses wear. i'm normally not one to argue with ladies wearing short hoochie dresses, but it's totally out of place in an otherwise classy restaurant.\n\nfood:\nfor sure, the two stand out dishes are the <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark> and the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>. in fact, i urge everyone to just order four orders of the tacos as their meal. my friend got the fleur burger (despite the exorbitant price) and really liked it, but i've heard from others that it's quite dry. in general, i hear the menu is hit or miss, but you'll have to read other reviews to see if people can advise you towards some dishes.\n\nservice:\nthe service is impeccable. our waitress was very sweet, gave us time to figure out what we wanted and added in recommendations. her wine pairings were also excellent. the service actually made the meal special, which isn't something you'd normally say in vegas.\n\nbottom line, fleur is worth a visit (or a second visit for me)!", 
            "had dinner here with a friend and colleague and loved our experience here. fleur's service was friendly and high end. the food was terrific, we started with the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> and then followed up with the fleur burger for my friend and the potato encrusted haddock for myself. \n\na good place for dinner while in mandalay bay.", 
            "<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, and <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> are ridiculously good.... and the <mark>Red Sangria</mark> is the best i've ever had. service gets 5 stars, as well. both fleur and burger bar are reasons for keller to be proud.", 
            "ate here two or three times while in vegas.\n\ni know we ordered a few different items, but at the moment all i can remember are the sashimi <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>.  we literally could not stop ordering & eating them until we were ridiculously full. \n\neach visit we ordered the same bottle of wine-- montes purple angel carmenere from chile-- it was incredible."

            "this being my third meal at the hubert keller franchise, i harbored a slight concern that the food might lose some of its allure. not only did we enjoy superb food, but the service also exceeded all ex ante expectations. \n\nthe beet and goat cheese amuse was a friendly hello from the kitchen. concentrated droplets of grapefruit and cranberry woke up the palate, and the sweet beet tamed the tartness.\n\nfirst course: ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>, fennel salad, ginger ponzu, sesame seed tuile. starting with the tuna and continuing through the remaining savory courses, fleur de lys' breads became sine qua nons, specifically the rosemary-caramelized onion foccacia and the pretzel roll. the lime and vinegar sauce threatened to overpower the dish, but anise and sesame evened out the flavors, ensuring that the tuna's freshness remained the focal interest.\n\nsecond course: veal and yukon gold potato ravioli, braised carrots, pea foam. it is a given that veal ravioli, kampachi, and duck are delish. the vegetables, alas, tend to get overlooked at one's peril. cut carrots into canoe shapes, coat them in veal stock, and you can get anyone to nosh on them ad infinitum.\n\nthird course: foie gras, raspberry, strawberry, blackberry, cabernet sauvignon reduction, and brioche. ok, so maybe i will have to expiate for my two-day foie gras binge, but it is so bloody delicious. add two butyraceous pieces of brioche and you have a winning - and lipitor-inducing - combination.\n\nfourth course: olive oil poached kampachi, pickled shitakes, tempura scallions, ginger foam. poaching the kampachi lent a velvety texture. the pickled mushrooms and ginger were piquant. tempura-coated scallions furtively blended into the ginger foam, detected only by their mountainous batter and the imbricating parlsey.\n\nfifth course: duck breast, duck confit, chestnut pur\\u00e9e, cipollini onion, duck cracklings, baby bok choy. the bok choy's size relative to the duck is a testament to keller's reverence for vegetables. in general, an ancillary viand should not detract from the main ingredient. in this case, the bitter crucifer confidently towered over the supine, webbed-footed waddler. the cipollini onion topped with cracklings ought to be available to order by the half-dozen.\n\nintermezzo: coconut tapioca soup, kiwi, tempura plantain, strawberry, passion fruit-coconut sorbet. if there is anything i would deem posh boba, this would definitely qualify.\n\nsixth course: cappuccino with bailey's ice cream and a chocolate-banana liquor fondant. i reluctantly passed up the coffee service for fear that caffeine at 8:30 would keep me up too late, yet i could not resist quaffing the iced cappuccino. the warm, lava-like fondant was rich, fit more for a chocolate fiend.\n\nthe petite fours and madeleines were as fresh as i remember. with affable service and delicious food, i would not mind dining at fleur de lys three more times.", 
            "i was very impressed with fleur de lys' ambience, staff, food presentation and taste.\n\nwhen you walk in you'll notice the high rock covered walls and oversized art work of a rose filled petal. the second floor has a glass wall to show the massive wine cellar full of wines from all over the world from different years. for more privacy the restaurant also has rooms draped with curtains. i believe you have to make reservations to dine in these.\n\nthe entire staff is pleasant, friendly, and well educated with their restaurant. they answer every question regarding their menu and wine. one of our waiters, whose name i believe was seth, took good care of our party with his detailed description of the dishes, good humor and dessert recommendations. \n\nour party of 4 ordered the 4-course meal paired with red wine. all the dishes were outstanding in taste, flavor, texture, and presentation. but the ones i would order again would be the ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>, escargots with gnocchi and oyster mushrooms, and halibut tempura with potato salad amuse bouche (compliments of the chef  ).\n\nit's definitely worth spending the money on the quality versus the quantity you get at buffets.", 
            "i can't believe i'm going to say this, because i've eaten so many places, but i think the dinner i had at fleur de lys is the best meal i've ever eaten. i had the four-course elegance prix fixe menu, and each dish is etched in my memory -- the <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> with an amazing blend of herbs and a minty note, the barely-there slivers of veal ravioli floating in jus and foam, the filet mignon that remade the flavors of a basic dish into its own unique thing, and the chocolate souffle.\n\nservice was excellent and attentive. there's a bit of the overindulgent goofiness that strikes me at any fancy restaurant, but to their credit the descriptions of each dish were succinct and useful (not the litany you sometimes get, where a waiter is explaining to you the name of the farmer's cousin who picked the radicchio).\n\nsomething else i noticed is that you can have a sublime meal here for a variety of price points. one of my dinner companions had the three-course lion king prix fixe, at $45 or $55; i had the four-course at $89; and two others had the four-course with wine pairings for about $150. and we each came away bowled over.\n\nagain i feel sheepish saying this, but at least right now i feel ruined for food. anything i ate later on in my weekend in vegas was disappointing. it was almost literally the meal to end all meals.", 
            "**disclaimer: this is probably going to be a 2 part review just like i did for my 400th with ortolan... we need a higher character limit....**\n\nfinally!!  hubert keller is one of my favorite chefs, so ever since i first heard about him a couple years ago, i told myself next time i was in either las vegas or san francisco, i had to go to fleur de lys.\n\nit happened to be restaurant week in las vegas so our group had come here getting that menu in mind.  however that didn't last very long.\n\nour reservation was for 8:30, but a table where they were planning on seating us was taking their sweet ol' time and we were forced to wait.  after about 10-15 minutes of waiting outside, the hostess finally came up to us and offered us to wait in their lounge and enjoy complimentary champagne in their lowly lit lounge to apologize for the longer wait.  free champagne?  yes please!  the hostess was also kind enough to keep us updated on the table, waiting maybe an additional 10 or so minutes.\n\nthe lighting in the dining room was a little better and was thinking i could get away taking pictures without using my external flash on my camera (i hate using flash in a fine dining restaurant as i feel its a little bit of a distraction and nuisance).  our table was slightly tucked away off in the corner, making out meal semi private.  within a new york minute, our server, marcus, was at our side, giving us our menus.  so like i said, we had come having in mind that we were going to get the restaurant week menu for $50.  however, right when we opened the menu, right there staring us down was chef keller's \"elegance menu\", which was 4 courses (instead of 3 on the rw menu) for $89.  yes, a little hard to justify an extra course for $39, but, while some were the same, had more and better choices.  such \"better\" choices included veal and potato ravioli and filet mignon.  the rw menu did not have the ravioli or the filet.\n\ni started with the ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> with shaved fennel salad, a ginger ponzu sauce, and fennel seed tuile.  the tuna was very fresh and the ponzu wasn't too overpowering or salty.\n\nmy next course i ordered the veal and yukon gold potato ravioli with english peas, veal jus, pea shoots, and a sunchoke foam.  the ravioli were pretty good but i do have to say the veal jus was a little salty.  i still very much enjoyed this dish.\n\nfor my entree, i ordered the prime filet mignon, with a potato puree, baby spinach, wild mushrooms, salsify, and a red wine reduction.  medium rare of course.  the meat was cooked perfectly, though slightly underseasoned. the vegetables were perfect and the potato puree was very buttery.  there was an option to add black truffles and foie gras to the filet for an additional $25, and while i didn't partake in that, 2 others did.  the size of the foie was as round as the filet and they put a lot of truffles.  i'm not talking about like maybe 3 or maybe 5 slices of black truffles.  it was a pile of truffles, i'm guessing at least a dozen slices.  that right there, at $75/oz, definitely worth the $25.  and while seeing that much foie and truffles made me sad i didn't get it, they both gave me some of theirs so it was like i had gotten it myself.  oh man... the foie was just... i had to take a moment.  i also said i didn't want to eat or drink anything else after having the foie for fear of washing away the flavor.  it was ethereal.\n\nas much as i wanted to savor the foie gras, our dessert courses came out.  with souffle on the menu, i knew at least 3 or 4 people in our party would order it, so instead of ordering one for myself, i decided i would just steal a couple of bites of theirs and order the other item: a banana chocolate lava cake, served with a shot of peanut butter milkshake and baileys ice cream.  the lava cake was really good and had a pleasantly subtle banana flavor.  the peanut butter milkshake was good.  i honestly didn't really get the baileys ice cream.  personally to me it just seemed to be a little bit of a disconnect.  i mean, if the pastry chef would kindly explain why he chose baileys ice cream, then i'd probably understand.  but until then, your guess is as good as mine.\n\ni'll end here for now because of the 5000 character limit... remainder of review shall come tomorrow....", 
            "only today did i learn that fleur de lys was a hubert keller creation - what can i say, i'm not that big of a snob than was previously thought. \n\nwaiting for the ladies to arrive, me and my buddy sat in the bar, talking to the bartender and the hostess stephanie - both were very cool.  even the maitre'd was cool, remembering my name when we left - whatever, i'm a sucker for that sort of schiesse. \n\nwhen the girls arrived we sat in a big booth and the waiter brought round the bread basket - he would bring it out a total of three times.  the waiter was a bit green - when we ordered our appetizer we were also prepared to order our entrees and he disappeared, not to be seen for a while.  and what we ordered for an appetizer: <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>, and he tried to dissaude us, saying that depending on what we ordered, it might take time to fire it up and it wouldn't come out in time, and we were like, <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> is....raw!  what in the world, my good sir, are you firing up!\n\nthat aside, the tartare was excellent, better than tao's (i thought), though, in all fairness, it was served differently, more naked.  the prix fixe menu looked good, but i couldn't see myself putting away all those courses - not that night.  for the main course i got the roast duck breast, which was excellent, and my buddy the alaskan salmon, along with one of the girls, and the other got the filet mignon, which also looked delicious.  we chose to skip dessert, but they brought out a tray of dainties, anyway, complimentary - though i doubt anything in vegas is really free.\n\naside from the shaky service, the food is impressive, and now that i know it's a hubert keller restaurant, well, i guess subconsciously i knew that it was the whole time - it's that good.", 
            "i should learn to be less trusting.\n\ni've already learned the hard way not to trust them when they say, \"trust me, i'm a lawyer.\" and that's coming from an ex-lawyer, so you can trust me.\n\ni am inclined to believe \"trust me, i'm a doctor,\" and even \"trust me, i'm a michelin starred chef.\"\n\nbut i'm starting to question \"trust me, i'm the executive chef at a celebrity chef's las vegas outpost.\" \n\nyou see, the chef's tasting menu at fleur de lys is not listed. you tell them if you have any allergies or if there's anything you don't eat. besides that, you're in the chef's hands. in this case, executive chef steve wolf.\n\nnow, here's the thing. i'm not really sure if the ever changing chef's menu is really chef hubert keller's menu, chef wolf's menu, or chef wolf channeling chef keller's menu. so i'm not really sure where to lay the blame for a meal that was, well, hit and miss. don't get me wrong, there were some outstanding dishes. but there were also some dishes that missed the mark enough to make me question if they were coming from the same chef.\n\nlet's start with the positives. the restaurant is absolutely beautiful. a towering space with walls of stacked stone, heavy floor to ceiling dark curtains, an imposing second floor wine cellar behind glass, and an \"eye\" of orange roses watching over a dining room of white tablecloths and brown leather banquettes and chairs. it's masculine and luxurious and opulent.\n\nthe service is also top notch, finding that balance between attentiveness and unobtrusiveness.\n\nand the menu had some high points. some very high points. but the lows brought it back down to earth.\n\nwe started with an amuse of dungeness crab and avocado sphere in a watermelon gazpacho. if the amuse was to capture the essence of the meal, i would have been very happy. it was delicious, tart and refreshing. it held out the promise of a great meal.\n\nwe moved on to the 1st course of ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> over a shaved fennel slaw in ginger ponzu, topped with a fennel seed tuile. an ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> seemed like a safe, if uninspired choice, to start the meal. i've had many, as i'm sure you have, and this one was good without being remarkable. the fennel slaw beneath it was a nice touch, giving it some textural difference but the ginger ponzu sauce was overpoweringly sour.\n\nnext up was the truffled onion soup with a braised duck ragout and shaved black truffles. the braised duck ragout was served in a small rolled crepe in the middle of the dish, with the soup poured around it. this dish was the highlight of the meal. the onion soup was sweet and rich, with the taste of the truffles coming on in the end notes. the truffles were more pronounced in the crepe itself.\n\nthird course was veal and yukon gold potato ravioli with a sunchoke foam and english peas. the potato ravioli were very soft and tender and the veal jus lent a concentrated meaty flavor to the dish. another good dish.\n\nthe next course was hamachi with a ginger aromatic foam and tempura scallions. my first and lasting impression was that the ginger foam was salty. this is one of the dishes that really threw me with the heavy handedness of the seasoning.\n\nthe final meat course was the colorado rack of lamb with charred corn cous cous, mango chutney and a carrot curry sauce. the lamb was on the rare side of medium rare, just how i like it, but again the sauce was a salt lick. salty to the point of obliterating the other tastes. the addition of curry introduced an odd flavor profile into the meal. it just seemed incongruous with the rest of the tasting menu. if i didn't know better, i'd have wondered if that plate had come from the same kitchen or even restaurant.\n\nthe intermezzo was a passion fruit and coconut sorbet on a streusel crust in a coconut soup with tapioca balls, strawberry, kiwi and plantain. i loved the coconut soup with tapioca balls. just like an upscale boba and a perfect palate cleanser after the two salt bombs. the sorbet was also very good. this course set the meal back on track.\n\ndessert was sauterne marinated pears on a cinnamon crust and cinnamon ice cream with a walnut sesame crisp. the ice cream was good but the highlight was the cinnamon crust the dessert sat on. delicious. the kitchen also sent out two glasses of complimentary sauterne to pair with the dessert to make up for the lamb dish. a nice gesture and a nice way to end the meal.\n\nfinally, a small tray of lemony madeleines with a chocolate dipping sauce. \n\nand an autographed copy of hubert keller's book \"burger bar\", a rose from the aforementioned \"eye\" and personalized menus of the night's meal. a nice touch even if a couple of the courses on the menu were not what we had received.\n\nso there you have it. a meal, on the one hand, that exercised some restraint in bold flavors and two dishes that exhibited a heavy handedness in their seasoning and discordant flavor profiles.\n\nbut who am i to judge?\n\njust trust me. i'm a food blogger.", 
            "awesome that this should be my first five star review. maybe it's a celebrity chef sorta thing, but i've been wanting to try this place out since top chef masters. yeah... maybe i'm a sucker for these sorta things and hey, hubert keller probably doesn't even cook there... but hey, the food was excellent!\n\ni went here with my girlfriend to celebrate five months together. i had found gift certificates on restaurant.com and i thought, hey, why not?\n\nwe arrived on time to our 9:00pm reservation all dressed up and were seated immediately in a swank dining room with some mood music and between black curtains. upon sitting down, though, we realized we had forgotten our gift certificate. luckily i still had the email on my phone... but would they accept it? i asked our server the next time she came 'round and she wasn't sure, but she would ask her manager. sure enough... it looked like they wouldn't take it. =/ oh well... stuff like this happens.\n\nwe decided to both go for the elegance menu as it would mean 8 different dishes between the two of us for $79/person. the entrees were around $50 a la carte and the apps were around $20... so, why not do the prix fixe? \n\nafter some delicious bread (rosemary foccacia and honey wheat rolls), we got our amuse busche - tempura cod and potato salad with cayanne creme fraiche. it was pretty cute - sorta like a play on <mark>Fish and Chips</mark> =) \n\nand remember when the manager came by and said he wouldn't take our coupon off email? well, he came back and suggested something else - if i could send the confirmation email to him, he would print it out and apply it for us. really? really. awesome! there's another star right there!\n\nthe rest of the night just went up from there. here are the highlights:\n\n1st course:\ntruffled onion  soup with braised duck ragout- my girlfriend definitely won this one. the soup was amazingly creamy and delicious and the duck inside the crepe was just money. *drool*\nahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> - this one was alright. i think i've had better tartares before... the fennel was definitely a little different and was good, but not my favorite flavor, i think.\n\n2nd course:\ncitrus glazed halibut - the halibut was alright, but what really blew me away was the broccoli puree. i haven't had purees much... i usually don't eat at such fancy places... but this stuff blew my mind. it tasted so freakin' good... like pure essence of broccoli. how the heck did they do that?!\nbraised veal and yukon gold potato ravioli - this one came out pretty good, too. the potato inside the ravioli was so flavorful... \n\n3rd course:\nfilet mignon + foie gras and truffles - this was probably the best cooked piece of meat i've ever eaten - perfectly medium rare - it practically melted in my mouth... and the foie gras... the first time i've had that and the stuff just melted over the meat... so freakin' delicious. i'm usually not a fan of liver, but this stuff was just like butter. paired with the filet, it was amazing. totally worth the extra $25. the mashed potatoes (which was more like a puree) was equally delicious.\nstout braised beef short ribs - these were really good, too. i have to say that the mustard was my favorite part about it - but again, some of the most tender and well cooked meat i've ever had.\n\ndessert - \nchocolate souffle - not too shabby.... not a huge chocolate fan, but my girlfriend loved it.\ncarrot and cream cheese ice cream sandwich - carrot cake is great, but this went beyond simple carrot cake. it was simply heavenly. the carrot-pineapple ice cream they served it with was sweet, but not overly so. and i absolutely loved the raspberry jam smeared on the side of the ice cream sandwich. *drool* i think if i only had the filet and this for dinner, i would've been completely satisfied.\n\nwe were also served a complimentary anniversary dessert - a play on cheesecake with scripted \"happy anniversary\" in chocolate. i'm tellin' yah, service here is tops!\n\nwe were also served a petit four at the end, which came with five little dessert pieces. i think the actual desserts we had were much better... but all the little extras were great =)\n\nall in all, some of the best food we've ever had and excellent service. i sorta wish i took pictures, but i didn't want to look tacky doing it in the dark dining room =p this place is well deserving of my first five star review - and i will definitely want to try the one closer to home some time in the near future =)", 
            "we decided to start off the new year with a good meal and decided to try fleur de lys. if the rest of my year is anything like the meal and experience i had here, i'll consider myself lucky. \n\nas lovers of tasting menus, we decided to go with the full tasting menu that came with 7 courses. we started off with a dungeness crab wrapped in slices of avocado served with a watermelon gazpacho. this was fantastic. the avocado was the perfect compliment for the crab and the watermelon gazpacho offered a light contrast to the savory avocado. the next dish was a <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> served with a ginger ponzu sauce. this had to be the best <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> i have ever had...hands down. the ponzu sauce was spruced up with a hint of ginger and the tuna was perfectly balanced with cucumber strings. the following dish was the nantucket bay scallops served with frisee and a tomato confit. the scallops were so moist and flavorful. generally, my compliant with scallops are that they are too big and lack the sweet, buttery flavor. these scallops had that wonderful flavor and a lot more. the tomato confit was very unique - the tomatoes were skinned and cooked, while maintaining it's shape and was the perfect consistency. the truffled onion soup was served with duck braised ragout and black truffles. i loved the duck braised ragout, but the soup was a little too creamy for my liking. my boyfriend loved it so it may just be a personal preference. i was more interested in the next dish, the veal and yukon gold potato ravioli. wow - this was so wonderful. this dish came with sunchokes and english peas. i loved the consistency of the ravioli, and the veal sauce was mouth watering. the last of the savory dishes as a venison served with huckleberries, mushrooms, brussel sprouts, a potato puree served on a bed of red cabbage. the venison was perfectly cooked - the meat was extremely tender and flavorful. the red cabbage was slightly crunchy and worked perfectly with the meat. i was in heaven. \n\nfor desserts, we had the coconut soup with tapioca, passion fruit sorbet served on a square of banana bread. we also had the chocolate souffle, and poached pears with cinnamon ice cream. the desserts were okay - i feel like i have had better (hence the 4 stars). overall the service was okay as well. my last comment is that i loved the decor of the restaurant. the vaulted ceilings had drapes going from floor to ceiling which gave the restaurant a very dramatic effect. the huge display of roses at the entrance of the restaurant was breathtaking.", 
            "exceptional restaurant by top chef hubert keller. took my bf here for his birthday a couple of weeks ago. the food and service was superb. \n \nwhat we ordered: \nthree out of the four of us ordered the three course elegance prix fixed menu which included 4 courses. my bf ordered ala carte. \n \nbread basket: good selection of bread. my faves were the focaccia and the pretzel bread. \n\nsalad:  fresh and tasted great. \n\ntruffle onion soup-braised duck cr\\u00eape, red wine shallot pur\\u00e9e, black truffle. this was definitely very good...tasted very decadent and hearty. \n\nahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>:  the ahi tuna tasted fresh and the ginger ponzu sauce added a little kick to the dish.\n\nchorizo wrapped suzuki sea bass:  this was a superb dish. sea bass was cooked very well, melted in your mouth.\n\nbraised veal and yukon gold potato ravioli: the last time i had veal, i didn't really like it. but this time it was actually pretty good. \n\nstout braised beef short ribs: soft and tender. very good but i must say my bf and two other friends ordered the prime filet and that was definitely the better of the two dishes. \n\nprime filet mignon topped with saut\\u00c9ed foie gras: this was definitely the best dish of the night. the meat just melted in your mouth and the foie gras was superb!!! the dish also had truffle in it which was an added bonus. \n\ndessert trio of peanut butter milkshake + chocolate fondant cake + canal of bailey's ice-cream with crushed peanut butter brittle: my friend wasn't too impressed with this dish..tried a little bit and thought it was ok,nothing spectacular. \n\nchocolate souffle: this was actually really good. decadent and was perfect with the ice cream.\n\ncarrot cake with a pineapple sorbet: carrot cake was moist and the sorbet was not too tart. \n\nsince it was my bf's bday they brought out a dessert dish that had happy birthday on it with a candle..yay happy birthday bf!!! they also gave us 4 small dishes of appetizers; complimentary of the chef  and was pretty good. unfortunately i forgot what its called though. \n\ndog point pinot noir: this was a very good pinot from new zealand. soft bodied and a little more fruity in taste. \n\noverall the experience was great. deducted a point just for the affordability factor. we got $50 deducted from our bill because we used a certificate i got from restaurant.com. total for 4 people 650 including tip and the $50 deduction. definitely not cheap and will take a chunk out of your wallet but i have to say it was well worth a try. also, plan on staying for a least two hours for dinner. our reservation was at 7pm and we didn't leave till 9pm, that's with us rushing our server a bit because we had a show to attend at 930. so word of advice, plan accordingly if you have something planned after dinner.", 
            "we love staying at mandalay bay and a quiet evening spent dining at fleur de lys always makes our vegas trip complete.\n\nthis is the second time i have eaten at fleur de lys, and it only gets better. (of course i haven't had to pay the bill which was close to $400 plus tip)\n\nthe atmosphere is wonderful and is the perfect escape from the neon lights of vegas.  dining at fleur de lys makes me feel like a queen.  i love the outstanding service and the surroundings are elegant and relaxing.\n\nduring our most recent experience the sommelier offered several suggestions to accompany our tasting menu and each was perfectly paired with the entrees.  i enjoyed a fruity pinot noir and had a few sips of a red, but stopped there since i'm not much of a drinker.\n\nthe food seemed to just keep coming and the only entree i passed on was the foie gras since i will not touch it for ethical reasons, but my dining companion said it was the best ever.\n  \nwe started with a mixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> with polenta and the truffle onion soup, both excellent.  i was almost full by the time i sampled the bread basket which was amazing in itself.  i could have eaten the pretzel bread and focaccia along with the salad and soup and been very satisfied.\n\nthe other courses included a sampling of lobster and scallops, braised beef short ribs and pan seared duck breast.  my companion also ordered a sampling of ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>.  every course had unique flavors that worked together like an orchestra performing in my mouth.  side dishes included white asparagus and fingerling fries.  although i was full i couldn't pass up tasting each dish, and my companion lucked out since they scored half my dinner.  ah, but there was a method to my madness since i was saving room for dessert.\n\nwe enjoyed a cheese sampling and fruit along with the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 and some brittle.  \n\ni can't wait to go back this spring, hopefully with my 21 year old in tow. \nfleur de lys is definitely on my short list of favorite restaurants.", 
            "we came here for our \"splurge\" dinner in vegas. although we intended to order the 3 course menu for $45, we ended up really splurging for the $90 menu and were not disappointed.  everything was excellent, especially the <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>, the filet mignon and the chocolate souffle dessert.  i could go on and on about how perfect each course was, but suffice it to say that everything is excellent and nothing disappointed.  \n\nhere's what i really appreciated about our dinner at fleur de lys--the little extra touches.  the amuse bouche.  the frequency with which the bread selections came around (we eventually sampled all 6 different types of bread and all were delish).  the excellence of the house wine.  the complimentary mini pastries made by their pastry chef.  they really go the extra mile here to make sure the experience is worthwhile.  my only complaint is that the service is a bit too intrusive; for example, someone came by after every course to ask how it was.  other than that, it's the perfect place for a romantic splurge dinner in vegas.", 
            "4 1/2 stars. \n\nmy husband and i came here for our anniversary and both had the elegance menu. \n\nmy first course was the <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> with a shaved fennel slaw. sure, it's not the most creative dish, but it was very, very, tasty. the fennel with the ponzu sauce complimented the tartare cleanly and wonderfully. i thoroughly enjoyed this dish.\n\nthe second dish was the chorizo wrapped sea bass. all i can say is, oh. my. gawd. i could have had 12 servings of this dish and not be tired of it. this dish was ridiculously good and it is one of the best dishes i have ever had, and that's saying a lot. \n\nthe third dish was the filet mignon. the filet melted like butter on the tongue. this dish was extremely well executed but not nearly as creative as the second course. \n\nfor dessert, we had the chocolate cake with popcorn ice cream (which was awesome) and a peanut butter shake, which i did not like so much. the peanut butter shake was way too overpowering and peanut-buttery, it didn't fit in with the rest of the dessert. \n\nthe chef brought out a complementary passion fruit chocolate cake with the words, \"happy anniversary\" on it. that was so sweet and such a nice touch. this dessert actually was my favorite one. the passion fruit gave an acidity and fruitiness that balanced out the dark chocolate perfectly. \n\nthis place is very, very expensive (our meal was over $300), but completely worth it. i thoroughly enjoyed my meal and would definitely come back for another special occasion.", 
            "this is hands down the most expensive dinner my husband and i have ever had and we don't regret a single dime of it.  we decided to splurge and be adventurous and go with the chef's tasting menu, basically a 7-9 course dinner with whatever the chef decides to serve us, with wine pairings for my husband.  \n\nwe had 9 courses and these are some of them.  keep in mind my description does not do the meal any justice.  \navocado ball with dungeness crabmeat inside with watermelon gazpacho.\n<mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>\ntruffed onion soup\nhamachi with shitake mushroom\nlamb\nchocolate souffle with dark chocolate sauce\n\nmy husband said the wine choices were absolutely perfect with each course.  our server, javier was fun and friendly.  in the end, they took us back to the kitchen to show us around and to meet chef keller.  he was very friendly and was able to chat with us for a bit.  part of the dinner was also 2 autographed cookbooks that he authored.  \n\ni highly recommend the restaurant for a special dinner.  they do 3, 4 or 6 course dinners in addition to the chef's choice that we chose.", 
            "wifey and i don't get spoiled too often...it was her birthday...we were in vegas...so what the heck...why not go all out?  chef hubert keller won our hearts from the moment we walked into the restaurant.  the place is absolute beautiful...small, quiet, romantic...and i really liked the wine cases on the 2nd floor...super elegant.\n\nthe service was the best i have ever had.  after every course, we got different utensils...the servers were on top of bussing our plates and filling our water glasses.  everything was personal...many items were put together at our table.  and the food was just magnificent.\n\nok, first of all, if you want to eat here but are worried about the price, go get a $50 gift certificate from restaurant.com.  the certificate itself was only 2 bucks...well worth it for a fancy shmancy restaurant like this one.  and the servers don't mind at all...in fact, they're more than happy to take it.  it significantly lowered our bill...but don't forget to tip on the original amount!\n\nok...the food...we both ordered off the prix fixe menu.  a guy came around with a big ole basket of 4 different types of bread.  the pretzel roll was amazing.  we couldn't help but to have a couple of them!  \n\nfirst course: \n1. truffled onion soup (the server poured the soup into our bowl at the side of our table)\n2. <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> (delish)\n\nsecond course:\n3. chorizo wrapped suzuki sea bass (probably my least favorite dish of the night...but was still extremely tasty!  i still licked the plate afterwards)\n4. braised veal and yukon gold potato ravioli (absolutely the best dish of the night!!!)\n\nthird course:\n5. stout braised beef short ribs (the short ribs were so tender...it just melted in my mouth!)\n6. prime filet mignon (cooked perfectly...no juices leaking on the plate...the steak rested enough to ensure that the steak wasn't dry...i've never had a steak as perfect as this one!)\n   \nfourth course/dessert:\n7.  upgraded to a chocolate souffle (the server pokes a hole in the middle and pours chocolate into the inside...served with mocha ice cream)\n8. carrot cake with cream cheese ice cream filling with a scoop of mango carrot ice cream (yum)\n\nas a bonus, wifey got an extra dessert for her birthday.  it was some sort of pistachio cake served with fresh fruit...also delish.  and they were cute enough to bring it out with a lit candle...awww....\n\ni can't believe i waited all this time to eat at chef hubert keller's restaurant...there is one in san francisco but never really thought about eating at fleur de lys...until now...if only i were rich...haha.\n\nthe best restaurant dining experience ever!!!", 
            "when i realized that the chef was from alsace, i was expecting to taste it in the dishes, but this was mostly contemporary cooking. the ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> was really good and went surprisingly well with fennel. the beef was delicious too. i wasn't thrilled by the selection of cheeses and would have loved to find a good munster on the plate. the dessert was unfortunately disappointing and very plain.\n\nall in all, there is room for improvement. hubert keller is very nice and certainly talented. i just wished he would be more influenced by his origins: his region and his parents' pastries.", 
            "delicious and delightful, even playful. the cuisine was superb. we had the tasting menu. here's my meal: ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>, skate salad with pineapple, short ribs with guinness foam, and a carrot cake ice cream sandwich. the short ribs dish with the guinness was a perfect flavor combination.\n\nthe wait staff was also fun. i often feel intimidated at big-league restaurants, especially when i ask questions about the food, but they were patient, and they let me take pictures of the food to send to my mother, who is a hubert keller fan. then they went above and beyond and let us take a peek at the kitchen. i was impressed, especially by the sous-vide bath. i always wondered what the fuss was over sous-vide cooking, but believe the hype. sous-vide results in tender meat. \n\nyes, it's pricey, but it's the kind of meal you won't forget. if you want fine dining in vegas, go here. i need to talk my mom into braving the vegas heat and debauchery so she can enjoy fleur de lys in person.", 
            "fancy smancy dinner here on a saturday night.\nwe started off with the amuse bouche. it was a piece of fried cod over potato salad. yum. a great start to our meal. appetizer was the ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>. again, yum! the fish was fresh and the fennel crisp on top was a nice flavor combo. i had the butter-poached maine lobster. it had good flavor but it was chewy :( was that because it was overcooked? not sure. i didn't send it back. charlie got the steak. it came with creamed spinach and marble potatoes. the steak had an incredible crust on it. really really tasty. creamed spinach was so good! even he who doesn't like creamed spinach loved it. no room for dessert....so stuffed. \n\noverall, the food was really good except that my lobster was chewy. the service was ok. not super attentive and our waitress spent a lot of her time on the other tables. (probably because they ordered a heck of a lot more food and wine.) i would have to rate this at a 4 for now. room for improvement. i would love to try this place again except in sf!!", 
            "another big league high end top chef celebrity restaurant...  fleur de lys is an excellent choice for fine dining while visiting vegas....\nstarted off with an amuse bouche which was a piece of fried cod over a potato salad.. it was quite pleasant and was an excellent prelude to chef hubert keller's tasting menu....next i had the truffled onion soup followed by sea bass wrapped in a pan seared chorizo covering.... both were absolutely amazing and made me wish i could have \"much\" more... the next dish was the filet mignon and finally a small platter of chocolates \nand ice-cream with a caramel drizzle..... both items were also very pleasing to the palate and will\nnot be forgotten soon... as for my girlfriends dishes, all i can remember is the short ribs with guinness foam and <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>... they \nwere equally impressive.... bedsides the unforgettable food i have to say that the service was great.. most tasting menu types of experiences i've had in the past have came accompanied with somewhat unapproachable waiters that can't even crack a smile.. the \nstaff at fleur de lys are both friendly and professional... my only slight complaint is that the pacing of the tasting menu is quite fast..the pace has always been a little more relaxed during my other tasting menu \nexperiences at other fine establishments, but i guess this is how they ensure that the masses of vegas tourists can eat here without having to spend too much time sitting around... \noverall my experience at fleur de lys was an excellent one that i highly recommend to others if you have the extra money to spend \nas it will cost a pretty penny, but is totally worth the experience..\n\nfun fact- ladies, there is a huge  artistic mural on the wall that is completely made of fresh roses.. at the end of your dinner you're waiter will bring one to the table as a bit of a souvenir...nice classy touch!!!", 
            "this is simply just one of the most wonderful french restaurants in las vegas.  the service was excellent as the waiters were very knowledgeable, helpful, and prompt.  the ambience has a low key atmosphere which is perfect for a date and probably what you'd expect from a upscale french restaurant.\n\nso let's go on to the food.  my girlfriend and i both ordered the prix fixe menu where we both ordered different items since we wanted to taste as much as we could from chef hubert keller's menu.  we were started off with some small scallop dish that wasn't on the menu complimentary of the chef. so what we had each were:\n\n- truffle onion soup / ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> (appetizers)\n- chorizo wrapped seabass / braised short ribs with guiness foam (entree)\n- filet mignon / ravioli with parmesan foam\n- chocolate fondant / carrot cake ice cream with peanut butter shake/ pistachio cake (this one was for our early anniversary)\n\nthe food was all excellent.  the short ribs are delicious, but the taste of braised shortribs have never impressed me much.  they were tasty nonetheless.  the paremesan foam was an excellent touch to the ravioli, and the filet mignon was perfectly cooked.  also, please get the truffled onion soup.  it really wasn't what i was expecting at all, and i'm glad i tried it even though i don't care for onion soup.  \n\noverall, this was such an enjoyable meal and experience.  prepare to spend some money though, and the only downside was not being able to meet chef hubert keller!", 
            "this review pertains to the tapas/lounge area.\n\nthe skinny: great tapas menu with excellent desserts (4.25), service: excellent, nice ambience (4) value: if you get the entire tapas menu (including dessert) for $115, it's a great deal for the quality and perfect to share amongst 3-4 people (4.5)\n\nwe went to fleur de lys tonight to share their tapas menu with 3 other friends. we got the entire tapas menu for a price of $115 - which would cost a lot more if you ordered a la carte.\n\nthe tapas menu was excellent. from the truffled onion soup to  the chacuterie plate for two, the dishes were delightful well-balanced and well-executed. the wonderful manchego mixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> had the right amount of tartness. first time for yellowtail fish sticks with tartar sauce but i have to say i'm sold! moist on the inside, wonderfully crispy on the outside. mmm.... the chacuterie plate was fantastic with the decadent pate, cured meats and artisan bread. \n\nthere were only few missteps - the truffle buttered popcorn, rock shrimp noodle salad and the ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>. the rock shrimp noodle glass noodle salad was supposed to have some sort of asian/vietnamese influence but fell short due to the noodles being too thick and gummy. the ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> was only okay and didn't really add anything new. the truffle buttered popcorn was a little bit bitter and i'm not sure why. still the truffle really came through on that dish.\n\nthe dessert portion was awesome: 3 dishes of ice cream/sorbets, 1 ice cream float, 1 lemon ice cream with angel food cake. all amazing presentations and large portion sizes - good enough to share amongst all of us.\n\nideally, it might have been a little bit better to share the entire tapas menu amongst four but it did well enough with five of us. so if you think about it, $115/5... that's less than $25 per person. it's actually more affordable if you got the entire tapas menu and split it two ways than going for their early bird prixe fixe menu (at $65/person). \n\nactually, in many ways, i felt the tapas menu tasted better than the $65 set menu. so i would recommend going here to split the tapas tasting menu (including dessert) with four people.", 
            "omg!  so fun.  best staff ever.  my husband and i went to the fdl for our anniversary dinner last night.  they have a tapas special where you can get one of every tapas on the menu for $99.  you can also add one of every dessert for an additional $15.  i assumed that these would be amuse bouche size bites, but they were the full tapas serving (which was actually bigger than a tapas).  first, we were seated and told the waitress what we wanted.  she said that normally, they only serve tapas on the \"patio,\" but that she would check with the manager.  they were very accommodating and left us where we were.  they then stopped us from ordering two tapas tasting menus because it would be too much food.  what?  they saved us $115.  mu husband doesn't eat pork, so they offered substitutions on the two pork items for him.  the food was delicious, but very rich (as you might expect from french-influenced cuisine. truffle popcorn was amazing, huge portion, but drenched in butter, so even though it was only the second dish they brought out, we couldn't finish it.  the onion soup was literally fantastic.  four little tasting cups come per serving.  ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> was good, but heavy on dressing, so fish flavor was a little lost.  the rock shrimp and noodles were very spicy. my husband felt the shrimp were overcooked--i thought it was ok.  chimichurri flank steak was amazing-the silky chimichurri on marinated grass fed flank served medium rare was outstanding.  the charcuterie plate was delicious and portion was huge!  my husband got the short ribs, and he loved them.  delicate and wonderful hearts of palm salad.  the tossed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> was also yummy. my husband had two glasses of wine, i had the cocktail flight (three fruity mini martinis).  they were sweet and string, presented beautifully.   they brought us 7 desserts (an extra for our anniversary), of which we ate about one bit each because we were stuffed. best of all, service was unbelievably good.  our main waitress packed food for us without asking (at a high end restaurant, where i would have been embarrassed to ask for that). we had a great time, and would go back in a flash.  total bill $227 (alcohol was about $50, and the extra entree was $42).   to think that for $115 you could get all of that food, at that quality, with that service, is unbelievable.", 
            "this should be a five star review but i allowed my friend and fellow yelper seth(the food snob) to talk me down to 4 stars. the service here is stellar and they really pay attention to detail. the huge gripe i have with the service is that they neglected to tell us each soda would be charged as such. this would've been ok if each one had more than 3 sips in it and didn't get refilled when it was halfway done.\n\nother than my small gripe and my friends slightly overcooked sea bass the meal was fantastic. i must admit the meal started off great when we were greeted by the deceptively cute hostess and brought to a very private table. i'll excuse the fact that she called my friend my other half but that's a story for another day.\n\nwe ordered the 4 course elegance menu which started with <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> on top of a fennel slaw which was refreshing and a great starter. next up was a chorizzo wrapped chilean sea bass with risotto with a tomato sauce that was amazing. my bass was cooked perfectly and basically melted in my mouth. the presentation was colorful and made the dish pop. next out was the filet mignon and potato gratin. the filet was buttery and the perfect portion.\n\nand then there was dessert.....wow was there dessert. i ordered the chocolate fondant cake with peanut butter milkshake and peanut butter ice cream. my friend ordered the carrot cake with carrot/pineapple ice cream. i am not a fan of carrot cake but the ice cream was intense. my fondant cake was exactly like you'd hope a gooey, warm, angel would be. wait....no, that's it. a great way to end an elegant meal even if my company was a snobby yelper. i will definitely be coming back. thanks hubert!", 
            "what a fantastic dining experience -- and tapas to match!  this is such a delightful change from the old fleur de lis!  the new fleur has great menu items that you must must order.  believe me, you won't be disappointed: lobster mac & cheese, big eye <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> tacos, smoked short ribs.  the choreography and theater of the food delivery is only beat by the unbelievable food quality.  we ate until we were stuffed, and wished we had another stomach to turn to.  spectacular!!  book a reservation now!", 
            "alright...so i'm very aware that there are already way too many reviews for this place, but it was such a memorable meal for me, that i really have to pass along my two cents worth.\n\ni went with two girlfriends for lunch to this glorious spot when we were out in vegas for continuing education. (have to give a shout out to my husband for the recommendation!) we waited a very short time for a table considering it was the busy lunch hour. when we were seated, our server came over promptly and began talking with us. i discussed chef keller with him and how excited i was to be eating there, to which he stated \"would you like a picture with him? he is sitting right behind you.\"\n\ni said something to the effect of \"shut the f**k up!!!!\" (not my proudest moment, but it shows you how excited i was that the word vomit just came pouring out). he smiled politely and said he would send him over in a little bit.\n\nwe began ordering, which was quite difficult since everything on the menu looked amazing!! i ordered the cuban panini (might i add, so did chef keller...but i'm not a stalker or anything). this sandwich was perfect. the horseradish mustard gave it just the right kick, and i could feel it all through my sinuses. i also got the homemade gnocchi with pesto. thank god for homemade gnocchi! these little balls of deliciousness were just the right texture and consistency. \n\nmy friends ordered the <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark>, the italian style meatballs with pasta fagioli soup underneath them. they also had the sliders and the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>. all of these items were delicious and perfectly seasoned. the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were the standout item of what my friends ordered...they used very thin slices of <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>, which gave just the right amount of flavor and texture against the crunchy taco shell. we also all shared the macaroni and cheese with lobster. i'm not a huge seafood fan, especially when it is mixed in to one of my favorite comfort foods, but the server recommended it and he was spot on. the only reason we didn't finish it is because we were too full from all our other items, plus...there was the matter of ordering dessert.\n\nfor those of you who know me, i am not a huge fan of dessert to begin with, but everything was so good i just had to have one more course. i ordered (are you ready for this???) my absolute hands down favorite dessert of all time! it was the coconut soup with passionfruit sorbet. sounds weird, i know, but it was unbelievable! they had topped the runny coconut soup/tapioca mixture with cold passionfruit sorbet and crunchy dehydrated fruit. i can't say enough about it. i could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. my friends had the panna cotta, which was good, and fairly standard. we also got a couple cheesecake lollies sent over from the table next to us (apparently, their family of 8 had eaten too much too). wonderful and a very playful take on classic cheesecake.\n\nfinally, chef keller came over to talk with us. we snapped a few photos, told him how delighted we were over meeting him and how much we enjoyed his meal, and then were off to enjoy more of our ce. thank you chef keller!!!", 
            "<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, and <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> are ridiculously good.... and the <mark>Red Sangria</mark> is the best i've ever had. service gets 5 stars, as well. both fleur and burger bar are reasons for keller to be proud."

            "came here in april 2011 and it was a very disappointing experience! i made a reservation after my friends had raved about fleur de lys being the best dining experience they had in las vegas. after looking up the menu changes, i decided to give fleur a try. i didn't think hubert keller could disappoint. \n\ni do have to disclose that i tried to cancel my reservation earlier that day. my group had decided we wanted to do something a lot more casual for dinner. despite their 24 hour cancellation policy, i was told when i made the reservation that they're not strict about it and that as long as you call before your reservation, you won't be charged the ridiculous no-show fee. when i called, they gave me a lot of trouble, telling me that they had a ridiculously busy night and that cancelling the reservation would absolutely mean i'd be charged $50 per person. she even went as far to tell me that if i tried to pull a loophole on her by changing my reservation then canceling it 24 hours before my reservation, i would still be charged. thank goodness my group of friends were troopers and decided to give the restaurant a try. \n\nwhen we got there, the restaurant wasn't busy at all. the lady on the phone emphasized how busy they were and were going out of their way to accommodate our large party of 9. there was plenty of room in the back in the 'real restaurant area' but we were put in the very front in the mall area. it felt like we were eating in a food court. \n\nthe entire meal was a disappointment. the service was mediocre at best. we had a party of 9 so we were able to order a lot of plates off the menu. there were more than 3 dishes that the wait staff got wrong. we kept getting dishes we didn't order and we got repeats of dishes that were already served. when we pointed them out to the servers, they simply said \"the kitchen hates it when we send food back so just eat it.\" \n\nthe food was nothing spectacular. not only did nothing taste particularly flavorful, nothing came out at the right temperature. everything we ordered came luke warm. the server kept warning us that the lobster mac and cheese was extremely hot but it wasn't. we could've put our face to the baking dish without our skin turning red. the mussels were bland, the braised hamachi came highly recommended by the wait staff but it came swimming in so much sauce that you couldn't even tell you were eating fish. my friends ordered the fleur burger but the waiter instructed them to pour the red wine reduction sauce all over the burger that it completely masked the taste of the wagyu, foie and truffle. the worst dish even though its a side dish must've been the <mark>Tarte Flambe</mark>. it was simply onions on flatbread, both underwhelming and tasteless. \n\nthe only highlight to the meal was dessert. the chocolate souffle and the <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> trio were the only dishes that were satisfying.\n\nafter food, wine, tip and tax, the bill came out to $78 per person. it was an outrageous amount of money to have spent on a very lackluster meal.", 
            "fleur uses the tapas concept (small plates to be shared) but elevates it to a fun event with artistic, almost whimsical presentations of absolutely mind blowing flavors.  it is hubert keller at his best.\n\nthe oyster shooters are a must try.  an oyster sitting on a bit of cr\\u00e8me fresh in a green gazpacho with a touch of hot sauce.  taken as a shot, the flavors go on and on.\n\nthe \"flambees\" are equally good.  various toppings are served on a wafer thin flat bread.  the <mark>Tarte Flambe</mark> is a personal favorite with onions, bacon, truffle, asparagus, on a base of cr\\u00e8me fraiche.  seriously, who doesn't love bacon.\n\nthe dinner menu offers a much wider selection of dishes with even more standouts.  the short list includes the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, oysters (with margarita sorbet and orange puree), braised hamachi (incredible soy ginger foam),  \"in the shower\" lobster mac and cheese, and the wagyu beef (served on a hot stone with wasabi and lime.)  if you can't decide, you can always eat the menu.  the options includes practically every dish on the dinner menu and is suggested for a party of 6 or more (it must e a joke.  i've never tried this).\n\nservice is excellent in both the lounge and restaurant.  \n\nfood prices are fair.\n\nwine pricing is high even by vegas resort standards.  the wines by the glass list is short but well chosen.  \n\nspecial note, the restaurant offers an incredible absinthe cart.  don't pass this up especially if its not yet legal in your state.", 
            "stick with any buffet at the wynn for much better dining for your buck.  \n\nfor lunch, we ordered the onion soup shooters, mac & cheese, oyster shooters, <mark>Tarte Flambe</mark>, manchego salad, alaskan halibut, steak frites and almond panna cotta.  \n\ngreat presentation, decent service, but every dish was terrifically mediocre - i would put it at cheesecake factory level dining.  no originality nor artistry, nothing was memorable - i had to go back to the online lunch menu to remember what we'd had.", 
            "i came here with 3 other friends and we ordered a bunch of different plates and shared everything so we can try a bunch of stuff.  service was great.  i would give this place a 3 star if it wasn't for the near damn perfect chocolate souffle.  that souffle bumped it up to a 4 star rating.  \n\nwhat i ordered:\ncroque monsieur: yum\nsteak tartar: good, but i've had better\nfig flambe and <mark>Tarte Flambe</mark>:  i could've done without\nseared foie gras:  yummmmm\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>:  my friends liked this dish.  i thought the hard shell taco with raw tuna was a weird combo.\nrock shrimp:  blahhh; if you ever had korean spicy dduk, this uses the same sauce.\nbraised hamachi:  very good\nitalian style meatballs:  good\nbraised short ribs:  very good, but i've had better\nside or wild mushroom:  good.\nwarm coconut almond cakes:  very good.  kiwi sorbet with a great combo with the almond cakes.\nchocolate souffle:  amazing!  perfect light airy texture, not overly sweet, nice super thin crispness to the top.",

            "let's start by saying this: tapas style restaurant.  this is a small plates establishment, so order appropriately.\n\ndo they have a bigger dinner menu? after 2 cancelled birthday dinner reservations we had to settle for a birthday lunch on sunday before catching our flight back to la.  we decided to try fleur because a. had been to the other fleur and said it was delicious and that we should go.  of course i yelped it to see what it was tdf (to die for)\n\nafter perusing the menu nothing in particular really stood out to me.  and since a few reviews were talking about the kobe burger, we decided to just order some apps and then walk over to the burger bar, also a hubert keller establishment located at mandalay place.\n\nwe ordered the truffled onion soup shooters.  people seem to have forgotten mention that in their review.  it comes in a small carafe equaling 4 shooters.    i'm a huge onion soup fan and am always on the look out for a restaurant that blows my tastebuds.  this wasn't it.  it was heavily creamy and looked like cream of corn.  the truffle oil is probably the only thing that saved it.\nthe lobster mac and cheese which everyone also raved about.  they used small macaroni noodles and in my opinon didn't have enough cheese to my mac.  it was good but i probably wouldn't order it here again and opt to try something new.\n<mark>Tarte Flambe</mark> with bacon truffle and asparagus was the best out of the 3.  the flavors complemented each other perfectly \n\nthe desserts are actually the only thing that sounded delicious, but since we were heading to burger bar i exercised a little self control and asked for the check.", 
            "yay! i'm a fan. \n\n... a fan of their specialty drinks. good wine selection, very good service. \nshortrib, cerviche, burgers, etc.. all very well done except the below:\n\nseared foie gras was a bit on the oily side. \n<mark>Tarte Flambe</mark> - flatbread was kind of cold.\n\nnice decor, wish the room was brighter. \nwould come again.", 
            "we were there for our 3rd anniversary dinner and had a wonderful, delicious time.  the portions are decent sizes, not the horrible, oversized portions, that a lot of the restaurants serve in america. we starteed with manchego salad and <mark>Tarte Flambe</mark> (bacon, onion, truffle, asparagus and sour cream), both great to share. amazing dressing in that salad, and the tarte was so flavorful...the trufle was never too overwhelming, it was just perfect. for our entrees, my husband had the braised short ribs, on a bed of fingerling potatoe puree and he was so pleased with it. i had salmon with some cucumbers, sourcream horse radish truffle sauce - out of this world! service was very pleasant and non-intrusive a+", 
            "hubert keller is absolutely charming.  chats with guests and is concerned about their experience.  our lunch in this gracious, but business-like venue included a carafe of sangria was delicious, refreshing and light; can recommend the <mark>Tarte Flambe</mark>, amazing guinness braised short ~ rib lasagne (best ever non-traditional lasagne), croque monsieur, and panna cotta.", 
            "creative.  inventive.  the perfect melange of flavors.  a modern dining experience based on sensory overload thanks to the restrained use of molecular gastronomy.  \n\nthe menu was changed in december 2012.  sadly the stunning steak tartare with white truffle powder is gone.  what replaced it lessens the sorrow.\n\nthe crisp duck confit spring rolls with its over the top, umame \"injection\" of truffles and a truffle aioli, omg!  the gaminess of the duck is brought out by the earthy truffles.  a delicious flavor that goes on and on (translated:  the fat from the confit and oil in the aioli coats your tongue in a good way).\n\nthe seared foie with hazelnut crust, excellent.  foietastic nuttiness contrasting perfectly with the puckering verjus and the essence of grapes.  simply put, wow.\n\nthe kushi oyster, amazing.  served atop liquid nitrogen and dressed with lemon juice and orange pearls.  eat it quick.  the liquid nitrogen super chills the oyster without freezing it.  biting into the oyster and popping the citrus caviar creates a eruption of flavors.  think, frozen vodka shot.\n\nthe <mark>Tarte Flambe</mark> (crisp, wafer thin flat bread topped with onion, bacon, asparagus, cr\\u00e8me fraiche, and truffles), and the raw ahi taco (baby taco shells filled with an avocado cream, crisp and hot serrano chili, and a ponzu suspension) are both worthy of special mention.  \n\nfriendly, knowledgeable servers.\n\nvery good, well chosen, global, mid range wine list.  most bottles under $80.  vegas resort pricing.  for something special be sure to try the \"liquid nitrogen enhancement\" to their signature cocktails.  the table side show flash freezes your drink into a heady sorbet.  the first \"bite\" is an indescribable sensory overload.\n\nthe lesson, when in doubt, try.", 
            "can i just start with \"we love tapas\" - \nok now that's out of the way. \ni've eaten at fleur for a business dinner but my constant companion has not. as a local it is always a treat for us to actually go to a strip casino on a saturday night. but the mpi-wec trade show was there and i wanted to bask in their ambiance so off to mandalay bay we went. \nfleur is in the perfect location for people watching. we had made a reservation for 630pm but got there early and was very happy to be seated. \nround 1:\ncocktails: we started with blood orange margarita & the enchanted apple. note: they have an ipad to speed though the ordering process but if you want something not on their menu (we are bloody mary folks) you have to order the old fashioned way. \nwe had the bone marrow & the sliders to start. \nround 2:\n2 bloody marys\npork belly fried rice\n<mark>Tarte Flambe</mark>\nround 3:\n2 more bloody marys\n& we split a fleur burger. \nround 4:\nvanilla creme brule\nchocolate cake pops\n\nthe cockails. love the blood orange margarita..not so much the enchanted apple. they were nice enough to take it off the bill. so kudos. bloody mary's were good but they don't carry any of the infused vodkas so we didn't have the spice factor. \n\nthe food: all plates were ample for 2 or 3 to share. the marrow was great and even better when mixed with the fried rice. we could have had 2 orders of the sliders they were so good. flatbread was decent and pretty big so it was well shared. \n\ndessert: cake pops? divine. vanilla creme brule: fail. never had a hot creme brule. always cold with a quick sugar encrusted top. \n\nfat friendly: yes! great comfortable chairs for those of us with ample backsides. \nnoise level: they have 2 sections. 1 in the back which is beautifully appointed and spacious and not noisy at all. front which is in the \"restaurant row\" area is lively and i'm pretty sure later in the evening is much noisier but it is great for people watching. \n\nprice: party of 3: 6 cocktails. 4 rounds of food: bill $160.00 which is just over 50.00 pp. really not a bad price for a decent night out on the strip. \n\nnormally you really do need reservations.", 
            "my husband was looking forward to eating here because he's seen hubert keller on pbs.  great atmosphere, service, etc., but disappointing food.  the meal started great with grilled octopus which was stellar but it was downhill from there.  the angus sliders were good but the truffle oil mac n cheese bordered on tasteless.  the meatballs were meh as was the <mark>Tarte Flambe</mark>.  since only one out of 5 items were anything special we didn't even bother with dessert.  next time we'll try one of other restaurants in the casino.", 
            "a great restaurant and a chance to enjoy hubert keller without booking six months in advance.  \n\nfirst, wanted to compliment the service.  the waitress asked if we had to make a show and i mentioned i had a flight.  rather than a two or three hour experience, they were great at delivering the dishes promptly.  although it would of been great over many hours, i really like the way they were accommodating without me even having to ask.\n\nalthough there are entree on the menu, they also have small plates separated by territory.  my friends and i shared several:\n--   <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>.  i love tuna and the tuna was perfect.  the crispy taco was a very neat touch.\n--  black angus sliders.  maybe the highlight of the dinner.  while everyone has sliders these days, these were fantastic.  larger than i would of expected and the caramelized onions and bacon came together wonderfully with the meat.\n--  <mark>Tarte Flambe</mark>.  probably the most disappointing dish.  no flambee and overall not much flavor over the bread.\n--  seared foie gras.  i love good foie gras and this foie gras was prepared perfectly, the other highlight of the evening.\n--  bbq pork ribs.  a dish that often goes bad at small plates restaurants, done perfectly at fleur.  ribs were tender, flavorful and meaty.\n--  pork belly fried rice.  okay, another highlight of the evening.  surprisingly, it was not the pork belly that made the dish great but the flavor of the rice.  \n--  green papaya carpaccio.  after the tarte, one of the weaker dishes.  just not much flavor, the carpaccio did not come through.\n--  <mark><mark>Brownie Lollipops</mark></mark>. i am not a big sweets person, but these were very popular with our table.\n\nwith julian serrano, two fantastic options for small plates in vegas.  both are fantastic, fleur maybe a little more consistent but some great dishes in both places.", 
            "i had an awesome opportunity to dine twice at fleur by hubert keller, a restaurant owned by one of the greatest chefs of our time, hubert keller. fleur is a small-plates restaurant featuring tastes from around the world.\n\none of the most delicious things i've ever had was the <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark> with truffle oil. it was an explosion of flavors, and it was so delicious i had to go a second day in a row, just to eat the soup. the first day, i ordered this delicious flatbread, called the <mark>Tarte Flambe</mark>, which had onions, bacon, truffle oil, shaved asparagus, and creme fraiche. it was simply light and full of flavor.\n\nmy husband ordered the cuban sandwich with fries, and he was very delighted with his meal. for dessert that day, i ordered the brownie cake pops. they were simply divine. they contained milk chocolate mousse, dark chocolate ganache, and cocoa nibs. i love cakepops, and i have to say this was one of the best i've ever had.\n\nthe following day, march 8th, i decided to go downstairs by myself and grab a bite of that delicious <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark> with truffle oil, that i had the day prior. i also ordered the brioche beignets served with vanilla and cherry anglaises sauces. it was so delicious, and as you know, one of my favorite things is a good beignet.\n\nopen entering the restaurant i spotted chef hubert keller himself, i almost fainted. i was looking at his poster outside and said to myself that this couldn't be actually him. i was happy i had the opportunity to tell him how much i was a fan of his work, and how delicious his soup was.\n\nto kick off an even better birthday, i got a delicious chocolate cupcake served by chef keller himself. i was so surprised and almost passed out from shock. i was deeply humbled by the whole experience, and never in a million years thought this could happen to me.\n\noverall, this is simply one of the best restaurants i've ever been to, and it will always serve a special place in my heart. thank you so much to chef keller and the wonderful staff, you made my 30th birthday special, and i will never forget it.",

            "alright...so i'm very aware that there are already way too many reviews for this place, but it was such a memorable meal for me, that i really have to pass along my two cents worth.\n\ni went with two girlfriends for lunch to this glorious spot when we were out in vegas for continuing education. (have to give a shout out to my husband for the recommendation!) we waited a very short time for a table considering it was the busy lunch hour. when we were seated, our server came over promptly and began talking with us. i discussed chef keller with him and how excited i was to be eating there, to which he stated \"would you like a picture with him? he is sitting right behind you.\"\n\ni said something to the effect of \"shut the f**k up!!!!\" (not my proudest moment, but it shows you how excited i was that the word vomit just came pouring out). he smiled politely and said he would send him over in a little bit.\n\nwe began ordering, which was quite difficult since everything on the menu looked amazing!! i ordered the cuban panini (might i add, so did chef keller...but i'm not a stalker or anything). this sandwich was perfect. the horseradish mustard gave it just the right kick, and i could feel it all through my sinuses. i also got the homemade gnocchi with pesto. thank god for homemade gnocchi! these little balls of deliciousness were just the right texture and consistency. \n\nmy friends ordered the <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark>, the italian style meatballs with pasta fagioli soup underneath them. they also had the sliders and the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>. all of these items were delicious and perfectly seasoned. the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were the standout item of what my friends ordered...they used very thin slices of <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>, which gave just the right amount of flavor and texture against the crunchy taco shell. we also all shared the macaroni and cheese with lobster. i'm not a huge seafood fan, especially when it is mixed in to one of my favorite comfort foods, but the server recommended it and he was spot on. the only reason we didn't finish it is because we were too full from all our other items, plus...there was the matter of ordering dessert.\n\nfor those of you who know me, i am not a huge fan of dessert to begin with, but everything was so good i just had to have one more course. i ordered (are you ready for this???) my absolute hands down favorite dessert of all time! it was the coconut soup with passionfruit sorbet. sounds weird, i know, but it was unbelievable! they had topped the runny coconut soup/tapioca mixture with cold passionfruit sorbet and crunchy dehydrated fruit. i can't say enough about it. i could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. my friends had the panna cotta, which was good, and fairly standard. we also got a couple cheesecake lollies sent over from the table next to us (apparently, their family of 8 had eaten too much too). wonderful and a very playful take on classic cheesecake.\n\nfinally, chef keller came over to talk with us. we snapped a few photos, told him how delighted we were over meeting him and how much we enjoyed his meal, and then were off to enjoy more of our ce. thank you chef keller!!!",

            "if you want a splurge meal in vegas without the splurge price, i'm pretty sure fleur is it.  our party of 4 had an outstanding meal for about $50 a head.  the food is made and plated beautifully, with the menu bent towards small dishes that are easy to share.  a rundown of the things i remember:\n<mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark> - just watch out for the anchovies.  there were these 2 salty, cold bites of fish that kind of jolted me, since the lighting was dim & didn't expect it.  otherwise, a nice starter\nceviche - served with tortilla chips.  the seafood is nicely seasoned with a lime flavor that is strong but not overpowering.  don't forget the guacamole on the bottom\nsteak tartare - parmesan flatbread, tarragon mayonnaise and finely chopped meat.  i rarely eat this, but i thought this was quite tasty\nskirt steak - the chimichurri sauce was kind of thick, like salad dressing and not exactly what i was expecting.  usually i think of chimichurri as a little more oily and thin, but the steak was cooked very nicely\nlobster mac & cheese - the classic kid food, all grown up!\n\ni could go on and on, but i want to get to dessert, because there was something that i just had to get.  the pineapple carpaccio - thin slices of fresh pineapple, some that are torched or baked in an oven so that they are crispy, with lime sorbet and cilantro granita.  you read that correctly.  and if it sounds kind of strange, just give it a try because it will blow your mind.  probably the best dessert that i have had all year!  \n\nthe service is attentive, and the other thing that really stood out is how everything is served beautifully.  dishes with a lot of sauce were served in canoes like the sauteed shrimp, or the steak tartare on a flat square, that looked like it was made out of stone with the fleur logo.  you'd swear that you're the judge on a food network show, the way everything comes out of the kitchen.\n\na tremendous value in vegas, because you can spend way more than $50 per person and not be this happy.  get the pineapple dessert!!!!",

            "yes! everything about this evening was amazing; i wouldn't expect anything less.  this was our splurge night with friends so we were 100% aware of price and cuisine. we made a reservation but didn't feel it was necessary - no one was there at 7pm on a saturday; by the time we left around 9:30pm it was still empty. \n\nwe picked 3 appetizers; beef carpaccio (we ordered seconds!); escargot; gnocchi & short ribs = all amazing.  \n\nwe then ordered 2 <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark> & split them; definitely enough for 4 adults. the dressing was on point.\n\nentrees: fleur burger (added f.g. & truffle) - \"best burger ever\" as described from our friend; scallops - cooked perfectly + beets (my favorite!!!); my husband ordered the beef cheeks - so flaky soft, the pieces melted in your mouth... if you're a skeptic, it was like a very tender stew, but 100x better; 8 oz hanger steak - cooked perfectly to medium rare, melt in your mouth... our friend had to force herself to stop eating so she could save room for dessert. talk about self control!\n\ni can't freaking remember the desserts. oh my gosh. whatever, they were good, lol! \n\nit's a treat to eat here and i'm glad we did, one more celebrity chef to check off my list. a+++++!",

            "was attending a conference at the mandalay bay conference center and was looking for a place to meet with an old friend. fleur, located inside the mandalay bay casino, was a relatively quick walk from the conference center and looked pleasant enough so i  made a reservation via opentable (although it was not busy enough that i needed a reservation).\n\ni had the \"la scala's <mark>Greek Style Chopped</mark>\" salad with chicken.  essentially a romaine salad with soppressata, mozzarella, olives and beans in a vinaigrette.  i added a bit of extra protein by adding an organic <mark>Roasted Chicken Breast</mark>.  my friend had their <mark>Field Green</mark> salad (which included pear, apple and walnuts) and topped it with shrimp (note that the extra price for the shrimp was a bit outrageous, as the shrimp \"add on\" costs only $1 less than the salad itself).  she enjoyed her salad and shrimp.  i also enjoyed my salad, which was a healthy size, with the exception of the chicken.  clearly tasting like it was cooked hours in advance (or perhaps even a day in advance), it was refrigerator cold and completely dry.  i could have had chicken that tasted like that at the convention center; i had expected more from a  restaurant bearing mr. keller's name. although bread is not included, if you ask they will bring some pretty yummy rolls.  should have asked for another batch...they were that good.\n\none interesting affectation:  while the menu is presented printed on a large sheet of paper, the wine and drink list consists of an ipad that the waiter plopped in the center of the table while we were browsing the menu.  perhaps the restaurant feels that using an ipad for drinks looks \"cool and hip,\" or perhaps their wine and drink list change by the hour or minute, making a printed list too problematic. either way, i would suggest that they either give us the menu and drink list in the ipad, or give them to us on paper.  but don't try to hedge your \"coolness\" bets by using both formats.  that's just my $.02 worth."

            "we love staying at mandalay bay and a quiet evening spent dining at fleur de lys always makes our vegas trip complete.\n\nthis is the second time i have eaten at fleur de lys, and it only gets better. (of course i haven't had to pay the bill which was close to $400 plus tip)\n\nthe atmosphere is wonderful and is the perfect escape from the neon lights of vegas.  dining at fleur de lys makes me feel like a queen.  i love the outstanding service and the surroundings are elegant and relaxing.\n\nduring our most recent experience the sommelier offered several suggestions to accompany our tasting menu and each was perfectly paired with the entrees.  i enjoyed a fruity pinot noir and had a few sips of a red, but stopped there since i'm not much of a drinker.\n\nthe food seemed to just keep coming and the only entree i passed on was the foie gras since i will not touch it for ethical reasons, but my dining companion said it was the best ever.\n  \nwe started with a mixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> with polenta and the truffle onion soup, both excellent.  i was almost full by the time i sampled the bread basket which was amazing in itself.  i could have eaten the pretzel bread and focaccia along with the salad and soup and been very satisfied.\n\nthe other courses included a sampling of lobster and scallops, braised beef short ribs and pan seared duck breast.  my companion also ordered a sampling of ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>.  every course had unique flavors that worked together like an orchestra performing in my mouth.  side dishes included white asparagus and fingerling fries.  although i was full i couldn't pass up tasting each dish, and my companion lucked out since they scored half my dinner.  ah, but there was a method to my madness since i was saving room for dessert.\n\nwe enjoyed a cheese sampling and fruit along with the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 and some brittle.  \n\ni can't wait to go back this spring, hopefully with my 21 year old in tow. \nfleur de lys is definitely on my short list of favorite restaurants.", 
            "this pertains to their top chef masters menu\n\nthe skinny: great execution of classic french cuisine with occasional missteps (4) service - excellent, prompt, unpretentious (4.5), value - for the top chef masters tasting menu is actually pretty good for what it's worth (only available until 7pm).\n\nwhen people ask me about where they can find great, fancy french food for a reasonable price, i would have to recommend this place (i've eaten here before but i forgot to write a review!). i am sad to see that fleur will be closing its doors in august because it is a great restaurant on the strip.\n\nmy hubby and i tried their top chef tasting menu for $65/person.\n\nthe amuse bouche was a lightly fried cod with a warm potato salad. the cod was light and crisp while the acidity from the salad accentuated the flavours of the fish. a well thought out dish.\n\ni had the mixed greens with polenta croutons while my husband had the salmon and radish salad. the mixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> was phenomenal because of the crouton. now here's the thing. i don't like croutons. i don't like polenta. but i swear to god the chef must've used some sort of magic to make those babies - such lovely texture and aroma. i could have eaten an entire plate of those. the salmon dish and the radish salad was well prepared but overall, was a little unexcitiing.\n\nsecond course was lobster mac n' cheese and the braised beef cheek with filet mignon. to be honest, the lobster mac n' cheese a miss for me. for one thing, not enough lobster flavour and the macaroni was a little more than al dente for my taste. however, it tasted wonderful regardless.\n\nthe braised beef cheek however - wow! the meat braised in five spices... one of the best beef dishes i've had in a while. i almost wished there was no filet mignon there (not because it wasn't good) because the beef cheek totally outshone it. the accompanying sides were delicious. \n\nfinally dessert - a quartet of desserts actually. the earl grey <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark>, chocolate mice mousse and the fruit marscarpone parfait were home runs. the unfortunate piece was the lemon/chocolate tart. i love lemon tarts. i love chocolate. but the two together do not work. lemons really bring out the bitterness and grainy texture of chocolate.\n\nwe were also given a lovely plate of petit fours which were not that great. again, weird flavour combinations - lemon with five spice cake (the lemon doesn't go with it at all). the other sweets were...well... too sweet.\n\nlike i said, i will be sad to see fleur de lys close its doors next month.", 
            "this review pertains to the tapas/lounge area.\n\nthe skinny: great tapas menu with excellent desserts (4.25), service: excellent, nice ambience (4) value: if you get the entire tapas menu (including dessert) for $115, it's a great deal for the quality and perfect to share amongst 3-4 people (4.5)\n\nwe went to fleur de lys tonight to share their tapas menu with 3 other friends. we got the entire tapas menu for a price of $115 - which would cost a lot more if you ordered a la carte.\n\nthe tapas menu was excellent. from the truffled onion soup to  the chacuterie plate for two, the dishes were delightful well-balanced and well-executed. the wonderful manchego mixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> had the right amount of tartness. first time for yellowtail fish sticks with tartar sauce but i have to say i'm sold! moist on the inside, wonderfully crispy on the outside. mmm.... the chacuterie plate was fantastic with the decadent pate, cured meats and artisan bread. \n\nthere were only few missteps - the truffle buttered popcorn, rock shrimp noodle salad and the ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>. the rock shrimp noodle glass noodle salad was supposed to have some sort of asian/vietnamese influence but fell short due to the noodles being too thick and gummy. the ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> was only okay and didn't really add anything new. the truffle buttered popcorn was a little bit bitter and i'm not sure why. still the truffle really came through on that dish.\n\nthe dessert portion was awesome: 3 dishes of ice cream/sorbets, 1 ice cream float, 1 lemon ice cream with angel food cake. all amazing presentations and large portion sizes - good enough to share amongst all of us.\n\nideally, it might have been a little bit better to share the entire tapas menu amongst four but it did well enough with five of us. so if you think about it, $115/5... that's less than $25 per person. it's actually more affordable if you got the entire tapas menu and split it two ways than going for their early bird prixe fixe menu (at $65/person). \n\nactually, in many ways, i felt the tapas menu tasted better than the $65 set menu. so i would recommend going here to split the tapas tasting menu (including dessert) with four people.", 
            "this review pertains to their a la carte dining (please see below for tapas/top chef menu reviews)\n\nthe skinny: had the best chicken dish in a long time - it was slightly ridiculous how good it was! but trust me... don't order the duck (4), service - i think our server was not as good as some of the others (3), value - pretty good - gave us 2 free dishes (3).\n\nokay, i know this is my 2nd review update in the space of a month but i gotta get it while it's good and still open. plus, both my hubby's and my birthdays fall within a month of each other so it's okay to be a little on the splurging side.\n\nnormally, we either go for a nice prix fixe menu - more affordable and more complete experience. however, everytime we see something on the a la carte menu that piques our interests. so this time, we came armed with a $50 restaurant.com coupon and bit the bullet.\n\nwe ordered the organic beet salad, the foie gras tasting 3 ways, the organic chicken, the peking duck and finally, an almond panna cotta.\n\nagain, an amuse bouche of fried cod and potato salad which was very good (like our previous visit).\n\nthe foie gras was served in three preparations with brioche - a foie gras cappucino, a foie gras seared with a fruit compote and a foie gras terrine. the cappucino was very smooth, lusciously foamy and really accented the true flavour of the foie. the seared preparation with fruite compote was a classic and well prepared. the terrine was wonderful as well. my only complaint about the dish was it could have used more warm brioche to go with the foie gras.\n\nthe organic beet salad with poached quail egg and ham was okay. for 6-7 small cubes of beets, each topped with a fleck of microgreen, with 4 quail eggs with a sliver of ham - $19 seemed overpriced. although the presentation was astounding, i prefer their mixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> with polenta. disappointingly, it was the only salad option on the a la carte appetizer menu.\n\nwe both received a free 1/2 sized portion of the halibut entree. the halibut was seared perfectly - wonderful crust - but unfortunately was a little bland in the middle portion of the fish. the accompanying sweet corn/fava bean succotash was delightful.\n\nthe peking duck was a rather large disappointment. when you tell an asian that you're making peking duck - that skin better be crispy. and crispy it ain't. although the duck breast was well-cooked, the skin was nothing like peking duck. the cloyingly saccharine sauce on top really overpowered that dish. paired with a tough, overcooked foie gras on the bottom, you have a culinary mess on your hands.\n\nthat being said, the roast chicken dish was the best chicken dish i have had in a long time. the roasted chicken skin was so wonderfully crisp and seasoned and i savoured each bite (i normally remove the skin entirely). the moisture and texture of the meat was amazing.\n\ni have to admit - i was a little skeptical about when i saw foam covering the <mark>Roasted Chicken Breast</mark>. with so many restaurants using foam, it's become a bit of a cliche. but i understand why this technique was used in this case - the foam added that wonderful umami flavour of truffle without compromising the wonderful texture of the crisp chicken skin. the accompanying morel mushroom and cabbage completed this wonderfully well envisioned and balanced package of a dish.\n\nthe almond panna cotta was good but not astounding. the flavour combinations were wonderful if only the panna cotta had a better texture. to quote nigella lawson: [panna cotta should have] \"the quiver of a 17th century courtesan's inner thigh\". it was a little too solid for our tastes and not quite as silky smooth as other preparations we've enjoyed in the past. \n\nof note, we were not offered petit fours at the end of our meal this evening unlike our previous prix fixe menu experience.\n\noverall, a great meal with some highs and lows and the bill came to around $125 tip and tax (discounting the cost of the $50 coupon).", 
            "omg!  so fun.  best staff ever.  my husband and i went to the fdl for our anniversary dinner last night.  they have a tapas special where you can get one of every tapas on the menu for $99.  you can also add one of every dessert for an additional $15.  i assumed that these would be amuse bouche size bites, but they were the full tapas serving (which was actually bigger than a tapas).  first, we were seated and told the waitress what we wanted.  she said that normally, they only serve tapas on the \"patio,\" but that she would check with the manager.  they were very accommodating and left us where we were.  they then stopped us from ordering two tapas tasting menus because it would be too much food.  what?  they saved us $115.  mu husband doesn't eat pork, so they offered substitutions on the two pork items for him.  the food was delicious, but very rich (as you might expect from french-influenced cuisine. truffle popcorn was amazing, huge portion, but drenched in butter, so even though it was only the second dish they brought out, we couldn't finish it.  the onion soup was literally fantastic.  four little tasting cups come per serving.  ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> was good, but heavy on dressing, so fish flavor was a little lost.  the rock shrimp and noodles were very spicy. my husband felt the shrimp were overcooked--i thought it was ok.  chimichurri flank steak was amazing-the silky chimichurri on marinated grass fed flank served medium rare was outstanding.  the charcuterie plate was delicious and portion was huge!  my husband got the short ribs, and he loved them.  delicate and wonderful hearts of palm salad.  the tossed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> was also yummy. my husband had two glasses of wine, i had the cocktail flight (three fruity mini martinis).  they were sweet and string, presented beautifully.   they brought us 7 desserts (an extra for our anniversary), of which we ate about one bit each because we were stuffed. best of all, service was unbelievably good.  our main waitress packed food for us without asking (at a high end restaurant, where i would have been embarrassed to ask for that). we had a great time, and would go back in a flash.  total bill $227 (alcohol was about $50, and the extra entree was $42).   to think that for $115 you could get all of that food, at that quality, with that service, is unbelievable.", 
            "we came here to try the tapas menu that has recently been offered. there is a tall poster type thing in front of fleur de lys that advertises this menu. it's extremely well-priced. example $6 for 4 shot glasses of their amazing truffle onion soup, $12 for 2 sliders with fries, $6-8 for truffle popcorn. to eat at such prices at a hubert keller restaurant...quite a steal i would say. if you choose to partake in the tapas menu, there is separate seating outside the restaurant as well as in the bar/cocktail area which are both very nice. \n\nlet me start with the good:\n\nloved the people watching while waiting for our food. i hardly venture out onto the strip and when i do my primary enjoyment stems from watching fashion disasters, unknowing tourists and stereotyped \"vegas types.\" i know...it's awful but i can't help myself. \n\nthe service was great...the bartender served us for most of our meal and she was great. the manager even came to clear our plates. \n\nthe food: hearts of palm salad with a pistachio cream was divine, the manchego cheese mixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> was the perfect mix of shaved smooth cheese, tart dressing, crisp greens and a sweet garlicky and raisin topping, the truffle onion soup (as always) was rich, creamy and had a delicacy that was perfect. we ordered the mushroom risotto to share from the dinner menu which was also very tasty with a generous helping of woody wild mushrooms. the desert of passion fruit sorbet with coconut tapioca (boba) soup was also a hit. refreshing would best describe it\n\ntapas pricing was very very reasonable. the passion fruit sorbet in the coconut soup was $5 for an order that easily fed 2 people, 4 shotglasses of truffle onion soup was $6, $8 for the mixed green and manchego cheese salad and for people who eat meat, the meat based tapas were also just as reasonable. \n\nnow the bad:\n\nfalse advertising: the tapas menu outside the restaurant mentions that the hearts of palm salad is on the tapas menu. it was not. when inside, the waitress tells us the menu has been changed and that the palm salad had been taken off. we had to order it from the a la carte menu for $16. not fun. a lot of why we even went for the tapas menu was based on the hearts of palm salad which is a favorite of ours\n\ni genuinely dislike businesses that lure people in with an advert and then do a turnaround when they've got you all seated and your drinks ordered. it was fairly easy to correct the menu outside or honor that menu when we asked about it. fleur de lys did neither. \n\nwe ended up spending $120 for tapas (2 cocktails) including tip. that was a bit more than i thought we were in for. partly because we ordered 2 orders of the palm salad from the a la carte menu and because there were so few vegetarian options that we had to order a dish off the main menu again (risotto). i was not a happy camper (especially when i thought i was embarking on an austerity drive). \n\ni'll give it to these guys, they make a mean meal....amazing food but they really need to work on sprucing up their tapas menu and consistency in advertising especially since they're trying to move to an all-tapas type restaurant in the near future (per the manager). a bump down to 3 stars for our multiple shocks tonight. \n\nps. another shout-out for the service here. the bartender serving us (forgot to get her name) was very personable.", 
            "went on the cheap and did the $55 prix fixe with $25 bottle of wine. really great value. for course 1 had onion soup and mixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark>. its hard to wow on a basic salad but did they ever. it was the best dinner salad i've ever had, just so fresh and tender with heirloom tomatoes and great dressing and huge. soup was good but smallish and rich. had salmon and short rib, both very good. simple but delicious. trio of chocolate was incredible.", 
            "delish! the small plates here are fantastic. we ordered some dishes to share:\n\n-<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> (really good, we ordered another round)\n-<mark>Field Green Salad</mark>\n-rock shrimp (comes with rice noodles, delicious)\n-chicken wings\n-sliders\n\nall the food was delicious. the sangria is excellent as well. my only complaint is that their small plates really are not enough for a meal with multiple people. it's perfect for a snack and cocktails.", 
            "the restaurant is now just \"fleur\".... no longer fleur de lys, located inside the mandalay bay hotel.   fleur means flower in french, but the decor seems to be reminiscent of rustic modern, something you can find in colorado or minnesota.  the only \"flower\" i see at the entire place is the cut orchids placed in a glass container.\n\ninstead of indulging in a huge steak dinner, h and i decided to give this place a try for their sampling menu.  as crazy as it sounds, but they offer a tasting menu called the \"feast\" that's meant to serve min of 6 people for $450, but large parties of 10 people have proclaimed that they cannot finish this on their own.  \n\nmini bites:\nthe <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> ($14) were amazing!  the jalapeno on top gives it a spicy kick and the ahi was seasoned perfectly.\n\nshort ribs ($26)\nah, the price tag was a bit steep considering the size, but well worth it.  braised for many hours, it was so soft and juicy and oozing with flavor.  my fav dish of the night.\n\nnampol's wings ($9)\nnot too novel in taste or presentation, but tasty indeed.\n\nceviche ($14)\nnot your typical shrimp ceviche.  i tasted oysters sitting atop a bed of guacamole.  the chips were fried perfectly and had a crunchy crisp.\n\nmixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> ($10)  of course you need to fulfill that recommended serving of veggies for the day.\n\nalmond panna cotta dessert ($10)\nalmond cake with blackberry kalamansi sorbet.  this dish was not too sweet for a dessert.  it actually was a bit tart, which was a perfect complement to my sweet cocktails.\n\nlibations:\nfleur <mark>Red Sangria</mark> (carafe is $35)\nwow, really one of the best sangria h and i ever had.  made from malbec and brandy infused with fresh fruits and spice.   it really creeps up on you, too.\n\ndecadent flight ($18 for trio of 3 cocktails)\nwhite chocolate, chocolate coconut, and expresso martini.  \nreally tastes like a dessert, a little bit sweet, but the presentation was gorgeous.  my fav of the 3 was the white chocolate.  however, i would order this again just bc i love the diversity of flavors.  after all, this is a \"tasting menu\" type of establishment, isn't it?\n\nservice:\nwas questionable at first, but when we requested a new server, the night turned out ten times better!   \n\none of the best dining experiences of our entire trip.  highly recommend!", 
            "i really wanted to use restaurant week as an opportunity to try out some of the pricier restaurants that i wouldn't normally visit. perusing the $20 lunch options, most seemed like pretty standard stuff (read: lots of burgers). i happened on the menu for fleur:\nplace i would normally never visit? check.\ninteresting menu i wouldn't normally order? check.\n$20 lunch option? check.\nok, sounds like a done deal.\n\nwe walk in and the hostess is a little cold about seating a party of 6 for lunch and suggests we could just \"pull some tables together in the lounge.\" no thanks, can we please sit at a normal height table? not to worry, though, we got our normal height table and our waiter was awesome. tragedy averted. (plus points for being totally cool with our six-month old).\n\nambiance inside is pretty cool. the booths are separated by these flowy curtain things and the wine cellar is actually up on a second floor, looking down over the dining area. nice.\n\nthey had a nice selection of specialty drinks which we did not sample, although i might be back for happy hour, since it's 2 for 1 from 3-6pm. we did get a carafe of sangria, which was tasty, but perhaps not worth the price tag.\n\nnow for the food! the restaurant week special was seriously awesome. the first course was a <mark>Field Green</mark> salad with cheese croutons. just a salad, i know, but very deliciously prepared. the main course was short rib lasagna, and i wasn't too excited about it, but it was sooo good. the beef was tender and flavorful, the noodles perfect, the cheese mild but added a great flavor to the dish. plus, the baby carrots were delicious. i could have eaten like 4 of these things, no joke. then dessert. i gave myself a 1-meal reprieve from my ban of sweets in honor of restaurant week, and it was definitely worth it. the dessert was a pot de creme with bourbon foam and cookie, which i found out means \"fancy chocolate pudding.\" great texture, the bourbon foam added the tiniest hint of tartness (or whatever the flavor of bourbon is), and the cookie was delicious, with a light not-too-sweet cream filling. it was served in a mini mason jar, so extra points for presentation.\n\nif the review stopped there, i would grade fleur five stars, but my husband was not in the mood for the lunch special, and instead got an italian sandwich. who would order such a thing at fleur, you may ask? well, i know of only one person. the sandwich was fine, but it was still just a regular sandwich. $18 was pretty steep, so i have to assume the rest of the menu is pretty pricey, too.", 
            "came here for lunch on a weekday- so my review is based on lunch, not dinner.  \n\ni thought the items we ordered were good.  \n\n\"in the shower\" mac & cheese: cheese sauce is smooth, small chunks of lobster, nice crumbly crust on top  \nsteak frites: crust on steak is black and salty, fries have an interesting extra flavor (maybe they're fried in fat instead of oil?) \n\nas i said before, everything was good but not out of this world amazing.  our waiter was very honest when we asked him what he recommended.  according to him, you shouldn't order the <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark> or the <mark>Field Green</mark> salad because you can get that anywhere.  also, he said that the cuban sandwich is plain, as is the vegetable sandwich.  so if you come here, i would avoid those items!", 
            "with all the good reviews of this place, i found it quite below average... sorry, you get a fail.  first i got the wrong salad (arugula) but it was decent (wanted the <mark>Field Green</mark>). i ordered a local craft beer (red hydrant), but it was $14 and really more of an irish red and it tasted very euro (so it was poorly labeled).  i got the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, that were tiny, yet very good, even though the corn taco shell dominated the overall flavor.\ni ordered the braised short ribs, that was really just a giant rib (as in only one big one). it was not that good, and it's really hard to screw up short ribs. it also had this weird foam on top of it that looked like a fuzzy mold. the parsnip puree had a very weird texture. that was poor, d+ but i ate the whole thing...\nthe wild mushrooms were terrible. they had no flavor, nor even tasted like anything was added to them, other than the earthy natural flavor... the polenta wasn't bad, but boring!   \nwe passed on three other restaurants for this place?  dang!", 
            "was attending a conference at the mandalay bay conference center and was looking for a place to meet with an old friend. fleur, located inside the mandalay bay casino, was a relatively quick walk from the conference center and looked pleasant enough so i  made a reservation via opentable (although it was not busy enough that i needed a reservation).\n\ni had the \"la scala's <mark>Greek Style Chopped</mark>\" salad with chicken.  essentially a romaine salad with soppressata, mozzarella, olives and beans in a vinaigrette.  i added a bit of extra protein by adding an organic <mark>Roasted Chicken Breast</mark>.  my friend had their <mark>Field Green</mark> salad (which included pear, apple and walnuts) and topped it with shrimp (note that the extra price for the shrimp was a bit outrageous, as the shrimp \"add on\" costs only $1 less than the salad itself).  she enjoyed her salad and shrimp.  i also enjoyed my salad, which was a healthy size, with the exception of the chicken.  clearly tasting like it was cooked hours in advance (or perhaps even a day in advance), it was refrigerator cold and completely dry.  i could have had chicken that tasted like that at the convention center; i had expected more from a  restaurant bearing mr. keller's name. although bread is not included, if you ask they will bring some pretty yummy rolls.  should have asked for another batch...they were that good.\n\none interesting affectation:  while the menu is presented printed on a large sheet of paper, the wine and drink list consists of an ipad that the waiter plopped in the center of the table while we were browsing the menu.  perhaps the restaurant feels that using an ipad for drinks looks \"cool and hip,\" or perhaps their wine and drink list change by the hour or minute, making a printed list too problematic. either way, i would suggest that they either give us the menu and drink list in the ipad, or give them to us on paper.  but don't try to hedge your \"coolness\" bets by using both formats.  that's just my $.02 worth."

            "well i'm really disappointed with this place and food especially. i have read lots bout hubert (chef) and this place before coming here and was very excited to taste top notch food from such a famous french chef. we had few things to share as we wanted get a really good taste. 1. warm halloumi cheese with <mark>Grilled Vegetable</mark>- yes the cheese was good and grilled but served on a bed of mixed greens with tons!!! of balsamic vinegar!!!! which almost burned my mouth (vinegar) which took over and killed taste of veggies and cheese. chef- easy with that balsamic or just simple don't used it at all!!! \n2. stuffed peppers with quinoa - no taste at all. very blended and definitely missing a taste! \n3. shrimp and grits - no taste at all again. the shrimp were marinated in something that really doesn't have a taste at all. very blended and missing a taste again! \n4. wild mushroom ragout- oh my! my grandma cooks better wild mushrooms with butter than that dish. yes mushrooms were fresh but once again no taste and leading  composition. \ni'm a person who very barely use salt&pepper on any dish as i expect to be cooked without a need to use it and always thought it is a slap to a chef when people use salt&pepper on anything but mushrooms really needed a hint of both to save some sort of a taste. \nafter that dish we gave up and did not order more plates to taste (as we planned to do ) and asked for a check. \nservice was good and that star belongs to our server! \np.s. decor of this place was very confusing to me too. i think someone just lost an idea how this place should look like leather bulky chairs with embroidery? no!!!"

(mind you it is super slow and the next closest restaurant was like 10 steps away)! the waiter gave me attitude, couldn't even pack my lunch and couldn't be happier for us to leave! i don't know if he knows this but he's in a customer service industry! i used to be a server, i barely bugged them the whole time i ate there. unappreciative. wolf gang puck next door, wayyyyyy better and worth the vegas experience. i ordered basically every other item on the menu. burgers were dried, my <mark>Wagyu Hot Dog</mark> pretzel bun was hard. presentation was pretty but it doesn't make up for the bad service. it gives everyone a bad taste i their mouth!",

            "i got a comp for a 5-course dinner experience for two with a personalized menu at fleur, so i was super excited to come here on our most recent vegas trip.\n\nhowever, for such an extravagant dinner, i left with a couple disappointments:\n\ndisappointment #1:\nby \"personalized menu\", all it really means is that the chef comes to your table before you order and asks if you have any food allergies or distastes.  i said that i didn't like exotic meats such as lamb or deer, and the chef said it wasn't a problem since they don't have those meats in the kitchen anyway.  as a fine dining restaurant, i'd expect them to have a fancier selection.\n\ndisappointment #2: \nbecause you don't really get to choose your food, i ended up getting items that i probably wouldn't have ordered normally...aka foods that didn't tickle my fancy.  this included bland, boiled kale and veggies in a liquid soup which got soggy after sitting a while, a huge bowl of weird mushrooms that had a funny smell and taste, and a salad with an almost poached, almost raw egg on it.  i probably only ate a few pieces of each, and felt bad wasting the rest :(.  also, because i didn't know what was coming out next, my stomach wasn't prepared.  i was pretty much full after course #3.\n\nmy meal:\n\ncourse 0.5: raw oyster in a ponzu sauce under a bed of dry ice\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q\nrefreshing, delicious, and extra presentation points for keeping it on the dry ice!\n\ncourse 1: potato soup, asian slaw, crab cake\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#qccymqr7r2nrb58nfsljeg\nprobably my favorite course.  the potato soup was so rich and creamy and was made with a touch of truffle oil.  the slaw wasn't anything special, but a good refreshing counter to its adjacent rich foods.  the crab cake was also awesome: crispy on the outside, soft and flaky on the inside, with tons of real crab meat.  i could have had another couple plates of just the soup and crab cake for the meal and would be so happy!\n\ncourse 2: spinach salad with poached(?) egg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#3ko-o6wh-vqfsd27b-fcsw\nthe spinach and its dressing was actually very good with a light, sweet, creamy dressing that didn't overpower the hearty greens.  however, i absolutely despise runny egg yolks, so i had to make sure i didn't pop the egg while eating my greens.  when i was almost done with the salad, it broke on its own and i was done with the dish right then.\n\ncourse 3: surf and turf: salmon and steak\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#w9bbwd7c8mabiw_fkfqe0a\npredictable flavors, but still good.  both the salmon and the steak were very tender and moist.  my only complaint here was there was no starch to pair it with!  i ended up ordering a loaf of bread, since they apparently don't sell rice.\n\ncourse 4: braised beef with espresso foam, side mushrooms and boiled kale/veggies\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#hbd3rqxwlxf4ipheembj4w\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#voytnj-dk<mark>Blt</mark>38jacw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#onahfbyanlevg5x0anorwa\nthis was the \"weird mushrooms\" and \"bland boiled kale/veggies\" that i mentioned above.  i was pretty much full after course #3, so i couldn't really enjoy this dish to its fullest, but the braised beef was one of my favorite things of the night!  sooo tender, flavorful, and the espresso foam gave it that extra somethin' somethin'!  it sat on a bed of mashed potatoes (finally!!!! starch!!!!).  even though i was full, i ate most of the beef and potatoes...\n\ncourse 5: chocolate cream puffs and pineapple/cream parfait\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#wcpwbn9nyecthewb34b9hw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#zuta5knekhl0lu_s92euga\nso by now, i was over and beyond stuffed.  not really much of a dessert person, i let myself relish one chocolate cream puff, which was actually pretty good.  the chocolate was rich and decadent, poured over the puff dough, and between the two puff halves was vanilla bean gelato!  yum!\n\ni must admit, it was a very tasty meal.  some items were not ones i would order again, but that's how it is with a surprise menu i suppose.  i think i enjoyed the meal a lot more because i got it for free, but i don't think i would pay the actual value to eat here again."

            "awesome that this should be my first five star review. maybe it's a celebrity chef sorta thing, but i've been wanting to try this place out since top chef masters. yeah... maybe i'm a sucker for these sorta things and hey, hubert keller probably doesn't even cook there... but hey, the food was excellent!\n\ni went here with my girlfriend to celebrate five months together. i had found gift certificates on restaurant.com and i thought, hey, why not?\n\nwe arrived on time to our 9:00pm reservation all dressed up and were seated immediately in a swank dining room with some mood music and between black curtains. upon sitting down, though, we realized we had forgotten our gift certificate. luckily i still had the email on my phone... but would they accept it? i asked our server the next time she came 'round and she wasn't sure, but she would ask her manager. sure enough... it looked like they wouldn't take it. =/ oh well... stuff like this happens.\n\nwe decided to both go for the elegance menu as it would mean 8 different dishes between the two of us for $79/person. the entrees were around $50 a la carte and the apps were around $20... so, why not do the prix fixe? \n\nafter some delicious bread (rosemary foccacia and honey wheat rolls), we got our amuse busche - tempura cod and potato salad with cayanne creme fraiche. it was pretty cute - sorta like a play on <mark>Fish and Chips</mark> =) \n\nand remember when the manager came by and said he wouldn't take our coupon off email? well, he came back and suggested something else - if i could send the confirmation email to him, he would print it out and apply it for us. really? really. awesome! there's another star right there!\n\nthe rest of the night just went up from there. here are the highlights:\n\n1st course:\ntruffled onion  soup with braised duck ragout- my girlfriend definitely won this one. the soup was amazingly creamy and delicious and the duck inside the crepe was just money. *drool*\nahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> - this one was alright. i think i've had better tartares before... the fennel was definitely a little different and was good, but not my favorite flavor, i think.\n\n2nd course:\ncitrus glazed halibut - the halibut was alright, but what really blew me away was the broccoli puree. i haven't had purees much... i usually don't eat at such fancy places... but this stuff blew my mind. it tasted so freakin' good... like pure essence of broccoli. how the heck did they do that?!\nbraised veal and yukon gold potato ravioli - this one came out pretty good, too. the potato inside the ravioli was so flavorful... \n\n3rd course:\nfilet mignon + foie gras and truffles - this was probably the best cooked piece of meat i've ever eaten - perfectly medium rare - it practically melted in my mouth... and the foie gras... the first time i've had that and the stuff just melted over the meat... so freakin' delicious. i'm usually not a fan of liver, but this stuff was just like butter. paired with the filet, it was amazing. totally worth the extra $25. the mashed potatoes (which was more like a puree) was equally delicious.\nstout braised beef short ribs - these were really good, too. i have to say that the mustard was my favorite part about it - but again, some of the most tender and well cooked meat i've ever had.\n\ndessert - \nchocolate souffle - not too shabby.... not a huge chocolate fan, but my girlfriend loved it.\ncarrot and cream cheese ice cream sandwich - carrot cake is great, but this went beyond simple carrot cake. it was simply heavenly. the carrot-pineapple ice cream they served it with was sweet, but not overly so. and i absolutely loved the raspberry jam smeared on the side of the ice cream sandwich. *drool* i think if i only had the filet and this for dinner, i would've been completely satisfied.\n\nwe were also served a complimentary anniversary dessert - a play on cheesecake with scripted \"happy anniversary\" in chocolate. i'm tellin' yah, service here is tops!\n\nwe were also served a petit four at the end, which came with five little dessert pieces. i think the actual desserts we had were much better... but all the little extras were great =)\n\nall in all, some of the best food we've ever had and excellent service. i sorta wish i took pictures, but i didn't want to look tacky doing it in the dark dining room =p this place is well deserving of my first five star review - and i will definitely want to try the one closer to home some time in the near future =)", 
            "i had really high expectations for fleur.  i'm a big fan of hubert keller and had recently eaten at burger bar and really enjoyed my experience there.  so, i was really looking forward to an excellent food experience at fleur.  from the start, i was mildly disappointed.  the hostess wasn't very friendly, and the restaurant itself had an overly  casual bar feel to it.  it was also loud for a while because there was a live band playing just across the way.  the menu of small and large plates is huge with many exciting options, but  unfortunately many fell flat for me.  the lobster mac and cheese was way too mild and not very flavorful.  the duck was really tender but could have used more zing to the flavors.  the accompanying braised veggies ( rhubarb, celery, <mark>Fish and Chips</mark> onion) were not appetizing at all - they looked limp and were oily and flavorless.  my favorite was the garlic fries which were incredibly rich due to the truffle oil.  the service was inconsistent.  drinks were not refilled after the first refill, and it took an unexpectedly long time for extra things that were requested (e.g., lime) to be brought to the table.  the serviced really dropped off toward the end of the meal when we felt a bit overlooked.  there also seemed to be problems with expediting the food in a reasonable time period.  even though all the dishes don't need to come out at the same time, we had to wait so long for our last plate (the truffle fries) that we thought they had forgotten about them.   while this wasn't a horrible dining experience, it was a bit frustrating because i had such high hopes for hubert keller's food, and the flavors just weren't there.  but then again, i fear that fleur may just be one of those trendy vegas places where the chef puts his name on it but doesn't leave his mark anywhere else.",

            "this review pertains to their a la carte dining (please see below for tapas/top chef menu reviews)\n\nthe skinny: had the best chicken dish in a long time - it was slightly ridiculous how good it was! but trust me... don't order the duck (4), service - i think our server was not as good as some of the others (3), value - pretty good - gave us 2 free dishes (3).\n\nokay, i know this is my 2nd review update in the space of a month but i gotta get it while it's good and still open. plus, both my hubby's and my birthdays fall within a month of each other so it's okay to be a little on the splurging side.\n\nnormally, we either go for a nice prix fixe menu - more affordable and more complete experience. however, everytime we see something on the a la carte menu that piques our interests. so this time, we came armed with a $50 restaurant.com coupon and bit the bullet.\n\nwe ordered the organic beet salad, the foie gras tasting 3 ways, the organic chicken, the peking duck and finally, an almond panna cotta.\n\nagain, an amuse bouche of fried cod and potato salad which was very good (like our previous visit).\n\nthe foie gras was served in three preparations with brioche - a foie gras cappucino, a foie gras seared with a fruit compote and a foie gras terrine. the cappucino was very smooth, lusciously foamy and really accented the true flavour of the foie. the seared preparation with fruite compote was a classic and well prepared. the terrine was wonderful as well. my only complaint about the dish was it could have used more warm brioche to go with the foie gras.\n\nthe organic beet salad with poached quail egg and ham was okay. for 6-7 small cubes of beets, each topped with a fleck of microgreen, with 4 quail eggs with a sliver of ham - $19 seemed overpriced. although the presentation was astounding, i prefer their mixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> with polenta. disappointingly, it was the only salad option on the a la carte appetizer menu.\n\nwe both received a free 1/2 sized portion of the halibut entree. the halibut was seared perfectly - wonderful crust - but unfortunately was a little bland in the middle portion of the fish. the accompanying sweet corn/fava bean succotash was delightful.\n\nthe peking duck was a rather large disappointment. when you tell an asian that you're making peking duck - that skin better be crispy. and crispy it ain't. although the duck breast was well-cooked, the skin was nothing like peking duck. the cloyingly saccharine sauce on top really overpowered that dish. paired with a tough, overcooked foie gras on the bottom, you have a culinary mess on your hands.\n\nthat being said, the roast chicken dish was the best chicken dish i have had in a long time. the roasted chicken skin was so wonderfully crisp and seasoned and i savoured each bite (i normally remove the skin entirely). the moisture and texture of the meat was amazing.\n\ni have to admit - i was a little skeptical about when i saw foam covering the <mark>Roasted Chicken Breast</mark>. with so many restaurants using foam, it's become a bit of a cliche. but i understand why this technique was used in this case - the foam added that wonderful umami flavour of truffle without compromising the wonderful texture of the crisp chicken skin. the accompanying morel mushroom and cabbage completed this wonderfully well envisioned and balanced package of a dish.\n\nthe almond panna cotta was good but not astounding. the flavour combinations were wonderful if only the panna cotta had a better texture. to quote nigella lawson: [panna cotta should have] \"the quiver of a 17th century courtesan's inner thigh\". it was a little too solid for our tastes and not quite as silky smooth as other preparations we've enjoyed in the past. \n\nof note, we were not offered petit fours at the end of our meal this evening unlike our previous prix fixe menu experience.\n\noverall, a great meal with some highs and lows and the bill came to around $125 tip and tax (discounting the cost of the $50 coupon).", 
            "we came to fleur for lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices at this high-end eatery. my review is really more of a 3.5-star, but i'm rounding up because it is still better than a 3-star. i would have given it a 4.5-star review if it were not for the less-than stellar service.\n\nthe food was very good. we started with the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>. they were little bites of heaven. the ahi tuna was very fresh and all of the flavors combined worked perfectly. the portion size on this appetizer was very small, but it was not very expensive, so i give it a pass.\n\ni also had the chicken sandwich with fries. the <mark>Roasted Chicken Breast</mark> was moist and the pesto and ancho sauce used as spreads made this sandwich very interesting. the fries were nice and crispy. \n\nthe hubs had the hk burger. it had a good taste, but it was dry. he ordered his burger medium, but they gave it to him essentially well-done.\n\nthe server was inattentive and cold. frankly, everyone at this restaurant was. he never introduced himself and the first words out of his mouth were, \"so what do you want to order?\" he did not offer refills and really only came back to drop off the check. we expected service of a higher caliber at a keller joint.\n\nso yeah, this review is mainly on the food, so approach with caution if service is a deal-breaker for you...", 
            "i came here with a group of 30, so we were forced into a predetermined menu with only two options. that was the first mistake.\n\nthe restaurant itself is gorgeous, and the service is impeccable. their bartender makes fantastic drinks, and the wine selection is excellent.\n\nit was the food that bothered me:\n\nthe appetizer was a risotto with scallion, lemon and basil - the risotto was very nicely prepared, but it was nothing mind-blowing.\n\nfor the mains, we had a choice between braised short ribs with honey, coriander, glazed carrot and warm potato salad, or <mark>Roasted Chicken Breast</mark> with wild mushrooms and cabbage fricassee. i opted for the latter, which i regret. the chicken was dry and mostly tasteless. the wild mushroom and cabbage fricassee was actually quite tasty, but was not enough to make up for the lackluster chicken. i had a sampling of the short rib, and while nothing special, it was certainly better than the chicken.\n\nthe dessert was some form of chocolatey balls on a stick, but i don't have much of a recollection, as the evening got pretty hazy, and the dessert changed from what was originally sent to us. it was good, but again, nothing mind-blowing.\n\nthe coffee at the end was served lukewarm, and this was noticed by everyone who ordered espresso. that was entirely unacceptable, but we had to get going, and i didn't have time to replace it.\n\nother than the fantastic service, i can't say i was convinced of the food quality, though i'd like to check it out and order off the actual menu, rather than a two-choice cookie-cutter group menu.", 
            "came here for brunch on sunday. this was exactly what we needed after a weekend in vegas and before our drive back to la. the decor is simple but elegant looking, darker tones and woods. our  waiter here was so nice and attentive. \n\nhangover angus short rib benedict // this is amazing!! it's definitely on the heavier side but great for a hangover. lots of pulled short rib on top of thick crispy round hash brown potato cakes (instead of the usual english muffin). the egg on top was poached perfectly. \n\nroasted organic <mark>Roasted Chicken Breast</mark> // generous portion of <mark>Roasted Chicken Breast</mark> on top of a red quinoa salad that is mixed with a fresh light vinaigrette. this was yummy as well and a good choice for a lighter option.\n\nwe also ordered bloody mary's which are build-your-own style. the bartender wheels over an impressive cart that has various types of vodka, the bloody mary mix, and a tonnnn of hot sauce options and garnishes. we were all so excited for this but the  drinks turned out kinda bleh. maybe our own fault though? haha. \n\nconclusion: bomb food, stellar service, but maybe skip the bloody mary's (especially at $18 each).", 
            "was attending a conference at the mandalay bay conference center and was looking for a place to meet with an old friend. fleur, located inside the mandalay bay casino, was a relatively quick walk from the conference center and looked pleasant enough so i  made a reservation via opentable (although it was not busy enough that i needed a reservation).\n\ni had the \"la scala's <mark>Greek Style Chopped</mark>\" salad with chicken.  essentially a romaine salad with soppressata, mozzarella, olives and beans in a vinaigrette.  i added a bit of extra protein by adding an organic <mark>Roasted Chicken Breast</mark>.  my friend had their <mark>Field Green</mark> salad (which included pear, apple and walnuts) and topped it with shrimp (note that the extra price for the shrimp was a bit outrageous, as the shrimp \"add on\" costs only $1 less than the salad itself).  she enjoyed her salad and shrimp.  i also enjoyed my salad, which was a healthy size, with the exception of the chicken.  clearly tasting like it was cooked hours in advance (or perhaps even a day in advance), it was refrigerator cold and completely dry.  i could have had chicken that tasted like that at the convention center; i had expected more from a  restaurant bearing mr. keller's name. although bread is not included, if you ask they will bring some pretty yummy rolls.  should have asked for another batch...they were that good.\n\none interesting affectation:  while the menu is presented printed on a large sheet of paper, the wine and drink list consists of an ipad that the waiter plopped in the center of the table while we were browsing the menu.  perhaps the restaurant feels that using an ipad for drinks looks \"cool and hip,\" or perhaps their wine and drink list change by the hour or minute, making a printed list too problematic. either way, i would suggest that they either give us the menu and drink list in the ipad, or give them to us on paper.  but don't try to hedge your \"coolness\" bets by using both formats.  that's just my $.02 worth."

            "service - 2:  i came here with a couple of friends right when the restaurant was opening up for lunch and there was only one server available.  it took almost half an hour for the waiter to take our order and then another 45 minutes to receive our food.\n\nfood - 3:  food was average - ordered the <mark>Angus Burger</mark> with chipotle aioli (the burgers come plain - cheese, dressing, and extras are considered additional toppings).  personally, i'd much rather have a burger from in-n-out.\n\n*the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were delicious, but way too small (like two bites small)."

            "dinner with the girls with mandalay vouchers credit used was a fantastic way to use it for some french cuisine. \n\nstarted with the fresh oysters topped with iced margarita  and braised mushroom hamachi. the oysters were small in size but the iced margarita complimented it well. the braised hamachi was a bite salty but fresh to the taste. \n\nnext for the entree shared the braised short ribs and <mark>Wagyu Burger</mark> with fries. the short ribs was soft and full flavor with a strong sauce to it. the wagyu was tender and juicy and cooked perfectly medium rare. \n\ndesserts we shared a creams br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e, blood orange sorbet with cookies and creme ice cream and pistachios palovou. the sorbet was like any sorbet just house made with blood orange favors. the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e was the best one. instead of serving it in a typical cup size it was serves in a long rectangular shallow dish that gave you extra crispy carmel with the creme in every bite. \n\nour waiter was nice he was great in helping us on deciding what's best to try and always attentive. good experience but  feels its missing something to it. maybe because it's vegas my expectations may be higher than if it was store front restaurant.", 
            "actually, 3.5 stars, but that's not possible. $50 restaurant.com coupon ($100 minimum spend) brought us her. i have been to fleur de lys in sf and loved it - beautiful setting; beautiful experience. this place is drop-dead gorgeous. aside: what's up with the painting of the partially be-headed vegas bimbo? was it ironic juxtaposition in such a \"fancy\" place? not quite sure about that one... anyway, space is pretty to look at, but the service is only so-so, and the food was a bit uneven in execution. overall, this place was good, but not great. the food:\n\n* onion soup shooters - rich, creamy, sublime! no idea how they squeezed so much flavor out of something as simple and humble as an onion. knock-out!\n* tuna taco - perfectly executed and delicious, but a bit of a let-down after the onion soup shooters. \n* roasted duck - easily one of the best duck dishes i've ever had. the daikon accompanying it was expert and just under being \"too\" salty - perfection. husband said it tasted like a teriyaki gummy bear, but that's another story...loved it!\n* polenta w/ corn - rich, creamy, and the perfect foil for the duck.\n* <mark>Wagyu Burger</mark> - can we just call a time-out on the kobe burgers? i'm officially over this over-priced, over-hyped menu item. part of the problem was that it was on the wrong side of \"medium\" - overcooked and dry. should have asked for medium rare, but shouldn't an attentive waiter gently corrected my husband when he asked for it medium? they have in the past. in any case, this was the main reason for the 3 instead of 4-star. also, the \"pomme frites\" that seemed to be roasted fingerlings cut in half. fine, but not pomme frites.\n* cheesecake - delicious and expertly plated. nice way to end the evening.", 
            "i was very disappointed as i had expected more from a keller restaurant. we ordered two dirty martinis with olives - we asked for stuffed blue cheese olives which they didn't have (in vegas???) and they weren't very dirty.\n\nto the food: my wife had the <mark>Wagyu Burger</mark> - she very much enjoyed this and also the fries. i ordered from the small plates the steak tatar and the herb crusted snails. the tatar was somewhat lacking in proper seasoning so i give that 3 stars. the snails were lacking in anything that could be called herbs and i would rate them 2 stars.\n\nthe wines list was unrealistically expensive - a $10 retail priced wine was listed for $50! the atmosphere reminded me of a sports bar - quite dark and uninviting.\n\nthe bottom-line: we do not recommend this one. our 3 stars were based heavily on my wife's <mark>Wagyu Burger</mark>.", 
            "my girlfriend and i shared the peking duck, garlic fries and fleur burger w/ foie gras and truffle.\n\nthe fleur burger was amazing.  i've never had foie gras or kobe but it tasted amazing. have never had truffles before this either but they were mushroomy, but didn't seem amazing.  overall though the strength of the <mark>Wagyu Burger</mark> with foie gras on a brioche bun was amazing.\n\nthe peking duck was a disappointment. it was $27 or so and imo overpriced. it was not peking duck.  i guess it was under the \"french\" section, and not chinese, so i don't know what i was expecting.  but it wasn't anywhere near as good as the chinese version and overpriced.  there didn't seem to be any skin on it, and it was just boring, which at $27 for a 5oz breast or whatever seems criminal.", 
            "a group of us decided to dine at the bar vs getting a table.  the restaurant sits in an open area of the mandalay bay, so expect a loud environment towards the front of the place.  being that this is hubert keller's spot, expect to pay for the food you get, if you're on a budget, don't bother walking in here (nor any other restaurant in a big label casino in las vegas).  regardless, i went with the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> and the <mark>Wagyu Burger</mark>.  the tacos had some issues to me as the shell was thick and i just lost everything else inside.  the slice of ahi was thicker than i had thought, which was a nice surprise.  but unfortunately the overall taco was not that great.  there was a longer gap before the entrees came out, but it didn't stop me from really enjoying the <mark>Wagyu Burger</mark>.  the patty itself was delicious and cooked to a perfect medium.  you can really tell a good patty apart by the consistency of the meat and fleur hit it right on.  the potatoes on the side were a nice complement.  not sure if i'd come back here, but it was a nice dining experience.  prices are a tad high for what they serve, but again, it's hubert keller's restaurant in one of vegas' nicer hotels.", 
            "i came to try the praised <mark>Wagyu Burger</mark> with foie gras and truffle. i was really hoping to be blown away, even just a little breeze, nothing. i even made a point to eat slowly so i could savor everything. \n\ni could barely even taste the truffle, might as well have been any other minced up mushroom. this was my first time having foie gras and i still feel i didn't get the best piece, it was mostly just fat tasting (like chicken fat or any other meat fat) and there was one tiny bite where i could taste a hint of liver flavor which was good. \n\nthe meat patty itself literally tasted like average beef that anyone could cook up at home, not wagyu, not black angus, not anything. i truly felt insulted and i almost complained about it if i hadn't had a coupon to save a bit (which i purposely showed at the end of the meal so they had no way of knowing i had one earlier to maybe skimp on quality). overall not worth $70 for this burger, not worth even half that much. my boyfriend had a hanger steak which i tasted and his was good quality as expected, the garlic fries that came with it were some of the best i've ever had though, that's what saved this place from 1 star.\n\none thing that also bugged me a bit was that the average drink glasses were the smallest i've ever seen, it was literally for a child, all i had was soda and had to wait to get multiple refills because of the tiny size. hubert keller, get some actual wagyu or better quality beef because people can taste the difference. no compliments to the chef.", 
            "went for a lunch around 1:30-it was still busy but we only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. then we waited another 10 minutes before we saw our waiter (tyler) and received some water. we both ordered the <mark>Wagyu Burger</mark>-medium well. one was cooked well but not exactly piping hot-it had clearly been sitting out. the other burger was more rare and was sent back. neither had the caramelized onions we ordered. once the order was fixed it was fine but the service was definitely not up to par. not really worth your time or money!", 
            "at a conference and had an hour for lunch.  waited close to 40 minutes for <mark>Wagyu Burger</mark> which came out well done, not medium. had no time to complain just gobbled it down since i needed to get back to conference.  others at bar waited close to an hour...they need to fix their line cooks and could use an expediter.  bartender was trapped with no way to check orders - not good.  hopefully this was just a glitch today but i would give yourself plenty of time to enjoy the experience.", 
            "everything at fleur is made just right!  the salads have a refreshing flavor while the <mark>Wagyu Burger</mark> was delicious!  top these off with some sangria and chocolate dessert lollipops and you're good to go!  excellent and friendly service as well!  be back soon!", 
            "for the price, this was one of the most disappointing meals i have ever paid for. i got the <mark>Wagyu Burger</mark> with added avocado. while the beef was cooked well, the avocado was rotten and ruined the whole burger. on top of that, the mushrooms were cold. the bacon was also cold, and under cooked. also, talk about sticker shock when i got the check and found that soda refills were not free.  we only ordered diet soda and it came to over $20 for three people. the only reason i am giving this place two stars is that the fries are really good.", 
            "pricey and just average. had the $23 <mark>Wagyu Burger</mark> and really was just average. maybe if it cost $16 would have been better but once a burger crosses the twenty mark then it should be spectacular. also had the white onion soup and was surprised that it was sweet. don't really recommend this place and falls in line with the other mediocre restaurants at mandalay."

            "had an early dinner here with my family. we bridged the lunch and dinner menus because we wanted to try a few things from each. we started with the onion soup shooters, burrata, and brie flamb\\u00e9. the burrata was a large portion of light, fluffy cheese, though a little firmer than i'm used to. still, accompanied by a nice crostini and tomatoes with balsamic, it was lovely. the brie was decent. my family enjoyed it more than i did, but i'm not a huge brie fan. the onion soup shooters were the favorite of the table, with the four of us, from my five year old on up trying to get one more sip. \n\nat this point, the adults ordered drinks. i had the cherry limeade, which is made with cherry vodka, lime juice and black cherry pur\\u00e9e. it was easily the best mixed drink i've had in my life. my husband had the sumo, which was just okay, and kept sneaking sips of my drink. we ordered another cherry limeade to split. my ten year old ordered the steak frites, just under the wire before the switchover to the dinner menu. it was cooked to medium rare, very tender and juicy. the fries were good as well. \n\nonce it was time for the dinner menu, i had the salmon, which came with a nice dill sauce and some lightly cooked sliced cucumbers. it was delicious. my husband had the braised short ribs, which came in a larger than expected portion, soft, tender, sweet. he enjoyed it.\n\nfor dessert, we had the <mark><mark>Brownie Lollipops</mark></mark>, creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e, and panna cotta. my husband loved the panna cotta. the <mark><mark>Brownie Lollipops</mark></mark> were pretty slim on the brownie. like a cake pop, with chocolate mousse  and a thin sliver of brownie dipped in dark chocolate. the caramel sauce that accompanied it was a little skimpy, but tasty. my ten year old had the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e, which i tasted and thought was a pretty standard creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e. \n\nthe service was good, with a nicely attentive waiter and assistant refilling our waters frequently. i'll be back for another cherry limeade and onion soup shooters.", 
            "my advice would be to skip it.\n\nwe went to vegas for my sister's 25th birthday and stayed at the mandalay bay. initially i had made reservations at aureole. we were looking around at menus and found the menu at fleur to be more appetizing, so we switch at the last minute. big mistake.\n\nfirst of all, fleur is not a nice restaurant. it has no outer walls so people walking by/being loud can disrupt your meal. they also have this cheesy poster thing outside that made me feel like i was going to a random sushi restaurant in brooklyn.\n\nsecond, our waiter was probably the most awkward person i've ever encountered in a restaurant. the restaurant is tapas-style and the menu is nothing like what they have online. we ordered a bunch of tapas since we had a large lunch and were still a bit stuffed. some people in our party ordered larger tapas. we assumed they'd bring our tapas out together since well, they're tapas and meant to be shared. that was not the case. they brought out all but two dishes and we waited a really, really long time (about 30 minutes) for those two dishes. just as we were about to cancel them, our waiter said, \"oh, they are the second course.\" huh? why the heck would two people want to eat while everyone else watched? they obviously forgot about those dishes and at the last minute brought them out.\n\ni was about to refuse but my husband doesn't like me to make a scene.\n\nanyway, then when it came to the dessert portion, i expected them to bring something out for my sister since they asked me what the occasion was when i made the reservation.\n\nbut no. our awkward waiter brings out the dessert menu, asks what everyone wants (no one wanted anything, we just wanted to get out of there) and needed to be reminded by me and another person in our party that its her birthday. then he got defensive when we reminded him. awesome. she eventually got the <mark><mark>Brownie Lollipops</mark></mark>.\n\nto top it all off, there was no apology or compensation for the huge lag time between our \"first and second courses\". \n\nthis place was empty every night we passed by. in a place like vegas where fancy and delicious food is a dime a dozen, this place won't last. do yourself a favor and don't subject yourself to awkward, slow service.", 
            "i was pleasantly surprised with our first experience at fleur! our meals at other \"high end\" places in vegas were somewhat disappointing, so it was great to finally have a good meal. mandalay bay is a really gorgeous place and we sat at a high-top just outside the restaurant. the service was great - our hostess and waitress were really attentive and nice. we even caught a glimpse of hubert keller visiting a table nearby!\n\nwe started with a shot of absinthe each. we had never had it before and fleur has a wide selection, complete with table side service. if you've never tried absinthe or had the experience of them \"making\" your drink next to our table, i highly recommend it. i ended up settling on the grilled octopus small plate and my boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese small plate. my octopus was delicious! it was layered with mushrooms and a delicious pepper aioli. the mac and cheese was creamy on the bottom and crispy and breaded on top, and the shrimp inside were cooked perfectly.\n\nfor dessert, we ordered the <mark><mark>Brownie Lollipops</mark></mark> and <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark>. the lollipops were okay but the <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> was great. we would definitely go back and i would try the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> next. the menu, though not large, has a variety of dishes so there's likely something for just about everyone.",

            "our dinner at fleur was very nice  - the decor was perfect, the presentations we're well thought out and the small plate portions were reasonable to split between two people. we ordered a bunch of tapas and ate what we pleased from the vast selection.  we tried the ceasar salad, korean style beef ribs, fried chickpeas, tarte flamb\\u00e9e, chicken wings and the ceviche.  everything was good minus the ceviche (but only because i'm not a fan of raw fish - wasnt aware of this before ordering). we paired our meal with fleur's <mark>Red Sangria</mark>- which was nothing short of wonderful! we ended the night with tiramasu and the restaurant even put together a special little dessert on top of that for our anniversary.  all in all a great night to celebrate a special occassion in vegas.",

            "we love staying at mandalay bay and a quiet evening spent dining at fleur de lys always makes our vegas trip complete.\n\nthis is the second time i have eaten at fleur de lys, and it only gets better. (of course i haven't had to pay the bill which was close to $400 plus tip)\n\nthe atmosphere is wonderful and is the perfect escape from the neon lights of vegas.  dining at fleur de lys makes me feel like a queen.  i love the outstanding service and the surroundings are elegant and relaxing.\n\nduring our most recent experience the sommelier offered several suggestions to accompany our tasting menu and each was perfectly paired with the entrees.  i enjoyed a fruity pinot noir and had a few sips of a red, but stopped there since i'm not much of a drinker.\n\nthe food seemed to just keep coming and the only entree i passed on was the foie gras since i will not touch it for ethical reasons, but my dining companion said it was the best ever.\n  \nwe started with a mixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> with polenta and the truffle onion soup, both excellent.  i was almost full by the time i sampled the bread basket which was amazing in itself.  i could have eaten the pretzel bread and focaccia along with the salad and soup and been very satisfied.\n\nthe other courses included a sampling of lobster and scallops, braised beef short ribs and pan seared duck breast.  my companion also ordered a sampling of ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>.  every course had unique flavors that worked together like an orchestra performing in my mouth.  side dishes included white asparagus and fingerling fries.  although i was full i couldn't pass up tasting each dish, and my companion lucked out since they scored half my dinner.  ah, but there was a method to my madness since i was saving room for dessert.\n\nwe enjoyed a cheese sampling and fruit along with the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 and some brittle.  \n\ni can't wait to go back this spring, hopefully with my 21 year old in tow. \nfleur de lys is definitely on my short list of favorite restaurants.", 
            "this pertains to their top chef masters menu\n\nthe skinny: great execution of classic french cuisine with occasional missteps (4) service - excellent, prompt, unpretentious (4.5), value - for the top chef masters tasting menu is actually pretty good for what it's worth (only available until 7pm).\n\nwhen people ask me about where they can find great, fancy french food for a reasonable price, i would have to recommend this place (i've eaten here before but i forgot to write a review!). i am sad to see that fleur will be closing its doors in august because it is a great restaurant on the strip.\n\nmy hubby and i tried their top chef tasting menu for $65/person.\n\nthe amuse bouche was a lightly fried cod with a warm potato salad. the cod was light and crisp while the acidity from the salad accentuated the flavours of the fish. a well thought out dish.\n\ni had the mixed greens with polenta croutons while my husband had the salmon and radish salad. the mixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> was phenomenal because of the crouton. now here's the thing. i don't like croutons. i don't like polenta. but i swear to god the chef must've used some sort of magic to make those babies - such lovely texture and aroma. i could have eaten an entire plate of those. the salmon dish and the radish salad was well prepared but overall, was a little unexcitiing.\n\nsecond course was lobster mac n' cheese and the braised beef cheek with filet mignon. to be honest, the lobster mac n' cheese a miss for me. for one thing, not enough lobster flavour and the macaroni was a little more than al dente for my taste. however, it tasted wonderful regardless.\n\nthe braised beef cheek however - wow! the meat braised in five spices... one of the best beef dishes i've had in a while. i almost wished there was no filet mignon there (not because it wasn't good) because the beef cheek totally outshone it. the accompanying sides were delicious. \n\nfinally dessert - a quartet of desserts actually. the earl grey <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark>, chocolate mice mousse and the fruit marscarpone parfait were home runs. the unfortunate piece was the lemon/chocolate tart. i love lemon tarts. i love chocolate. but the two together do not work. lemons really bring out the bitterness and grainy texture of chocolate.\n\nwe were also given a lovely plate of petit fours which were not that great. again, weird flavour combinations - lemon with five spice cake (the lemon doesn't go with it at all). the other sweets were...well... too sweet.\n\nlike i said, i will be sad to see fleur de lys close its doors next month.", 
            "this review pertains to the tapas/lounge area.\n\nthe skinny: great tapas menu with excellent desserts (4.25), service: excellent, nice ambience (4) value: if you get the entire tapas menu (including dessert) for $115, it's a great deal for the quality and perfect to share amongst 3-4 people (4.5)\n\nwe went to fleur de lys tonight to share their tapas menu with 3 other friends. we got the entire tapas menu for a price of $115 - which would cost a lot more if you ordered a la carte.\n\nthe tapas menu was excellent. from the truffled onion soup to  the chacuterie plate for two, the dishes were delightful well-balanced and well-executed. the wonderful manchego mixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> had the right amount of tartness. first time for yellowtail fish sticks with tartar sauce but i have to say i'm sold! moist on the inside, wonderfully crispy on the outside. mmm.... the chacuterie plate was fantastic with the decadent pate, cured meats and artisan bread. \n\nthere were only few missteps - the truffle buttered popcorn, rock shrimp noodle salad and the ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>. the rock shrimp noodle glass noodle salad was supposed to have some sort of asian/vietnamese influence but fell short due to the noodles being too thick and gummy. the ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> was only okay and didn't really add anything new. the truffle buttered popcorn was a little bit bitter and i'm not sure why. still the truffle really came through on that dish.\n\nthe dessert portion was awesome: 3 dishes of ice cream/sorbets, 1 ice cream float, 1 lemon ice cream with angel food cake. all amazing presentations and large portion sizes - good enough to share amongst all of us.\n\nideally, it might have been a little bit better to share the entire tapas menu amongst four but it did well enough with five of us. so if you think about it, $115/5... that's less than $25 per person. it's actually more affordable if you got the entire tapas menu and split it two ways than going for their early bird prixe fixe menu (at $65/person). \n\nactually, in many ways, i felt the tapas menu tasted better than the $65 set menu. so i would recommend going here to split the tapas tasting menu (including dessert) with four people.", 
            "this review pertains to their a la carte dining (please see below for tapas/top chef menu reviews)\n\nthe skinny: had the best chicken dish in a long time - it was slightly ridiculous how good it was! but trust me... don't order the duck (4), service - i think our server was not as good as some of the others (3), value - pretty good - gave us 2 free dishes (3).\n\nokay, i know this is my 2nd review update in the space of a month but i gotta get it while it's good and still open. plus, both my hubby's and my birthdays fall within a month of each other so it's okay to be a little on the splurging side.\n\nnormally, we either go for a nice prix fixe menu - more affordable and more complete experience. however, everytime we see something on the a la carte menu that piques our interests. so this time, we came armed with a $50 restaurant.com coupon and bit the bullet.\n\nwe ordered the organic beet salad, the foie gras tasting 3 ways, the organic chicken, the peking duck and finally, an almond panna cotta.\n\nagain, an amuse bouche of fried cod and potato salad which was very good (like our previous visit).\n\nthe foie gras was served in three preparations with brioche - a foie gras cappucino, a foie gras seared with a fruit compote and a foie gras terrine. the cappucino was very smooth, lusciously foamy and really accented the true flavour of the foie. the seared preparation with fruite compote was a classic and well prepared. the terrine was wonderful as well. my only complaint about the dish was it could have used more warm brioche to go with the foie gras.\n\nthe organic beet salad with poached quail egg and ham was okay. for 6-7 small cubes of beets, each topped with a fleck of microgreen, with 4 quail eggs with a sliver of ham - $19 seemed overpriced. although the presentation was astounding, i prefer their mixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> with polenta. disappointingly, it was the only salad option on the a la carte appetizer menu.\n\nwe both received a free 1/2 sized portion of the halibut entree. the halibut was seared perfectly - wonderful crust - but unfortunately was a little bland in the middle portion of the fish. the accompanying sweet corn/fava bean succotash was delightful.\n\nthe peking duck was a rather large disappointment. when you tell an asian that you're making peking duck - that skin better be crispy. and crispy it ain't. although the duck breast was well-cooked, the skin was nothing like peking duck. the cloyingly saccharine sauce on top really overpowered that dish. paired with a tough, overcooked foie gras on the bottom, you have a culinary mess on your hands.\n\nthat being said, the roast chicken dish was the best chicken dish i have had in a long time. the roasted chicken skin was so wonderfully crisp and seasoned and i savoured each bite (i normally remove the skin entirely). the moisture and texture of the meat was amazing.\n\ni have to admit - i was a little skeptical about when i saw foam covering the <mark>Roasted Chicken Breast</mark>. with so many restaurants using foam, it's become a bit of a cliche. but i understand why this technique was used in this case - the foam added that wonderful umami flavour of truffle without compromising the wonderful texture of the crisp chicken skin. the accompanying morel mushroom and cabbage completed this wonderfully well envisioned and balanced package of a dish.\n\nthe almond panna cotta was good but not astounding. the flavour combinations were wonderful if only the panna cotta had a better texture. to quote nigella lawson: [panna cotta should have] \"the quiver of a 17th century courtesan's inner thigh\". it was a little too solid for our tastes and not quite as silky smooth as other preparations we've enjoyed in the past. \n\nof note, we were not offered petit fours at the end of our meal this evening unlike our previous prix fixe menu experience.\n\noverall, a great meal with some highs and lows and the bill came to around $125 tip and tax (discounting the cost of the $50 coupon).", 
            "omg!  so fun.  best staff ever.  my husband and i went to the fdl for our anniversary dinner last night.  they have a tapas special where you can get one of every tapas on the menu for $99.  you can also add one of every dessert for an additional $15.  i assumed that these would be amuse bouche size bites, but they were the full tapas serving (which was actually bigger than a tapas).  first, we were seated and told the waitress what we wanted.  she said that normally, they only serve tapas on the \"patio,\" but that she would check with the manager.  they were very accommodating and left us where we were.  they then stopped us from ordering two tapas tasting menus because it would be too much food.  what?  they saved us $115.  mu husband doesn't eat pork, so they offered substitutions on the two pork items for him.  the food was delicious, but very rich (as you might expect from french-influenced cuisine. truffle popcorn was amazing, huge portion, but drenched in butter, so even though it was only the second dish they brought out, we couldn't finish it.  the onion soup was literally fantastic.  four little tasting cups come per serving.  ahi <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> was good, but heavy on dressing, so fish flavor was a little lost.  the rock shrimp and noodles were very spicy. my husband felt the shrimp were overcooked--i thought it was ok.  chimichurri flank steak was amazing-the silky chimichurri on marinated grass fed flank served medium rare was outstanding.  the charcuterie plate was delicious and portion was huge!  my husband got the short ribs, and he loved them.  delicate and wonderful hearts of palm salad.  the tossed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> was also yummy. my husband had two glasses of wine, i had the cocktail flight (three fruity mini martinis).  they were sweet and string, presented beautifully.   they brought us 7 desserts (an extra for our anniversary), of which we ate about one bit each because we were stuffed. best of all, service was unbelievably good.  our main waitress packed food for us without asking (at a high end restaurant, where i would have been embarrassed to ask for that). we had a great time, and would go back in a flash.  total bill $227 (alcohol was about $50, and the extra entree was $42).   to think that for $115 you could get all of that food, at that quality, with that service, is unbelievable.", 
            "we came here to try the tapas menu that has recently been offered. there is a tall poster type thing in front of fleur de lys that advertises this menu. it's extremely well-priced. example $6 for 4 shot glasses of their amazing truffle onion soup, $12 for 2 sliders with fries, $6-8 for truffle popcorn. to eat at such prices at a hubert keller restaurant...quite a steal i would say. if you choose to partake in the tapas menu, there is separate seating outside the restaurant as well as in the bar/cocktail area which are both very nice. \n\nlet me start with the good:\n\nloved the people watching while waiting for our food. i hardly venture out onto the strip and when i do my primary enjoyment stems from watching fashion disasters, unknowing tourists and stereotyped \"vegas types.\" i know...it's awful but i can't help myself. \n\nthe service was great...the bartender served us for most of our meal and she was great. the manager even came to clear our plates. \n\nthe food: hearts of palm salad with a pistachio cream was divine, the manchego cheese mixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> was the perfect mix of shaved smooth cheese, tart dressing, crisp greens and a sweet garlicky and raisin topping, the truffle onion soup (as always) was rich, creamy and had a delicacy that was perfect. we ordered the mushroom risotto to share from the dinner menu which was also very tasty with a generous helping of woody wild mushrooms. the desert of passion fruit sorbet with coconut tapioca (boba) soup was also a hit. refreshing would best describe it\n\ntapas pricing was very very reasonable. the passion fruit sorbet in the coconut soup was $5 for an order that easily fed 2 people, 4 shotglasses of truffle onion soup was $6, $8 for the mixed green and manchego cheese salad and for people who eat meat, the meat based tapas were also just as reasonable. \n\nnow the bad:\n\nfalse advertising: the tapas menu outside the restaurant mentions that the hearts of palm salad is on the tapas menu. it was not. when inside, the waitress tells us the menu has been changed and that the palm salad had been taken off. we had to order it from the a la carte menu for $16. not fun. a lot of why we even went for the tapas menu was based on the hearts of palm salad which is a favorite of ours\n\ni genuinely dislike businesses that lure people in with an advert and then do a turnaround when they've got you all seated and your drinks ordered. it was fairly easy to correct the menu outside or honor that menu when we asked about it. fleur de lys did neither. \n\nwe ended up spending $120 for tapas (2 cocktails) including tip. that was a bit more than i thought we were in for. partly because we ordered 2 orders of the palm salad from the a la carte menu and because there were so few vegetarian options that we had to order a dish off the main menu again (risotto). i was not a happy camper (especially when i thought i was embarking on an austerity drive). \n\ni'll give it to these guys, they make a mean meal....amazing food but they really need to work on sprucing up their tapas menu and consistency in advertising especially since they're trying to move to an all-tapas type restaurant in the near future (per the manager). a bump down to 3 stars for our multiple shocks tonight. \n\nps. another shout-out for the service here. the bartender serving us (forgot to get her name) was very personable.", 
            "went on the cheap and did the $55 prix fixe with $25 bottle of wine. really great value. for course 1 had onion soup and mixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark>. its hard to wow on a basic salad but did they ever. it was the best dinner salad i've ever had, just so fresh and tender with heirloom tomatoes and great dressing and huge. soup was good but smallish and rich. had salmon and short rib, both very good. simple but delicious. trio of chocolate was incredible.",

            "alright...so i'm very aware that there are already way too many reviews for this place, but it was such a memorable meal for me, that i really have to pass along my two cents worth.\n\ni went with two girlfriends for lunch to this glorious spot when we were out in vegas for continuing education. (have to give a shout out to my husband for the recommendation!) we waited a very short time for a table considering it was the busy lunch hour. when we were seated, our server came over promptly and began talking with us. i discussed chef keller with him and how excited i was to be eating there, to which he stated \"would you like a picture with him? he is sitting right behind you.\"\n\ni said something to the effect of \"shut the f**k up!!!!\" (not my proudest moment, but it shows you how excited i was that the word vomit just came pouring out). he smiled politely and said he would send him over in a little bit.\n\nwe began ordering, which was quite difficult since everything on the menu looked amazing!! i ordered the cuban panini (might i add, so did chef keller...but i'm not a stalker or anything). this sandwich was perfect. the horseradish mustard gave it just the right kick, and i could feel it all through my sinuses. i also got the homemade gnocchi with pesto. thank god for homemade gnocchi! these little balls of deliciousness were just the right texture and consistency. \n\nmy friends ordered the <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark>, the italian style meatballs with pasta fagioli soup underneath them. they also had the sliders and the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>. all of these items were delicious and perfectly seasoned. the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were the standout item of what my friends ordered...they used very thin slices of <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>, which gave just the right amount of flavor and texture against the crunchy taco shell. we also all shared the macaroni and cheese with lobster. i'm not a huge seafood fan, especially when it is mixed in to one of my favorite comfort foods, but the server recommended it and he was spot on. the only reason we didn't finish it is because we were too full from all our other items, plus...there was the matter of ordering dessert.\n\nfor those of you who know me, i am not a huge fan of dessert to begin with, but everything was so good i just had to have one more course. i ordered (are you ready for this???) my absolute hands down favorite dessert of all time! it was the coconut soup with passionfruit sorbet. sounds weird, i know, but it was unbelievable! they had topped the runny coconut soup/tapioca mixture with cold passionfruit sorbet and crunchy dehydrated fruit. i can't say enough about it. i could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. my friends had the panna cotta, which was good, and fairly standard. we also got a couple cheesecake lollies sent over from the table next to us (apparently, their family of 8 had eaten too much too). wonderful and a very playful take on classic cheesecake.\n\nfinally, chef keller came over to talk with us. we snapped a few photos, told him how delighted we were over meeting him and how much we enjoyed his meal, and then were off to enjoy more of our ce. thank you chef keller!!!", 
            "las vegas restaurant week!!!\n\n$20.00 3 course lunch!!!\n\ni wanted to hit a bunch of places for lvrw, but i could only make it to this one plus dinner at del friscos. i read some previous reviews that this place used to be alot more high end, and made some changes to make this more of a tapas place with a bar. it definitely looked more price friendly and $20 for 3 courses was a steal!\n\ni started off with a nice <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark>, complete with a tiny anchovie and yummy fontina and brioche croutons http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yuim5vksco8rs1ex7f19_g?select=i2u5ijlxktwxshqadivvna\n\nthe shortrib sandwich was next http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yuim5vksco8rs1ex7f19_g?select=lcqpsvaflfyw9glqwzml9q.\nit was almost like a bahn mi. bread was yum and shortrib was tasty. i enjoyed it better when i put some of the coleslaw into the sammie. \n\nlastly was some tasty sorbets for dessert http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yuim5vksco8rs1ex7f19_g?select=rwjot4nictnbuqeqtzaiiq\n\nwe also added an order of the cuban panini. i wished we had ordered the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> instead. the panini i think would have tasted better with some bacon in it. hahaha. the bread was a little too heavy. however the fries were amazing!!! i think they were twice fried in duck fat or something, cuz i seriously started to break out after i ate some. but it was yummy!", 
            "if you want a splurge meal in vegas without the splurge price, i'm pretty sure fleur is it.  our party of 4 had an outstanding meal for about $50 a head.  the food is made and plated beautifully, with the menu bent towards small dishes that are easy to share.  a rundown of the things i remember:\n<mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark> - just watch out for the anchovies.  there were these 2 salty, cold bites of fish that kind of jolted me, since the lighting was dim & didn't expect it.  otherwise, a nice starter\nceviche - served with tortilla chips.  the seafood is nicely seasoned with a lime flavor that is strong but not overpowering.  don't forget the guacamole on the bottom\nsteak tartare - parmesan flatbread, tarragon mayonnaise and finely chopped meat.  i rarely eat this, but i thought this was quite tasty\nskirt steak - the chimichurri sauce was kind of thick, like salad dressing and not exactly what i was expecting.  usually i think of chimichurri as a little more oily and thin, but the steak was cooked very nicely\nlobster mac & cheese - the classic kid food, all grown up!\n\ni could go on and on, but i want to get to dessert, because there was something that i just had to get.  the pineapple carpaccio - thin slices of fresh pineapple, some that are torched or baked in an oven so that they are crispy, with lime sorbet and cilantro granita.  you read that correctly.  and if it sounds kind of strange, just give it a try because it will blow your mind.  probably the best dessert that i have had all year!  \n\nthe service is attentive, and the other thing that really stood out is how everything is served beautifully.  dishes with a lot of sauce were served in canoes like the sauteed shrimp, or the steak tartare on a flat square, that looked like it was made out of stone with the fleur logo.  you'd swear that you're the judge on a food network show, the way everything comes out of the kitchen.\n\na tremendous value in vegas, because you can spend way more than $50 per person and not be this happy.  get the pineapple dessert!!!!", 
            "so excited to go here after seeing hubert keller on top chef. ordered \"in the shower\" lobster mac and cheese.... and was disappointed. it was watery, and rather tasteless! tartine with brie and honey was absolutely delicious. i also had a <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark> with shrimp.  the shrimp were perfectly cooked.  service was excellent.", 
            "came here for a nice lunch before leaving las vegas.  i would recommend the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, which were perfect little bites to whet one's appetite, the flatbread with brie, bacon, and morels (i think...it's not on the online menu, but was available when we were there), and the <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark> which was bursting with truffle-y flavor!  unfortunately, the <mark><mark>Grilled Chicken</mark></mark> sandwich was a little on the dry side.  \n\nfun fact: they serve absinthe here...yes, real european absinthe with wormwood content!  would have loved to have tried it, though probably not a good idea prior taking a flight back home, lol.\n\nthe atmosphere is fun and boisterous as it's \"outdoor\" seating, meaning that it's open to the walkway within the hotel area and service was very friendly and accommodating.", 
            "came here for lunch on a weekday- so my review is based on lunch, not dinner.  \n\ni thought the items we ordered were good.  \n\n\"in the shower\" mac & cheese: cheese sauce is smooth, small chunks of lobster, nice crumbly crust on top  \nsteak frites: crust on steak is black and salty, fries have an interesting extra flavor (maybe they're fried in fat instead of oil?) \n\nas i said before, everything was good but not out of this world amazing.  our waiter was very honest when we asked him what he recommended.  according to him, you shouldn't order the <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark> or the <mark>Field Green</mark> salad because you can get that anywhere.  also, he said that the cuban sandwich is plain, as is the vegetable sandwich.  so if you come here, i would avoid those items!", 
            "on our latest trip to las vegas, we decided to have dinner at hubert keller's fleur at the mandalay bay.  \n\nthey have a dining area in front of the restaurant, but we opted for seating in the restaurant.  the d\\u00e9cor and ambiance is very modern and classy.\n\nafter checking out the menu, we decided to order several small plates, a large plate and finish off with a dessert. we ordered:\n\n- <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark> with parmesan lavash, truffle and anchovy.   the truffle and pieces set this apart from an ordinary caesar.\n- <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> with ponzu chantilly, serrano, and avocado cream.  three small tacos that were so delicious.  could have eaten a couple more on my own.  \n- \"in  the shower\" mac n cheese, lobster and brunoise vegetable.  delicious with good amount of lobster mixed in.\n- black angus sliders, with caramelized onions, bacon and frites.  two juicy sliders that were very juicy and tasty.\n- guinness braised short ribs with rainbow carrots, pommee puree and coffee foam.  this had great flavors with the guinness and coffee foam.  the ribs were a tad dry.  \n- grand marnier souffl\\u00e9 with orange cr\\u00e8me anglaise and orange-cardamom ice cream.  wow, this was one amazing dessert.  it was delicious down to the last drop.  had me licking my spoon.\n\nservice was excellent.  we were talking about the wine cellar with our waiter and he even took us on a tour of the cellar after our meal.  that was cool!\n\noverall, a great overall meal.  with these small plates, we were able to share all these dishes.  heck, we even shared the short rib entr\\u00e9e as well.", 
            "ehh i'm kinda disappointed.\n\ni came to the mandalay bay which to be honest, i rarely come because i actually had tickets to the mj one show. after yelping some places to eat around mandalay bay, i was super excited to find out that there were two joints opened by hubert keller!!\n\ni'm a huge fan of hubert keller especially after his debut on top chef masters. i was really rooting for him the first season to win! i also have always wanted to eat at his restaurant in sf at fleur des lys so when i found out he had fleur in mandalay bay, i quickly made a rsvp before the show.\n\nthe restaurant was quite empty when we arrived, given that my rsvp was at 5:30 bc we had the 7:00 tickets to the mj show, and we got sat down inside very quickly. it was super dark inside that we had to request moving to different tables bc it was too dark for some people to read the menu. our waiter was nice, attentive, good at recommendations and any questions we had.\n\nhalf ordered the mj prix fixe menu while half ordered a bunch of little dishes to share. some things ordered was the shrimp ceviche, <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, beef sliders, skirt steak, <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark>, corn soup, and fleur burger. \n\neverything tasted pretty mediocre. i was slightly disappointed especially since i had high expectations of this place and also that i had told my party that dinner would be good. majority of my party was not satisfied with their meal and was highly disappointed as well. the sliders were okay. good meat patties but kinda dry and needed some sort of sauce to it to counteract the dryness. the shrimp ceviche should really not be called ceviche. normally, a ceviche is cooked in the juices of some sort of citrus juice like lemon or lime but this \"ceviche\" was basically drowned in a cold cucumber soup. the cucumber dressing was really bland and had no flavor to it and the accompaniments was really minimal. couldn't find a single tomato or avocado in that small dish. the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were good. good slab of tuna but could have used more sauce in the tiny tiny taco. salad was mediocre and corn was okay. nothing too spectacular just ok. we ended the night with some brownie pops which again, kinda misleading. i was expecting kind of like a brownie cake pop but it's more like a chocolate truffle on a stick with some caramel. it was way too sweet even for a sweet tooth lover like me.\n\noverall, my dinner was fine. but for a highly rated restaurant, i was expecting more especially one that's owned by hubert keller. i think i made the mistake of eating at fleur instead of going to burger bar. maybe next time i'll go back to mandalay bay and have better luck at his burger joint instead.", 
            "<mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> to start: shells were a bit \"chewy\". flavor was great.\n<mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark> was very tasty. grace says the white anchovies they used are very delicate (and yummy- perfect amount of \"briny-ness\").\nskirt steak- had to take a picture. incredible flavor and it's tender. now how do they accomplish both? nice job!\ngrace and i both ordered skirt steak (hers medium, mine medium rare). both came out perfectly cooked but mine was half as thick as hers - i kinda got ripped off.  this is my only minus for the night and only reason for 4 stars. \ndesert: tiramisu with blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries.  awesome - custard was light and creamy, top was perfectly browned! if creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e by itself, the cream is a killer!", 
            "this place is just so so. \n\n<mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark>: fail. chopped, almost shredded, room-temperature romaine drowned in thick, bottled (?) dressing. it was an extremely poor interpretation of a simple, classic salad that is so easy to do right but that marginal and below restaurants do poorly.\n\nfleur burger. excellent. served with a mini fryer of fingerling fries. $35.\n\nservice. fail. fast and efficient. however service workers who complain always cancel out the good. the bartender told me she could really use my burger and martini; it had been a bad day and she was hungry. you know what honey, i'm on a weekend getaway and am dropping ~$80 on this meal. i don't want to hear your problems! get a job at denny's.", 
            "there menu looks interesting but failed to impress. i tried their <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> and they were super plain no flavor. <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark> was good but that's hard to mess up. tried their brownie pops for dessert, they were sweet but 75% frosting and only 25% brownie. we went for lunch so maybe their dinner is better.", 
            "can't touch some of dallas's restaurants, this was just celebrity chef hype. now, as you can see by my # of reviews, i eat out - alot. and i've eaten at some fancy pants places but i have never been charged per dinner roll. ever. $1.25 per roll here! we have complimentary bread baskets in dallas yal! and french bread, and muffins and cornbread and free chips n salsa....what gives vegas? charging us per roll? \n\nmoving on....the service was excellent, the wine was excellent - huge selection. the food - good, not great....i've had way better and nothing i had here would be worth coming back for next time i'm in vegas. we had 2 entrees and the rest tapas. the potato-crusted trout was the fav of the night. the coq au vin was pretty good as well.\nthe veggie tart...was mushy, not a fav. the black angus sliders were good...but ya know, they're just sliders...nothing that inventive. <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark> was delish and everyone loved the side of wild mushroom ragout.\n\nwe tried to leave full and happy with 2 desserts....but again, just ok. <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark>...just as good as anywhere else. the bengiet (i know i'm spelling this wrong) balls were good but not as good as the real thing, or just a good ol' donut hole.\n\ni'm goin' back to dallas. dallas, dallas....goin' back to dallas. where the food is so much better. word.",

            "what a fantastic place! i have stayed in the mandalay a few times (i think 5) and i had never been to this restaurant. i think in part that the bar is blocking the lovely ambiance of the back so it looks too casual from the casino side. the manager knew it was my birthday and came baring glasses of champagne and an amazing truffle <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark> shooters in little martini glasses. we then proceeded to order family style:\n\ndelicious <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark>- parmesan, lavash, anchovy, truffle\nseared pork gyoza with garlic ponzu and green onion\nduck terrine which is a duck breast confit terrine with picked veggies and a celery root remoulade\nblack garlic escargot in a puff pastry crouton\nheirloom tomato, smoked duck breast and burrata salad \n\nthey are all amazing and i will definitely be coming back.\n\nat the end of the meal, they brought me a candle in a cake with my name on the plate in chocolate as well as a card with a recipe in it as my gift. i wish i knew what all the ingredients are to make it but i'll attempt one of these days!", 
            "yes! everything about this evening was amazing; i wouldn't expect anything less.  this was our splurge night with friends so we were 100% aware of price and cuisine. we made a reservation but didn't feel it was necessary - no one was there at 7pm on a saturday; by the time we left around 9:30pm it was still empty. \n\nwe picked 3 appetizers; beef carpaccio (we ordered seconds!); escargot; gnocchi & short ribs = all amazing.  \n\nwe then ordered 2 <mark><mark>Caesar Salad</mark></mark> & split them; definitely enough for 4 adults. the dressing was on point.\n\nentrees: fleur burger (added f.g. & truffle) - \"best burger ever\" as described from our friend; scallops - cooked perfectly + beets (my favorite!!!); my husband ordered the beef cheeks - so flaky soft, the pieces melted in your mouth... if you're a skeptic, it was like a very tender stew, but 100x better; 8 oz hanger steak - cooked perfectly to medium rare, melt in your mouth... our friend had to force herself to stop eating so she could save room for dessert. talk about self control!\n\ni can't freaking remember the desserts. oh my gosh. whatever, they were good, lol! \n\nit's a treat to eat here and i'm glad we did, one more celebrity chef to check off my list. a+++++!",

            "3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 because i have mad respect for chef hubert keller and what he's doing here.\n\nthe ambiance and decor:\nfirst, it's great that you can always get reservations for fleur, which is not possible for most of the other top restaurants in vegas. i'm not sure if this is public response on the food, location or marketing, but it's something to consider. the location definitely leaves something to be desired; it's in the back of the hotel, and you end up with a view to some slots and walkways due to the open floorplan. the decor itself is very nice; supple leather, slate, glass, and some random \"edgy\" art pieces. there's also a beautiful wine cellar behind glass. the big detractor for me was the outfit the cocktail waitresses wear. i'm normally not one to argue with ladies wearing short hoochie dresses, but it's totally out of place in an otherwise classy restaurant.\n\nfood:\nfor sure, the two stand out dishes are the <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark> and the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>. in fact, i urge everyone to just order four orders of the tacos as their meal. my friend got the fleur burger (despite the exorbitant price) and really liked it, but i've heard from others that it's quite dry. in general, i hear the menu is hit or miss, but you'll have to read other reviews to see if people can advise you towards some dishes.\n\nservice:\nthe service is impeccable. our waitress was very sweet, gave us time to figure out what we wanted and added in recommendations. her wine pairings were also excellent. the service actually made the meal special, which isn't something you'd normally say in vegas.\n\nbottom line, fleur is worth a visit (or a second visit for me)!",

(this was out favorite and ordered it to split between me and significant other).\n+next: gyros; not listed on the menu link. made with thick lamb and vinaigrette lettuce/olive mixture. (the lamb was cooked to perfection, not too dry or moist, and seasoned lighly without overpowering the meat).\n+black angus sliders: sadly there were only three. we had to split one and wish we had more. \n+lastly we ordered the chocolate souffle. this was our first so we can't act like experts and critique it absurdly. however we loved every bit and scrambled to grab the last bite. served with oreo ice cream to ease your tongue from too much warm souffle.\n\ni do have a food allergy and appreciated it very much when the waitress was able to recall off the top of her head if a dish contained nuts or not.",

            "dinner review ...\n\nnote about the \"star\" rating ... i gave fleur five stars. you might ask why given that some of the dishes (as explained below) were just okay, and the reason is that the other dishes were really, really good. ultimately, i like to judge restaurants and food based on whether i'll remember them ... and i'll definitely remember the beef tartare tacos, veloute, and ricotta gnocchi.  in addition, the service was excellent.\n\nhad dinner at fleur before seeing le reve at the wynn. decided on the tasting menu (\"tastes from around the world\"), which was reasonably priced (in a relative sense, given how much - and easily - you can pay at the other celebrity-chef restaurants around las vegas) ... four courses plus dessert (amounting to ten dishes, and i added escargot to boot):\n\ncourse 1 -\n\n1. beef tartare tacos - terrific dish. i'm a big fan of beef tartare; the taco shells added texture; and the beef was great.\n \n2. truffled beef carpaccio - good dish. but i've had the same at other good restaurants; not bad by any means ... again, a good dish, just not necessarily memorable.\n\ncourse 2 -\n\n3. <mark><mark>White Onion Soup Veloute</mark></mark> - terrifc dish again. this was my personal favorite, memorable in a way that the beef carpaccio might not be; the veloute was rich and creamy, with a trace of truffle.\n\n4. gyoza - mediocre dish.  this was my least favortie dish; the gyozas were somewhat uninspired with neither the pillowy-ness of boiled dumplings or the crispy skin of potstickers. \n\ncourse 3 -\n\n5. ricotta gnocchi & braised short rib - very good dish. i really enjoyed the gnocchi (and i've had a lot lately ... with my favorite being at osteria mamma in los angeles), especially the nice pan sear; short ribs were also tasty.\n\n6. grilled octopus - okay dish. not quite as good as the gnocchi, but better than the gyoza.\n\ncourt 4 -\n\n7. grilled skirt steak lyonnaise - very good dish. the steak was cooked well (as is properly, not as in burnt to death) ... always enjoy steak and potatoes.\n\n8. diver scallop - good dish. nicely cooked scallops, but don't remember the pork belly.\n\n9. ratatouille - very good dish.  i really enjoyed the ratatouille; i recall another review saying the vegetables were mushy, but i found the whole dish to be spot on.\n\ndessert -\n\n10. brioche beignets - terrific dish. light, fluffy pilows of goodness ... again, i thought the beignets were terrific (but as a word of caution to set expectations, these are different than the beignets you might expect at cafe du monde).\n\nadditional dish -\n\n11. escargot - good dish. friend had never had snails, so added an order; good dish, but i also don't eat snails often enough to add any insight.\n\nservice - service was friendly and professional; have nothing but good things to say about the staff. \n\natmosphere - comfortable dining room, with an upscale but still casual feel.  for more casual, try the food court, and for fine dining, try aureole next door."

            "i got a comp for a 5-course dinner experience for two with a personalized menu at fleur, so i was super excited to come here on our most recent vegas trip.\n\nhowever, for such an extravagant dinner, i left with a couple disappointments:\n\ndisappointment #1:\nby \"personalized menu\", all it really means is that the chef comes to your table before you order and asks if you have any food allergies or distastes.  i said that i didn't like exotic meats such as lamb or deer, and the chef said it wasn't a problem since they don't have those meats in the kitchen anyway.  as a fine dining restaurant, i'd expect them to have a fancier selection.\n\ndisappointment #2: \nbecause you don't really get to choose your food, i ended up getting items that i probably wouldn't have ordered normally...aka foods that didn't tickle my fancy.  this included bland, boiled kale and veggies in a liquid soup which got soggy after sitting a while, a huge bowl of weird mushrooms that had a funny smell and taste, and a salad with an almost poached, almost raw egg on it.  i probably only ate a few pieces of each, and felt bad wasting the rest :(.  also, because i didn't know what was coming out next, my stomach wasn't prepared.  i was pretty much full after course #3.\n\nmy meal:\n\ncourse 0.5: raw oyster in a ponzu sauce under a bed of dry ice\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q\nrefreshing, delicious, and extra presentation points for keeping it on the dry ice!\n\ncourse 1: potato soup, asian slaw, crab cake\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#qccymqr7r2nrb58nfsljeg\nprobably my favorite course.  the potato soup was so rich and creamy and was made with a touch of truffle oil.  the slaw wasn't anything special, but a good refreshing counter to its adjacent rich foods.  the crab cake was also awesome: crispy on the outside, soft and flaky on the inside, with tons of real crab meat.  i could have had another couple plates of just the soup and crab cake for the meal and would be so happy!\n\ncourse 2: spinach salad with poached(?) egg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#3ko-o6wh-vqfsd27b-fcsw\nthe spinach and its dressing was actually very good with a light, sweet, creamy dressing that didn't overpower the hearty greens.  however, i absolutely despise runny egg yolks, so i had to make sure i didn't pop the egg while eating my greens.  when i was almost done with the salad, it broke on its own and i was done with the dish right then.\n\ncourse 3: surf and turf: salmon and steak\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#w9bbwd7c8mabiw_fkfqe0a\npredictable flavors, but still good.  both the salmon and the steak were very tender and moist.  my only complaint here was there was no starch to pair it with!  i ended up ordering a loaf of bread, since they apparently don't sell rice.\n\ncourse 4: braised beef with espresso foam, side mushrooms and boiled kale/veggies\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#hbd3rqxwlxf4ipheembj4w\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#voytnj-dk<mark>Blt</mark>38jacw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#onahfbyanlevg5x0anorwa\nthis was the \"weird mushrooms\" and \"bland boiled kale/veggies\" that i mentioned above.  i was pretty much full after course #3, so i couldn't really enjoy this dish to its fullest, but the braised beef was one of my favorite things of the night!  sooo tender, flavorful, and the espresso foam gave it that extra somethin' somethin'!  it sat on a bed of mashed potatoes (finally!!!! starch!!!!).  even though i was full, i ate most of the beef and potatoes...\n\ncourse 5: chocolate cream puffs and pineapple/cream parfait\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#wcpwbn9nyecthewb34b9hw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q#zuta5knekhl0lu_s92euga\nso by now, i was over and beyond stuffed.  not really much of a dessert person, i let myself relish one chocolate cream puff, which was actually pretty good.  the chocolate was rich and decadent, poured over the puff dough, and between the two puff halves was vanilla bean gelato!  yum!\n\ni must admit, it was a very tasty meal.  some items were not ones i would order again, but that's how it is with a surprise menu i suppose.  i think i enjoyed the meal a lot more because i got it for free, but i don't think i would pay the actual value to eat here again."

            "had an early dinner here with my family. we bridged the lunch and dinner menus because we wanted to try a few things from each. we started with the onion soup shooters, burrata, and brie flamb\\u00e9. the burrata was a large portion of light, fluffy cheese, though a little firmer than i'm used to. still, accompanied by a nice crostini and tomatoes with balsamic, it was lovely. the brie was decent. my family enjoyed it more than i did, but i'm not a huge brie fan. the onion soup shooters were the favorite of the table, with the four of us, from my five year old on up trying to get one more sip. \n\nat this point, the adults ordered drinks. i had the cherry limeade, which is made with cherry vodka, lime juice and black cherry pur\\u00e9e. it was easily the best mixed drink i've had in my life. my husband had the sumo, which was just okay, and kept sneaking sips of my drink. we ordered another cherry limeade to split. my ten year old ordered the steak frites, just under the wire before the switchover to the dinner menu. it was cooked to medium rare, very tender and juicy. the fries were good as well. \n\nonce it was time for the dinner menu, i had the salmon, which came with a nice dill sauce and some lightly cooked sliced cucumbers. it was delicious. my husband had the braised short ribs, which came in a larger than expected portion, soft, tender, sweet. he enjoyed it.\n\nfor dessert, we had the <mark><mark>Brownie Lollipops</mark></mark>, creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e, and panna cotta. my husband loved the panna cotta. the <mark><mark>Brownie Lollipops</mark></mark> were pretty slim on the brownie. like a cake pop, with chocolate mousse  and a thin sliver of brownie dipped in dark chocolate. the caramel sauce that accompanied it was a little skimpy, but tasty. my ten year old had the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e, which i tasted and thought was a pretty standard creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e. \n\nthe service was good, with a nicely attentive waiter and assistant refilling our waters frequently. i'll be back for another cherry limeade and onion soup shooters.", 
            "my advice would be to skip it.\n\nwe went to vegas for my sister's 25th birthday and stayed at the mandalay bay. initially i had made reservations at aureole. we were looking around at menus and found the menu at fleur to be more appetizing, so we switch at the last minute. big mistake.\n\nfirst of all, fleur is not a nice restaurant. it has no outer walls so people walking by/being loud can disrupt your meal. they also have this cheesy poster thing outside that made me feel like i was going to a random sushi restaurant in brooklyn.\n\nsecond, our waiter was probably the most awkward person i've ever encountered in a restaurant. the restaurant is tapas-style and the menu is nothing like what they have online. we ordered a bunch of tapas since we had a large lunch and were still a bit stuffed. some people in our party ordered larger tapas. we assumed they'd bring our tapas out together since well, they're tapas and meant to be shared. that was not the case. they brought out all but two dishes and we waited a really, really long time (about 30 minutes) for those two dishes. just as we were about to cancel them, our waiter said, \"oh, they are the second course.\" huh? why the heck would two people want to eat while everyone else watched? they obviously forgot about those dishes and at the last minute brought them out.\n\ni was about to refuse but my husband doesn't like me to make a scene.\n\nanyway, then when it came to the dessert portion, i expected them to bring something out for my sister since they asked me what the occasion was when i made the reservation.\n\nbut no. our awkward waiter brings out the dessert menu, asks what everyone wants (no one wanted anything, we just wanted to get out of there) and needed to be reminded by me and another person in our party that its her birthday. then he got defensive when we reminded him. awesome. she eventually got the <mark><mark>Brownie Lollipops</mark></mark>.\n\nto top it all off, there was no apology or compensation for the huge lag time between our \"first and second courses\". \n\nthis place was empty every night we passed by. in a place like vegas where fancy and delicious food is a dime a dozen, this place won't last. do yourself a favor and don't subject yourself to awkward, slow service.", 
            "i was pleasantly surprised with our first experience at fleur! our meals at other \"high end\" places in vegas were somewhat disappointing, so it was great to finally have a good meal. mandalay bay is a really gorgeous place and we sat at a high-top just outside the restaurant. the service was great - our hostess and waitress were really attentive and nice. we even caught a glimpse of hubert keller visiting a table nearby!\n\nwe started with a shot of absinthe each. we had never had it before and fleur has a wide selection, complete with table side service. if you've never tried absinthe or had the experience of them \"making\" your drink next to our table, i highly recommend it. i ended up settling on the grilled octopus small plate and my boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese small plate. my octopus was delicious! it was layered with mushrooms and a delicious pepper aioli. the mac and cheese was creamy on the bottom and crispy and breaded on top, and the shrimp inside were cooked perfectly.\n\nfor dessert, we ordered the <mark><mark>Brownie Lollipops</mark></mark> and <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark>. the lollipops were okay but the <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> was great. we would definitely go back and i would try the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> next. the menu, though not large, has a variety of dishes so there's likely something for just about everyone.", 
            "a great restaurant and a chance to enjoy hubert keller without booking six months in advance.  \n\nfirst, wanted to compliment the service.  the waitress asked if we had to make a show and i mentioned i had a flight.  rather than a two or three hour experience, they were great at delivering the dishes promptly.  although it would of been great over many hours, i really like the way they were accommodating without me even having to ask.\n\nalthough there are entree on the menu, they also have small plates separated by territory.  my friends and i shared several:\n--   <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>.  i love tuna and the tuna was perfect.  the crispy taco was a very neat touch.\n--  black angus sliders.  maybe the highlight of the dinner.  while everyone has sliders these days, these were fantastic.  larger than i would of expected and the caramelized onions and bacon came together wonderfully with the meat.\n--  <mark>Tarte Flambe</mark>.  probably the most disappointing dish.  no flambee and overall not much flavor over the bread.\n--  seared foie gras.  i love good foie gras and this foie gras was prepared perfectly, the other highlight of the evening.\n--  bbq pork ribs.  a dish that often goes bad at small plates restaurants, done perfectly at fleur.  ribs were tender, flavorful and meaty.\n--  pork belly fried rice.  okay, another highlight of the evening.  surprisingly, it was not the pork belly that made the dish great but the flavor of the rice.  \n--  green papaya carpaccio.  after the tarte, one of the weaker dishes.  just not much flavor, the carpaccio did not come through.\n--  <mark><mark>Brownie Lollipops</mark></mark>. i am not a big sweets person, but these were very popular with our table.\n\nwith julian serrano, two fantastic options for small plates in vegas.  both are fantastic, fleur maybe a little more consistent but some great dishes in both places."

            "after watching top chef masters and routing for chef keller, i wanted to check out his restaurant. the top chef special tasting menu was over at 7pm so i was bummed that i couldn't check it out.  however, our waiter was nice enough to offer some of the dishes on it if we wanted. however we went with the tasting menu. \n\ntruffled onion soup\nbraised duck cr\\u00eape, red wine shallot pur\\u00e9e, black truffle\n-nice and tasty\nchorizo wrapped suzuki sea bass\npiperade, barley risotto, caramelized chorizo sauce\n- very interesting flavors. \nstout braised beef shortribs\nroot vegetable puree, whole grain mustard, cornichons\n-yum, melt in my mouth shortribs but i was quite full by now\n22 star buffet tasting\nearl grey flavored cr\\u00e8me brulee, ginger bread verrine, chocolate-lemon tart\n-my favorite was the early grey <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark>. i was very full so i couldn't finish it up.", 
            "this pertains to their top chef masters menu\n\nthe skinny: great execution of classic french cuisine with occasional missteps (4) service - excellent, prompt, unpretentious (4.5), value - for the top chef masters tasting menu is actually pretty good for what it's worth (only available until 7pm).\n\nwhen people ask me about where they can find great, fancy french food for a reasonable price, i would have to recommend this place (i've eaten here before but i forgot to write a review!). i am sad to see that fleur will be closing its doors in august because it is a great restaurant on the strip.\n\nmy hubby and i tried their top chef tasting menu for $65/person.\n\nthe amuse bouche was a lightly fried cod with a warm potato salad. the cod was light and crisp while the acidity from the salad accentuated the flavours of the fish. a well thought out dish.\n\ni had the mixed greens with polenta croutons while my husband had the salmon and radish salad. the mixed <mark>Field Green Salad</mark> was phenomenal because of the crouton. now here's the thing. i don't like croutons. i don't like polenta. but i swear to god the chef must've used some sort of magic to make those babies - such lovely texture and aroma. i could have eaten an entire plate of those. the salmon dish and the radish salad was well prepared but overall, was a little unexcitiing.\n\nsecond course was lobster mac n' cheese and the braised beef cheek with filet mignon. to be honest, the lobster mac n' cheese a miss for me. for one thing, not enough lobster flavour and the macaroni was a little more than al dente for my taste. however, it tasted wonderful regardless.\n\nthe braised beef cheek however - wow! the meat braised in five spices... one of the best beef dishes i've had in a while. i almost wished there was no filet mignon there (not because it wasn't good) because the beef cheek totally outshone it. the accompanying sides were delicious. \n\nfinally dessert - a quartet of desserts actually. the earl grey <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark>, chocolate mice mousse and the fruit marscarpone parfait were home runs. the unfortunate piece was the lemon/chocolate tart. i love lemon tarts. i love chocolate. but the two together do not work. lemons really bring out the bitterness and grainy texture of chocolate.\n\nwe were also given a lovely plate of petit fours which were not that great. again, weird flavour combinations - lemon with five spice cake (the lemon doesn't go with it at all). the other sweets were...well... too sweet.\n\nlike i said, i will be sad to see fleur de lys close its doors next month.", 
            "i ate here new years day (yeah, that was a while ago and i totally forgot to write a review!) with my best friend and (now ex) significant other to kick the new year off right. and wow, we made the right choice. we decided to go with their prix fixe menu and order different plates, that way we could all get a little taste of every dish. there were a couple dishes that absolutely wowed me. first, they started us off with a delectable amuse-bouche. it was the right way to start off the meal because from that very first bite, i can tell that this will be one of the best meals i'll ever have. to start off, i ordered their onion soup, which was amazing. best soup i've ever had. it was creamy and yet light enough so that it won't weigh you down for the rest of your meal. their filet mignon was so tender that they didn't bother giving me an actual steak knife to cut through it. hahaha, they gave me an un-serrated butter knife. at first i was like \"wtf, how do they expect me to cut into my meat with this thing?\" well, let me tell you, i was able to slice through that chunk of meat with minimal effort. =p oh, and yes, it was just as deliciously flavorful as it was tender. i opted to pay the extra money to get the <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> for dessert. i remember it cracking ever so nicely when i first dug my spoon into the creamy goodness. after remembering that great meal i had at the las vegas location, i'm thinking about making a stop over at the san francisco location. thank goodness i'm in the bay area! =p", 
            "i had a chance to meet and chat with hubert and he told me that this is now fleur, which appears to be a more accessible and budget-friendly than before. i believe fleur de lys in sf still remains the same. of course, the best part about the whole experience was meeting hubert! right after we were seated, my bf saw hubert coming out of the kitchen, and he was heading straight to our table to greet us! what an experience!\n\nthey have a tasting menu ($45) which consists of 6 preselected dishes. for us, it was: <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, onion soup, cod fritters, gnocchi with marinara and pesto, sliders, and a trio of <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> (earl grey, honey lavender, cookie dough). my favorites were the onion soup (with a touch of truffle oil!) and the gnocchi, which were so soft, light, and airy! we also ordered some other dishes: crab and avocado sphere, \"shower\" mac n' cheese (calling all top chef master fans!), braised hamachi, and skirt steak. everything was well prepared and executed. \n\nfor dessert, besides the <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark>, we also ordered their cheesecake lollipops. these were great in theory but not so great in application. the cheesecake would start to slide off after one bite, and it was not as cold as i would have preferred. because it was my birthday, they also gave us a vanilla panna cotta with huckleberry sorbet on the house, which was absolutely divine.\n\ni had a fantastic time and the best part of it all is that it is super budget-friendly, so there is no excuse not to try it out! hopefully fellow yelpers come on a day hubert is there, because he is just as humble and welcoming in person as he appears on t.v.!",

            "came here in april 2011 and it was a very disappointing experience! i made a reservation after my friends had raved about fleur de lys being the best dining experience they had in las vegas. after looking up the menu changes, i decided to give fleur a try. i didn't think hubert keller could disappoint. \n\ni do have to disclose that i tried to cancel my reservation earlier that day. my group had decided we wanted to do something a lot more casual for dinner. despite their 24 hour cancellation policy, i was told when i made the reservation that they're not strict about it and that as long as you call before your reservation, you won't be charged the ridiculous no-show fee. when i called, they gave me a lot of trouble, telling me that they had a ridiculously busy night and that cancelling the reservation would absolutely mean i'd be charged $50 per person. she even went as far to tell me that if i tried to pull a loophole on her by changing my reservation then canceling it 24 hours before my reservation, i would still be charged. thank goodness my group of friends were troopers and decided to give the restaurant a try. \n\nwhen we got there, the restaurant wasn't busy at all. the lady on the phone emphasized how busy they were and were going out of their way to accommodate our large party of 9. there was plenty of room in the back in the 'real restaurant area' but we were put in the very front in the mall area. it felt like we were eating in a food court. \n\nthe entire meal was a disappointment. the service was mediocre at best. we had a party of 9 so we were able to order a lot of plates off the menu. there were more than 3 dishes that the wait staff got wrong. we kept getting dishes we didn't order and we got repeats of dishes that were already served. when we pointed them out to the servers, they simply said \"the kitchen hates it when we send food back so just eat it.\" \n\nthe food was nothing spectacular. not only did nothing taste particularly flavorful, nothing came out at the right temperature. everything we ordered came luke warm. the server kept warning us that the lobster mac and cheese was extremely hot but it wasn't. we could've put our face to the baking dish without our skin turning red. the mussels were bland, the braised hamachi came highly recommended by the wait staff but it came swimming in so much sauce that you couldn't even tell you were eating fish. my friends ordered the fleur burger but the waiter instructed them to pour the red wine reduction sauce all over the burger that it completely masked the taste of the wagyu, foie and truffle. the worst dish even though its a side dish must've been the <mark>Tarte Flambe</mark>. it was simply onions on flatbread, both underwhelming and tasteless. \n\nthe only highlight to the meal was dessert. the chocolate souffle and the <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> trio were the only dishes that were satisfying.\n\nafter food, wine, tip and tax, the bill came out to $78 per person. it was an outrageous amount of money to have spent on a very lackluster meal.", 
            "was at fleur this past weekend with a party of 9. two sets of the feast tasting menu was ordered. no one was aware that it came with 43 dishes. so 43 x 2=86 was how many dishes we had. there was so much food that it was hard to enjoy all of it. the food was good, but \nnothing all too impressive. \n \ndishes i enjoyed:\nparmesan paprika popcorn\np.e.i. mussels basil & parmesan emulsion\nskirt steak with chimichuri\nlobster mac & cheese\ngarlic fries\nceci frito fried chickpea, preserved lemon \nmarinated olives \nchicken wings\ntiramisu\n<mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> trio\npb& j chocolate macaroons with rum iced milk \n\nit was $160 per person...with a few alcoholic drinks\n\nthe service was excellent. the ambiance was classy and trendy.", 
            "it was on a trip back to vegas after having lived there for three years that a friend and i finally had the opportunity to try fleur before seeing one of the last performances of the lion king at mandalay bay. i am a huge fan of hubert keller from his appearances on top chef and was excited to try his food! \n\ni purchased a $50 gift certificate from restaurant.com that only cost me $3! the only stipulation was that we spent at least $100 (not including alcohol) and you must tip on the original bill. this worked out great because we wanted to try a little bit of everything! \n\ni started off with a trio of martinis for about $18. they had a very reasonable happy hour including $3 domestic beers,but i wanted to get something i wouldn't normally order. my favorite martini out of the three was the flirtini.\n\nthe plates here are small, but there was definitely a lot of flavor. we ordered the croque monseuir which is pretty much a grilled ham and cheese sandwich. simple but delicious! the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were one of my favorites but didn't impress my fellow diner as much. the braised hamachi with soy ginger foam was a little overdone and salty. not to mention that when one of the servers dropped it off he failed to tell me that the plate was extremely hot. ouch. \n\nthe chicken croquettes were super yummy. only problem was there just wasn't enough on the plate. despite all the small plates we ordered we still had room to order a couple of large plates as well. the braised short ribs were delicious, flavorful and tender. they were slightly sweet but well balanced. the peking duck breast was a little less impressive, the duck was cooked well but i'm not sure it was a $30 dish. probably could have just ordered a few more small plates for less and have been just as satisfied.\n\nfor dessert we ordered the <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> trio. the vanilla was by far the best, followed by pistachio and then raspberry, which was a little too sweet. we ordered coffee (which is pressed at the table) and our server went back and made us fresh whipped cream to go on top. delish! \n\nservice was attentive and friendly. we ate earlier in the evening so there weren't many guests there which is why i think we were so well attended to. atmosphere is great but it is a little dark inside, which can be a good thing i guess. \n\nnot sure if i would put this restaurant on the top of my to do list on my next trip to vegas with all the great food that the city has to offer but it was definitely one of my better experiences at a celebrity chef restaurant.", 
            "we had been wanting to try fleur forever! my husband and best friend accompanied me for my birthday. we were so excited to try fleur and found the food to be hit and miss, but we had an awesome once in a lifetime experience with hubert keller. here is the list of food that we tried:\n\ntarte flamb\\u00e9e onion, bacon, truffle ,asparagus, cr\\u00e8me fraiche - this was probably the highlight of the meal. so delicate and delicious we almost fought over the last piece.\n\nceviche fresh daily selection, guacamole, tortilla chips - the ceviche was very good, not the best i have had (thank you rick bayless), but good. it was a little weird to eat since it was presented in a very deep dish and we had to ask for more chips, but overall the flavor was good. \n\n\"in the shower\" mac & cheese lobster, brunoise vegetable - the lobster mac and cheese was ok, nothing special. the serving size for this dish was surprising large compared to other dishes. \n\nnampol meesa\"wings\" spicy, salty, sweet - these are tiny little chicken wings! i found these to be very salty and lacking in the flavor department. they had a nice crispness to them, but hard to eat due to the saltiness.\n\nskirt steak* chimmichurri, roasted fingerling, cr\\u00e8me fraiche - this was definitely a low point of the meal, the chimmichurri was a really weird and unappetizing paste, not a traditional chimmichurri at all. they seriously mean fingerling, you literally get 1 tiny potato, which we split 3 ways. it was delicious, but seriously?\n\nwe also tried braised beef sliders that were nothing special and some korean bbq ribs that had great flavor, but were so chewy i almost had to spit them out. now, the meal up to this point was disappointing, but then it all changed. hubert keller came through the dining room and checked in with every table! he was so sweet and posed for pictures with people. when he stopped by our table my friend lauren asked him if he could serve me a souffle. he agreed without skipping a beat. \n\nnow, a little history, i have never had a souffle because like the perfect man, i was waiting for the right one. souffles are so delicate and can be done so poorly, so i wanted my first one from a real french master and i was not disappointed. before the souffle was served, we got a complimentary birthday dessert with brownie bites and banana cupcakes. it was adorable, but nothing spectacular. \n\nmy friend lauren got the <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> and it was stunning! i thought for sure it was going to be too much custard and not enough crunchy delicious sugar topping, but the raspberry, pistachio, and vanilla were some of the best i have had. i was in love with the vanilla and there was definitely something special about this one. then came the highlight of the meal, hubert served me my souffle and even prepped it in front of me. he also bought it for me, which was incredibly thoughtful. the souffle was stunning and as he predicted i am now addicted to them! \n\noverall, the food was disappointing but my personal theory is that a french chef will excel at french food, not tapas. this is not his niche and it was obvious. the desserts were stunning and i would go back for dessert anytime. hubert keller did not disappoint, he was so sweet, friendly, and accommodating. i couldn't wipe the smile off of my face for days! thanks for a great experience hubert!", 
            "the food was good, nothing was exceptional but they were all better than average. the prices are a little on the high side, but what isn't in vegas? \n\nwe ordered:\nsteak tartare - very good. seasoned well.\nsauteed shrimp - not bad. served with a rich creamy spicy sauce that is quite seasian inspired.\nbraised pork sliders - meh..\nskirt steak - cooked well but the chimmichurri was disappointing and bland\npeking duck breast - definitely not peking duck. the skin was not crispy n fat not rendered off. but not bad flavour wise\nbraised short rib - very rich n deliciously tender. the potatoes were disappointing.\nchocolate souffle - very good\n<mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> trio - very good\n\n\nservice was quite dismal. the hostess was nice and seated us promptly and food runners were great at describing every dish we ordered but our server was pretty absent and pompous. we saw her when we ordered and when she asked if we wanted to order more food and when we got the bill. that's it. no check back on the food and i even forgot i meant to order a glass of wine! with all the options in vegas, it is hard to justify going back..", 
            "i don't take the time to write many reviews, and i've eaten at some really great restaurants since this but my mind keeps making me want to go back to fleur.  we went in december of 2011 and it was extremely memorable.  it was my typically traditional mom's first time eating tapas and she loved it as well.\n\nshe was surprised to see how small the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> were when they came out but we ordered plenty of dishes to keep us full.  the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>, basil mussels, steak with chimi churi sauce, and lobster mac and cheese were all amazing.  i didn't try anything i didn't like.\n\nthere were 4 of us and we all ordered 3-4 tapas a peice.  it was a great way for us to all catch up with each other after we hadn't seen each other for awhile while enjoying dinner. they timed the food perfectly so we never had too much on the table or were waiting for food. \n\nwe used the restaurant.com gift certificate which was a great deal so we were all able to get a few cocktails and dessert as well as the tapas for $43 a person. amazing deal. \n\nsave room for desert the creme brule came in original, rasberry, and pistachio, best <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> i've ever had. \n\nall in all best tapas and best place i've eaten at in a long long time!", 
            "2nd stop on my birthday extravaganza lead us to fleur.  my friend visited this place last year for her birthday and got to meet hubert keller in the flesh.  i wasn't so lucky lol but no worries.  we were here to enjoy some dessert and drinks after a great meal at mix.  \n\nalong with our drinks, we also got the grand marnier souffle and vanilla creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e.  i thought the <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> was on point!  it was served with a vanilla cream foam and fruit.  the <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> was served in a  rectangular dish which was suitable for 4 people to share off of.  the souffle was not as delightful in my opinion.  although i've had souffle before, this one had a strong egg odor.  it was served with orange flavored cream and ice cream.  as long as you mixed all the components, it was tolerable. \n\nthe best part of the evening came when our server brought a plate with 4 banana cream muffins, fruit, a lit candle and chocolate words reading, \"happy birthday.\"  such a great touch!  \n\nhaven't had dinner there, and from our desserts only, it was ok.  i will come back to try their enticing menu.  next time, i will raise my rating if hubert comes out to greet us! lol.", 
            "our group decided to go fancy for my bestie and my birthday dinner in vegas, so we ended here after reading good reviews. the restaurant has a classy ambiance - dim lighting, modern furniture, and fancy table top elements. (i thought the water cups were candle holders! they had an intricate damask design on them.)\n\nbecause we had a party of 10, we decided to order \"the feast.\" sounds daunting, right? don't worry - there was a lot of food! the feast includes almost everything from the menu. it's definitely enough food, but because most of them were small plates, not everyone got to try everything. out of all the dishes (minus desserts), the lobster mac n cheese really stood out. to be honest, not a lot of the dishes wow-ed me.\n\nby the end of dinner, i was the only girl in the group, so obviously, i ate the majority of the desserts. it was quite a happy birthday to me! their <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> was good, ice cream and sorbets were fresh, and oh my god, the cheesecake was ah-mazing! \n\ntheir service was great - they consistently brought out food, took away used plates, filled our water glasses, and made sure we had everything. they also brought out two birthday desserts to end our dinner, which was pretty sweet! for about $70 per person, it's definitely a nice celebratory-kind-of-restaurant to go to.", 
            "it took me a while to figure out if i wanted to give this place 3 or 4 stars, but i honestly felt like it wasn't deserving of the full 4 stars. i came here this past weekend for caroline t.'s birthday. we decided to take her somewhere nice that served foie gras and luckily fleur was in the hotel we were staying at. of course we all came here after a full day of drinking/partying at encore beach so we were a bit hungover. upon getting seated, we promptly asked for water and bread (to soak up the alcohol), but the waitress told me that they charged for bread which kind of put me in shock. now, this isn't the cheap asian in me coming out and not wanting to pay for it...but it was merely the principle of a fine dining establishment charging for bread. we had 6 girls in our group and they wouldn't even give the birthday girl one piece of bread, but we ordered it for her anyway. when she asked for a second piece they told her they were going to charge her for the second piece as well. i'm sorry, but that was just kind of left a bad taste in my mouth about this restaurant. \n\nanyway, moving along to the food i can honestly say i only loved two of the items from my whole meal (seared foie gras & <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark>). the seared foie gras was amazing and i enjoyed the pineapple pairing it had with it, however, i wasnt a huge fan of the shitake mushrooms. it was no biggie since i just pushed that aside and only devoured the foie gras and pineapple bits. i also had the croque monsieur, which upon the first few bites was good but got tiring really fast. i also had the ceviche and duck confit which were both delicious, but nothing that blew me away. my friends all ordered different things on the menu and no one loved what they got. the only dish that we all had a consensus of truly enjoying was the seared foie gras. one friend got the bone-in ribeye and was so unimpressed she only ate half of it. she said it was comparable to her mom's home cooked steak, and although her mom is a good cook, i would expect more from a fine dining establishment. my second favorite dish of my meal was the <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark>. it came out on a long thin rectangular plate, which made for the perfect custard base and burnt caramel ratio. the birthday girl got the grand mariner souffle which was also delicious, but i have had better before like at le papilion.\n\nall in all, i would probably try to find a better place in vegas if you want a mind blowing dining experience. sorry fleur...but you need to step up your game.", 
            "fleur was amazing dining.  my mom and i got the \"chef's experience\".  we are quasi-foodies.  we love food, love the presentation, and overall experience- but there are still some things that we just won't eat.  so, this chef's experience was perfect!! the chef comes out to your table and discusses your likes, dislikes, allergies, background, travels and experiences.  the chef then creates a five-course meal around everything you just shared with him.  each course was a surprise and of course it was decadent and delicious.   course one- <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark>  and shrimp ceviche served over avocado, pico de gallo and a cucumber gazpacho.  course two - onion and truffle soup shooter and crab cake with fresh mandarin slaw.   course three- lupe de mer (mediterranean sea bass with a crispy skin, served in a beurre blanc butter with artichoke hearts, tomatoes, cerrano chiles and olives)- this was the best fish dish i have ever had in my life- it literally made my cheeks tingle. course four - skirt steak with a three dipping sauces, potato puree with truffle jus and sauteed wild mushrooms. course five  - brownie pops, brownie, chocolate mousse, coated in dark chocolate and rolled in cocoa nibs and <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> with fresh berries.   chef alex came out at course three to present and to check on experience and he came back at the end of the meal for our feedback.  we raved of course and he allowed us to take our picture with him.  he was so personable and so open to our feedback.  the whole experience was outstanding.  during the evening our server was incredibly friendly and talked with us about all of the things to do in vegas.  the manager stopped by to check in with us and the other manager (brad weinstein) took a pic with his phone (my flash wasn't working) and messaged it to me immediately.  he then chatted with us for quite a while - he made us feel so familiar and welcomed.  this entire group is second to none!  some restaurants have airs (sometimes airs they do not deserve) but the welcoming staff made this ethereal experience unforgettable.  i can not say enough how much anyone who loves food should try this!!! the cost of the dinner was roughly $100 per person.  if you want a wine pairing it would be about $60 per person.   coffee and drinks are extra.", 
            "service was excellent but the restaurant was standard.\n\nwe made reservations for 7:30pm on a wednesday night. i knew it wouldn't be that crowded during that date but it is summer so i expected it to have more diners than the few i saw..\n\nfood is pricey and only standard. good but nothing wowed me. we had the michael jackson prefix. \n- mini tacos were decent - really cute\n- salad was normal\n- skirt steak was the best out of the whole meal - super juicy\n- salmon was normal - nothing special\n- the recommended squash as a side dish was normal - no special flavor\n- chocolate cake pops were super chocolatey - good but still just a cake pop\n- <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> was good but nothing special\n\noverall, i felt that for what we paid, i expected more flavor. \n\ndecor was nice and they had really cute cups for water.", 
            "i became acquainted with hubert through top chef (love the show!). i realized he has a restaurant in lv a few years ago, but wasn't able to dine there...so i made it a mission to dine there this time!\n\nas usual...i made reservations through opentable. i arrived with my party 15 minutes early. they had us wait for our reservation time. i thought that was strange... i never ran into a situation where a restaurant would not seat you early. once we were seated...i looked around and saw the dinning are was pretty much empty. so my question is.....why did i have to wait 15 minutes??\n\nthe menu is tapas style. it's similar to the way the asian culture eats, but portions are a lot smaller...and more expensive. my expectations were very high. we ordered the special which included a 3 course meal and 4 tapas.\n\nfor the 3 course--fish tacos, filet mignon, and <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark>.\nfor the 4 tapas--foie gras, corn soup, scallops, and octopus.\n\nthe most memorable were the foie, corn, scallops, and creme. in the foie, you could taste the love and attention put on the plate. from the sauce to the sorbet...it was something i have never had before. the corn soup was the equivalent to the lobster bisque at capital grille. creamy and light, but you definitely have to share if you want to try other things! the scallops came with a bowl of smoke covering it. you could taste the smoke and sweetness of the scallop. there was also tomato water...smells like tomato, but doesn't really have a taste. the <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> was hands down the best i have had so far. smooth and light. i did not feel guilty afterwards!\n\nthe low of the meal was the octopus. it was tender, but really salty and the sauce reminded me of jarred pasta sauce. (sorry! but it's the truth...) i wish i ordered the shrimp dish instead.\n\nservice was great. food was spectacular. i think they need to dust out the place because halfway through dinner, my allergies kicked up. i wish there was more light (just my personal preference). the hostess confused me a bit with the 15 minute wait...again, i have never been told to wait when i arrive early to a reservation...especially when there is clearly room in the restaurant.\n\ni would give it a 3 if i was in a bad mood. i look forward to dinning there again. maybe i'll sit outside and people watch next time, haha.", 
            "i was pleasantly surprised with our first experience at fleur! our meals at other \"high end\" places in vegas were somewhat disappointing, so it was great to finally have a good meal. mandalay bay is a really gorgeous place and we sat at a high-top just outside the restaurant. the service was great - our hostess and waitress were really attentive and nice. we even caught a glimpse of hubert keller visiting a table nearby!\n\nwe started with a shot of absinthe each. we had never had it before and fleur has a wide selection, complete with table side service. if you've never tried absinthe or had the experience of them \"making\" your drink next to our table, i highly recommend it. i ended up settling on the grilled octopus small plate and my boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese small plate. my octopus was delicious! it was layered with mushrooms and a delicious pepper aioli. the mac and cheese was creamy on the bottom and crispy and breaded on top, and the shrimp inside were cooked perfectly.\n\nfor dessert, we ordered the <mark><mark>Brownie Lollipops</mark></mark> and <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark>. the lollipops were okay but the <mark>Vanilla Creme Brulee</mark> was great. we would definitely go back and i would try the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tacos</mark> next. the menu, though not large, has a variety of dishes so there's likely something for just about everyone.",
