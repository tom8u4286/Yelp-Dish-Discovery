            "an affordable dining experience in paris, i mean vegas.  location was built out perfectly to the french theme.  they had tasty appetizers with the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> and the garlic simmered shrimp.  the burger was cooked well with a large amount of fries.  the bread that they serve before the meal can be, \"cut the top of your mouth hard\" so be careful.  a local recommended the french onion soup, but i totally forgot to get that.  great views if you get the outdoor seating!", 
            "this can be a stunning meal if you happen to snag a table on the patio across from the bellagio lake. if you're not able to do that, you're probably just as well off at any number of french bistros on the strip.\n\nthe food was good, but not particularly memorable. i ordered the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin which was ok, and noshed on <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> and cornichons (a must do whenever i eat french). our server was pretty good, but since it was busy we hardly saw  much of her.  she was prompt when we saw her, but 10-15 minutes would go by before we would see her again.\n\nit was a scorcher of a september day, but a patio table, a fountain show at bellagio, some cabernet, pate and cornichons - i was a happy camper. i would go back, perhaps if just for wine, pate and cornichons.", 
            "i do love the view here. i am a people watcher and can view the whole strip and watch the bellagio fountains. plus, it's rare that i get my \"perfect weather day\" in vegas so i bask outside whenever i can. \n\ni get very simple things here and they are good. i am a pate person- their <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>  and chicken liver mousse are happy pleasure of mine. (me= bread and charcuterie whore). i usually just snack and dont commit to serious eats while watching people so thats my usual. \n\nbreakfast i've had the butterscotch waffles with poached pears and it was a nice topping...sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. \n\ni have not had dinner here yet. \n\ni've gone off trying most breakfast/lunch items, but i just keep it to those simple three usually...not that the other items are bad. ive gotten a short rib cheese sammy, escargot, <mark>Scallops Gratinees</mark>, <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> and enjoyed each. \n\ni just like french simplicity to go for the view.", 
            "from looking at all the pictures on yelp, magr looked like a pretty casual  bistro feel eatery, but i guess at night it's oooh la la time! i made reservations for a group of 7 and we were seated within 15 minutes  at  round table in the corner.  it was the perfect spot!  when you look up, the celings are so high and the hanging lamps were very rustic looking! i loved that they sat us at a round table.  i hate when you have a large group and they seat you in a rectangle shaped table where you have to lean forward to talk or look at the person you are talking to.  \n\nfood:\nwe started with the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> which was too course for my palate.  we were deciding between the country or the mousse, but we all thought the mousse would be too moussey ( is that a word?).  the flavor was spot on, however i would of liked the texture a little smoother.  it was hard to spread on the break because, well it doesn't really spread!\n\nthe escargots were very tasty and even better when you ask for extra bread and dip it in the left over garlic pesto sauce.  \n\ni think we asked for bread 3 times, and i over heard our waiter say to another waiter, they want more bread???  haha. yes we like our french bread, is that a crime?  \n\ni ordered soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> which happened to be cream of garlic.  could this be a better match for me?  i happen to love garlic so of course i had to order the soup.  it was so good that my two friends sitting on either side of me kept dipping their bread in my bowl!  i was happy to share... they gave such a huge bowl!\n\nfor my entree i decided to go with the scallops gratin which was an appetizer, but by the time this arrived, i was already so full!  the scallops were very flavorful.  in every bite you can taste the caramelized onion, gruyere, parmesan, and garlic.  you however, don't really taste the scallops at all.  this is definitely an appetizer to share.  eating four of these bad boys will leave our mouth thirsty for water the whole night!  this is definitly my kinda dish as i love all these flavors, but maybe one would suffice! =p\n\ni tried a few of the other dishes, seared scallops ( it was very fishy and very scallopy.  i would give this dish 2 *.), steak with herbed butter ( the steak was kinda thin and tough 3*).  \n\noverall, the experience, ambiance, and food was pretty good.  i recommend this for those looking for a romantic restaurant at a good price ( sit outside and watch the bellagio fountain), or those with big groups looking to get a great value in vegas!\n\nfyi be careful of the paper covered table.  i got a huge paper cut from it!", 
            "so i decided i wanted to take my bf out to a nice lunch, i of course went to my handy dandy yelp app on my phone. we got waiter #32 he gave us some amazing recommendations (i think that he should be promoted to a tag with his name instead of his number) we started off with the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> it was impressive , i've had better though. then with the recommendation of our waiter i had the scallops ammmaaaziinngg. i then ordered the escargot. wow!! the sauce it comes with was so good i was wetting my bread in it to, it was perfectly buttery and garlicky. if i couldve licked the plate i would've. :)  we also had a pitcher of frangria their version of sangria so awesome. my bf had the steak cant remember the name but the sauce was wow amazing perfectly cooked, the waiter was really attentive and kept checking on us. would bring us fresh bread whenever our was out. we were stuffed so really werent sure if we wanted to have desert, our waiter recommended the bread pudding. now mind you i hate bread pudding and so does my bf, but we decided to go out on a limb, wow oh wow!!!!!!!!!!! must have, one of the best deserts i've had. the ambiance was really enjoyable we people watched and enjoyed the breeze and the sun. over all experience ammmaaazzziiiinnnggg!!! definitely will be back for brunch!", 
            "07/06/10\n\nsure, mon ami gabi serves mostly tourists, but the service and their food was phenomenal.\n\nthree of us had a bottle of jean-louis ros\\u00e9 sparkling wine. to start, we had chilled cucumber soup, frisee and <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>, <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>, and escargots. it's worth to come here just for their bread, we had three.\n\nthe salad was made french style, lightly dressed and refreshing, just like the soup. pate and escargots were very appetizing, along with our view of bellagio's fountain on the patio.\n\nwe finished our lunch with double daily sorbet (green apple) and macchiato with a shot of amaretto. i wished they had sweet crepe for desert!\n\np.s. elizabeth was a very attentive and good server!", 
            "this review pertains to the lunch menu.\n\nthe skinny: gabi is not your friend - while the view est magnifique,  the food n'est pas tres bien (2.5), service: efficient but tries too hard with the \"mon-sir\" and \"bon-jouer\" (3), value: not that great considering the level of cuisine (2).\n\nwe've been to mon ami gabi for lunch a couple of times mostly because of the spectacular view of the bellagio. accordingly, the food is a bit overpriced for what it is. \n\nwe subscribe to the \"lettuce entertain you\" rewards so i got a $15 gift card on my birthday. we ventured here for lunch (with an opentable reservation).\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>, the butter lettuce salad (with asparagus, beets, and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>), and the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>. we've previously tasted their lovely skate dish and their great burgers but we decided to try something different this time. \n\nbad move.\n\nthe butter lettuce salad was meager for a $10 dish. a small dish of butter lettuce with some scatterings of asparagus and beets underneath. an overly large slice of <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> (closer to a feta cheese than a chevre) made the salad overly salty. the dressing, a creamy concoction reminescent of ranch, just doesn't work with the texture of the lettuces (it's too heavy) nor the flavours.\n\nthe <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> is yet again, overly large portion of meat with only 4 thin slices of bread. the pate is not quite what we expected. there's too much meat, not enough fat which made the pate hard to spread and not nearly as decadent as it ought to be (it might be unfair but i had a great pate at fleur de lys a day ago).\n\nfinally, the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>. at a place like this, a <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> ought to be better. first of all, no bechamel sauce - you can't have a high end croque without a nice bechamel sauce. 'nuff said. bread sliced too thinly (making it too hard when toasted), with very little in the way of ham or cheese, it was hard to justify the $12 pricetag. the bread was also a trifle greasy for my tastes. the accompanying frites were okay - more like chips than fries.\n\ndespite her really laboured/butchered french , the waitress herself was efficient, prompt and kind. she checked on us frequently enough and ensured our beverages were always filled.\n\noverall, it was an okay experience but i have definitely eaten more authentic french cuisine at a better value. (fyi -the above three items plus a diet coke would have cost well over $30 if we didn't have the giftcard.)", 
            "i was a little dubious at going from chicago to las vegas and ending up at yet another lettuce entertain you restaurant, but i was staying at the paris and the location right along las vegas boulevard and looking at the bellagio fountains was very nice.  \n\nmy friend and i went for a late lunch.  i had an okay glass of pouilly fuisse at $12, a $15 cheese flight of okay but grocery-store quality cheese and then we got the oysters.\n\nmy friend very much wanted to treat me to something special and ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell.  they came to the table and we both looked at each other and hesitated because they smelled really fishy.  however, we both tried one and both had the same reaction: there was no way we were eating more.  \n\ni called the waiter over, let him know that we found the oysters fishy but that it might just be us and there was no need to take them off the bill.  his response? \"whatever.  they're milky and people love them but if you don't like them i'll take them away.\"  and he did.  we ordered the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> and my friend got a <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> that she liked.  the pate was okay, but the service was crap from that point on, of course.\n\noh, and the french bread sucked.  i should have known after so many lettuce entertain you disappointments here in chicago that this would be no better.  i felt really bad that my friend shelled out $75 for such a mediocre lunch.", 
            "we've eaten here twice while visiting vegas.  this last time was within the past week.  we made reservations for lunch and were seated outside.  the waitress was friendly and attentive.  we ordered the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> plate for an appetizer and i ordered a quiche while my husband ordered a sandwich.  i enjoyed the quiche but thought the sandwich was lacking a bit...then again i'm not a huge sandwich fan.  anyhow the bread and butter is always yummy and i do recommend the quiche which was delicious.  the pate was okay but i didn't know that the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> was more on the chunkier side, so if you like a more mousse like pate then maybe try the chicken liver one.", 
            "whoot whoot. while we didn't sit outside on the patio, we sat in there nice atrium in the strong sunshine. it was a nice end of the trip meal...\n\nthey have a bloody mary bar. we sat near it. you order whatever vodka you want and they bring you a huge glass of it. you then take this glass and bring it over to the bloody mary bar. you can choose tomato juice or clamato juice... you can then add an assortment of olives, there are pickled beans, fresh horseradish... oh and they have pepperoni sticks. i saw people walking away with their glasses filled to the brim and with side plates filled with extras. \n\nafter placing our order with our wonderful waiter, he brought us soft baguettes with butter. our waiter was so friendly and so engaging. he was fairly attentive for a busy sunday. he made suggestions and knew a lot about the menu. he also brought me refills of coke without me even having to ask. \n\nwe got there during brunch, but i had lunch. hmm, while my friends ate burgers, eggs benny and corned beef hash, i had the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> and the <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> with bacon. sigh. i could have sat here all day. the pate was really good. it was firm and the top was covered in bacon. it came with some toast, cornichons and a big dollop of grainy mustard. i didn't really need the mustard and shamefully ate most of the pate with my fork. yum yum. my <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> was nicely tossed with the right amount of vinaigrette. i love the soft, runny poached egg. i love breaking that yolk and seeing the golden thickness coat the curly lettuce. oh, and there is bacon. yes, and lots of it.", 
            "on our last night in vegas i took my wife here for a late dinner. this location had been recommended by a local for the romantic atmosphere. we sat on the patio which sits facing the bellagio. we didn't eat until almost 8pm, the fountains where putting on their show every 15 minutes giving it a little extra to the atmosphere.\n\n the service was remarkable. our waiter was very helpful and friendly, answering my questions. he asked if we wanted a bottle of wine. at first i said no, but changed my mind as it was our last night in vegas and i wanted to have a special dinner with my wife. of course i know nothing about wine. my palette is mainly attuned for beer and spirits. the waiter asked some questions then made a recommendation. his recommendation was spot on. i really wish i could remember the name of the wine as we both loved it. \n\nfor an appetizer we ordered the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>. we both enjoyed it. it had a rich flavor, but it wasn't overpowering. it was a great way to start the meal. \n\nthe main course my wife wanted the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> for two: lobster, shrimp, oysters, tuna tartar and seaweed salad. the shrimp were huge. the lobster was delicious and cooked perfectly. my wife didn't like the oysters, but i enjoyed them. the tuna tartar had a great flavor and was combined with avocado that helped balance out the tuna. neither one of us liked the seaweed salad, but i think that's a personal taste issue. the best part of the meal was the sauce they provided for the lobster, it was like a horseradish mustard. the tasted fantastic! definitely worth a try. \n\nwe contemplated ordering dessert, but we were both full. \n\nif you go, and the weather is right, i would recommend sitting on the patio. the combination of the fountains, the d\\u00e9cor and being able to watch people walking up and down the strip made for a fun evening. \n\noverall the entire experience was amazing. i would definitely go back if i ever go to vegas again.", 
            "this is one of the first popular yelp places i've been disappointed with. hopefully the loud foul mouthed guy at the next table wasn't one of you. first you can't see the fountains across the street unless you can get a coveted patio table. and the inside is quite loud. our server was nice but would disappear for long stretches. the tables were small and cleared too infrequently. as for the food, my husband and i both enjoyed our steaks. he had the hanger and i had the filet. he liked the pommes frites served on the side, while i would rather have had some other potato entree. they seemed like cheap filler for the plate to me. skip the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> (bland) and the cheese plate was uninteresting and the slices quite small. my son's french onion soup was presented beautifully but lacked the salty velvety texture of a good french onion. we had a few cocktails too. a standout was a good stout \"french manhattan\". desserts were average as well. my favorite was my husband's profiteroles while the table liked the bananas foster. but i thought the crepes were gummy. not a repeat!", 
            "huge scallops, perfect sear, yummy veloute? why not? my husband's pork was perfectly cooked though you must request medium rare--they tend towards medium well otherwise. apps were nothing special: the warm brie was tasty, the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> was nice, the duck confit leg was merely acceptable. but in this pricy town, mon ami gabi is a rare thing--a mid range priced restaurant with good quality food. back home, i wouldn't recommend this restaurant but in vegas it is the americana version of classic french bistro without breaking the bank. did i mention those big, juicy scallops? gabi is definitely mon ami. dude, even the name is super americanized--there should be an \"e\" at the end of ami if gabi is female, non?", 
            "surprisingly charming, mag succeeds as an oasis amidst the tinsel town glitter. for a vegas theme eatery, the interior is surprisingly classy and romantic, but the best seats as many have said are outside on the terrace overlooking the bellagio water works. \n\na supplemental gluten-free menu, which includes complementary g.f. bread with butter and (wonderful!) roasted olives, was most appreciated. the \"real\" wheat bread comes in a paper bag, which seemed a little odd and out of sync with the otherwise chic vibe.\n\nstarter of a <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> was a little disappointing, with the greens seemingly undressed and couched on a puddle of water. the rustic <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> was a delight though, very flavorable and on request served with triangles of g.f. toast. the main meals of frites, and steaks, were tasty, though my dining partner's was somewhat chewy though mine was tender.\n\nservice was very professional and very french. so if you're not a native parisian or can't fake the accent, don't look for employment here.", 
            "celebrated 2 birthdays here! yay! we made reservations and were seated right away. there was a 1 hr wait to sit outside where you are right on the strip but we came to eat not to be seen stuffing our faces and loosening our belts. \n\nappetizer: ordered the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> as it was suggested by the waiter but they accidentally served us the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>. well, we accidentally ate 3/4 of it before the waiter noticed and replaced it for the correct one. (yay, since we got to try both for free!!!) \n\nfrench onion soup - wow, this is meant for sharing!!\n1 1/2 ft baguette - love warm bread\nny steak w/handcut fries - perfectly cooked medium rare as i requested. i should mention that my plate looked like i ordered fries w/ a side of steak. i don't think anyone at our table finished the fries!\n\nsteak was good and the pate was good but not exceptional that i would rave on and on about. but if you want a decent meal for a good price then this is the spot. 3.5 stars from me.", 
            "restaurant was nicely set up. i love the patio seating and being able to people watch :) \n\ni had a much higher expectation for service so i was a bit disappoint. the food was good. we had the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> and the scallop entree. both were good. we also had a salad which was just okay, nothing special. the menu read really well but there was something lacking when it arrived.\n\nour server, #71, was the only thing that made our dining experience not so impressive. she was boring and wasn't willing to really give us any suggestions or details. she made us feel like we were such an inconvenient to her. i wished we would have sat in another section. \n\nit's shouldn't matter if we were there for lunch or dinner, service is such an important aspect of dining that it shouldn't be neglected.\n\noverall, it was an okay experience. this is definitely a place that i might want to come back to give it another chance. hopefully, we won't get the same server.\n\nhappy eating!", 
            "i love this restaurant! we went during the week so we didn't have to worry about long waits. we made a reservation anyway and got to sit at an awesome table facing the bellagio fountains. \n\nservice was great--our server had a super thick french accent which could be difficult to understand, but at least he wasn't snobby in the least. \n\nour order:\ndrink: frangria 3 stars. (sangria with rosemary) - rosemary was overwhelming, and the drink was incredibly sweet. it was okay but i wouldn't order it again.\n\nappetizers:\n<mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>: 5 stars. i love pate. <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>, classic, terrines of all sorts. this one had a nice meaty texture to it, and i loved the bread and mustard it was served with. would definitely order this again. they also have a chicken liver mousse on the menu that i want to try. next time!\n\nmixed salad with kale: 4 stars. can't remember too much about this salad, but it was good, from what i can recall.\n\n<mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> (boyfriend's order): 5 stars. the rest of the trip, we were talking about coming back to get more of these mussels!!! we ordered a half-order for $10.95 and they were big, tender, and that broth was amazing and perfectly seasoned. best dish of the meal for sure! ***tip: the resto gives you a loaf of bread at the beginning of the meal. save it for sopping up the broth. too good.\n\nbone-in ribeye: 4 stars: perfectly seasoned and very well cooked, but excessively fatty (not marbled--we're talking chunks of fat). i also had a bit of gristle in mine but it wasn't much. the fries that come with the rib eye are so good. it's like a potato chip made babies with a french fry. crispy and tasty and awesome and they soak up the meat juice and become little crispy meat-juice carriers. my mouth is watering at the thought of it.\n\nscallops with ratatouille (boyfriend's order): 4 stars. the scallops (order came with 4 or 5 large scallops) were perfectly cooked--tender and flavorful. the basil pairing was perfect. the ratatouiile was just okay according to him. plate portion was on the smaller side, but the awesomeness of the scallops made that okay for him.\n\nwe will definitely be back, especially for the pate and mussels. for the price and ambiance (especially if you can get a table overlooking the bellagio fountains), it can't be beat!", 
            "always loved the chicago original, and nice to say they do a great job here, too. the food and drink and execution in the pretty bistro made for a couple nice occasions. pre-show, had the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> along with the frites with some wine and champagne. near enough to the theatre, we lounged for a half hour at the bar, had some witty banter with the bartender and enjoyed ourselves. the pate hit the spot -- served with delicious mustard atop, with toast points, olives, cocktail onions etc. \n\nthe frites are, in fact, flat! but very tasty -- not oily at all, and perfectly crisp. it took maybe 28 seconds for them to appear after ordered. mmmmm.\n\nthe next day, we returned for a light breakfast. intelligentsia coffee, so nice to see you. and the market berry waffle worked great for me. fresh berries alongside the crisp on the outside, soft on the inside waffles. i asked for the whipped cream on the side so i could monitor my indulgence! the real syrup was a nice component as well. i ordered a side of poached eggs, too, which helped fill me up more completely. the bircher muesli was outstanding -- and apparently not easy to make. if you're so inclined, go for it. the mimosa was a nice reminder of having a lazy sunday. \n\nloved also to sit inside but right near the outdoor deck. it's so airy and light out there; really the best of both worlds. and it's a marvel to occasionally see the tactical units circling round to insure the flow of traffic in and out works seamlessly.",

            "had reservations thru open table, no problems, we arrived early since all of the bad reviews about wait times even with reservations.  they seated us right away, earlier than expected, yea. a nice french bistro fare, with a good wine list.  great decor inside and outside fresco dinign with a view of the bellagio fountain and hustle and bustle of the vegas strip. appetizers looked awesome, especially the escargots, <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> and <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark>.  husband had the french onion soup, crust with gruyere cheese and crunchy en crouton on top.  i had the gaspacho, sooooo yummy, fresh tomatoes, splash of spanish vinegar over crunchy cucumbers and creamy avocados, i have to reverse engineer this recipe!  salmon with quinoa was fresh and fabulous, the skate in lemon sauce looked good, but i had the seafood in broth, fresh fish, scallops, in a lemon herb white wine broth, soo good and fresh, no room for dessert, but next time!   you hve to try their frangria, beaujolais, conjac, fresh juices and a hint of rosemary..yummy!  have to come back and taste more!", 
            "the wife and i were invited to join another couple for sunday brunch at mon ami gabi.  it was late morning on a beautiful, clear, sunny january day.  it was so nice on this particular day; we knew it would be a shame to not eat outside on mon ami gabi's patio overlooking the strip across from the bellagio.  we didn't have reservations, not that it would've helped, since outside dining was first come, first served.  as luck would have it, a table was available immediately for our party and we were treated to a four top up against the rail with an unobstructed strip-side view of passersby.  needless to say, it's one of the best people watching spots on the strip.  \n\nwe started off by sharing orders of the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> ($10.95) and the trio of artisan cheeses ($15.95).  the portion of pate was surprisingly generous and a great starter.  the cheeses, while delicious, were nothing terribly special or unique and probably a bit overpriced compared to the seeming value of the pate and what we received for the rest of our meal.  the wife and i split orders of the warm chicken & <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> ($12.95) and the butternut squash & brie quiche ($13.95).  the grilled chicken and brie was topped with caramelized onions and thin slices of green apple.  it was a nice-looking and tasting sandwich and an overall winner.  the quiche was tasty, as well, possessing a nice and buttery, flaky crust.  the amount of food was plentiful for the price.   \n\nfor a national chain restaurant, mon ami gabi impressed me enough to want to check out its location much closer to our home in northern virginia.  mon ami gabi served up a solid meal made all the more special by its singular al fresco dining experience.  if you go, go on a good weather day, and sit outside!", 
            "the wife decided to get all dolled up so how can i not take her to a classy establishment for a great dinner. funny enough.. this place wasn't my first choice but got chosen because of the fact they open late and we got distracted working up a sweat before getting ready.\n\nmade a reservation. got there on time and was immediately seated outside with a view of the bellagio fountains. matt was our main server. i say main because a few others were coming by to help drop off food or clean up.\n\nwe ordered some drinks (sidecar #43 and forgot the other one) and the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> to start off with the warm bread and whipped butter. the bread and butter was delicious. the sidecar was extremely sweet which neither my wife or i was a fan of. the other drink wasn't worth remembering.. neither great nor horrible. the pate wasn't bad. it was worth eating but i've had better.\n\ni ordered the 22oz ribeye and my wife ordered the chicken. considering the fact our server talked up cuts and mentioning it was what they were famous for.. i honestly wasn't impressed. i've had far better steaks for far less.\n\noh! i also got the garlic spinach and creamed cauliflower on the side. the spinach was nothing to write home about but the creamed cauliflower was delicious and creamy. definitely would get again if i were to come back. \n\nalso one of the server's gaze seemed to come to rest on my wife's cleavage (clay-vaahge) quite often. i was going to say something but i do realize how great it is so i let it slide. haha.", 
            "came here for my birthday dinner with a special friend.  he made sure to get a nice table between the inside and outside with the perfect view of the fountains at bellagio.  the staff were friendly and helpful.  the food was amazing.\n\nwe got...\nescargot - delicious!\nsalmon tartar- perfection!!\nduck <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> - delicious!\ntrout almandine - light and well seasoned fresh fish that came with perfectly steamed beans.\n\neverything was perfect and the cherry on top was the cr\\u00e8me brulee.  had one of the best birthdays here with my friend.  looking forward to coming back and trying other things on the menu.", 
            "having lived in france and visited numerous times, i would say mon ami gabi is a french bistro style restaurant.  bistros have limited menu choices, the items are usually simple, and the service tends to be quick and efficient.  the food here is decent, although a bit inconsistent at times.  but the service was anything but quick or efficient.  after we sat down it took a long time for them to take our order.  once our orders were taken, it was 30 minutes before our <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> arrived, a dish that requires minimal preparation.  it was another long wait before our main dishes came.  my steak frites was generously portioned, cooked to my liking, and very flavorful.  my gf's seared scallops though were overly charred, and left a burned taste in our mouths.  \n\nnow despite the slow service, and the mishap on the food, here's why i'm giving them 4 stars --- the staff and management really took care of us.  when i made a complaint to my waiter about the scallops.  he had it replaced quickly.  then the manager came out to apologize personally, and comp'ed the appetizers and the glass of wine.  i think that kind of attention and care to your customers is very rare these days, especially from a big and busy restaurant on the strip.  so i think they deserve a compliment for that!", 
            "this has always been one of my favorite spots in vegas to eat simply because it is consistently good and the service always spot on.\n the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>',  <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> with bacon and egg is always a big hit, there crepes are a little thick for my taste but the fillings are always great. i love the bloody mary bar, when i go for sunday brunch,  steak  frites  is a signature and though it is not as good as  steak frites in nyc it is still fantastic. the waitstaff is always attentive in a european style, and are quick with answers.  excellent service makes many small issues in a restaurant forgiveable", 
            "my go to place to bring out of towners when i have to go to the strip. for a strip outlet, it's a solid four stars but unsure if i'd be as wow'ed if in a local part of town. the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> is good as well as the wine selection. \n\non my last visit had the scallops. would give them a miss. the side of liquid squash did no favors and felt like i was eating baby food. my friend's steak was ok, just ok.", 
            "maybe it was because this was one of many amazing meals i had that week or maybe it was because i had one too many sangrias, but i thought this place was just okay.\n\ni am thinking that it has such high reviews because for the price you are getting everything at, you are getting a great deal. it is a higher-end, nicer sit-down meal, but it is not the best you are going to find in vegas, nor the worst. \n\nwe started with the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>, which was excellent. we also got the warm brie cheese which was divine - i don't even like brie cheese but i found myself eating more and more of it.\n\nfor my main course, i got the beranise steak frites. it was cooked correctly, but i just did not find anything special about it. i had also had a few steaks earlier in the week that specialized in different types of steaks, so it could be that my review is skewed because of that.\n\nthe ambiance of the place is also really nothing special either. like most restaurants in vegas, the tables are too close together, so you feel like you are dining with the couples on either side of you. we had a reservation for 6:30pm and didn't get seated until 7pm, so that was a little off-putting as well. it was noisy, but not so loud that i couldn't carry on a conversation at the table.\n\noverall, i would recommend this place to someone who is not a foodie, but is looking to have a nice sit-down meal at an affordable price for las vegas standards. for someone who is looking for a really good meal, i would send them elsewhere.", 
            "after reading others reviews about the steak frites and location we decided to give it a try. it has a great location where you can watch bellagios fountain show if seated on patio. we were seated quickly and orders taken quickly. the baguette and butter is really good although we would've loved french cultured butter for the bread but it was still good. we had the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> for appetizer which was a healthy portion size with onions and cornichones and toast yummy. for mains we ordered steak frites which was well cooked,a nice portion and tasty, hubby had moules which he said was very tasty with lots of sauce, og portion as well. overall a nice experience we would return as the servers were attentive and food flavorful and plentiful for price.", 
            "my plus1 wanted steak. i go to yelp & there are lots of places listed for $$$$ & 3/5 rating. mag has $$ & 4/5 rating. the rating should be higher than the $s, is how i see it. plus mag has that magnet patio and the weather was perfect for using it. we get in line & they give us a beeper. my plus1 goes off to play the slots in paris casino. i go to the restroom. beeper goes off in about 10 minutes and we are escorted to primo patio seating, hugging the rails separating mag from the sidewalk. i feel gawd d** lucky, like hitting big on slots or lotto! lol\n\nplus1 orders steak merlot and i order quiche w/bacon, 2 drinks(both for me) and <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>. the quiche is perfect, light the crust barely noticeable. omg! i get some steak from my plus1. it's good. i take a few bites but prefer my deliciously light quiche. plus1 takes the steak back. :-)  no room for dessert. we finish lunch about 12:45. we had planned to eat dinner but lunch last us all day. i did not even snack later. had a few drinks later but no more food for the day. so the $80 lunch bill does not so seem excessive at all by the end of our day. having this experience, so cheap, made it so worthwhile. \n\ni \"heart\" mag!", 
            "love that i made a reservation about 20 minutes before arriving and got seated right away.. i love how they walked us to our seat into a bright room with a view of the bellagio fountain. we came in for my wifes birthday for lunch and was really excited to come here. i really dont have too much to say bout how good this place was because it was just a mediocre experience so lets get to what we ordered.\n\nfresh baked french bread (really good had 2 loafs there and 1 to take home)\nhousmade <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> (least favorite)\n<mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>\n<mark>Scallops Gratinees</mark> (favorite)\nsteak frites roquefort (really good)\ncaramel creme brulee (great dessert)\n\ni really could have done without the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> because it totally changed the whole dining experience if you know what i mean. the prices here really make you think thats affordable but the portions dont support it. its a spot for the tourists for sure. i like the steak frites but since i eat steak so much and know it was just flap steak served with some fries i know that they were just playing it safe which is fine. i wouldnt mind eating here again but i know now that i should stick to certain things maybe my next experience would bump them up to a confident 4star rating. thank you for the food.", 
            "this is about my 5th visit of mon ami gabi. the menu has changed slightly and they no longer have the baked brie, but they do have some fun new stuff like a \"pulled pork bahn mi\" (not very french, but it was tasty). \n\nsteak frites is always a safe option and it comes with a variety of sauces to choose from. my favorite is still the au poirve, which is the peppercorn brandy sauce. the baguette they serve you is very tasty and i try very hard to not fill up on it, but how can you owe up a hot and fresh baguette?\n\nthe <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> is also quite yummy but mild in flavor, which i don't mind. it comes with area pieces of toasty bread, whole grain mustard, a few sprigs of fresh watercress, and well as a variety of pickled items. it's a yummy starter to share, but a little much to eat all on your own as a starter. \n\ndecent french food on the strip with a magnificent view of bellagio's water show. opt to sit outdoors for this.", 
            "the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> was excellent! really great. the low stars are for the steak frites. can't trust a french restaurant that can't do a good steak. easiest dish to nail because you let the cow do most the work. it's like the steak was cooked in too much liquid. no sear and practically boiled. meh!", 
            "my family and i have lived here since 1989. i absolutely love going to mon ami gabi. every time we go there we always request to get seated outside to get a great view of the bellagio fountains. during the spring and fall is the perfect time to sit outside. i would only sit out there at night if you are here in the summer. i highly recommend you make reservations as well through opentable or calling to request this seating in advance. \n\nthe bread is buttery with a smooth butter spread. the last time we went my boyfriend ordered the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> and i had the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>. i personally enjoyed the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> more because of the rich tomato sauce. the pate was also delicious especially on that warm toast. \n\nwe shared the french onion soup, which was tasty. it was not too salty and the cheese was melted well over the bread. probably one of the best french onion soups i have had in vegas. \n\nfor the main course, i had the steak frites <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> and my boyfriend had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>. if you enjoy a creamy peppercorn sauce then get the <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>. i recommend the filet mignon as a must for first-timers. the steak was so soft and juicy. the merlot sauce pushed the experience to the next level. my taste buds were ecstatic to enjoy something so decadent. the filet mignon here is the best for those who do enjoy tender meat. we both got ours medium. \n\nour sides were the frites (fries) and the brussel sprouts. enjoyed them both as well! however, we did see the whipped cauliflower and the sauteed mushrooms pass by our table, which also looked delicious so i would recommend trying those if you want lighter sides. \n\nfor dessert, we shared the creme brulee. it was a decent size. the top was crisp and the custard was excellent. i highly recommend this dish as well. the ambiance was perfect for a beautiful date night, birthday celebration, or anytime you are feeling fancy for great steak. service was excellent! i love how authentic it was to have someone from france wait on us. it really brought the experience together."

            "mon ami is a wonderful bistro -- great service & a lovely menu.\n\nwe were there around lunch time -- so we went with a <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> mousse with the three cheese plate. definitely enough for two for lunch. absolutely delicious & the baguette, butter and an excellent by the glass wine selection definitely hit the spot.  the mousse was topped with a divine mustard & merlot reduction -- didn't look real appealing, but the flavor was spot on.  our cheese plate included a roquefort, brie & a mild cheddar like cheese, in addition to the dried currants, raisins, nuts, sliced apples, etc.  perfect!\n\nwe sat inside, so no view of the bellagio fountains or the people on the sidewalk, yet we enjoyed the comfy & club feel to the bistro furnishings.  \n\nour waiter was great -- confirmed & redirected (as necessary our wine selection).  we are not knowledgable of french wines vis a vis us wines, so his input was definitely useful.\n\nlunch was $65, with 3 glasses of wine.  a great deal -- for a great lunch.\n\nwe had intended to make breakfast, but overslept -- we will definitely make it there either for breakfast or dinner -- both menus looked great!", 
            "there are a handful of stalwarts on the strip, a constant stream of new offerings, and several mediocrities that survive by inertia. few moderate venues put in the effort to maintain themselves. mon ami gabi is different. after about ten years in the same location, the room looks as new (or new-old) as the day it opened. really! the tile floors are spotless! the paint is fresh. the waitstaff are far from complacent. and the food is delivered hot and correct, starting with the complimentary warm baguette and carrot relish. \n\nmodeled after an idealized parisian bistro--but thankfully not overburdened by the clich\\u00e9 lautrec prints--mag is deceptively big (nearly 400 seats) but divided into several different sections--depending on your mood, you can sit in a dark, book-lined bar room, a warmly lit interior, a comfortable but energetic pavilion, or a boisterous strip-side patio. the menu follows traditional french brasserie food, but goes the extra mile in terms of variety. thus the menu includes a vegetarian sampler, fish choices including skate, a good looking short rib, and over 10 different steak frites varieties. my steak bordelaise was, well, perfect. their ribbon-style fries didn't impress though--true french frites, in my experience, are actually very close to mcdonald's, believe it or not. the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> was a healthy portion. prices are not shockingly low, but for the strip, strike a relative value. there's no reason you can't have that romantic dinner here for 100 dollars, instead of spending 300 somewhere else. consistency is a quality to be praised in any restaurant--in one wth a prime strip position that could easily coast on its vantage point, it's almost a wonder.",

            "another trip to vegas mean another stop at mon ami gabi. i just can't get enough of this place. the food was just as good as before, but the service was ehh this time around. i missed the waitress from before. our waiter this time around was here and there but no connection. \n\nas always, we had the french onion soup, a small salad, and the liver platter. the french onion soup was just how i remember it to be. hot and gooey from the melted cheese and warming with caramelized onions and the broth. the starter salad was just mixed greens with a light vinaigrette. simple yet tasty. the liver platter was a first and it did not disappoint. you get a generous slice of <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark>. it comes with sliced crusty french baguette and pickled mini onions and gherkins. it doesn't taste like <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> at all. it's very soft and creamy in texture. \n\nfor our group's entrees, we had the mussels that was steamed in white wine, burger <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>: open face duck burger stuffed with cheese, open faced ham and cheese sandwich, chicken and apple crepe, the ever so <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>, and scallops. the mussels was fresh and delicious. it was great with the baguettes to soak up all the sauce. the burger <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> was not up to par as before. it was really gamey and needed something to counter balance that taste. but it was good nonetheless, if you like gamey duck. the opened faced ham and cheese was just good. you get a lot of the gooey cheese if you love cheese. it had a comfort food feeling attached to it. the scallops was not as big as the previous visit and it seemed a little bit overcooked this time around. the apple crepe was gigantic. it's a mix of savory and sweet. the chicken the the sliced granny smith apples goes really well together along with the white alfredo sauce. it's definitely bigger than the normal crepes you can get at the crepe stand inside paris. the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> was just like the previous time, wonderfully eggy. \n\neverything was just soo yummy. i think we came in with high expectations from last time so we were a little bummed. it's still nice to see the water show from bellagio across the street every 15 minutes tho!  see you in a few months...", 
            "delicious everything, great service, great setting and inside a hotel i'm very fond of. came for a nice dinner out with my mom while she was in town and i wanted to try mon ami gabi; it was definitely the right choice. our waiter was very attentive without being overbearing (that's hard to do since he came around often but was just so polite and not pushy at all). we had reservations for 8 pm and when we arrived had a 10 minute wait, so we went to the bar to grab drinks in that time. i had a bloody mary and my mom had a lemon drop martini (very good). we were seated just in front of the kitchen so there was a lot of traffic going by. in some restaurants i think it can be annoying but it didn't bother me here. everyone seems very professional, which is how it should be! a lot of people dress up but there are also others dressed casually, so whatever floats your boat, but they do have a no sleeveless shirts requirement for men.\n\ni had the french onion soup (yum), my mother had the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> which she absolutely loved (i don't really like or dislike pate so my opinion is void), and then we shared the hanger steak (the merlot butter was so delicious) and the seared <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>. i ordered the steak medium rare but would get medium next time since it was a little tough to cut. those are seriously the best scallops i've ever had, tasty and soooo tender. my mother also had 2 glasses of the sauvignon blanc which was very very smooth. what was refreshing to me was the music. it wasn't just piano instrumentals to fall asleep to, but they played a lot of norah jones mixed in with contemporary soft rock/pop songs. that might sound weird how i'm describing it but it was contemporary while still being appropriate for the setting.\n\nour total was just over $100 including drinks and tip which i completely think is worth it for fine dining without being stuffy and amazing food all around. we were too full for dessert but i'll definitely be back for that steak and to experiment with their specialty drinks menu. i'd also like to sit outside when the weather isn't too hot, it's fun to people watch!", 
            "this review is long overdue. by my count i have been here over 15 times and to vegas now over 70 ... \nwe all know that this place so hard to be french, the menu, the atmosphere, the wine, the waiters outfits .... who cares! they do one thing right -the food!!!!\nin my opinion, a pace that starts dinner with slated butter and a warm baguette is already really high on the culinary spectrum. over 15 times and food is still fantastic. fillet had the prefect temperature, the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> is served just the right way with the miniature gherkins and onions. it's paradise, especially if you can score the outdoor table on a perfect evening where you can watch the bellagio fountains and the people passing by. \none thing of note: it is a tourist trap but than again the entire las vegas strip is so if you are not happy with something coming from the kitchen let the staff know and they will gladly take care of it. \nwe highly recommend reservations as this place tends to get booked on weekends. the food is good and by vegas strip standards is priced fair,\nbon apetit!!!!",

            "mmmm get the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark>.  fantastic and so smooth.  \n\nthe steak was also excellent.  very tender and cooked deliciously.  the fries were a bit too salty for my tastes, honestly.  \n\ntarte tatin for dessert was very rich.", 
            "came here for a late dinner, and waited forever for patio seating, but it was definitely worth the wait. sitting at the patio, we were in perfect view of the bellagio and its fountain show that came on every 15 min. sooo picturesque and they had the ac blasting (which was probably a big waste of energy), but i was a a very comfortable temperature throughout the entire dinner, even though it was still in the high 80s at night. \n\nthe baguettes they provide were very good: so warm and fresh and even the butter was super good. we ordered the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> to start off and i didn't know what to expect, but it was really nice. good texture and taste. i ordered the filet mignon with the merlot butter and i devoured it completely. my sister ordered the hanger steak and it was truly delicious as well. as for desserts, we got the creme brulee, which tasted like a normal creme brulee and the apple tart which was kind of weird. their desserts are good, but nothing to freak out over.\n\nthe service was great and it was overall an amazing dinner experience.", 
            "ok, first let's dispel the rumor that sitting across the street from the bellagio fountains indoors or outdoors is a worthwhile experience.  without the music the fountains are just a bunch of overgrown water sprinklers and, unfortunately, the music cannot be heard.  even outside, the road noise and crowd noise from the restaurant drowned out the music.  so if you're going to go here, go for the food alone.\n\nextensive and interesting menu and wine list.  we enjoyed the following:\n beet and apple salad (complimentary) served with the french bread and butter.  very good and quite interesting.\n <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> - very good\n <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> with toast points, cornichons, olives, and pickled onions - great!\n flat iron steak bordelaise - good if you like bordelaise\n fish and chips - wonderful and possibly our favorite dish\n garlic spinach - very good\n frites - very good - a cross between potato chips and fries.  must try.\n french onion soup - fair.\n jumbo lump crab cakes - excellent - some of the best we've had.\n house merlot - average\n\nservice was excellent.  outdoor seating is fun for people watching but is first come first serve only.  inner patio covered seating is same.  indoor seating would definitely be my last choice and might not be a choice for us as there was a strong fish smell throughout the indoor areas.  in fact, it even drifted out onto the patio when we were first seated.  hopefully a one time thing.", 
            "we went there for a business dinner, and was able to get a patio table for 8 around 9:30pm which is generally unheard of... fortunately one of our party got there early to hold it (they dont normally do resos for the patio). the view from the patio is incredible! while enjoying the las vegas ambience, the background is the bellagio fountain show!\n\nthe food is also very excellent quality. i had the filet mignon, which comes with frites (fries). steak was cooked perfectly - and for appy, the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark>... which also was great. \n\nonly reason why i am giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is because the frites were not that great, and with the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark>, the ratio between pate and bread was not even (too much pate, not enough bread) - and eating pate by itself without a cracker or something isnt my thing. overall - will come again anytime and everytime we have the chance!", 
            "celebrated 2 birthdays here! yay! we made reservations and were seated right away. there was a 1 hr wait to sit outside where you are right on the strip but we came to eat not to be seen stuffing our faces and loosening our belts. \n\nappetizer: ordered the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> as it was suggested by the waiter but they accidentally served us the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>. well, we accidentally ate 3/4 of it before the waiter noticed and replaced it for the correct one. (yay, since we got to try both for free!!!) \n\nfrench onion soup - wow, this is meant for sharing!!\n1 1/2 ft baguette - love warm bread\nny steak w/handcut fries - perfectly cooked medium rare as i requested. i should mention that my plate looked like i ordered fries w/ a side of steak. i don't think anyone at our table finished the fries!\n\nsteak was good and the pate was good but not exceptional that i would rave on and on about. but if you want a decent meal for a good price then this is the spot. 3.5 stars from me.",

            "my friend and i wanted to enjoy a very nice dinner without having to spend a ridiculous amount of money. mon ami gabi was the perfect place. the atmosphere inside was that of a classy steakhouse. as an appetizer, we ordered the chicken liver mousse, which was very tasty. definitely more mousse than a party of two could handle, though. my friend ordered the steak classique, which came with an herb butter, and pom fritte. she loved the steak, but wasn't excited over the pom fritte. she said it tasted like she was eating fancy potato chips. i ordered the chicken grandmere, and it was absolutely delicious! i usually don't eat the skin, but you could see how perfectly this half chicken was cooked that it was a must to experience the full flavor of the dish. the chicken came with creamy mashed potatoes and a sauteed mix of pearled onions, mushrooms, roasted garlic, and bacon (the real deal chunky bits of bacon)! while eating the chicken i was surprised to find roasted garlic, mushroom and rosemary tucked beneath the skin of the chicken to add even more flavor to the already tasty meat. overall, our meal was wonderful! the chicken entree was $20.95, and the steak classique was $24.95. for those who like <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark>, $10.95 for a large portion is what you'll pay. this was a wonderful, affordable steakhouse restaurant, and i will more than likely return on my next visit to vegas.", 
            "7/4/13  dinner\n\nmy third time dining at mon ami gabi doesn't disappoint. for a french steak restaurant on the strip, this place offers great food at a great value. my party of 4 arrived promptly for 6:30pm reservation. surprisingly we were offered the option of indoor dining or the patio outside overlooking bellagio fountain across the street. patio is usually first come-first serve but on a 108f day we just didn't feel like eating outside. plus all the hustle-and-bustle on the street.\n\nserver was friendly, ready to make cocktail suggestion. despite being very busy for 4th of july, service was not pushy at all. we spent almost a cocktail's time looking over the big menu, which features grain-fed mid-west beef.\n\n*paris romance ($12): a rum base cocktail with a tinge of lemoncello. \n*grey goose cosmopolitan ($14): just the way i like it, a slightly more vodka compared to cranberry juice, fresh lime (there's pulp) a beautiful pink\n\nour table goes for beef since this is a classic french bistro specializes in meat.\n\n*<mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> ($10.95): the tangy red wine mustard goes really well with the very creamy liver spread on warm toast. it really set the mood of dinner for the evening.\n\n*<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> ($34.95): very tender, almost like wagyu, beef seared to a medium-rare pink, with a butter/red wine reduction. i've had harris's filet mignon and loved it. but mon ami gabi is just as juicy, and every bite of meat is \"even.\" this is one of the best filet mignon i have had. the handcut frites are warm crispy, with the texture of sliced potato chips. they give you so many that i couldn't finish.\n\n*steak classique ($24.95): a slimmer cut sirloin steak served with house-special herb butter. my bf also had it medium rare and it was pink like mine. he did better with the frites and licked the plate clean.\n\n*steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> ($25.95): probably the strongest tasting steak on our table, served with a brandy peppercorn sauce. our dining companion also opted her sirloin medium rare. i was very impressed at the overall consistency in how their meat was prepared here. \n\n*prime cheeseburger ($12.95): with blue cheese. this is a mon ami gabi's classic and they charge the same price as for lunch. medium cooked beef patty served on a brioche bun. instead of fries, my dining companion got french green beans on the side. \n\nwe concluded the meal with warm chocolate torte and assorted sorbet. the whole experience---food, service, drinks, and decor, is top-notch but you pay decent prices for it. it's one of the best value on the strip. make sure you have a reservation. i always have dinner here when i'm in vegas.", 
            "my first time in vegas and this was where i went for dinner. the idea of a reservation is a little bit of a joke. we had to wait for another 30 minutes or so. i suppose it might have been longer if we didn't have a reservation, but it didn't seem to make a difference. \n      that aside, i loved the food, service, and decor. the place definitely reminded me of the restaurant amelie would go to with her parents when she was younger ( or i'm remembering another french movie...either way i loved the dark wood and black and white tiled floors.)  the place was packed but our service was great, i can't remember what his name is now but waters were filled our orders were taken and plates removed in a very timely manner. \n       the food: scallop entree, steak and frites entree, and <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> appetizer, all delicious.  i would recommend all three items again. i want to go back and just have the exact same dinner again with a glass of rose.",

            "mon ami gabi had been on my wish list for quite some time. the most recent trip to vegas allowed me to finally go this establishment and i was not disappointed.\n\nfirst mon ami gabi is located right on the vegas strip with both an indoor and outdoor section with a nice view of the fountains at the bellagio casino across the strip. we decided to eat indoors since it was over 100 degrees that day. \n\ni ordered a mixture of appetizers that included the french onion soup/<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>, the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark>, and the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>. the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> i'd only seen on a spanish menu before so i was interested in comparing them. mon ami's take was nice and creamy with a tomato sauce surrounding it and a slice of french bread with an herb garlic mix on top to scoop up the food with. the pate was nice and creamy and served with some toasted bread to it with. the onion soup was good but not as thick with cheese as i would have liked but had good flavor nonetheless.\n\nmy son got <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> which was served with mon ami's thinly sliced fries. he devoured it and especially liked the au jos sauce to dip it in.\n\nmy niece ordered the cheeseburger that was served with fries as well and loved it.\n\nthe one drawback was my wife got the classique steak. mon ami has several steak preparations but uses the same cut for each one. my wife said it wasn't the greatest piece of meat so she was slightly disappointed.\n\ndespite that we would gladly go back to mon ami gabi and i was happy to finally check this restaurant off my list.", 
            "i had the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> appetizer ($12) and their jumbo crab cake ($18)...was not impressed. i actually didn't see anything that really stood out to me, however, my girlfriend order filet mignon with a piece of butter like spread on top and that was delicious! the meat was very tender and the spread just topped it off. \n\ni gave it a 3 stars because the other dishes were good. mine, not so much.\n\nfor starters, they give you a long piece of baguette with some butter. i thought that was ok also. and i love bread. this bread was ehhhh.\n\nlocated inside the paris hotel.", 
            "this is my third time dining at this restaurant and we have went here twice during this trip in vegas.  once for dinner and the other for lunch the next day. the service is immaculate here and servers are always making sure we have everything we need. \ni had the steak frites <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>.  price was $27 for the entree which was very affordable.  the peppercorn sauce was very flavorful and wish i had a little more. we also had the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> appetizer which was also very delicious as well.  we sat outside for dinner because there was a cool breeze that was very nice in the vegas heat and it was fun watching people pass by. recommend this place for families that want a nice dinner without having to get all fancied up.", 
            "this is a great value for vegas!  the location is hard to beat and patio seating is even better.  the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> was excellent, especially on the fresh and warm baguettes they bring to the table.  scallops were pretty good, overall a great experience.", 
            "the food and service were good.\n\ni'd recommend the french onion soup, <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark>, and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>.\n\nalso, the view seating outside is nice because you get a good look at the bellagio water fountain show.\n\neverything on the las vegas strip is priced relatively on the higher end, that being said, this place gives a good bang for buck.", 
            "came here after reading several great reviews on yelp. this is my my first time in vegas and the first meal i had here and man oh man it was amazing!!! sat outside and watched the fountain show at the bellagio. me and my bf had the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> and the onion soup, 22oz steak with fries, half chicken and mashed potatoes and a large french sangria to drink... amazing! must try! it's worth the wait at the door! and all the servers were super nice",

            "except for the long wait for an outside table (first come, first served - we waited 90 minutes), this was a truly memorable evening. \n\nit was the view of the fountains at the bellagio that stimulated my interest in mon ami gabi - after looking it up on yelp, i made a reservation (not knowing that the terrace was not reservable). we did eventually get a table right at the railing, with a great view of the fountains. the food and service was exactly as described on yelp! \n\nwe started with the <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> - when we asked our attentive and very friendly waitress what escargots tasted like, she said \"garlic\". if you like garlic, this is for you! we used the remainder of our fresh bread to soak up the sauce. the bread and butter with a shaved carrot topping was grand. we also had the butter lettuce salad, which was fresh and tasty. \n\nfor main courses, we both had steak, mine was steak bordelaise, the other was steak roquefort. i got mine with the frites, which were 1/4\" wide, paper-thin, and crispy. my intention was just to taste them, as they were highly recommended by our waitress, but i ended up finishing them. sheryl substituted vegetables for her fries - she had garlic spinach which she loved. the steaks were good, thin and a little tough as french steaks usually are. \n\nno desert - too much food - but great coffee!! overall, we went for the view and stayed for the food. a grand evening, not soon to be forgotten!", 
            "being a big fan of french food, i was really looking forward to eating here. maybe it was eating at 4pm, or maybe i was just not feeling the food that day. i thought this place was okay. i just thought it was nothing special or out of the ordinary, something i could've easily eaten in la and didnt have to be in vegas to get.\n\nstarted off with <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> ($10.50). was pretty good. dipped the bread in the leftover garlic herb butter.. yum! :) got the skate fish ($22.95) for my main course. it was good.. had capers, which i liked. it came with chips, which became soggy from sitting in the sauce that the fish was sitting on. the fish was pretty tender, but also a tad lacking in flavor. maybe that was what the capers were for? the reisling i had went well with the fish though.\n\ndont get me wrong, the food wasnt bad. i actually had a taste of my friend's pork tenderloin and it was really good. it just didnt seem to live up to the hype that i'm reading here. keep in mind we also sat inside, so maybe that took away from the experience of eating on the patio and overlooking the strip.",

            "mon ami gabi is a quaint french restaurant, located in paris resort and casino. it was a bit far from the center of the strip ~10 minutes walking. the decorum of the restaurant was very cute and resembles a modern cafe in france. casual and delicious! \n\nservice was ok in that there seemed to be no designated waiter per table so you had to flag one down to ask for the check. however, they did refill our glasses multiple times, so i can't complain. bottled or sparkling water are complimentary. \n\ni recommend coming for brunch, which is only offered on weekends. their lunch menu is very limiting but it is still possible to pick out some interesting and tasty dishes. if you have never had escargot, i would recommend trying it at mon ami gabi because it is not as slimy (which may seem revolting).\n\ni came here on weekday afternoon. we started with the <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> which is oven roasted snails cooked in garlic herb butter. i believe this is true, butter makes everything tastes good. ;) i like escargot and this dish made me like it more. if i had a larger group and a bigger appetite, i would have tried more dishes from their hors d'oeuvres because it truly gives you a taste of authentic french cuisine. i would recommend country style p\\u00e2t\\u00e9, chicken liver mousse, <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> gratin\\u00e9es  and <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> if you're feeling adventurous.\n\nfor lunch, their offerings are predominantly, sandwiches, crepes, salads and steak frites (which is essentially steak with thinly cut fries).\nfor brunch, i have heard good things about their french toast, pancakes, crepes and eggs benedicts. \n\nthe two of us ordered the croque madame and <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> for entrees. croque madame was fine but the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> was show-stopper. first of all, the crepe was buttery and thin, strewn over with a b\\u00e9chamel cream sauce. the shrimps and scallops were fresh, tender and sweet. and the combination of textures and flavors satiated my palate. definitely recommended!\n\noverall, i enjoyed mon ami gabi and will come back next time for their brunch. our check came out for ~$17 pp, which was reasonable compared to how much we ate. also, they provide complimentary, fresh-baked french baguettes. love!", 
            "i had mon ami gabi as my last meal in vegas. we went b/c some of my suitemates went there from their last visit. it topped the trip off perfectly as we spent the afternoon eating and chatting away at a window side table in this little bistro! i was thankful we got indoor seating since the weather had been really windy outside!\n\nfor hors d'oeurves we had:  <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark>\nthis was a bit against my will but group majority prevailed. my previous encounter with snails were not pleasant but i decided to give them another shot. honestly i couldn't really taste much of it as it was masked in the garlic herb sauce. it was just a chewy bit of something that i swallowed down. i liked to dip the baguette into the garlic herb sauce tho that was really yum-o. \n\nentree: trout grenobloise\ni liked the flakiness of the fish.the pan-sear or however the skin was prepared was great. it was very crispy! it was mildly seasoned and hinted at the fish's natural flavor which was good. overall i really liked it. it was light and the green beans that came with it were cooked nicely. \n\nso there was the frites that came along in a cup and they were super yummy and quite addicting. thinner than fries and maybe even than potato chips.\n\nat last!1! time for dessert!: profiterole trio a.k.a cream puffs! \nthey were super good!!! it was napoleon style as we had vanilla, chocolate and strawberry filled centers. i loved the chocolate/ fudge sauce that was drizzled on them. the flavors were very concentrated and they put me to shame to the kind of cream puffs i had made in hs french class. much better than beard papa too that has commercialized and supersized the cream puff. \n\ni def loved the atmosphere of this place and though it's on the pricier side, its a treat to come here with friends and check it out for one of the fancier meals one can have in vegas.", 
            "disappointed!\n\ni came here with friends for lunch and was looking forward to sitting in the patio. too bad the wait was an hour so we decided to sit inside. of all the available seats, we were seated next to the door that had a draft. luckily, the server allowed us to move over one table. \n\nwarm bread was provided when the server came along. \n\nwe started off with <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> ($10.50). it was described as \"oven-roasted snails, garlic-herb butter.\" it was decent. not enough butter for my taste and a bit too much garlic. however, dipping the hard bread in the sauce was still okay. unless you're really craving for escargot, i'd pass on this dish.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> cooked medium w/au jus, mustard mayo, caramelized onions ($13.95) and that came with their \"signature hand-cut frites.\"  i think i should have ordered this medium-rare because the steak was not as tender as i would like. overall, it was a simple sandwich and the sauces complimented well. their frites were definitely different from what i'm use to. like most of the reviewers have said, these are borderline potato chips! my friend and i kept calling them a tease. it was too thin to fulfill us...\n\ni would have given this place two stars but the server was engaging and attentive. \n\nsooo.....unless i was going to be seated in the patio with a few bloody marys in hand, i doubt i'd come back here for lunch.", 
            "i was so excited to try the place because walking by the restaurant, the smell of the food wafting out of the restaurant smelled divine and i was craving fish. the atmosphere is quite cozy and chic. it is quite busy so service wasn't terrible but not as good as it could've been. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> and the <mark>Skate Wing</mark>. i had not had escargot in a really long time, so i had to try it but it was quite a disappointment. the garlic herb sauce for the escargot was extremely buttery to the point where i could feel the butter after wiping my mouth. definitely not appealing. and the escargot was a bit on the chewy side. when the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> arrived the aroma was intoxicating. the texture was very light (similar to a tilapia type fish) and the flavors wasn't too overwhelming. i was not a fan of the capers (a bit on the tart side which was a little off putting with the dish) that came with the fish. the chips (made in-house) were extremely de-lish! probably would buy a whole bag if i could.\n\nfor fish, this place is fantastic. great atmosphere. would definitely want to go back to try some other dishes as i'm a huge fan of french cuisine.", 
            "many people recommended mon ami gabi to me for some time.  i decided to give this place a whirl and have dinner for my friend's birthday here.\n\ni made reservations for our party of 4 for a sunday night at 6:30pm on opentable.com.  outdoor patio seating which has a view of the bellagio water show is available but i believe it's on a first come, first serve basis.  we were lucky enough to get an inside table that had that view.  note: they will not seat you until your entire party is present.  \n\nthe steaks were usually recommended to me.  i decided to order steak classique ($24.95).  i wanted a smaller piece of steak and our waitress made these steaks sound appealing saying that they were pounded down to about half an inch thick and would be extremely tender.  i ordered it medium rare, but it was more along the lines of medium well which had very little pinkness to it.  it was a bit tough and wasn't flavorful as i expected.  i had a bite of my friend's filet and that was delicious.  if i would've gotten that, mon ami would've received another star from me.  the accompanied fries were delicious.  the fries were cut thin and deep fried until crispy and very few soft pieces remained.\n\nas an appetizer, we ordered the escargot <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> ($10.95) which was yummy.  six pieces of escargot was marinated in a garlic herb butter sauce which also made great dipping sauce for the bread.\n\nour waitress was nice but the servers were usually the ones that were more helpful.  i told the hostess that we were celebrating a birthday.  they brought him a small dessert with a candle (he didn't like us singing happy birthday lol).\n\nkeep in mind, dinner is long and there is a lot of wait time between dishes.  i believe our dinner took more than two hours therefore don't dine here if you're crunched on time.\n\np.s. think twice if you're ordering a drink. my friend ordered a hennessy & 7up which he though was a bit watered down.  turns out the drink was $21.", 
            "on a recommendation of a friend, and good reviews on yelp, i decided we had to check this place out. weeks in advance, i set a reservation through open table for 7:30 on a tuesday night. \n\ndress code here is mostly lenient--no sleeveless shirts for the gentlemen and no swimwear for the ladies--chances aren't likely that you'll run into anyone from the jersey shore here. \n\nbut it is a popular place. there are two lines at the entrance. we arrived a few minutes early but stood in line anyway because it looked like it would be several minutes of waiting. and it was.  one line was for those with reservations and one line was for those without. i overheard someone in the \"without reservations\" line say there would be an hour wait for a table outside. when we got to the front, we let them know our name and reservation time and were seated immediately at a little table for two inside but facing the fountains of bellagio. \n\nwe were brought a loaf of delicious fresh, warm bread and split an order of escargot <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> for $11. my husband says the bread was probably the best he'd ever had and we cleaned the escargot dish to save the dishwasher some extra work.  \n\nmy husband ordered the trout amandine, a recommendation of the hostess that seated us.  it was a huge filet of trout prepared with a lemony dressing--light and healthy but full of flavor and a large enough serving for even my hungrier half to be content. \n\ni had the filet mignon with the merlot butter. it was prepared beautifully...exactly as i ordered and just the perfect flavor. \n\nbased on the food alone, we would absolutely return to mon ami gabi.  everything was delicious and our dinner was so reasonably priced, we were a bit surprised--$76 for an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert in a restaurant with a view on the strip. say what?! \n\nit's a bit noisy in there but that seems to be par for the course in vegas. we keep trying to find nice romantic restaurants and it seems the party environment that vegas is doesn't seem to allow for it...knowing that in advance, i'd still return to mon ami gabi again.", 
            "me and cousin were deciding on a place to eat. there are so many fine restaurants in vegas and in the end we decided last minute to go here on the 2nd night i was in vegas. it was a great choice!!  i called in earlier that evening around 830pm and made reservations for two. i was very surprised that they still accepted reservations the night of! it was definitely a good idea since there were people waiting when we got there at 10pm. one of the asian hostesses was a bit rude towards me since she asked me to get in the back of the line when i was obviously there before other guests. but i just let that go. \n\nwhen we walked into the restaurant it was very crowded. most, if not all of the tables were occupied. i was under the impression that it was casual atire, but people were dressed rather nice. we sat indoors. the ambiance is rather romantic with slightly dim lights. the atmosphere seemed lively yet relaxed at the same time with people conversing and having a merry time. our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. he gave us advice on what to order which worked out wonderfully!!\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark>(oven-roasted snails, garlic-herb butter) and <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>(steak with butter and red wine reduction, served with their signature hand-cut frites). both were very good. i've had snails before but never cooked this way. we ate it with the fresh warm bread! the steak was soooo tender!!! by far the best steak i have eaten! seasoned perfectly and it is like butter when you cut into it. the frites were also very good and a different spin on fries. i actually like it better than fries because they are thinner and crispier. i am sad that i decided not to order dessert here because i wanted to try serendipity(no bueno). the total came out to be only $50. what a great deal for such delicious food! i will be coming back no doubt when i am in vegas :)", 
            "we try to stop by here whenever we are in vegas.  the restaurant is located in the paris paris, just off the main casino floor.  if the weather is nice, try to get a table on the patio, or the windows near the patio, as they overlook the beautiful bellagio fountains.  the patio is raised above the busy las vegas boulevard sidewalk, so all those inebriated tourist don't get in the way of the view.\n\nin my opinion, the food at most of the restaurants on the strip is overhyped and overpriced; this is not the case at mon ami gabi.  the food here is excellent for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and appropriately priced.  my personal favorites are the <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark>, the warm chicken & <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, and the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> steak frites.",

            "came here with a few friends as a \"formal dinner night\". an excuse to try a new place, an excuse to dress nice, and have a nice dinner with friends that came from out of town to visit. \n\nwe had reservations made and were quickly seated soon after arrival. we had been taken to a table inside. but upon request, we were able to get a table by the window to have a nice view of the bellagio fountains and the outside. \n\nservice was really good, and the waiter was very attentive and knowledgable. with an introduction of the day's specials as well as recommendations, it helped on deciding what to order. \n\nfor myself, i had ordered a hor d'oeurves (id just call it an appetizer) and an steak frites (entree xd).\n\n<mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> - oven-roasted snails in a garlic herb butter. very buttery and herb filled. escargot tasted great and seasoned perfectly. the garlic herb butter was delicious and went extremely well with the complimentary bread that was served. before i knew it, i was cleaning the escargot tray with the bread, not a drop of garlic herb butter was left ! mmm ! yummy ! \n\nbearnaise steak frites w/ classic bearnaise sauce - thin cut of steak with a mountain (not exagerating, there was a seemingly endless amount) of hand-cut fries. as for the steak, i had ordered medium rare. come out a little more towards medium to medium well. didn't really give it too much thought. the cut was quite thin. to get it seared on each side and edges, already puts it quite cooked. the bearnaise sauce was pretty good. creamy, slighty sour, bright flavored sauce. matched the steak pretty well. the hand cut fries were thinly cut and fried. given a large amount. i dont think i finished it\n\noverall, for the price of everything, the view, and the ambiance and experience. it was really good. with the weather allowing, it would be great to sit outside", 
            "i made a reservation for one via open table and i'm really glad i did because it was very busy for lunch (12:30pm). i wasn't able to opt for the extra 15-minute wait for patio seating (it became a 30-minute wait by 12:45), but i think it's worthwhile.\n\ngetting to my table was quite the ordeal. i was told that my table was being prepared when i checked in, however, i was still waiting after several other groups, most arriving after i did, was seated before me. i finally approached them after almost ten minutes and this was followed by a few more minutes of \"here's your table, nope, it's not available, waiting awkwardly, walking around the dining area, here's another table in the dark, there's other tables available, but not for one person, etc.\" it's a long story and i've spared the details. i was finally seated at a table next to the window overlooking the patio and it was very pretty. \n\nbecause of the lengthy windows and almost dome-like ceiling of this area, it's a wonderful alternative to their coveted patio dining. you still have a really great view and the light is magnificent (probably not so much in the summer). although, if you sit right along the glass, like i did, you are awkwardly close to patrons on the other side. besides the odd setting, i think this indoor \"glass room\" is better than actually sitting outside. you still get all the benefits of the restaurant's location without the car and foot traffic, outdoor elements, and people gawking at you.\n\nyou start your meal with fresh, warm baguette and creamy butter. i love that the loaf arrives in a \"mon ami gabi\" bag, where you just tear off pieces to eat and it allows for easy travel. the bread had a great crust and soft, chewy center. delicious.\n\ni had the <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> ($14.95), oven-roasted snails in garlic herb butter, and seafood cr\\u00eape ($15.95) made with scallops, shrimp, peas, and cream, served with a fris\\u00e9e and vinaigrette salad. the escargot was delicious! especially that butter. since it's served in the specially-made cast iron pan that it was baked, the dish is still warm until you're done. the \"sauce\" is extremely fragrant and went perfectly with the baguette. the cr\\u00eape was wonderful, filled with light cream and peas, topped with scrumptious scallops (it comes with two pieces, however, they're most likely one big scallop sliced in half) and plump shrimp (three nicely-sized crustaceans). the light and refreshing salad was a great companion as well.\n\nservice was very pleasant and quick to respond to my needs and necessity to finish my meal in the allotted time. the beginning was a bit shaky and it did cause my having to rush through lunch, however, i was very pleased with the table and the view made me smile. it also helped that the weather was gorgeous! i would love to dine here again, preferably for breakfast and/or brunch and dinner. i believe i've only visited once previously, approximately 7-8 years ago, for dinner, but i don't remember much!",

(if you want patio seating, it's not possible to get reservations for it.  there's a waitlist, and it's first-come-first-serve.)\n\nwith that being said, we ended up sitting inside with a view of the bellagio fountains, near the patio seating!  we enjoyed several shows of the bellagio fountains throughout our two hour meal, at the height of dinner service.  \n\nyes, we were impressed with the quality of food, service and ambiance!  thank you for making our anniversary dinner be such a treat!!

            "my most recent visit to mon ami gabi had a little bit of a disappointment which was really my fault for coming in at the wrong time.  currently, their sunday dinner special is beef wellington which i've been really looking forward to try.  the only beef wellington i've had is the one over at gordon ramsay steak, so i was looking to try one from another restaurant to compare.  well, i finally came in on a sunday night for a late dinner and by the time i got seated, my waiter told me that they had just ran out of beef wellington.  nooooooooo!!!\n\nwell, as an alternative, my waiter suggested ordering their <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>.  it's actually been a few years since i last ordered steak at mag, so he enlightened me.  plus, because it's a different cut of beef than the hangar and ribeye i've had before, it still continues my steak of ordering something new on their menu.  and to add to that, i ordered their wild escargot <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> appetizer.  i've never had escargot served this way so i was really intrigued.\n\n<mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1btorxp\noven roasted snails, garlic-herb butter\noh man.  butter and garlic galore!!  the snails were chewy just like i expected and they were drowned in so much butter and garlic that i couldn't really tell if they were actually snails.  they could've been mushrooms and i probably wouldn't know the difference.  they were was good though.  and with the complimentary baguette, it was the perfect bread to dunk into the garlic-herb butter wells.\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1qhygp5\nbutter, red wine reduction\ni understand that mon ami gabi is more of a budget friendly steakhouse that's part of  the middle tier of steakhouses on the strip, but i have to say that this filet mignon was awesome!  cooked to a perfect medium rare and it literally cut like butter! (http://bit.ly/1n0fjpx)  and the red wine reduction sauce just added a more robust flavor to the filet.  i'm so glad that i ordered this!  kudos to my waiter for the recommendation!\n\nmon ami gabi delivers once again even when there's disappointment with an item being sold out.  i love how there's plenty of 'plan b' entrees and based on my past visits, i really couldn't have gone wrong with any of them, but i'm glad that i got to try their <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>.  that's something that i wouldn't mind ordering again if i ever go back for to mon ami gabi for steak.  hopefully next time i'll make better judgement with coming in for an earlier dinner so i can finally try their beef wellington.  til next time mon ami gabi....",

            "we ate here for our re-wedding dinner on 10/8/15 and we were seated on the patio near a  young couple who had also gotten married that day,  my husband and i ordered the escargot <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> hors d'oeuvre - delicious plump  oven-roasted snails in garlic-herb butter. we had the <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> and the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> for two - cracked whole maine lobster, jumbo shrimp, those wonderful fanny bay oysters (smaller here) and <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark>. it comes with mignonette, cocktail sauce  and sauce gribiche.  at the end of the meal, they brought us and the table next to us an order of profiteroles. i was stuffed but my husband said it was yummy. it was fun sitting on the patio watching the incomparable view of the water show at caesars' palace! this is a very busy, very loud restaurant which sometimes made conversation difficult.  i am in a wheelchair and they had no problem accommodating me. i expect french service from a french restaurant even if it is a bistro and mon ami gabi did not disappoint. everyone was on their toes and the course progression was perfect. we will be eating here the next time we are in las vegas!"

            "we booked this last minute when we realized another restaurant was too far away and so glad we did.  the  food was amazing and huge portions!  you can sit inside or outside and we ended up inside with a nice dark ambience with candles and delicious food! we ordered some appetizers:\n\n<mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> (best tasting ever!)\nsteamed mussels (wowsa!)\nfresh warm bagette bread ( they kept bringing us more and we could not stop eatting every soft, warm bite!)\n\nmain dish:\npeppercorn steak with frites and a pear salad on the side!

            "a breathtaking view at the top of the eiffel + dinner at mon ami gabi after = romantic date! \n\nand that is exactly what my hubby and i did one weekend in vegas! he took me up to the top of the tower and saw the whole city of las vegas! the view was aaaaamazing! \n\nwe dined in for dinner late sunday night and there was numerous of vacant seats indoor. it was freezing outside and there were more patrons seated outdoor than indoor! well, thank goodness for those warm heat lamps! we chose to sit outdoors on the patio next to one of those heat lamps! the location of this restaurant is great because it sits right in front of bellagio's water show. it was nice to see what water dance every 15 minutes. :)\n\nokay, so the dinner. we ordered <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with <mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark> as an appetizer and for our entrees i ordered their giant scallops and my hubby ordered a steak. the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> was super delish and very fresh. i can honestly say this is probably one of my favorite appetizers. my scallops were just as good. very soft and flavorful.  my entree also came with mashed potatoes topped with brussel sprouts. who would have known that the combination of the two would be very tasty?! my hubby enjoyed his steak though he thinks it tasted mediocre. \n\nour server was very generous. i asked for hot water (since it was so cold!) and he made sure my water was warm throughout the night. he even replaced my pot of hot water with a new one! he was very attentive and took good care of us! :) \n\nthis is a place i would recommend for others to try. i would love to come back for brunch one day considering it's high reviews!", 
            "we arrived around 11 am for a leisurely saturday brunch on a sunny morning.  we were secretly hoping we could sit out on the beautiful open patio to soak up some vitamin d, but the 45-minute wait almost put the ravenous d and e over the edge.  thankfully, the patio waiting list is separate from the rest of the restaurant, and we walked right in and were seated immediately.\n\nthe front part of the restaurant near the host stand is quite dim, which could be intimate and romantic in the evening but was a bit of a downer for the morning.  which is why we were thrilled when were seated close to the glass window-ed atrium, adjacent to the patio.  our server was courteous and kind, bringing us extra brunch menus and then rounding up breakfast menus when we admitted we were hoping to get a late breakfast.  by the time we ordered, he had no qualms about all of us getting breakfast at 11:30, even though the kitchen technically stopped serving breakfast at 11.\n\nour table enjoyed beef hash (with poached eggs!), <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>, <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> eggs benedict and a mushroom omelette.  the hash brown potatoes served with the egg dishes were crispy, light and simply one of the best we've had.  i was surprised by the light custard texture of my <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and enjoyed the chewy chunks of bacon.  however, 3/4 of the way through, i found the rich flavors a bit overwhelming.  the fresh and lightly dressed frisee was an excellent side to my quiche.  maybe the quiche was just too big of a portion for me?\n\nd and e would not stop talking about their beef hash.  they were clearly in love with their dishes.  the coffee was tasty, and the warm crusty baguette they served us while we waited for our dishes was such a relief for our growling bellies.  they amply refilled our bread supply and included a great jam to spread on top.  i tucked the rest of the baguette in my purse as a snack, since they bring the baguette to your table in a paper sleeve, as if it came straight from the farmers market! \n\nthough the interior is quite upscale and nice, there were a good number of families with kids and casual diners to keep the atmosphere from feeling too stuffy. :p", 
            "as others say, this is really at the top tier of breakfasts in vegas.  on every weekend trip, it is my saturday morning treat (as sundays are now reserved for the bottomless mimosa brunch at border grill in mandalay).  \n\nthis french bistro packs a combo falcon punch of awesome!  between the outdoor deck (with heat lamps, so it can be enjoyed year round) that allows for fountain and people watching, the impeccable service, and... did i mention the food?  this place will slow you down and make you feel like you're on vacation, which is so important in this fast paced world, right?\n\nwhenever i go here, i opt for decadence, so my usual breakfast rundown is:\nmocha\nkir royale\n<mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> eggs benedict (isn't it weird that you can get better <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> in vegas than most places where i live in the pacific northwest?)\nand i finish it off with their orange chocolate chip muffin... one of the most decadent desserts (but they call it a breakfast pastry), i think i've ever tried.  huge hunks of chocolate, with an orange glaze, on a soft cakey dough.  it's amazing.\n\nthere aren't really any cons i'd give this place other than: \nbe aware that their breakfast ends at 11, which is earlier than some vegas spots.  lunch is still great, but sometimes after a hard party night in vegas, you just need some breakfast.\n\nadditionally, note that there are also locations in the following cities: \n-chicago il\n-oak brook il\n-reston, va\n-bethesda, md\n\nif you are local to one of those areas, you may want to try something else when vegas bound (but then again the deckside view may just be worth it even if you already eat a mon ami gabi brunch regularly).\n\nit's really an excellent experience.", 
            "if you want a nice restaurant that won't leave your wallet crying and your stomach still starving, this is not a bad place to go. just be sure to make reservations or the wait can be quite long. reservations only guarantee the indoor dining area, which is dim, romantic, and not conducive to instagram pictures. if you can, though, i'd recommend the patio area so you can people-watch from a heated and equally romantic vantage point.\n\nthe boyfriend and i ordered the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> appetizer, which was served with 4 large pieces of the creamiest salmon i've ever had and (maybe just a tad too much) red onions and capers atop brioche. the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> was definitely on the small side and probably could have done with a little less cooking, but the merlot reduction tasted amazing. what i should have gotten was the boyfriend's ribeye, which was bigger, fattier, juicier, and overall just more tasty. i was not, however, impressed with the steak frites that came with our entrees--they were paper-thin (like eating a deep fried potato peel) while i like more substance to my fries. \n\nthough the food was a little hit or miss, the ambiance and the attentive server who kept up with my water-guzzling boyfriend's refill needs upped my rating for this place to a 4.",

            "this place was pretty exceptional on the food and atmosphere front.  it's a simple yet very elegant restaurant, which seems suitable for afternoon casual lunch or fancy business meetings or dates.  the menu had a variety of options from light salads and oysters, to fancy sandwiches, to meat hefty meals.  i ordered the tomato and basil salad.  the waitress said it was a pretty decent size and tasty.  it was indeed tasty, but not substantial in size.  i was thankful i ordered chicken with it because it is not enough on it's own (for most people).  it was very fresh and lightly seasoned with oil.  \ni sneaked bites from the plates of those around me....the yellowfin was delish and the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> sandwich is probably the best thing one could order from the lunch menu!  the combined flavor of the bread, cheese, salmon and toppings was one of the most decadent things i've eaten in awhile!  \nso why 4 stars and not 5?  the service was lacking.  it's vegas...i expect above average.  service was average from all the staff i encountered and no one seemed very personable.  just kind of made me feel awkward.  oh well, good eats - try it!", 
            "i had to write a review just to say their <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> is to die for! a must try!! food was delicious, we had an order of their oysters, <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>, corned beef hash w/poached eggs and the steak bordelaise (bomb!), only problem was that the service fell a little short (i'm guessing because it's ldw) but overall a great place.", 
            "i've been to vegas so many times and walk by this place.... finally got to try it for late dinner with friends. have to say it was surprisingly pleasant. ambience was nice   dim lighting, excellent customer service, and delicious food. \neveryone raves how nice the patio seating is...i didn't get to dine on the patio . (too hot!) maybe on a cooler night. \nfood: we ordered a few appetizer... <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>, oysters, escargots.  all delicious and flavorful. main dish i ordered <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>. which i highly recommend. i did try my friends steak... it was tender and super tasty. finished off with house coffee... loved it. strong and sweet just how i like it  will definitely try this place again.", 
            "breakfast here was my first meal in vegas. the view is amazing if you can score a seat on the terrace but even if you can't the food makes up for it. i am a huge fan of kir royales and eggs benedict for brunch. it's practically impossible to get an real kir royale (made with creme de cassis) in hawaii, so of course i had to order it when i saw it on the menu at mon ami gabi. it was perfection. i also ordered the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> eggs benedict which was amazing. hollandaise sauce was creamy and rich but not salty. (if i could put hollandaise sauce on everything i would) the english muffin was a tad on the chewy side but no complaints from me. my friend had the strawberry waffles which she liked, and the portion size was perfect. we weren't too stuffed but felt satisfied.", 
            "one of the best views in vegas!  patio seating across from the bellagio fountains.  classic french with a flair for the moderately expensive.  breakfast is best, lunch is luscious, and dinner, well dinner is downright dreamy.   try anything, i just think you cant go wrong.  i have had the soups, sandwiches, breakfast eggs benedict with <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>, the salads, the steaks, the drinks.  they have it all.  5 star stuff. bring wallet.", 
            "came here for thanksgiving dinner. gotta say everything was pretty delicious.....except for the turkey.  we got lucky and there was patio seating available which gave us a perfect view of the bellagio fountains.  it's kinda funny to think that a main draw of this restaurant is based off of its view of a competing hotel.  the <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark> was really good, but the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> was amazing. kinda wish i had double of that instead of my turkey. i simply cannot dock this restaurant because i thought their white meat of their turkey was exceptionally dry.  any other day of the year i would never order turkey.  lastly, i had pumpkin bread pudding. i usually don't love bread pudding, it's more of my gf's thing, but this time it was amazing. so rich and moist. too bad it's probably a seasonal item.  i'll likely be back, next time to try a steak or something.", 
            "we came here for breakfast, but arrived not long after they'd switched over to lunch menus.  our waitress had no problem bringing us a breakfast menu, and that just made my day! \n\nordered their <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> benedict that comes with (what the menu calls) \"potatoes\" ... but please know that they mean \"hashbrowns.\"  not a bad thing, but \"potatoes\" to me says something else entirely; i guess i just visualize large chunks not shavings, besides, most places will state \"hashbrowns\" if that's what they serve.  okay, done with the dang potatoes!  \n\nwe also ordered the baked scallops gratine\\u00e9s, a side of date-glazed, thick-cut bacon as well as cappuccinos (which were very small in quantity, but good).  just don't expect to get your caffeine fix with one.  \n\nservice was great, everything we ordered tasted absolutely delicious, and the only slight issue that arose was quickly & thoroughly rectified far beyond our expectations!!  \n\ndefinitely stop here while you're in vegas!  i know i'm going back whenever i'm in vegas again :)", 
            "one of the best restaurants i've had the pleasure of dining at. easily the best restaurant i've been to in las vegas! notwithstanding gordon ramsay steak, and perhaps the bacchanal at caesars palace but that's a buffet and in a different league altogether. (i'll save that for another review) not to mention these are really very reasonable prices on the strip.\n\nwe came for breakfast, rather early at 7am, since we were up at 5am due to the most horrendous jet-lag having traveled all the way from minneapolis. coffee and provisions were desperately needed. we got seated on the patio by request, with a view overlooking the strip and the bellagio. i was on my summer vacation and ready to enjoy myself thoroughly. my <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> eggs benedict was spot on. rich hollandaise sauce covered the english muffins and it was truly a remarkable experience. i am a huge fan of the coffee. (intelligentsia coffee, i believe) it was rich, strong and flavorful. it revived us perfectly. we also shared their blueberry pineapple crepes, special of the day. came with a little boat of freshly whipped cream. they were light, sweet and scrumptious. good for sharing. \n\nfor an impromptu, spur of the moment breakfast idea, this place was a 10 out of 10. service was exemplary, waters were promptly refilled, and the restrooms are located out of the restaurant and inside the paris casino. the interior of the restaurant is gorgeous and very french, in keeping with the theme of the hotel. they have nightly dinner specials. i think i saw beef wellington on the sunday menu. in case you wanted to give that a try instead of gordon's beef welly across the slot machines. his food is pretty spectacular too though, so have a go at it. every time we go to vegas, we'll make mon ami gabi a regular breakfast spot.", 
            "the solarium is one of my favorite brunch spots in las vegas, but the setting trumps the food quality.\n\nambiance: the solarium is an enchanting venue.\n\ncrowd: foreign tourists on a christmas morning\n\nmenu: americanized french breakfast fare\n\nservice: attentive and accommodating\n\nfood ordered: chicken, brie, and apple crepe; <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with toast; fresh orange juice.\n\nfood quality:   the crepe was good, but it lacked complexity of flavor.  frankly, it would be better without the chicken.  the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> was also nice, but the quality was slightly below what i would have anticipated.\n\nvalue: you are certainly paying for the view.\n\nnotes: make sure you can eat in the solarium.  the rest of the restaurant is dark and uninviting.", 
            "a must every time in vegas! i love this place, great service and food. eggs benedict, <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> platter, warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, chicken grand-mere, bananas fosters crepe some of the dishes i've had and they were all delicious!", 
            "definitely my favorite restaurant in vegas. the bread and spread that came with the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> was out of the world and the crepes were good too :-) definitely coming back.", 
            "nom nom nom. mon ami gabi offered awesome hangover food. :) the blueberry french toast and <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> hors d'oeuvres...woah. the former was bursting with fruitiness, not only through the topped blueberries but with the blueberry syrup. the latter was creamy and tender. it was a bit overkill with all the complimentary bread preceding our selections (more self-control) but i'd recommend both. the fresh toast was definitely the best i've had. the outdoor patio was a treat. people watching on the strip always entertains (and the heat lamps are a great backup!).", 
            "i came here three times! i loved the place, with the traditional and consistence food. i took away one star, because the service for me was spotty. (the hosts at the front aren't too polite, whether you have reservations or not. some waiter were more attentive than others.) the cooking is always to perfection, but the flavoring can be a little bit more bold. slightly on the expensive side, but it is worth the experience and food.\n\n1st time: breakfast\n\nlemon pancake - for me this pancake was slightly denser and dryer than i would like. the flavor was very vanilla and hint of lemon (not too lemon-y, which i prefer, but if you like the lemon flavor to hit you hard; this is not for you.)\n\n<mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> benedict - i loved this plate! the english muffin was crisp, buttery, and light. the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> was generous, egg yolk was just the right consistency (runny), and the hollandaise sauce was amazing!  \n\n2nd time: lunch\n\nlemon salmon - both the salmon and vegetable was cooked to perfection, but slightly bland on the flavor profile.\n\n3rd time: dinner\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> - cooked to perfection (asked for medium) and the red wine sauce was delicious. \n\nmussels martiniere - wow, the broth had such a deep flavor, the white wine, sea, and butter! \n\ncreme brulee - so delicious, it was very vanilla like and lite custard (doesn't taste like eggy cake). one of the best, i tried.", 
            "had the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> benedict and it was good but nothing out of this world. very good view though and super friendly service and fast! only waited about 30 mins without reservation", 
            "when in vegas, it really is all about the food for me. i was looking for a good brunch place that was close to my hotel since it happened to be pouring rain that day. i came across this restaurant for brunch and was very pleased. \n\ni opted for a <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> eggs benedict with a mimosa. it was amazing!..and served with excellent hash browns too. their customer service was also great. i would definitely come back here!", 
            "it was extremely crowded when i ate here during breakfast hours.  i suggest making a reservation beforehand.  \n\nthe <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> eggs benedict  was delicious-- it was the best i've ever had, in fact.\n\noverall, good food in a highly touristy location on the strip.", 
            "over rated. had regular egg benedict and <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> benedict and mushroom omelette. to begin. omelette was nothing special so that's probably an average of 3stars. the egg benedict hollandaise sauce didn't have the pop of flavor i was looking for. the hasbrown that came with the dish looked a chewed up and taste like a can of salt was accidentally dropped in. baked bread for the omelete was bearly luke warm too. not impressed", 
            "i liked it. it wasn't overly gourmet breakfast fare but it was on par with bouchon. it's typical french breakfast food, sophisticated. i had the french onion soup which was available on the \"not breakfast\" section, and it was hearty, but could use a little bit more seasoning. my second item i ordered was the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> and bagel, which was straightforward and clean. the smoke on the salmon was not overly harsh and i can still taste the salmon, also served with pickled garnishes which added a unique background flavour. a coulis/jam and <mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark> were the condiments, which i have nothing to say about, they were what they were. i was eating with family and they ordered items such as the flat pancakes which were well made. otherwise, it's a humble, friendly, welcoming, busy environment, our waiter was smooth and organized, but it felt too much like bouchon though.", 
            "came in for breakfast with about a ten minute wait for a table outside. went to the bar and ordered a carafe of sangria. the pager went off right after ordering and they said they'd take care of bringing it to the table but we waited a while and had to ask for the carafe we ordered and the server didn't know we ordered it so when it finally came it was a little watered down, but it was strong and refreshing none the less which was a redeeming quality!\n\ni got the chicken, brie, and apple crepe. so creamy and delicious. and boyfriend got the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> eggs benedict that was also amazing. food came fairly quickly too so that was nice. i would definitely come back here for breakfast!", 
            "i chose to take us here for breakfast after seeing that this restaurant got a high overall rating. make sure to get a table on the patio for the view and people watching! even if it's really hot outside you won't really feel it because of the a/c from the restaurant.\n\nwe arrived around 10 am and were seated promptly. the server was efficient and friendly during our stay. that morning we ordered the eggs benedict, <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> eggs benedict, chocolate croissant (pain au chocolat), two mimosa's, and an orange juice. it didn't take very long for our food and drinks to arrive at our table. the eggs benedict were delicious! the mimosa's were quite expensive at $11.50 usd whereas we can get them for about $5 in canada. our server didn't charge us for the orange juice as she assumed we would use it for our mimosa's.\n\nbesides the pricey mimosa's we would definitely return on our next visit to vegas.", 
            "i went here for brunch this afternoon with my fianc\\u00e9. we had been meaning to go here forever but as locals we don't like going to the strip often. i was in the mood for a croque madame so we decided to finally venture to mon ami gabi. \nwe chose to sit on the patio because it has a beautiful view of the bellagio fountains and also is just a great people watching spot. there was no wait although the restaurant was quite busy. \nthere were misters in the patio to keep us cool as well as umbrellas, i ordered a mimosa and my fianc\\u00e9 ordered a bloody mary. the mimosa was delicious, and the bloody mary my fianc\\u00e9 came back with from the diy bloody bar encouraged me to order one as well. \nwe began our meals with chicken liver p\\u00e2t\\u00e9 and a <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> plate. the p\\u00e2t\\u00e9 was very rich but delicious and the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> was divine. i ended up eating just the salmon and capers as the toasts it was served with began to fill me up a bit. \nafter our appetizers we got a croque madame with frites. the gruyere on the madame was so delicious and the sunny side up egg soaked into the bread perfectly. all i could hear were angels singing. the frites were crispy and had just the right amount of salt. \nit was a delicious french brunch, i would say it's family friendly restaurant as long as your children are well behaved.", 
            "this place is one of the nicest restaurants i ever visited. food quality is excellent and the place is beautiful. service was flawless as well. i went there one year ago and had steak and chicken for dinner and it was delicious. this time we went six people for brunch and had benedict eggs and omelette. the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> benedict eggs is fantastic. if you go for brunch, don't miss the gabi's coffee blend! i would definitely come again.", 
            "excellent. need i say more? huge portions of steak. delicious <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>. crusty bread was warm. overall delicious. did not disappoint. pricey but worth every penny. service stellar. overall experience was fabulous.", 
            "probably one of the best places i ever had brunch in! the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> eggs benedict was absolutely delicious. the baguette with butter was one of the best i've had. highly highly recommend!", 
            "food was excellent for breakfast, i had the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> eggs benedict. the eggs and sauce was slightly runny but tasted good. the coffee was delicious. we sat outside on the patio on thanksgiving day and it was crowded but the service was excellent. my coffee was filled several times as well as the water while we where eating. it's also a good spot for people watching.",

            "i've been to a lot of restaurants in lv.  at one point, the experiences can get all clouded (and no, it's not because i've had one too many).  but i really enjoyed mon ami gabi.  expect to pay a bit more than what you may have wanted to, but whatever.\n\nit opened at 11, we got there at 11:20 and there was a 40-minute wait to sit outside!!  that sounds ridiculous, but my mom really wouldn't have it any other way, so we opted to wait.  yes, they give you those shiny, shaky pagers so you can keep on gambling while you wait.  the decor was really pretty inside.  they have a bloody mary bar!!!  always a hit!  of course by sitting outside, you've got prime views of the bellagio fountains--so lunch and a show, always nice.\n\ni ordered the cheese plate.  everytime i go to the paris hotel, i  must have me a cheese plate.  they've got the good stuff.  my plate came with brie, gorgonzola, and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>.  it was accompanied by apple slices, grapes, and candied dates---the pairings were really good.  it also comes with a couple different breads to choose from.  the coffee was really good, too.  always a plus.\n\nmy mom and sister split a fish and chips.  the fish was high class.  this ain't pub food.  it was lightly battered and fried---it looked like the entire fillet of halbut on the plate.  the chips are a bit different.  they're more like homemade potato crunchies than chips or fries.  that was a bit of a disappointment.  other than that, can't complain.", 
            "i'd rate this as a \"high\" 3.5 star which rounds the rating up to 4.\n\nme, the wife and the in-laws had a nice dinner here.  i started with an smash of an onion soup that was fully of cheesy goodness.  the wife and the pop-in-law split a salade maison, which was a mixed green salad w/ a house vinagrette and a <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> crouton.  they enjoyed it but nothing special for them.  mom-in-law just had sat tight for her entree.  \n\ni had the skate, as my entree, which was very tasty but oh so buttery, a bit too much i would say.  the wife had the lemon chicken w/ french cut beans which she found flavorful but a bit overcooked.  pop-in-paw had the thyme-seared salmon which was quite good and mom-in-law had the sampler of vegetables which looked excellent and i tried some beets and was won over.\n\nwe all split the chocolate mousse for dessert and loved it.  it was a bit thick but they added lil pellets of crunchy chocolate thingies (cue homer) and that just made it!  this itself makes the place a 4 star!\n\nthe service was good though a bit on the slow side.  our waitress was quite nice to us and very funny too.  she suggested a great pinot noir but i completely forget the name of it but it's the only pinot noir on their wine by the glass list.", 
            "we arrived for brunch on a windy, chilly september morning, but stuck it out on the patio.  the brunch menu is just the lunch menu, so don't juggle your plans to be here at brunch.  go somewhere else.  enjoy mon ami gabi any other time!  \n\nthe waiter brought out a baguette with soft butter and yummy raspberry jam.  i usually do not eat jam but this was so good with the butter and soft, crusty bread.  i had a bloody mary, (or two!) it was good.  i heard raves about the bloody mary bar on here, but it is nothing special unless you are sitting right by it.  i would rather the waiter just bring out my drink.\n\nwe were warmed up by the tomato soup (yum) and french onion soup (yummier).  also got the appetizer of baked tomato and cheese with toasts.  i thought it would be literally sliced tomato with melted sliced cheese on top.  it was actually a tomato puree with <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>.  very good, but not expected, as we already had the tomato soup.\n\nthe <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> was horrible.  there was an ingredient in there i couldn't stand, and my mom disliked it, too.  that is not to say someone else would not like it, just not for me.  i got the chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, very good, as were the frites that came with it.  the best was the creamy chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>.  that also came with a salad with frisee and i think baby arugula with a tantalizing dressing... i wasn't sure what it was and forgot to ask our server.  champagne vinegar, perhaps?\n\ni would definitely go back, though, and get the soup and the crepe.  i would also like to try the salad with pear & walnuts and the chocolate mousse.", 
            "probably the best meal we had in vegas over thanksgiving weekend. if the weather permits, sit out on the patio and go for dinner! you have a spectacular view of the dancing waters at the bellagio - great ambiance and fun! we started with the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and tomato appetizer that was amazingly good! the bread that they serve throughout dinner is also really yummy! the boys also had the escargot that they enjoyed. for dinner i had the butter lettuce salad that was fresh with a great dressing. i also had the yukon gold potato soup with brie which was delicious and very filling. my boyfriend had the beef wellington which he liked and my parents had the steak roquefort that they absolutely loved. very tender and well prepared. and the frites that were served with it were yummy, also. our best bang for our buck on our trip!", 
            "i was so excited to have a nice dinner in vegas with my friends while on vacation.  i already researched the menu and knew what i want to get but when i got there i wanted to taste much more.  i ordered the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> on a brioche with creme fraiche, a <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> salad and then split the filet with hand cut pomme frites with a friend.  the one thing that was really good was my wine and they didn't make it!  i am pretty sure this elusive brioche was wonder bread with the crust cut off, the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> salad was more bitter greens then anything else and the filet was overdone.  you ma ask how can you go wrong with pomme frites?! well they tasted like french's fried onions that you put on top of green bean casserole.  not good. i didn't even order the chocolate mousse i had previously been dreaming about.  shame on you mon ami.....you are not my friend.", 
            "this is an example of another reason vegas is a difficult place for a normal person.  the entire experience was, frankly, magical.  the service was a bit obsequious, but she was lovely, friendly, and warm.\n\nthis is a casual eatery we walked into in paris and had no reservations.  it was a saturday night, and we were sat by a lovely, romantic window within seconds.\n\nthe atmosphere was incredible.... across from the bellagio water show, and next to a window in a romantically lit restaurant that had a wonderful aesthetic... tiled floors (slippery in heels), lovely deep wooden grain finish on the classic bar.  it was as close to a dimly lit french bistro as you might find out of france.\n\nthe food was awesome.... \n\nthe oysters had one of the best mignonette's i have ever had.  for las vegas, oyster country (sarcasm button on), they were fresh and shucked decently.  luckily, nothing like andy k.\n\nthe endive and blue <mark>Warm Goat <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark></mark> with watercress and roasted pear was sublime.  the french onion soup was great.  again, i don't like it sweeter than smoky or \"zesty\"... but it was great.\n\nthe salade maison was very good, but the presentation of the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and croutons being the piece of toast with cheese spread ontop of it was confusing... in that lauren ate that without realizing that was the \"<mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> & croutons\" inherent to the salad.\n\nthe french martini was great (grey goose with pineapple, champagne, and chambord....)\n\nthe french 75 was perfect.  i subbed beefeater for the sapphire, and it was just awesome.  awesome!\n\nbut being on the strip, even a casual, non reservation type of meal... the bill came to $140 or something.  1 app, 2 salads, 4 cocktails, one soup.... $140.\n\ni know it is demanding to ask vegas to be cheap, but to sit for a couple apps <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> and see a bill like that is just... disheartening.\n\nso... go to vegas with money.  please please shove cost out of your head prior to sitting down anywhere.\n\nbecause vegas is pricey.  check out my las vegas as to why.... but it isn't just expensive.  i work in fine dining and high end hotels, and the price point is at least 20%-35% over a normal meal.  \n\nas long as you recognize that, even a casual, spur of the moment meal can be magical, romantic, delicious, and stunning.\n\ni would go back here in a second, with the awareness i wish i had previously had.  i think having not been to vegas much, it is something i simply need to plan for across the board.", 
            "the boy was right, and decided at just the right moment to have us sit down and rest our weary feet inside the paris casino. hey, if i can't get to paris itself, at least give me some wine and some fountains to stare at and i'll be happy. throw in some fancy meat and you may get lucky.\n\nthe wait staff was nice and accommodating. my water was constantly refilled,and i had no idea how hungry i was until i nearly ate half the free bread on the table myself. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Petite Salad Maison</mark> to start, lured in by the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> crouton. it was your average salad, but very fresh and came with a great balsamic dressing. i can never recreate those at home. i also intended on ordering the roast pork and a lovely glass of beaujolais, but instead, was given roast chicken and a glass of merlot. the merlot i let slide, but when i want my pork, rotisserie chicken does not suffice! blame it on my cleavage, i know some people get distracted...but how does \"beaujolais\" sound like \"merlot\" and hows does pork roast, sound like \"chicken\"? \n\nthe waiter was also an original nor cal native and very nice, so i wasn't bothered. i got a complimentary refill on my merlot and my pork came shortly thereafter. i passed the time munching on the boy's veggie plate--which i did envy. it was gorgeous, full of fresh, seasonal, comfort veggies and he was a member of the clean plate club. garlic spinach, mashed cauliflower, roasted potatoes etc... delicious.\n\nwhen my roast arrived, i blushed. i called it the \"pork lollypop\" since really, i don't get much fancier than ground turkey or trader joe's chicken strips these days on the dole. i was in pork heaven. nestled gently on a pile of mashed potatoes with succulent roasted carrots wedged on it's sides, this roast was bathed in a savory citrus sauce--like nothing i've ever tasted, and probably won't for a while more. \n\nexcellent service, reasonable vegas prices for food that does not include french fries or gas bubbles and a great decor. it was dimly lit, sexy and i had a view of the bellagio fountains from the table, minus the 20 degree wind chill factor. oo la la!", 
            "as peggy hill observed in her neighbors backyard hot tub while eating cut squares of american sliced cheese, \"this must be what paris is like.\"\n\njust kidding. i like this place though. i had the steak frites with bearnaise sauce. very delish. the frites were just the right amount of salty and crispy. <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer was warm and cheesy and pretty amazing. we sat on the inside (to avoid the 1 hr wait to sit outside), but they sat us literally 10 feet from the open windows with our chairs facing out, towards the bellagio water show. great service and pretty decent prices for vegas.  am now curious to try lunch there...", 
            "i've been to mon ami gabi three more times since my initial review and this has definitely become my go-to restaurant when i'm in vegas and i want a guaranteed good meal for a moderate price. if you can, i highly recommend dining on the patio - you can't request it when you make a reservation, but when you check in, they will ask. \n\nmy favorite dish is the sea scallop dinner - i've had it twice and it has not disappointed. the scallops are always cooked perfectly and you get six. the scallop appetizer was fine, but the entree is by far the better choice. the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer which i had this past weekend when i dined at mon ami gabi with two friends was a big winner with our group, but how can you go wrong with <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and tomato sauce? i am not a big dessert person, but the chocolate mousse is amazing.\n\nservice is always very friendly and attentive. when my friend's steak on saturday night wasn't cooked exactly how she wanted, our server got it taken care of right away. before tip, i always seem to spend around $40 which includes wine (either a glass or a portion of a bottle), my meal, and maybe a portion of dessert. i never leave disappointed and will go back to mon ami gabi on another trip.", 
            "we were strolling along the strip and since nocthing else seemed to be open, we decided to give this place a shot. the one thing i loved about this place is that it is right across the bellagio water show. that was lovely. the food here is good. their <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> is to die for :) the waitress was really nice she even offered to take our picture after we were finished eating. maybe we will be back.", 
            "i've always been a fan of lettuce entertain you restaurants, and mon ami gabi is no different.  service and food is excellent and it is a pretty good value, considering (ny strip for $30? that is about 20-50% less than most other steak places).  decor is dim and french in style, and the view out the front leads right to the fountains of the bellagio, which provide ample entertainment on 30 minute intervals during the meal. \n\nthe food is delicious, definitely recommend the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer.  steaks were good, and when i asked for some fresh cut horseradish, that is exactly what i got, not the creamed variety that often arrives.\n\na nice, clean, civilized restaurant in the heart of vegas, not bad.", 
            "as i sit here watching andrew zimmern eat snails in france, all i can think about is mon ami gabi.\n\nit has become a birthday tradition; every year, i go to mon ami gabi.  twice.  once with my brother, who, if possible, is even more of a foodie than i am.  then one more time with whomever i am in vegas with (ex-husband, friend, friends......random stranger i met at peppermill). \n\ni've tried almost everything on their menu (including things that they don't have any more and need to bring back, like the arugula and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> crepes), and it is all phenomenal.   in order of how much of a food-orgasm they give me:\n\n1.) escargot.  i've had a surprising amount of escargot in my life, and this is the ish.  buttery, garlic-y, amazing texture; one order is often not enough.  because my baby bro and i love them so much we sometimes get two orders.\n\n2.) crepes.  ohhh...the crepes.  one birthday, i did the double trip twice in one day; brunch the first time, late dinner the second.  the best crepe of my life was here, the aforementioned arugula and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> crepe.  i had never had arugula cooked before, and its peppery flavor was perfectly complimented by the very mild and creamy <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>.  i have never seen it on the menu again, and every time i go i ask for it and everyone claims to have never heard of it.\n\n3.) french martini (vodka, chambord, pineapple, up).  no brainer.  they do it better than anyone.\n\n4.) frites.  ohhhhhhhhh the frites.  crispy.  in large quantity. \n\ntheir steaks are great, try one at least once, and i recommend the dijon or bordelaise.  i'm not saying it is the best steak i've ever had (morton's tied with a random place in kansas get that award) but it is really good, and their sauces are incredible. \n\nyou can make reservations online which is very helpful for weekends and busy evenings.\n\nmake sure you ask for a spot on the patio so you can have the perfect view of the bellagio fountain. the covered part of the patio is well air conditioned during the summer and well heated in the winter.  the uncovered part has heat lamps in winter and is near nice little spray misters in summer (they don't spray on you, but somehow help keep the air cool near you).\n\nthe servers don't wear nametags....just numbers.  why? \"we at mon ami gabi think the experience should totally be about you....our names don't matter\".  i do find this a little silly, because, by drawing attention to the fact that you don't wear nametags by wearing numbertags, didn't you just make it about you?  but having a server tell me about the jokes they make in the kitchen for certain servers (#69 gets quite abused), i find it fun and hilarious. \n\ni wish they had ranch.  dipping my frites in mayo is not appetizing.\n\nif you haven't tried it yet, go.  and go hungry.  ask for an extra baguette to take home with you.  eat as much of those carrots that they serve with the bread (on good days) as you can.   have a martini.  pretend you're in ocean's eleven.   and eat some extra escargot for me.", 
            "i had my birthday dinner here with a few friends and it was pretty good.  we had reservations and as soon as most of our party arrived they promptly seated us.  the waitress made a few appetizer and entree suggestions that were very good.  after reading all the yelpers saying that their steaks are hands down one of the best things there i just had to try.  i'm not much of a beef eater but taking a leap of faith i ordered the filet mignon with merlot butter sauce.  oh boy it was melt in your mouth delicious!  the sauce was just perfect , the sauce was in no way overwhelming and it was cooked to perfection.  it was served with potatoe frites (similar to shredded potatoe chips, not thick as french fries).  \n\nwe also ordered the escargot and bake cheese as appetizers.  i love cheese and their <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> had this tomatoe base mixed in with the creamy cheese.  if you love tomatoes and cheese it's really good with the bread.  the escargot were baked shell-less with a wonderful olive oil pesto sauce.  it was just yummy.  after all the escargots disappeared i had an idea to dip my bread into the pesto sauce that was still in the pan.  \n\nfor dessert we had the banana foster crepe.  it was big ennough to share and was wonderfully delightful!\n\nthings to try:\n\n-escargot\n-<mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>\n-seared scallops served with cauliflower puree (taste just like mash potatoes almost)\n-hanger steak (if you don't mine chewing a bit and a little gamey)\n-filet mignon with merlot butter sauce\n-crab cakes\n-oysters on a half shell\n-creme brulee\n-banana foster crepes\n\nthe servers were very polite and if you want to try out their oysters, they actually give you a sample of one before committing to a full tray of them.",

            "hands down, one of the best meals of life (...and i've had a lot of damn good meals)....\nwe made a reservation at mon ami gabi for dinner on the 4th of july. we sat inside and were waited on my michelle, who was outstanding. when we got to the table they brought us an amuse bouche of orzo salad (yum) and their french bread...warm, crusty, oh-so-satisfying.\nwe started our meal with a few drinks and also ordered the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>. so, so good....i am craving it right now. it's basically a mixture of soft cheeses (<mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark>, <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>, etc.) that are baked in the oven, mixed with fresh marinara sauce, and served with toasted french bread drizzled in basil garlic oil. there were only two of us and we basically licked the bowl clean...it was that good.\nfor our meals we both got the signature filet mignon with merlot butter and red wine reduction. i got the asparagus for my side and my friend got the fries. the portions were surprisingly large and the meat was impeccably cooked. the filet was soft and well seasoned....melted in my mouth. without a doubt, the best steak i have ever had (and funnily enough also one of the cheapest). the asparagus was fresh and delicious. i also stole quite a few fries from across the table...those things are addictive. \nwe ended the meal with creme brulee. the custard was sweet and creamy and rich....exactly what i wanted. \noverall, a fantastic meal. i couldn't pick out a single flaw (and i can almost always pinpoint more than one). during our meal i looked around the nearby tables and picked up on a few conversations, and everyone was commenting on how spectacular the food and service were...lots of happy people and bellies. i will come here time and time again. wonderful meal, wonderful waitress, and a price that honestly can't be beat. my new \"to go to\" place in vegas.", 
            "we sat in the sweet spot of the dining room closest to the street: at one of the tables just inside the open french windows, sheltered from the midday heat but with a nice view of the bellagio fountains across the street.\n\nthe design is french brasserie all the way; the service is cheerful american. this may be the perfect combination.\n\nlet's pause for a moment and offer thanks for the baguette. it's placed on your table in a paper bag. so chic. but the taste: the shattering crunch of the exterior, the fresh and chewy interior, the joy of its union with the rapidly melting, slightly salted butter . . . you could just eat the whole thing yourself, or you could order lunch. both are good choices.\n\nwe shared the butter lettuce salad, which allegedly included asparagus (didn't see many; maybe husband stole them while i was having an affair with the bread) and a huge round of <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>. briefly considered slathering the rest of the baguette with same, wolfing down the whole thing, and returning to the room for a nap. no! discipline!\n\n<mark>Freshly Ground Ahi Tuna Burger</mark> was moist and delicious. lots of wines by the glass; the riesling was refreshing.\n\nbut whatever. i primly rolled up the top of the baguette bag and popped it in my purse. nana would have been proud.", 
            "this review pertains to the lunch menu.\n\nthe skinny: gabi is not your friend - while the view est magnifique,  the food n'est pas tres bien (2.5), service: efficient but tries too hard with the \"mon-sir\" and \"bon-jouer\" (3), value: not that great considering the level of cuisine (2).\n\nwe've been to mon ami gabi for lunch a couple of times mostly because of the spectacular view of the bellagio. accordingly, the food is a bit overpriced for what it is. \n\nwe subscribe to the \"lettuce entertain you\" rewards so i got a $15 gift card on my birthday. we ventured here for lunch (with an opentable reservation).\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>, the butter lettuce salad (with asparagus, beets, and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>), and the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>. we've previously tasted their lovely skate dish and their great burgers but we decided to try something different this time. \n\nbad move.\n\nthe butter lettuce salad was meager for a $10 dish. a small dish of butter lettuce with some scatterings of asparagus and beets underneath. an overly large slice of <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> (closer to a feta cheese than a chevre) made the salad overly salty. the dressing, a creamy concoction reminescent of ranch, just doesn't work with the texture of the lettuces (it's too heavy) nor the flavours.\n\nthe <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> is yet again, overly large portion of meat with only 4 thin slices of bread. the pate is not quite what we expected. there's too much meat, not enough fat which made the pate hard to spread and not nearly as decadent as it ought to be (it might be unfair but i had a great pate at fleur de lys a day ago).\n\nfinally, the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>. at a place like this, a <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> ought to be better. first of all, no bechamel sauce - you can't have a high end croque without a nice bechamel sauce. 'nuff said. bread sliced too thinly (making it too hard when toasted), with very little in the way of ham or cheese, it was hard to justify the $12 pricetag. the bread was also a trifle greasy for my tastes. the accompanying frites were okay - more like chips than fries.\n\ndespite her really laboured/butchered french , the waitress herself was efficient, prompt and kind. she checked on us frequently enough and ensured our beverages were always filled.\n\noverall, it was an okay experience but i have definitely eaten more authentic french cuisine at a better value. (fyi -the above three items plus a diet coke would have cost well over $30 if we didn't have the giftcard.)", 
            "really wonderful. better than i expected. our server was wonderful and really attentive but didn't hover. she knew the menu in and out, which is important to me since i'm that annoying diner who asks loads of questions. \nthey bring out a delicious and warm baguette to get you started with their shaved carrot 'accoutrement.' i honestly don't think it's a french dish, but nevertheless, it was tasty. herbs, vinegar, and something else i couldn't put my finger on all blend nicely with the carrot. we got the jumbo <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> to start - most of their appetizers were shell fish related and my honey is allergic, so the shrimp had to do. it was tasty, and their cocktail sauce had the lovely horseradish punch that i love. the only downside was the shrimp tasted a little 'fishy' to me. \ni had an heirloom tomato salad with basil pesto, <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and baguette croutons. i would have been happy if dinner ended here. the tomatoes were so flavorful and the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> was really nice with the acidity. \nwe both had steak for dinner. it's a steakhouse after all, why go against the grain? we chose their classic cut which is pounded thin. i was worried about the doneness and tenderness of the meat, but was pleasantly surprised to have a perfectly medium steak that was anything but tough. i chose to have the roquefort sauce while the man went with b\\u00e9arnaise. their b\\u00e9arnaise was authentic and really quite good; i've had terrible representations lately. now, possibly the best thing about dinner were the impossibly thin and delicious frites that they serve. what machine cuts then in such a way, i haven't the slightest, but i want one in my home! they are crispy, perfectly fried and lightly sea-salted. \nmoving on to dessert (and honestly, we should have stopped to avoid the utterly bloated feeling that was to come, but if you ever get to chance to eat this dessert-do it). we decided on the banana's fosters crepe. best. decision. ever. there should be movies written about this crepe. i am a banana's fosters fan to begin with, but this had just the right amount of rum to cinnamon to banana to caramel. oh heavens...\nwe really enjoyed our dinner here, and before tip it was under $100. we were shocked. i even had 2 cocktails! really worth it - and if you're lucky, you can get a seat outside to watch the bellagio water show, too!", 
            "if i had to title my review, it would be \"the perfect lunch.\"\n\ni have been several times now and enjoyed each time.  this last time i was there, i was able to put all of those past experiences to good use to create exactly the experience i was hoping for.\n\na few things to keep in mind if you have never been mon ami gabi.  \n\n1 - the best place to sit is on the patio, however reservations are not good for the patio.  the patio is perfect for people watching, and what better place to do some people watching than on las vegas blvd!?\n\n2 - get there 10 minutes to 11 (when they start serving lunch), put your name on the list for the patio, take the square-light-up-vibrating thingy, put some money in a penny machine and wait to be called.  our square thing went off a few minutes after 11.\n\nas far as what made this experience perfect, there were many factors.  we walked in and were seated on the patio at a table for two.  our server recognized that it was a little warm where we were sitting (full sun) and offered to look for a table that was less sunny.  she found us the perfect table and it wasn't even in her section!  plus, it was a four top, right in the center of the patio, in the shade, with the most perfect view of the bellagio across the way.\n\nof course, the food always plays a huge part.  a glass of house red wine to start is always nice.  the escargot was delicious, i loved using the french bread to sop up the garlic-herb butter left in the dish.  our beautiful red and yellow tomato salad was light and refreshing with pesto and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>, two of my favorite things! the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> was phenomenal.  not too much meat, cooked to our med-rare liking.  ciabatta was soft and caramelized onions were the perfect complement.  frites were light and crispy with a little chew so you could taste the flavor and know you were eating more than air.  \n\nwith the bellagio fountain show kicking off shortly after noon (on saturday) right as we were finishing the last of our wine and paying the bill.  this was one of my top 5 favorite lunches of all time!", 
            "me: is that the line for le buffet?\nhe: yep\n\nnot willing to wait in a long ass line for buffet food, even though this city is where buffets are the norm, we walked up to the front and decided to eat lunch here.  christmas is just a day around these parts, so the inside wasn't crowded.  we opted for the patio and got a street side table where we could see the water show at bellagio.\n\nbottle of cotes du rhone - check\nsmall loaf of hot bread - check\n\nfeels like we're in paris without the long ass plane ride.  the only difference is, although it's not so obvious, they do want to turn the table.\n\nthe crispy crab cake appetizer came with a jicama and cucumber slaw.  it was good, but could have used a little less breading.  the specials sounded great and i first ordered the sandwich, but the partner ordered the steak frites with the brandy peppercorn sauce because there were three to choose from.  looking over the menu again, there was a caramelized onion and red wine sauce....sold!  the steaks were cooked to order, a little tough, but good.  the partner said he expected more peppercorns.\n\nthe frites were interesting.  more like large potato shreds fried crispy, so sort of like a cross between a fry and a chip.  i thought a little more arugula on the plate would've been nice.  we enjoyed our meal so much, we came back for dinner a couple days later.  we pretty much ordered the same.\n\nexcept, i had the filet mignon with merlot butter,  and the partner had the caramelized onions.  we shared a butter lettuce and crispy apple salad.  this also came with grilled beets and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>, and was very tasty.  and then our over indulgence kicked in and we had the chocolate mousse, creme brulee, and a trio of ice cream in pastry.  so a buffet of desserts...lol!\n\nthe service was great!  attentive and friendly.  the view of the street is by far the best part.  watching all walks of life going by was interesting.  it may not be the real paris, but it's close enough and cheaper to get to.",

            "i have come to the conclusion that not one single restaurant in paris hotel casino resort is edible.  not the cafe(s), nor the buffet, and now add mon ami gabi to the list.  \n\ni've been staying at this hotel/casino for 5 days (thanks for the comp red room, paris!).  our last night here so i thought i'd give this place a try.  i was hugely disappointed at my meal.  we were seated in the 'atrium room' with direct view of bellagio fountain.  yes, it was nice but i came here for the food.  there is a door opened out to the outdoor seating area and the constant chill wind which cools the food very fast was not 'cool'.  \n\nthe jumbo lump crab cake (celery root remoulade, gribiche sauce) was really average.  i'm glad it was grilled and not deep fried. \n\nthe butter lettuce & honey apple crisp salad (roasted beets, aged <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>, apple cider vinaigrette)  was also forgettable.  i could barely taste the dressing.  \n\nthe roast chicken & frites ( all-natural roasted half chicken, mushrooms, bacon, pearl onions) - oh pleeeaaasssee!  costco's rotisserie chicken had more flavor than this.  it was dry and tasteless!\n\nthe filet mignon (merlot butter, red wine reduction) which is their signature dish and you would think it should stand out!  first of all, i ordered it medium and it came as medium rare.  the sauce was supposed to be merlot butter but it was so bland that i had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper to flavor it.  but after about 3 bites, i had to trade it with my fiance for his roast chicken which was even worse!  \n\nand those frites, what the hell were those?  string potato chips?  you could have served it with french fries and that would have been better.  \n\nservice was friendly but i wouldn't say it was attentive.  the waiter was more interested in talking to his fellow servers than to his guests.  \n\nit's food like this that reminds me of why i don't care for french restaurants!", 
            "had never been here before sunday night.  right across from the bellagio, you can sit inside or out on the patio and see the water show. i was with the guys, but seemed like a nice place inside for a romantic interlude.. darkly lit, with old world decorations and high ceilings.. believe there was a fireplace as well.. you get the picture.  we had a 40 minute wait for the patio.  food was xlnt.    for cocktails the waitress recommended a french martini, sounded good, tasted fantastic, but failed to check on cost and it was $12.95 for one drink!  ok it was super fantastic, (gee i need to make more money).. shared a <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer, table loved it, i had the scallops with a pureed mushroom sauce, best scallops i had ever eaten. think they were $23.. lovely.. would not hesitate to return ..this is a steak house, but no one tried a steak, one guy dieting had soup, another had the fish and chips which was a flat fillet rather than the breaded chunky pieces you usually see.  everything was excellent, bill was $180 for 3, which included 3 cocktails and 2 glasses of wine and a shared dessert.", 
            "eating in las vegas isn't cheap and any place that serves an entree in the realm of $25 can be considered a bargain. we decided to come here for a pre-show dinner. we hadn't eaten anything french recently and being from a backwoods town in the south where french isn't something you see very often, we were ready to try this place. we got reservations and had to only wait about 10 minutes for our table. we got an authentic french waiter but the poor thing was confused for most of the night. i am sure our southern accents scared the hell out of him. he couldn't remember the specials but that was ok since he seemed like a pretty nice guy.\n\nwe were starving since we had skipped lunch that day. i ordered the onion soup which was very good. they give you a fairly large portion which could be easily split between two people or eaten as a meal in itself with a salad. our table also ordered the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> as appetizer which was delicious. i ended up getting the steak bearnaise with hand-cut fries. not a big fan of the fries. they were cooked properly but i like my potatoes cut thicker. the steak was cooked perfectly and tender. the bearnaise sauce was very good and probably the highlight of the entree. we passed on dessert. \n\nservice was good but not exceptional. the food was good but nothing was spectacular enough to warrant a 5 star consideration. this place is probably more of a 3.5 stars but i will round up due to the appetizer and nice atmosphere. i will be moving to the dc area soon so i may have to hit up the one in bethesda. for the price you can't beat it though.", 
            "well first off, walking up and seeing an exorbitant line gave me the idea that the place was some awesome steak house. boy was i wrong... \ncame here with the parents and sat down a little bit after our reservation time, no big deal. the server martan(?) was alright as he recommended a good wine for the table. anyways, the hot baguette and pickled carrots were an alright starter. then came the appetizer; the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> (don't ask why the father thought it would be good). the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> tasted more like a bowl of spaghetti o's sauce accompanied by a piece of pesto covered bread, ick. \n     then came the entrees; i ordered the steak bordelaise which came with scrapped french fries which were probably the best part of my experience at mon ami gabi. the first couple bites of my steak were alright, as i ordered it medium, expecting it to be as so throughout, boy was i wrong (again). 2 bites through, i started noticing it was nearly impossible to cut through the steak, much less chew it, without feeling like it was about to fly away off the plate at 100 miles per hour. what i was left with was a mangled piece of tendon, and 2 half chewed rubbery pieces of meat that i couldnt muster up the courage to swallow. bottom line, this place charges above average prices for below average food, but if you like good bread and french fries, come here i guess. you wont see me here again... for 60 bucks a head i'll wait to head to l'entrecote when i'm in london next.", 
            "located at the paris hotel in viva las vegas, this is by far the best french restaurant on the strip. \n\nfor appetizers we ordered <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and it did not disappoint. the filet mignon is cooked in a red wine reduction. i now understand what a tender and flavorful filet is supposed to taste like. a friend ordered the skirt steak and said it was also very good. the house red merlot was also very impressive.\n\nfor dessert, we shared the bread pudding. again another home run!\n\nto get the full experience, ask to be seated outside and enjoy the view of the bellagio fountains (on a weekend expect a long wait for outdoor.\n\nwent back with on girls trip and it did not disappoint!",

(apologies to francophiles if i misspelled any of that...) we started with the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> which came with a stunning crispy yet soft herb bread. then, shocker of all evening, my \"burger and fries\" boyfriend ordered a steak, and ordered it medium rare! (we're talking about a \"everything should be well-done thank you very much,\" kind of guy here, so you should be shocked, too!) he got the steak roquefort  (bleu cheese sauce) and ate pretty much the whole thing. i ordered the steak bordelaise (caramelized onions red wine reduction) and ate pretty much all of it. (ok, you caught me. i ate the whole thing. it was tasty. and i regret nothing.)\n\nin addition, there are two other noteworthy items: 1) st. germain +champagne cocktails = baaaannnnggggiiiinnng; 2) while there were multiple servers working our table, not one of them made an attempt to rush out. we got to linger over every course which, again, was freaking wonderful after rush rush travel travel we had endured for the last 24 hrs. \n\noverall, i highly recommend this little spot in paris las vegas.   \n\nand seriously, get the st. germain-tasty-nectar-of-the-gods-in-a-very-formal-french-way cocktail. you'll love it. i think. or you should. whatever, just try the steak ok? i know you won't regret that.", 
            "mon ami gabi is ridiculously charming. i certainly felt like i was in france (mexican servers gave vegas away).  prepare for long lines, but the place is certainly worth it. patio seating on a first come, first serve basis, while you can reserve a table on opentable for the inside seating. \n\nalthough i am generally not a duck fan, i went for duck config with lentils. i must say, i was quite blown away, considering that i don't particularly like duck. the config was juicy, moist and fatty, and the duck was not gamey at all. the green lentils were refreshing and cooked perfectly. \n\ni also visited mon ami gabi for breakfast. my brioche toast (a side order) was delicious and spinach and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> omelette melted in mouth.", 
            "it is strange that i don't have a review for them, and yet i have been here every year that i have had my cosmoprof north america tradeshow for our annual girls night( a total of 7 times and counting) there are usually 7 to 10 of us lovely and we take a seat on the patio to people watch and enjoy a beverage ( or three) of sorts. the food is delicious! delicious! from the warm brie to the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> to the steaks, to the pomme frittes, to the desserts. sweet baby jesus you can't go wrong at this place. it seems that the drinks get stronger and stronger as the night progresses so w are usually fat, full, tired, and tipsy but no matter what, we always have a great time! see you next year ( if not sooner)", 
            "similar menu to bouchon in the venetian but not quite bouchon quality ( but very close). had an amazing meal with a great view of the strip. fris\\u00e9e salad, mussels, <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>, <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, stiff cocktails and reasonably priced!",

            "i have dined at mon ami gabi a couple of times without disappointment. their strip steak is fabulous, the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer served with toasted garlic bread is amazing.  the only disappointing entree are their $17 salads.  the chopped salad with grilled chicken is way too small for the price they charge, it's more like a side salad, this is where i really just don't understand restaurants.....why be cheap with the least expensive ingriedient!!...really? .  convenient place to dine at the paris hotel, however you are paying for the view...", 
            "staying at the bellagio and being that there is such a limited amount of outdoor dining there on the strip i thought our party of 8 would enjoy a comfortable casual fine dining experience across the street at the paris here last night.  with reservations for 8 persons at 7:45 in hand we entered a very small bar area where we could barely find a table of this packed place.  hostess said table should be ready on time but sorry even though you had a reservation and it was noted outside it's not guaranteed if you want to sit outside its going to be at 9pm  strike one!\n\nfairly diverse menu french based steakhouse & bistro with some really great boudreaux wines that were exceptionally priced and not overkill on the markup.  8 in tow for dinner i'll break it down as simple as possible hot french breach loaves with exceptional homemade butter was presented.  waitress took forever to get to us and even longer to take our order after spending god knows how long chasing our wine down.\n\nappetizers:  \nfrench onion soup was good but nothing out of this world for 9.50 a bowl of soup and it was not piping hot, but lukewarm and very little cheese covered the bow.  big miss here on simple french item. \n<mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> 8.95 & tomatoes sauce with warm garlic bread was better and the escargot with warm garlic butter was a hit with two of my friends.   the mussels with white wine with herbs were also a huge success. \n\nentrees:  \nny strip 39.95 with b\\u00e9arnaise sauce was tasteless and cold to the touch and undercooked. had to send it back but there was not much you could do to fix this.  the steak frites were impossible to eat tasteless also and ice cold.\n\n22oz bone in rib eye with b\\u00e9arnaise sauce was better juicy and coated properly and it was temperature hot. steak frites ice cold\n\ndover sole night's special neither was gummy and not very good nor was the chicken pallard pounded and covered with greens. a dry flat chicken breast that took nothing to make or present but it was screwed up royally.  \n\ncouple of half roasted chickens was ok but again nothing to write home about in fact all the entrees were either ok - passable or downright bad.  theme of the night all the food was lukewarm. \n\nservice she tried to be there but they are just too busy and overwhelmed as the food took over 50 minutes to arrive after ordering and the place is simply a cluster phuck on wheels as far as food and service. \n\ni'm really trying to be objective here for ambiance, etc but the bottom line is the food was mediocre, our reservations were not honored or shall i say ignored request, the food was not hot and the service was not up to par.  a giant next for this traveling group as we won't be returning anytime soon.  they will continue to survive and thrive due to a prime location but there are so many other dining options available in this great city we won't be contributing to their success.", 
            "this restaurant was an incredible experience.  we had wonderful customer service and the food was equally as impressive.  i could have had three servings of the warm <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and tomato sauce appetizer.  while telling our server how much i enjoyed it, she mentioned that i could leave my name and contact info and the chef would email me the recipe directly.  i have never been in a restaurant where that option is provided and sure enough, two days after dinner, an email from their chef arrived to my inbox.  \n\nthe prices are extremely reasonable for the high quality of the food.  i will certainly dine there again on future trips to vegas!", 
            "you know over the course of several years ive revisited mon ami on several occasions and each time has gotten better than the last. i used to laughingly refer to mon ami as the olive garden of french restaurants, homogenized versions of french bistro classics. but as i grow older and (hopefully) wiser ive found that this isn't really the case. yes this is a chain but they do try to do their best with what they do. i re-read my previous review (2008) and wow did i just sound like an arrogant dick. i apologize for that and sure i could delete it but think its much better left to show a contrast of me growing up. \n\nnow with all that being said, i have to say that i always crave their ribeye steak slathered in deliciously sweet bordelaise sauce when we visit. this is vegas and there are loads of steakhouses pretty much everywhere but for the price point this steak is a great value as well as a great taste! its slightly fatty, beefy richness is cooked exactly how i love it, medium rare. this imho is the only steak on the menu to order. while the lesser priced steaks are alright its only a few bucks more for the ribeye. \n\nif you haven't tried it, the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and tomato sauce appetizer is super tasty. creamy <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> melts into the tomato sauce fortifying it with amazing flavor. it comes with a slab of garlic butter soaked bread which is kind of greasy so i opted for hot fresh baguette. the fris\\u00e9e, kale and <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> make for an awesome salad that's covered with a single poached egg. you know you can put warmed egg yolks on anything and it'll taste good. the dressing is nicely acid with a slight sweetness that cuts the bacon and egg richness. so good.\n\nwho knows, maybe my supposed standards have gone down or perhaps, just perhaps, good food is just good food no matter where it comes from. regardless of the case one (me) doesn't need to act like an arrogant bitch about it.",

            "this place never disappoints. ask for a table on the strip patio. worth the wait! oh now i love to watch the crazy drive by while shipping a french martini. <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appie is delish! have had several items here, all good. very good burgers. strong pours in drinks and wonderful service. great spot for lunch or a quick appetizer and drink while walking the strip!", 
            "pretty cool little joint. my first time at a french restaurant (in the past, i've avoided them like the plague). my partner ordered soup <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>, and he enjoyed it. i had the night's fish special and a <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> dish. all of the food was very good. they provided us with an endless supply of bread, which was nice.\n\nthe real reason to come here is the view. you can't beat the fountains at night time (just make sure you're close to a heater, if it's cold).", 
            "another great dining experience at mon ami gabi. there were 2 of us and we decided to share everything.  we started with the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>, always a favorite.  we shared a full order of mussels and <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> (mac n cheese) and brussel sprouts.  the mussels were big and juicy, <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> is made with gruyere and was very yummy, brussel sprouts were made with bacon making them very flavorful.  i have been here many times and am never disappointed.", 
            "everything is incredibly good, but their sides are the best.  i got a plate of three sides (garlic spinach, mac & cheese, whipped cauliflower), and had to fight off my friends from abandoning their entrees and eating all mine.  the gratin soup is also good, and the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> is excellent.", 
            "had an amazing last meal in vegas here with 10 people. had to place a reservation and then wait about 30-40 mins to get a patio seat, but well worth it even during the daytime. i mean, just go get a drink at the eiffel tower bar while you wait. service was great, food was even better. for drinks i had a glass of their sparkling rose and then a glass of the frangria. the frangria as pleasantly not watered down or too fruity and also probably the cheapest drink on the menu :) for an appetizer i had a small portion of the mussels - delicious. i also tried someone else's <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>. amazing. another person in our party got the duck confit and that too looked amazing. for my main dish i went with the lobster roll. huge chunks of lobster and the most delicious, perfectly baked bun. came with a little side salad and their fries are something else. i'm typically not a fries person, but their's are great. no ketchup or dipping sauce needed. a little pricey for lunch, but honestly everything in vegas is pricey that's not fast food.", 
            "wow....this place is definitely worth eating at and definitely worth all 5 stars!!!! first of all ,make reservations its a  busy restaurant. this place is super cute and a cozy gem that feels like your in paris......the bread and butter they bring in the beginning was so good. my fiance and i tried the \"<mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>\" as an appetizer....omggg it was beyond amazing!!!! must try!!!!..then we had the filet mignon and steak, both were definitely tasty and delicious. so we both loved this place and if your thinking of trying this place out, definitely go for it,totally worth it!!!!!!:)", 
            "we had a beautiful early dinner here on a saturday night during our girls' trip to vegas.  the other ladies had previously been here, and while i have dined at the eiffel tower restaurant, i had never been to mon ami gabi.  who knew you could get such a good view of the bellagio fountains without actually being at the bellagio!\n\nobviously you want to eat on the patio.  we made reservations through opentable for 4:45 and requested the patio, but then read that the patio is seated in a first come first serve basis, so you can't actually request it ahead of time.  well luckily for us, they had a table for six, perfectly shaded by an umbrella and seated us just in time for a fountain show.  this place was packed!  even so early on a saturday!  \n\nwe ordered a carafe of sangria for the table (lovely) and a st. germain's cocktail carafe (also lovely, but good in smaller portions, so thank goodness there were six of us).  we also shared a <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer.  not enough garlic bread comes with the order to sop up all the extra tomato sauce, but luckily their baguettes for the table are just as delicious and will be replenished if you ask.  the most impressive thing was the one of us was on a gluten-free diet, so not only did she get a special gluten-free menu, but they brought her gluten free bread!  not bad.  the rest of us enjoyed our gluten-packed alternatives and the pickled carrots that came with it were something i'd never think to serve with bread and butter, but strangely worked.  \n\nfor the entrees 2 of us got steak, 2 got fish, one got veggies, and one got chicken.  the portions are very plentiful, the sauces well-balanced, and the food was all fresh and warm.  i opted for the filet <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>.  we were informed the filets were so tender we could cut them with a butter knife...which may explain why we didn't get steak knives.  while i do love fork-tender meat, i also sometimes appreciate a steak knife, even if i \"don't need it\".  i hit a little gristle at one point that was very hard to work through with just my regular table knife, but at that point it wasn't worth it to ask for the steak knife.  other than that, the steak tasted wonderful, and it was cooked perfectly rare for my tastes.  my second gripe, though, was with the \"fries\" that came with it.  i love that they're innovative and these aren't just typical steak fries, but unfortunately they didn't float my boat.  they were very much a cross between fries and chips.  i'm not a fan of potato chips unless they're flavored or i have dip for them.  but when i'm eating a nice filet, i especially am not in the mood for potato chips.  le sigh.  they weren't committed enough to either the fry or the chip lineage, so i was left disappointed.  now i imagine for the rest of the dining public, they'd probably love a chip/fry hybrid.  sadly, even a side of mayo to dip my fries in (it's so good!  and very belgian) didn't help much.  \n\nwe were too stuffed for dessert, sadly, but in all the dining experience was lovely, and the food really was delicious (minus my personal vendetta against the \"fries\").  i would gladly go back, because you get a nice meal for a much more reasonable price than at many of the other fancy vegas gourmet restaurants with an unbeatable view.",

            "the main reason we selected this restaurant was to dine on the patio and watch the lovely fountain show across the street at the bellagio so our expectations on food and service weren't terribly high. in the end, we left quite pleased with our  brunch experience.\n\nwe started the meal with  a carafe of their version of sangria which was delicious and not too sweet as well as the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>. i was a bit surprised by the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> as it was served at the center of an interesting tomato sauce and i had never seen that before. it came with crispy garlic bread which was good but i preferred it with the  baguette that was served at the on set of the meal. \n\nfor our entrees, we opted for a <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> with caramelized onions and sliced apples and a <mark>Cobb Salad</mark>. the sandwich was really a let down. the ciabatta roll it was served on drowned out all of the potentially good flavors and overall the flavors were on the sweet side. the salad however was delicious with fresh avocado, turkey, crispy bacon. the house dressing was a great compliment. \n\nfor the location on the strip, the prices were very reasonable and we left happy. all in all a very decent place to grab a bite and take in the sights of vegas.", 
            "this is a must!  the meal starts with a warm baguette with butter the baguette was perfect. the mushroom soup was incredible the onion soup is very good not sal. the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and beet salad was a little disappointing there's only like three pieces of beet, and it was mostly lettuce spinach lettuce. the next thing we had was scallops gratin the portion was very small only three scallops but extremely tasty. i had the pan fried whitefish with a mushroom pur\\u00e9e and some roasted vegetables with nuts, it was incedible!!!!\n\nj-sun endorsed", 
            "i love this restaurant! it is a must-stop for me when i am in vegas. the location is what truly sells it. i always sit outside where you have an incredible view of the bellagio fountains while you dine. perfect for simple wine and appetizers or for a whole meal. they have great heaters cranking in the winter, so you can still comfortably enjoy being on the patio. if there is one thing i would tell everyone to do, it is sit outside and sip a glass of wine. you will not regret it!\n\nwhile the view sells it for me, the food and service are pretty great as well. for vegas, the prices are pretty reasonable. in the past i've done the french onion soup and a side salad, which have been perfect. the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer is warm and satisfying, great to snack on with a glass of wine. \n\ni landed in vegas 2 nights ago, and my friend's flight was delayed coming in, so i was on my own for dinner. i immediately knew i would go to mon ami gabi. i bundled up in my winter coat and walked over. i asked for a table outside and was very comfortable under one of the many, many heaters they have out there. my server was incredibly helpful with the wine list as my knowledge of french wine is limited, and i loved what he picked for me. you are immediately presented with a loaf of bread and butter, as well as an amuse buche. tonight is was green apple and fennel with a mayonnaise dressing (the french really do love their mayo). it was a lovely snack while i debated what i wanted. when the waiter came back, i could not make a decision. i mentioned wanting to try the steak tartare as it is something i've somehow never had, and he said that it was his favorite thing on the menu and i must get it. not wanting to drop $35 and also not being that hungry, he offered to have them make me a half order as an appetizer and charge half the price. sold!\n\nit was really delicious, and i am so glad i listened to him. plus, with the smaller portion and price point, i had room for dessert! again torn between a few options, i went with his recommendation of the bananas foster crepe. delicious only begins to explain how good it was. the caramel sauce was decadent and the crepe was light and fluffy. i spent about an hour and a half there, slowly sipping my wine and reading my book while i ate, pausing every 20 minutes or so to watch the amazing fountains across the street (and the people watching isn't bad either :). my server would occasionally stop to check on me, often engaging in some lovely conversation and never making me feel like i should hurry up and leave. \n\na trip to vegas should always begin with a night on the patio at mon ami gabi!", 
            "i had one of the best french dinners here!\nit was outstanding and we were really quite surprised at how wonderful the food was.\n\nescargot was buttery but not too greasy and had a parsley mixture which added to its unique flavor.\n\nthe bone in ribeye is a must u have to order it medium rare and it will melt in your mouth with the perfect combination of herbs for the rich beefy flavor.\n\nthe <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> in tomato sauce appetizer was magnificently seasoned as it burst in your mouth and filled your tastebuds with a tantalizing taste of balanced <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and fresh tomatoes.\ni'm returning!", 
            "one of the best places to go. service is amazing, view is great and food is always yummy.  been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner throughout all my vegas visits. they never disappoint. the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> is great to share. the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> with warm bread is always a hit. there's a bloody mary bar on the weekends. just a great place. make sure to call ahead for patio seating. heat lamps are on outside when it's chilly. table by the window inside is perfect too. enjoy!!!", 
            "you gotta try this place when you come to vegas. and you gotta make sure you reserve patio seating! if you're coming for dinner, make your reservations after 7pm, that way the bellagio fountains will go off every 15 minutes. it's so gorgeous and such a prime location on the strip. we ordered cocktails and the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>-- everything was fabulous! wonderful service as well.", 
            "had a nice little meal here the first night of a conference i attended. i've been to the one in chicago, and liked it, and there aren't any real complaints here, either.\n\nstarted with the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and tomato sauce. it was tasty, but i'm a sucker for any type of <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>-based dish. my main course was the scallop dish, and while there were 5 scallops on my plate, they were paired with a few measly mushrooms and it just didn't go well together.\n\nthe view was great, though - we sat instead by right by the windows facing the bellagio. it was like dinner and a show.", 
            "my las vegas trip is not complete until i come here at least once. my favorites are escargot, <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>, frangria, <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> and much more. service is always excellent but for the one time when gabriel who seemed like he was more into himself than anything, \"took care of us.\" other than that their servers are pleasant, attentive and down to earth. if i had a place to go in san francisco that was this classy, affordable, approachable and comfortable, i'd be there at least once a week! love u mon ami gabi!", 
            "one of the best restaurants in vegas for the price. always reasonably priced and delicious. i always get the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> for an appetizer. so good and the waiter brought us extra garlic bread for it. i ordered the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> to share which came with a whole lobster, prawns, oysters, salmon, and a seaweed salad all for $50. talk about a deal! we sat on the patio which was great because we were able to see the fountains at the bellagio. it was also heated so you don't have to worry about being cold. we were about to order dessert when we realized we were running late for a show. we had already ordered cappucinos so we asked our waiter if her could make them to-go. he put our drinks in to-go cups and brought us our checks very quickly. i always enjoy coming here for the great food, nice atmosphere, and reasonable prices.", 
            "best steak i've ever had. the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer is a must. it's all to die for. our server was just as phenomenal as the food. will be back", 
            "i'll start by saying that i'm the kind of person that likes variety, but this place was so good and well-priced that i found myself there on two consecutive nights recently.  first of all, you can request to sit in their large windowed room or on their patio in order to view the spectacle that is the bellagio water show.  at night the show is very beautiful, and contrasts well with the soft candelight and ambiance of the dining room.\n\nconcerning the food, i started with the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and tomato sauce appetizer.  everyone at my table thought this was beyond good.  they serve it with a crispy garlic bread, and the portion is rather large so you'll want to share with a few other people if you can.  for my main dish i chose the pan seared scallops, which were perfectly cooked and tender with a sweet puree sauce.  i also made sure to try my friend's filet mignon with merlot butter sauce and it was delicious.  it came out to be about two inches thick, and really was a beautiful piece of meat which was well complemented by the crispy texture of the pommes frites.  if you try combining the scallops with the filet into a surf-and-turf kind of heaven, you won't be disappointed.\n\nfor dessert we tried several of their varieties.  by far the best was the white chocolate bread pudding.  it was rich and delicious, without the gummy texture that some poorly cooked bread pudding tends to take on.  i specifically ordered the lemon tart, which was combined with some sour cherry concoction and was truly delicious.  if you like your dessert a bit tart, i would definitely recommend this.  the chocolate flourless cake was really good too, and came with a delicious ice cream.  \n\nmy only complaint, which is probably a matter of personal preference, is that i found the french onion soup just okay.  it was a bit too sweet for me, and i would have liked the bread to retain some of it's crunch.  other than that, everything else was delicious!", 
            "dinner at mon ami gabi was good... nothing spectacular, but good.\n\nwe told the hostess our party was all here, but then two of our group wandered off by the time the buzzer was called, and she was not happy when we sat down with 2 missing people from the group. she rolled her eyes at us, which was a little uncalled for.\n\nbesides that, the servers were great, and the food was good. the appetizers were our favorites--the baked brie and warm <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>/marinara dip were amazing. i could have licked the plates! my steak was fine... a little overcooked, but fine. i also tried the scallops which weren't memorable.", 
            "sofia is the best hostess there! such a beautiful view and their food is amazing! try the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> dip, i didn't think i even liked <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> but i couldn't stop eating it!", 
            "had lunch here today with a couple friends. was nice out so we sat outside at the bar and were attentively taken care of by a guy named robert, who was fantastic! had a few appetizers and a sandwich. i had the endive and roquefort salad along with a warm <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> dip with toasted bread. both were amazing. the people i was with had french martinis which were terrific as they were recommended by robert. we ended with profiterouls and a chocolate pecan bar and an espresso martini. everything was great. thanks for a nice lunch.", 
            "this was one of the best meals i have ever had, hands down. and now i will be returning every time i go to vegas!\ni made reservations for a birthday dinner by the front windows. when we arrived for our reservation, the hostess said we would have to wait 15-20 minutes for the window. so worth the wait. we played on the slot machines right in front until the buzzer went off only 2 minutes later. \nour hostess was so friendly and we got a full conversation in by the time we were seated. that never happens! she was also able to give us a gluten free menu for one of the members of the group. we were promptly given warm french bread in a cute baguette holder and the server gave the friend gluten free bread without even asking! that is a perfect way to get customers to return! \n\nfor an appetizer we got the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> with tomato sauce and garlic bread. we should have ordered these individually because it was heaven on a plate. everything about this dish had me wanting more.\nfor steak frites (what else would you order), i got the bordelaise with wine sauce and onions cooked medium-rare. this was a large, tender piece of meat with a pile of fries and plenty of caramelized onions. they really get their portions right! my friends got the bernaise steak frites and that sauce was pretty spectacular as well. \nfor dessert, we got the profiteroles and i am convinced they imported them straight from france. again, amazing. i highly recommend! only weird thing about the meal was that they did nothing for the friends birthday, so i am assuming there was a lack of communication between the hostess and the server.\n\ntotal was around $60 a person for steak, appetizer, dessert, and split bottle of wine. for vegas, and how great this meal was, that was a fantastic deal.\noh and while this is all going on, the bellagio fountains are going off every 15 minutes right in front of us.", 
            "this place is awesome!  actually ended up eating dinner here twice on my 3-day trip to vegas last month. nothing beats sitting on the patio, overlooking the strip.. great views & great people-watching! thoroughly enjoyed a steak frites plate on my first visit.. the strip steak was cooked to perfection and the fries were delicious.  on my second visit i enjoyed gabi's martini, which was terrific. the highlight of all my time at mon ami gabi? the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>! absolutely, hands-down the best dish out there. the flatbread, the sauce, and the cheese make the perfect combo. only wish it was served with more bread!  i also had the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and an order of 6 oysters on the half shell which were in special that night... everything was great! a very memorable evening, can't wait to return!", 
            "our stop everytime we come to vegas.  love their filet mignon with merlot butter and hanger steak is delicious too.  this time i tried their beat and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> salad....perfect blend of sweet and salty taste each ingredient all around.  we had a party of four and half our party came late.  they wouldn't seat us until our whole party arrived.  i was worried our reservation would get canceled because they were nearly 30 minutes late past our reservation, but they seated us during prime time.   thank you once again for a wonderful time.  until next time.", 
            "i stop in at mon ami gabi every single time i'm in vegas. there is something about the delicious <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer that keeps bringing me back. everything from their cuts of meat to burgers to chicken dishes are just mouth watering! and who could forget that view? the service is always friendly and they are quick to communicate... the first time i ate here someone dropped my entree and the manager came out to tell me... being courteous goes a long way.", 
            "my friends and i stopped by for a late lunch.  we only had a few hours before dinner so we weren't super hungry.  i ordered the baked brie (served with roasted garlic and toasted bread), one of my friends ordered the arugula salad with walnuts, grapefruit and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>, and my other friend ordered the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> (served with bread, capers and creme fraiche).  we ordered a small carafe of a st. germaine cocktail (it was $12.50 for the carafe and we got about 5 short drinks out of it).  before our food came out they brought us warm bread with delicious butter, and this grated carrot salad marinated in honey along with other things.  it was delicious! our food came out shortly after and we loved all three of our dishes.  i forget our servers name but he was super nice and prompt.  i would love to go back to try their entrees.  our dishes were a little bit pricey but definitely not too bad for being on the strip.", 
            "wow so decadent.  the service was attentive and polite.  we ordered an olive plate as well as some <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer and by the time our food came, which included a soup, i'm sad to say i was hardly able to eat it!  very very good, but choose wisely and don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach!\n\ngenerous portions and everything is very rich.  great wine selection, too.", 
            "i did my wedding dinner here. all the food and appetizers were phenomenal! the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> sticks and ahi sliders were the bomb.com! i got tons of compliments on the food. the service was also exceptional! kristina and her crew took care of a party of 60 without a problem! she also let us know when we were at our minimum so we didn't have to overspend and made a vegetarian dish that wasn't on our set menu for a vegan friend! \n\ndrew, the coordinator, made the booking process smooth and seamless, which was essential since we were coming in from out of town! \n\nloved this place!!! :)", 
            "i came here for a late lunch, and despite very slow service, enjoyed the meal. the outdoor patio was warm and sunny - a rarity for a casino/hotel restaurant here to have a nice patio. the half baguette brought to the table was hot and fresh. the food was very tasty and reasonably portioned. i shared the sandwich of the day with my husband since we weren't too hungry. it was served open-faced (easier to share) with toasted whole-grain bread, thinly spread <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>, with a few rounds of roasted eggplant, greens and yellow grape tomatoes all dressed in a vinaigrette. the beer was expensive, as was the food, but that seems to be nearly inescapable here. the menu seemed to have a lot of heavier dishes; surprised not to see a basic salad nicoise on the menu. i hate how expensive simple good food is here in las vegas, but this isn't a place where i felt like i wasted my money.", 
            "every month, our team at work plans a team building event for us to get to know one another outside of the office. for the month of march, we wanted to do it big.  we wanted to experience something out of the norm, somewhere that required a dress up opportunity. there were a few options, however, we all ended up deciding on mon ami gabi for our \"fancy dinner\" event. boy were we excited!\n\nwhen you enter the restaurant, you immediately hit the bar area. along with the hostess stand, you see a bunch of high top tables and bar seating. the place just exudes a romantic vibe! it's located directly under the vegas version eiffel tower and along the strip sidewalk. the lights in the location are dim and intimate, the white table clothes bring the upscale element. wine glasses on the table sparkled brightly. man, we were excited! our table top was on the south end of the restaurant and the corner windows viewed the sidewalk veranda and the tower base. our server, although i can't remember her name, was super sweet! she was personable and offered some really great appetizers and drinks. what i really liked about her was her efficiency! we had a 13 person party and she was still on it! our food came out hot and ready in record time! for our apps, drinks and meals, here's what we had:\n\nchateau laronde desormes bordeaux for $54 a bottle - this wine was on point! it was soft with a sweet finish. definitely an everyday kind of bordeaux, something you can drink all the time. this wine went great with my meal!\n\nwarm brie cheese for $12.95 - served with black pepper honey, garlic, hazelnuts, croutons and greens. i love brie. this combination was no different. whole cloves of roasted garlic enhanced the flavor of the cheese very well. \n\n<mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> for $11.95 - first time trying this.  the best thing i had that night! served with burgundy red wine mustard and toast brioche with a garnish of gherkins and olives. the burgundy mustard brought a spicy/tangy element and the mouse was so rich and divine. this is must try, so delicious!\n\n<mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> for $11.95 - another great dish. tomato sauce surrounded the cheese with herb garlic bread. the cheese was super creamy and went well with the tomato profile. \n\n<mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> for $49.95 - what a platter! stuffed with shrimp, oysters and lobsters, this dish offered a little bit of everything for everyone! there were various dipping sauces and it was all served over ice. \n\nbone in ribeye for $39.95 - this was my actual dinner. 22oz cut of steak, perfectly cooked to my temperature, served with a bearnaise sauce and their signature hand cut fries. the steak was delicious. the right amount of marbleized meat, perfectly seasoned and packed with flavor and juices. ah-maze-ing. the bearnaise sauce was definitely not needed but offered another element. the fries were flat and super crispy. really helped to break up the meat with a crunchy aspect. \n\nwhat a meal! this place has got to be one of the best upscale restaurants i've tried here in vegas. i definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for an amazing date night restaurant, team building dinner joint or event a place that serves the best pate! i will for sure be back, time and time again.  thank you so much, mon ami gabi, for making this evening one that i'll never forget!",

            "the service was great here and it was decent french-esque food. the inside is dark and candlelit. try to get a patio seat if possible. we weren't able to. \n\nfirst, the good: omg the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>. omg the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>. the cheese was warm, soft, and served swimming in tomato sauce. it was served with warm garlic bread, and my biggest joy in life is garlic bread dripping with cheese and delicious sauce. it was a little bit of nirvana for dinner. unfortunately, it maybe set the bar a little high for the rest of the meal, because it didn't live up to the first course. \n\nwe also had the warm brie. i love a cheese plate served with hazelnuts, so that was the high point. unfortunately, the croutons were dry and hard. i ended up skipping the croutons it came with and eating regular bread with it, and enjoyed that more. \n\ni had the half portion of mussels and the frites. i didn't love the frites because they were hard and overly crunchy with no real potato in them. i dug around in the basket to see if there were better ones, but nope. all overcooked and shriveled. even dipped in the broth from my mussels, they were a difficult, flavorless side, and i didn't eat many of them. the mussels themselves were pretty good, and it was served in a basic, lemony wine sauce. \n\nmon ami gabi bills itself as a steakhouse, and several people in our party did get steaks and they enjoyed them. i didn't try it, so i can't speak to those, but maybe they're more proficient at their main attraction. \n\nwe were celebrating a couple of birthdays, so they served profiteroles with sparkler candles. they were festive, but not incredibly delicious. then again, i always have high expectations for french pastry, and maybe that's not fair for a place sitting literally in the shadow of a replica eiffel tower on the vegas strip. however, it was pricey enough to expect better food than we got. \n\nmy advice? come and gorge on cheese, bread, and wine. do as the french do and your meal will be more satisfying.",

            "every time we come to vegas, we go there for lunch. this time we had <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark>, which was great. <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> was simply amazing, and is one of their famous appetizers. i had crape with cheese which was good, and hubby had lobster roll, which was pretty good as well. the only thing i didn't like was their bloody mary, but as long as the food is good, i can live with that :) service could have been slightly better, i think they forgot about us for a brief moment. so 4 stars this time.", 
            "mon ami gabi had been on my wish list for quite some time. the most recent trip to vegas allowed me to finally go this establishment and i was not disappointed.\n\nfirst mon ami gabi is located right on the vegas strip with both an indoor and outdoor section with a nice view of the fountains at the bellagio casino across the strip. we decided to eat indoors since it was over 100 degrees that day. \n\ni ordered a mixture of appetizers that included the french onion soup/<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>, the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark>, and the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>. the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> i'd only seen on a spanish menu before so i was interested in comparing them. mon ami's take was nice and creamy with a tomato sauce surrounding it and a slice of french bread with an herb garlic mix on top to scoop up the food with. the pate was nice and creamy and served with some toasted bread to it with. the onion soup was good but not as thick with cheese as i would have liked but had good flavor nonetheless.\n\nmy son got <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> which was served with mon ami's thinly sliced fries. he devoured it and especially liked the au jos sauce to dip it in.\n\nmy niece ordered the cheeseburger that was served with fries as well and loved it.\n\nthe one drawback was my wife got the classique steak. mon ami has several steak preparations but uses the same cut for each one. my wife said it wasn't the greatest piece of meat so she was slightly disappointed.\n\ndespite that we would gladly go back to mon ami gabi and i was happy to finally check this restaurant off my list.", 
            "molly was our server. extremely friendly, knowledgable and attentive. food was amazing, particularly the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>, escargot, chicken liver p\\u00e2t\\u00e9 and top sirloin steak with brandy peppercorn sauce. a must in vegas", 
            "my family and i came here while they were in from ny, and i have to say i was pretty underwhelmed. here's what i tried and what i can speak to:\n\n<mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>\npate\nsteak bearnaise\nsteak tartare \n\nthe <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> lacked a significant flavor. i love cheese, you can pretty much melt any cheese in the world and let me dip bread in it and i would be happy. this cheese was meh. \n\nthe pate was also not particularly tasty. my mom loves pate, and my girlfriend had never had it. i knew she would love it, but when i tasted this one i was surprised that it didn't have the rich flavor pate usually has. \n\nthe steak sauce for the bearnaise was realllllly good, and i loved that! the steak itself was pretty good, but didn't justify the price. i smothered it in sauce and it was really yummy though. \n\nwe were really excited about the french fries, they were more like chips, and they were good not great. they weren't fresh and quickly went cold and soggy. we asked for a fresh batch (one dish arrived with cold fries), and the very fresh ones were excellent... but they sogged up real quickly and were cold. the waitress said it was because the area in the greenhouse area we were in was the \"wind tunnel\" but it was still disappointing. \n\nthe steak tartare also was just ok. the spices were pretty good, but nothing that wowed or had you excited to take another bite. \n\noverall, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the food was pretty decent. however for the price, i expected more, and it didn't help that the service was very slow and we had different servers taking our orders and helping us. it was confusing, and even with multiple people we felt the service was really slow.  \n\ni wouldn't spend money here again based on this experience, but based on other reviews, i think i'll give it another shot with just my girlfriend and i at some point.",

            "i frequent often especially with out of town guests- since the outside seating is excellent for people watching as well as the bellagio watershow. \nfood is fairly priced (in the 20s for steak, salmon, etc). i really enjoyed the escargot and my friend loved the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer. good place over all.", 
            "this place was pretty exceptional on the food and atmosphere front.  it's a simple yet very elegant restaurant, which seems suitable for afternoon casual lunch or fancy business meetings or dates.  the menu had a variety of options from light salads and oysters, to fancy sandwiches, to meat hefty meals.  i ordered the tomato and basil salad.  the waitress said it was a pretty decent size and tasty.  it was indeed tasty, but not substantial in size.  i was thankful i ordered chicken with it because it is not enough on it's own (for most people).  it was very fresh and lightly seasoned with oil.  \ni sneaked bites from the plates of those around me....the yellowfin was delish and the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> sandwich is probably the best thing one could order from the lunch menu!  the combined flavor of the bread, cheese, salmon and toppings was one of the most decadent things i've eaten in awhile!  \nso why 4 stars and not 5?  the service was lacking.  it's vegas...i expect above average.  service was average from all the staff i encountered and no one seemed very personable.  just kind of made me feel awkward.  oh well, good eats - try it!", 
            "this is a must stop brunch spot for every trip i take to las vegas! the service is always wonderful, the food is impeccable, and the gorgeous patio views of the strip is an added perk. it's one of the gems on the strip where the quality of the food far outweighs the price that you pay for it. \n\ni always order the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> (around $13 and a couple of people could split the plate). frankly, it's so delicious that i never have the desire to stray from it. it's wonderfully toasted and the combination of cheese and ham are present in the perfect ratio so either flavor isn't too over-whelming. the hand-cut fries that are included with the plate are seasoned and fried to perfection! \n\nmy most recent visit was particularly memorable. mark z. was our server and he was extremely attentive, pleasant, and actually cared about having a conversation with us (quite refreshing considering we are in our early 20's). we showed up around 9am on a sunday and were able to be seated right away on the patio which had a direct view of the bellagio fountains. \n\nwe started our meal with the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> (about $12) and i can definitely say that i will never skip ordering this delicious plate from this point on. the tomato sauce was perfectly thick and creamy, the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> was some of the best i have ever tasted, and the generous serving of garlic bread was perfectly buttery and crispy. my mouth is literally watering just thinking about it! \n\nmy boyfriend said the coffee that he ordered was some of the best he has ever tasted... so that's highly recommended! \n\nall in all, this place is absolutely incredible and i recommend it to every single person that i know that is taking a vegas vacation! kudos, mon ami, gabi!", 
            "i have been here many times and have never had a bad experience...well, there was the short ribs...  no matter, i love this place.  if you've been to the strip, you know the prices, but this place is pretty moderate and the food is always top notch.  i always get the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> app - so yummy.  i've had most of the other menu items, most recently, the snapper special......which had a browned butter and corn sauce over it which knocked me socks off.  also had steak tartare for the first time. i may be spoiled from having it here, but, oh my, delicious!  our waitress was funny and fantastic too, wish i remembered her name.  pigtails....you know who you are :)", 
            "came here again from california.  i was seated right away, and the food came very quickly.  oysters were okay this time around, but the steak classique really rocks my world.  also the warm <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and garlic bread were to die for.  will be coming back soon!",

(we didn't wait in line, but there was one when we left)\n\nsat on the lovely patio...yummy french baguette (although a tad too crunchy...ripped up the roof of my mouth a tad). and the butter? ahhh! orgasmic. creamy, salty, fresh churned tasting. \n\nthe <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> is easily a 5-star dish: ah-mazing! loved it & the creamy tomato sauce surrounding it. we licked the plate. not really kidding. a must order.\n\nperfect wine? saint bris savignon!! crisp, cool, refreshing...two bottles down, a third was mighty tempting.\n\nfor dinner, i loved the steak bernaise & frites. the frites were crunchy like potato chips...oh so good. the steak was thin, nicely pounded tender with some chew (think skirt steak). the creamy herby bernaise: muah!\n\ngo get it, vegas! parisian yumminess can be yours!",

            "my girlfriend and i were very excited to try mon ami gabi for dinner as part of a mini-staycation.  we had a comped night at bally's, and i've been meaning to try mon ami gabi since moving here 2.5 years ago.  unfortunately, we didn't have the great experience that i've heard many other people rave about.\n\nfirst, the positives...our seat out on the patio overlooking the strip had an awesome view of the bellagio fountains.  even as locals, we enjoyed this view.  our server was fantastic, very engaging, and had great knowledge of the menu.  he also recommended the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer, which was absolutely delicious.\n\nwe both ordered steak frites, which unfortunately did not live up to expectations.  my girlfriend ordered the hanger steak, and we both agreed that it was tough.  not just a little tough, but really just not edible.  our server and the manager did the right thing and replaced it with a filet mignon at no additional charge, which was delicous.  i got the signature steak - the sirloin.  the sirloin was thinner on the edges and thicker in the middle.  the edges were delicious, but the middle was chewy and tough.  i'm not sure if the steak was poorly butchered, or should have been cooked differently, but either way, it was not well-prepared.  by that time, we had already sent one steak back, and i had eaten some of mine before realizing the problem, so i did not send mine back.\n\nnot sure if we caught the restaurant on an off day - maybe a cook called in sick, or they got an order of lower quality meat, but we did not get to have the mon ami gabi experience.  we were disappointed that mon ami gabi did not live up to it's reputation.  we're torn between trying it again because many locals we know love it, or checking out one of the many other steakhouses on the strip.", 
            "what a great find, especially in the glittery, extravagant las vegas strip! our group of 5 came here for brunch after seeing the positive reviews and surprisingly reasonably priced brunch menu. it definitely fulfilled and surpassed our expectations! my guess is that it would do well even in an urban area, without requiring the constant flow of vegas customers to support its business.\n\nthe restaurant is quite spacious, with several rooms of tables and outdoor seating. in the last room facing the back there is also a direct view of the bellagio fountains, which makes a nice backdrop for enjoying the parisian food and decor while inside the restaurant. \n\nwe shared the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer which comes with a flavorful tomato sauce and crunchy garlic bread. they also provide free, unlimited bread (a huge plus), which we used after the garlic bread was finished to continuously dip into the sauce and maximize every last drop of flavor.\n\ni had the kale & <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> while others tried the eggs benedict and other standard brunch items. all servings were generous and filling, which is what we were seeking after a long night out. we came in like the living dead, but mon ami gabi succeeded in reviving us-- merci beaucoup!!",

            "what a great spot and the food was delicious. it was a beautiful evening last night so we decided to wait for a patio table and it was well worth the 20 min wait. we got to watch the bellagio fountains go thru 3 shows from our table, our steaks were delicious, even the frites that came with them were good. we had the warm <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> app as well and it was just as good. excellent spot, good food and our waiter was pleasant as well. some of the waiters/bus staff weren't very pleasant and that was the reason i deducted one star.", 
            "we had a lovely time at mon ami gabi before seeing \"o\" across the street at the bellagio. reservations are a must unless you arrive early or are prepared to wait. the restaurant is affordable fine dining for the strip (if you can't splurge for michelin-starred robuchon or nobu) so we thoroughly enjoyed it but only noticed a few drawbacks. \n\nit was cold and rainy outside so we skipped the patio (though it did have heat lamps) and we liked the fancy, romantic atmosphere inside. the entrance to the restaurant is inside the paris casino, so there definitely is the smell of smoke inside the restaurant - not overpowering but a little disappointing. \n\nthe service was very professional - our waitress asked us our evening plans and made sure our food arrive promptly so we could get to it on time. we loved the complimentary warm baguette with butter and the small plate of pickled shredded beets that accompanies it. \n\nfood was delicious. i had the roquefort steak (blue cheese sauce) with frites and though i ordered it medium-well, i was very thankful when it came out an absolutely perfect medium (usually i order mw because some restaurants either over- or under-cook their medium). the dollop of blue cheese spread over the meat was divine and the size of the steak was perfect - generous but not too heavy. the frites were good, but a bit too salty to finish them all.\n\nmy friend ordered the <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark>, served in a lovely glass with avocado and a side of gaufrette chips (thinly-sliced waffle chips) that seemed to be house-made. the plate was garnished with assorted olives and caper berries. she loved it all. \n\nmy other friend ordered the warm <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> salad - mixed greens, oven-dried tomatoes, and herbs served with a warm, creamy, mustardy but light vinaigrette. it was simple but right en pointe. \n\nthis place is very popular for a reason - it's centrally located and very reasonably-priced for a delicious dinner right in the middle of all the excitement. we all loved our dinners, but the finer details of a 5-star experience just weren't there - the tables were a little too close together (probably to accommodate as many guests as possible), which wasn't a problem until it got very busy right when we left and two other patrons had to literally squeeze into the table next to us. it also is awkward that you have to walk through part of the casino to get to the restrooms, which were not very clean and crowded with casino patrons. even though smoking is not permitted in the restaurant, we wished there wasn't associated-casino smoke floating in.\n\nall in all, we'd definitely return, but knowing those things ahead of time can prepare you for a great dinner and just a good dining experience.", 
            "strong 3.5 stars \n\npreviously i are here over 7 years ago and wasn't the most impressed with the place! for me living in montreal there are many easy options for french cuisine. i came here because members of my dining group wanted to come here. not to sound unimpressed, pretentious and a mega jerk but most fine dining restaurants in montreal and quebec will do a great job of frites steak. also, many restaurants have excellent selection and usually 10+ different ways of serving frites moules. so....eating french in vegas is a bit kitschy for this guy. but of course it serves the paris well and those who live far from france or quebec. \n\nwhen you enter the restaurant it sure gives you the feeling of being in a paris bistro in some back alley arrondissement. they did an admirable job here in decor and design. if you can get a table on the patio you have some fantastic views in the evening of the bellagio fountain as it goes off. \n\nsince we gorged ourselves on the bachannal buffet (caesars) earlier i was not super hungry. we started off with some apps of oysters, scallops. both were fresh and done perfectly. then i decided to have the warm <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> salad. it was very flavourful, lighter and i'd highly recommend it if you are down with <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>. to finish off i really love a good chocolate mousse so i selected this. it was a larger portion but light, chocolatey and delicious.\n\none word of caution, no restroom in the restaurant. you need to exit the restaurant and follow on the left side by the sports book in the casino. \n\noverall everyone in our group had a great meal with awesome conversation. the restaurant is not cheap but this is the norm in vegas.",

            "if you're visiting the strip, this restaurant has the best location. it's perfect for catching the bellagio fountain show, soaking up some nice fresh air, and people watching :) food is pretty standard for the strip....good quality but over-priced. good service!\n\ni came here for brunch with some girlfriends, and i ordered the salmon eggs benedict. the egg was poached well and the hollandaise was light, but the english muffin was a little hard (like it had been sitting out for a while). my friends each ordered a crepe, which they said were tasty, and we shared a super delicious and creamy <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer.....drool! my only complaint about that was there wasn't enough bread for the cheese! haha\n\ni've heard the steak & frites is good, so that's on the docket for next time!\n\n*tip: reservations are only for inside seating...if you want to snag a table outside on the patio, come early!", 
            "amazing, everything is amazing. the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer is a must! we eat here every time we are in vegas.", 
            "amazing for brunch. we went on easter sunday and we had great service even though they were slammed. we ordered a <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer that was so good! i also had the french toast and it was covered in berries. not to mention the view of the bellagio fountains is great!", 
            "everything was absolutely amazing!  from the service to the views to each course. we ate on the patio and had reservations for 5p.  i had a glass of the rose and my friend had a cocktail. we went with some recommendations from our server, including the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and tomato puree appetizer, then the trout and sea scallop dishes, all of which were fantastic.  we finished with the lemon cr\\u00e8me brulee and espresso.  the atmosphere, food, and prices were off the charts. i will definitely be returning when back on the strip!", 
            "here to celebrate my mom's (and mines.. next weekend) birthday! girl's weekend! great food, great service.. a bit pricy ($12 for a mimosa.. really?!) but this is vegas. so happy we chose to have lunch at this place though. highly suggest the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer (so good) and the \"frangria\".. loved it! ($24 craft = about 4 glasses) i ordered the warm <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> salad w/chicken and it was delicious. well worth the $20! lol. i will definitely be back my next trip to sin city! (loved the warm, fresh baguettes!!!!!!!)",

            "breakfast review- \n\nalways busy even on weekdays. outside is first come first serve. no way to guarantee. usually immediately seated if you want to stay inside so expect to wait if you want a seat with a strip view. \nwhen i went most of the patrons at least got to sit in the pavilion so it looks half inside and half outside \n5 girls 5 different entrees so we can try each other's. my favorites were the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer to start and lorraine's quiche. the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> is served with garlic bread and the sauce was very tasty. everyone loved it even the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> first timers. i liked the quiche the as the best entree because it was very delicate and flavorful. it felt very light. \n\nwe also had the croissant sandwich  (simple and nice), the florentine and salmon benedict (classics) and the french toast. \n\ni think this place is pretty and delicious. the average entree price for breakfast is about $15 to $20. warmed freshly baked bread is provided. they give butter and jam. you have a paper top on the table which i have seen at other french restaurants and proportions were a nice size. \n\ni recommend making reservations and then enjoy.", 
            "this place is a solid 5! the patio seating offers a sweet escape from the dark, smoke-filled casino and the food is amazing. i had the steak frites and warm <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> salad, both which were amazing. the steak was tender and juicy and they definitely do not skimp out on portions here. the salad was refreshing yet savory. i will definitely be back next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "best breakfast we had in vegas last weekend!  great food.  fair price.  great service.  we each got a breakfast entree - lemon skinny pancakes and a spinach and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> omelet.  if i went back i think we would both get omelets.  coffee was fantastic and the bloody-mary was a great start to the day.  \n\npatio seating is awesome for people watching and views of the bellagio", 
            "we had breakfast here twice on a recent trip to vegas. first day i had waffles and whip cream - yum. second day i had a baguette and some fresh fruit. loved it. my wife had an omelet with <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and was in heaven and then eggs benedict on day two.\n\nwhy 3 & not 4 or 5? well the wait staff was a little slow and forgetful. asking twice for one thing with one waiter on one day is one thing. asking two different waiters twice each for two different things twice is a syndrome. but would i go back? yup, i'll put up with slow service for the food, the location and the fun atmosphere.", 
            "our go to spot for a nice, romantic and mid priced meal in las vegas. we always sit outside and get the view of the bellagio fountains. terrific! the steak frites are yummy; steak is pounded flat and well seasoned. however the frites are the star. can't stop eating them.\n\nyou can sign up with them to get texts and a freebie. we got the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> last time. it was huge and great with the bread they serve. could have filled up on bread, butter and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>, but i forced myself to eat my steak frites.", 
            "one of our favorite apps in vegas!  we always kick off our visits with brunch here. the pulled pork sriracha sandwich is delicious,  and the prime steak peppercorn sandwich is a must. always worth the visit. we also love the marinara <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> with pesto garlic bread.", 
            "came back for second time still suggest the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and salmon appetizers. we tried sitting in a different spot to avoid the blistering heat. there are about two rows of table that is outside/ inside and it gets the air conditioning while maintaining the outside ambiance. we really enjoyed this place. it actually sets the pace for vacation mode", 
            "visiting my friend in vegas who's never had french food and wanted to take her somewhere nice. the atmosphere was very nice and our server was wonderful. we ordered the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer which was delicious. i had the steak tartar which i enjoyed very much but requires no talent. my friend ordered a roasted chicken breast with an arugula, basil paisley pur\\u00e9e and a side of asparagus. the pur\\u00e9e was bitter and gross, not even sure why it was on the plate. the asparagus was boiled and unseasoned,  and had absorbed water so they weren't crisp.", 
            "this was such a wonderful restaurant. it's really hard to find gluten free food, as i'm celiac, but i was certainly able to here! i had the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> salad which was outstanding. my friend is a vegetarian and with no problem the manager accommodated both of us easily. also, definitely order their bowl of coffee...never seen a coffee that large before! :) \nwe sat outside overlooking the strip, while misters sprayed over the railings to keep us cool from the hot sun.", 
            "i had been stuck in my hotel for 14 hrs til they fixed my room, i walked along the strip, i had read about this restaurant on yelp and other sites, i was starving, , i just wanted something quick, so i sat at the bar, and a very sweet bartender unfortunately i didnt get her name, she has a dark bob, she suggested i order the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> in a wonderful spicy tomoato sauce, it came with a fresh baguette, it was delicious, in fact beautifully presented, the woman seated next to me was actually smelling how good it was, so i told her to grab a spoon and take a taste, she loved it too and ordered her own, it sure hit the spot, , i was really wanting to stop for breakfast which they are really known for, but i didn't have the time, hence the 4 star review, im sure next time i go back and i will soon, it will rate the 5 stars. they were soo friendly, and i cant wait to peruse the entire meni", 
            "this is a really cute french restaurant at paris hotel & casino.  it sits outside of the hotel facing the bellagio fountains.  we made a reservation and needed to add an additional person at the last minute and actually wanted to eat earlier, and not only were the hosts able to accommodate to our group size, but we also got sat 15 minutes before our reservation time.  we were sat in the inside with the air-conditioning, but right next to the patio where we were able to view the bellagio fountain show from our seats.  it was spectacular.  \n\nwe were a group of 7 and brought our own wine bottles.  corkage fee is $30 per bottle, which is a bit steep, even for vegas.  they served us complimentary baguettes with butter and some carrot dish,  our server was very friendly and explained the menu to us in detail.  \n\nwe ended up ordering a few appetizers:\n-oysters: unfortunately i didn't get to try these.  i love oysters too.\n-some <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> app with toasted garlic bread: this was delicious!  whatever the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> was mixed with was very good, not too salty, and had the right amount of <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>\n-escargots: this was drench in some olive oil and basil sauce that was very good.  i ate the whole snail and i used the same sauce to dip the complimentary baguettes.\n\nmain dish:\n-hangar steak ($23): so tender!!!  this came with some merlot butter sauce that really went well with the steak.  it was very rich in flavor and was like a dream in my mouth.  i had my steak with haricots verts instead of fries since i ate like a pig at lunch.  \n-<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>: i had a bite of this.  it's an 8 oz steak, which is their smallest size, and it was the most tender filet ever!  it was soft like butter.  you could probably cut it with a fork. this meat was also rich in flavor and their most popular steak frites dish. \n-bison rib-eye (special of the day about $40): i had a taste of this also.  it was very good, lean-tasting, and not gamey at all.\n\ndessert:\n-banana fosters crepe ($10.95): i probably could have devoured this by myself despite being super full.  this was not too sweet and had all the right flavors combined, plus a scoop of vanilla ice cream wrapped in the middle.\n-caramel creme brulee: though not as good as the banana fosters crepe, this was also really tasty.  crepe brulee with a hint of caramel.  the carmelized sugar was perfectly burnt and not too hard to break through.      \n\noverall, this was a very hearty and delicious meal.  i left feeling super stuffed.  everything on the menu tasted very good and the service was impeccable.  highly recommended, especially if you're staying close by!", 
            "this place is overhyped....the food is okay, fairly priced and their orange juice is definitely not freshly squeezed.\n\ni ordered the spinach and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> omelette (really buttered and fattening green beans, but i guess that's why it tastes good) and the corn beef hash and poached eggs...okay dishes overall, but i don't know how they got 4 stars.\n\nalso, my hash browns tasted as if they spilled salt onto it, and my friend's was tasteless. the food was colder than the plate and the waiter gave us the wrong check.", 
            "always a favorite on our vegas visits.  highly recommend lunch in the patio.  recommend the sangria, the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>, and the steak frites!", 
            "many of the reviews rave about the outdoor seating and the view of bellagio's water. however, imho, coming at it from the foodie point of view, mon ami gabi was a disappointment. we had a lacklustre experience here. even though the restaurant was not full, the food took forever. the   baguette was warm and crusty, delicious. we also got the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> which was rich and decadent with garlic bread. the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> sat in a dish of tomato bisque, prefect for dipping. but that was all that was good. \nwe got the recommended <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark>, a pounded pan fried chicken breast sitting on a supposed basil aioli send with salad. first, the chicken was underseasoned. and the basil aioli was not what it was supposed to be. it was very bitter with only a slight hint of some herb. when we told or server that it was bitter, she reiterated what it was supposed to be and walked away. the salad had greens and pickled beets which were extremely sour. \ni got the recommended wild boar ragu cencioni pasta. the pasta was good and the ragu was ok. nothing to wrote home about and certainly not worth  the pricing.", 
            "this is hands down one of the best restaurants i've been to. the view of the bellagio fountains in the patio is amazing. the environment, the music and the weather make the experience one of the best on the strip. the food is delicious. we had the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> for appetizer with bread for dipping. all four of us ordered different steaks. they were so tender and the sauces that complimented them were all so rich and tasty. the rest of the table ordered creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e and they loved it. we also had the pinot noir \"hobnob\" throughout dinner that was smooth. the service is exceptional. while most restaurants lack customer service and friendliness, mon ami gabi is above par and sets the bar high. please ask for doug out in the patio. he is pleasant and makes your dining experience exceptional and one to remember.", 
            "mon ami was recommended to me, and i am happy it was! \n\ngreat location in the heart of the las vegas strip. love the decor and service is always great. not to be outshined by the food. each table is welcomed with a warm baguette. me and my fianc\\u00e9 always order the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer, the marinara and warm <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> are delicious together. \n\ni just love to sit outside and have a glass of wine and truly enjoy my day and whomever i'm at the restaurant with. \n\nthis is a must for every trip to las vegas and is always on my list of restaurants i have to go to. \n\nthank you mon ami!", 
            "the best restaurant in las vegas that we went to this trip. affordable. beautiful view from the patio. we were sat quickly. we had an average waiter. he didn't speak english fluently but he tried his best. wonderful champaign. we got muscles and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> bread sauce for starters. the muscles were so good, very seasoned and not overcooked. also not a bit of grit in them. the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> dipping sauce might have been the best thing in vegas. my god it took my breath away. please try it. then we got our entrees. salmon blueberry salad. the bomb. and a bison steak. very unique. most definitely the best restaurant in vegas.", 
            "this is one of my most favorite restaurants in town. i've been eating here for special occasions for at least 14 years or so.\n\nthat being said, i found last night's dinner to only be ok. my group started with the french onion soup, the gazpacho special, and the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> salad. the gazpacho was great! the soup was a touch too sweet and the salad, frankly, was not worth it. one circle of cheese on top of greens. for $14.\n\ni found my steak to be good, but not great. in my mind the steaks have always been great so i'm not sure what happened. the fries, very sadly, were a touch over cooked. \n\nour dessert was the caramel creme brulee and it was divine! excellent! our server was also very friendly.\n\nall of this being said, \"ok\" at mon ami gabi is \"great\" anywhere else. i just have so many perfect meals in my memory that last night's meal didn't quite match up.", 
            "amazing food and better service! cheryl is wonderful!!!! she made us feel like we knew her for years. we had the oysters which were perfection and the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> which was equally outstanding. overall we will come back, request her, and leave full and happy!", 
            "we came here for dinner while in vegas last weekend and were not disappointed. we waited so we could sit outside and see the fountains at the bellagio. really the view was gorgeous. the food was also amazing. we had the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> for an app. and then my husband and i each had a steak, both of which were wonderful. i got green beans with my meal which also came with potatoes. it was so good. we also had a bottle of wine that was wonderful. i was very happy in our choice to come!", 
            "this is my second time here and its absolutely my favorite restaurant in las vegas.  the escargot is amazing and the warm <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> is perfection. if you can get a table on the patio the view is of the bellagio fountain. the steak here is amazing too.", 
            "my family and i have lived here since 1989. i absolutely love going to mon ami gabi. every time we go there we always request to get seated outside to get a great view of the bellagio fountains. during the spring and fall is the perfect time to sit outside. i would only sit out there at night if you are here in the summer. i highly recommend you make reservations as well through opentable or calling to request this seating in advance. \n\nthe bread is buttery with a smooth butter spread. the last time we went my boyfriend ordered the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> and i had the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>. i personally enjoyed the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> more because of the rich tomato sauce. the pate was also delicious especially on that warm toast. \n\nwe shared the french onion soup, which was tasty. it was not too salty and the cheese was melted well over the bread. probably one of the best french onion soups i have had in vegas. \n\nfor the main course, i had the steak frites <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> and my boyfriend had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>. if you enjoy a creamy peppercorn sauce then get the <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>. i recommend the filet mignon as a must for first-timers. the steak was so soft and juicy. the merlot sauce pushed the experience to the next level. my taste buds were ecstatic to enjoy something so decadent. the filet mignon here is the best for those who do enjoy tender meat. we both got ours medium. \n\nour sides were the frites (fries) and the brussel sprouts. enjoyed them both as well! however, we did see the whipped cauliflower and the sauteed mushrooms pass by our table, which also looked delicious so i would recommend trying those if you want lighter sides. \n\nfor dessert, we shared the creme brulee. it was a decent size. the top was crisp and the custard was excellent. i highly recommend this dish as well. the ambiance was perfect for a beautiful date night, birthday celebration, or anytime you are feeling fancy for great steak. service was excellent! i love how authentic it was to have someone from france wait on us. it really brought the experience together.", 
            "we went here for a late sunday breakfast and everyone had an amazing meal. the coffee was perfect, the service was pleasant and quick enough. the has browns were tasty and crispy.  i had the spinach omelet with <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>... yummy", 
            "this was just an amazing place all around.  the wait for the patio is well worth it (first come first serve).  there's no replacing having brunch across from the bellagio fountains.  the drinks were well made and decently priced.  the real star of the show was the incredibly wait staff.  they anticipated everything you could want.  coffee was refilled the instant i thought i'd want more and the main course was brought out at a perfect time after the appetizers.  the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> in tomato sauce was delicious!  somehow they got the tomatoes perfectly roasted, but not burned at all.  eating here was a real treat and i can't wait to go back.  just be sure to get there early if you want an outside seat.  otherwise i highly recommend a reservation for the dining room.", 
            "the steak classique is by far the best on the menu, and the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> is what dreams are made of. do yourself a favor and get both...you will not be disappointed.", 
            "delicious food and drinks and a great atmosphere on the patio overlooking the strip. heat lamps make a cool fall night enjoyable. not a huge selection for vegetarians, however. the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and fresh bread was an amazing appetizer!", 
            "wow! that is one of the best french restaurants i've ever been to (including a few in paris). everything was top-notch! we had a lovely lunch there and it's all thanks to you, dear yelp users! i researched few places nearby and mon ami gabi had so many good reviews that i decided on trying it right away. \n\nfirst impression - this place is enormous! we wanted to sit on a patio and to get there we went trough three or four different dining rooms. the view outside is great, as the restaurant is facing bellagio and its beautiful fountains. the staff was very nice and organized, we were promptly seated and handed menus. a lot of dishes seemed appetizing so it took a while to order. \n\nfor a starter we shared <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and snails in garlic, butter and herbs. both were simply delicious! escargot were best i ever had and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> came with creamy tomato sauce and fresh and crispy baguette. mmm... next we all ordered onion soup. it was very nicely prepared, with the melted cheese on the top. i don't know why i ordered it as i absolutely hate french onion soup. it must have been peer pressure :d. however, it was still one of the most passable onion soups i ate. and others like it very much, so it's probably great. after the first course we were already pretty full, but we made a mistake of ordering everything at once, so a few minutes later spinach and salmon salad with walnuts and blueberries arrived before me. and it was a surprising dish. in my opinion a salmon salad always consist of lots of small salmon pieces, not one big hunk of fish and all the other stuff next to it. it was more of the size of the main course and should have been named 'salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>' not 'salmon salad'. but it's all semantics. walnuts and blueberries gave the dish a refreshing taste, and even though i didn't manage to finish it, it was still very tasty. our friends decided on salmon tatar with chips and it was probably the weakest part of the meal, but still not bad. it just lacked some herbs or spices. during our visit we also drank a lot of lemonade. at the beginning i made a mistake of ordering home made tea. in poland, where i live, it always taste sweet, however, as i quickly learned, in america it's just regular tea, only cold. it did not taste good. the waiter was so nice, that upon noticing my mistake, she proposed switching it for sweet lemonade right away. and she didn't even put the tea on the bill. \n\nwe left the place full and content. looking back, it was probably one of the best restaurants i visited during the stay. definitely recommend.", 
            "the breakfast was great (eggs benedict, wife had spinach and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> omelet (really good)); however, bacon was burnt and dining room was quite warm to 12 out of 15 people in our party, hence the four stars. they did turn on the ac at our request. the service was exceptional for a casino restaurant i will definitely come back.", 
            "my friends and i were very excited to try this place and surprises that on opentable, we were able to make a lunch reservation the day of! \nwe ordered the soup of the day (cream of potato) and onion soup to start off with. i loved the cream of potato soup!! if you want something creamy and savory, i definitely recommend it! i also enjoyed the onion soup, but i was not a huge fan of the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> on top. \ni ordered the eggs benedict which came with canadian bacon and a side of hash browns. i found the hash brown to be really cold when it came out, and the english muffin was extremely hard- i couldn't cut it so i just ended up eating the top part. it was just too burnt. \nmy friends orders were delicious though! especially the <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>- i will definitely order that if i were to come here again! it also comes with a side of fries, which were crispy and perfectly seasoned. \ni also tried the grilled cheese and mushroom and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>. they were delicious and perfectly cooked.\none downside is that after placing our order, we decided we wanted to try the fries and ordered it from our waiter. he failed to mention that the two of our dishes came with fries and we had no idea, so we had 3 fries for 4 people and it was way too much. \nwe tried the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e for dessert and it was good! creamy in the middle and crispy on top. \n\ntry to sit on the patio for a wonderful view of the strip and the fountains of bellagio!"

            "i had this place bookmarked for good ambiance. we walked from the flamingo our last morning in vegas for a nice breakfast. we got seats right on the edge of the patio, so we could see the sidewalk and, across the street, the bellagio. the fountains weren't running in the morning but it was still a nice view. and the people watching was excellent, as it is in vegas! we had good service by our waiter, who brought things out quickly and was always nearby. i ordered steel cut oats, a bagel with <mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark>, and oj. my friend got a breakfast crepe. she wasn't that impressed by it as she didn't like the sauce, but it wasn't bad. she said the coffee was amazing. my oj was good, though small for the price. my oatmeal was great and so was the bagel. the oatmeal came with raisins, brown sugar, and half and half on the side, so i could make it up as i pleased. \n\nprice was comparable to other breakfast places we tried in vegas, and quality was good. the view made it all worth the while. i only wish i could've had lunch here and seen the fountains!", 
            "a breathtaking view at the top of the eiffel + dinner at mon ami gabi after = romantic date! \n\nand that is exactly what my hubby and i did one weekend in vegas! he took me up to the top of the tower and saw the whole city of las vegas! the view was aaaaamazing! \n\nwe dined in for dinner late sunday night and there was numerous of vacant seats indoor. it was freezing outside and there were more patrons seated outdoor than indoor! well, thank goodness for those warm heat lamps! we chose to sit outdoors on the patio next to one of those heat lamps! the location of this restaurant is great because it sits right in front of bellagio's water show. it was nice to see what water dance every 15 minutes. :)\n\nokay, so the dinner. we ordered <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with <mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark> as an appetizer and for our entrees i ordered their giant scallops and my hubby ordered a steak. the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> was super delish and very fresh. i can honestly say this is probably one of my favorite appetizers. my scallops were just as good. very soft and flavorful.  my entree also came with mashed potatoes topped with brussel sprouts. who would have known that the combination of the two would be very tasty?! my hubby enjoyed his steak though he thinks it tasted mediocre. \n\nour server was very generous. i asked for hot water (since it was so cold!) and he made sure my water was warm throughout the night. he even replaced my pot of hot water with a new one! he was very attentive and took good care of us! :) \n\nthis is a place i would recommend for others to try. i would love to come back for brunch one day considering it's high reviews!", 
            "this place was amazing, and much better than expected! the first day we ate here; we all had a nice beverage to get the morning going and sat near outside but not so near that we heard street noise or felt the cool air. \n\neveryone loved their respected dishes. we ordered; salmon plate, croissant sandwich, chicken/brie/apple crepe, blueberry french toast, eggs benedict, bacon, breakfast potato. \n\ntotal for all of us was $140, which is not bad for 6 people plus drinks and tip. \n\nmy friend and i returned the next morning and had a bagel with <mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark> and potato's - which again were fabulous. \n\nthis is definitely my new breakfast spot!", 
            "mon ami gabi was one of the only places on my list of \"must do\" restaurants in vegas. we ended up getting up quite early and i wanted a good, quality, tasty breakfast that wasn't going to be served in its wrapper. we got a cab down to the strip and headed to mon ami gabi.\n\nthis place is attached to paris so of course it has the requisite french theme. service was prompt and we were seated on the already pretty full patio. it was nice to be able to sit and people watch as we had our breakfast. this is one of those places where the waiters are dressed impeccably, there are white tablecloths and napkins, and condiments are brought to you in their own tiny dishes, instead of bottles, etc. lovely experience.\n\ni ordered the mushroom omelette, which had brie cheese on the inside and came with super crispy hash brown strings, and a piece of brioche with <mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark> and jam on the side. everything was perfect - the omelette was incredible. i can't say i've ever enjoyed something for breakfast that much. melty, oozy brie cheese inside the omelette.... man, mouth is watering just thinking about it. the crispy hash browns were great, but my boyfriend would have preferred his less crispy (he's nuts, crispy hash browns all the way). i had a glass of juice and a tea and both were very good. our meal wasn't rushed, the servers weren't all over us. it was very much so as though we were dining on our own, which was a nice way to start the day.\n\noverall, this was an incredible meal and i wish we'd come here at least one other time to try some of the lunch or dinner options. this is a must for me the next time i go to vegas and it should be on your list too.", 
            "mon amis always been one of my favorites every time i visit the strip. located inside of paris, the outdoor seating in the heart of the city is one of the best in terms of setting and ambiance. the one thing i do love about mon ami is the flexibility with the menu. most places refuse to serve breakfast items after a particular time but this restaurant always accommodates my requests and the service is typically on point. the waiters are not overly enthusiastic, but they are friendly and quick which, i believe, are better qualities to portray in food hospitality. on this particular visit i ordered: \n\n<mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark>: with mushrooms, black garlic and sherry reduction. be warned this item is garlicky, but it is delicious. if you love mushrooms and garlic this is a must try. the toasted bread with the gooey <mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark> and garlicky saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms are  an amazing flavor combo. \n\n<mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>: jumbo shrimp served with cocktail sauce and lemon. the shrimp is very fresh and the simplicity of the dish speaks for itself. \n\nmaine lobster roll: served on a toasted brioche roll with house chips on the side. the lobster is fresh and mixed with a creamy mayonnaise. this is one of the heavier items on the menu; if you do not like mayo, you may want to skip out on this one. the chips are also a bit bland, but can be subbed out for house fries, which are delicious. \n\ncustom crepe: i wanted to order a sweet crepe and the waiter suggested a fresh banana and strawberry crepe with whipped cream. i opted for this dish and added a side of nutella (chocolate hazelnut spread) to my crepe. the crepe was served on its own with the toppings served on the side. the fruit was fresh and the cream was whipped in house. the portion is also very large and can easily be shared between two people. \n\nall in all, i recommend mon ami if you enjoy french cuisine and a great view. although i cannot vouch for every food item on the menu, but there are several items that i always eat when i am here. there is typically a wait to sit outside, even on the weekdays, but well worth it!", 
            "the food was excellent, the service was friendly, but lacked attention and was super slow pace, because of that it's 3 or 3 1/2 stars not 4.   we made reservations on open table, but got to paris early and saw patio seating only had 35 min wait so we switched.    i ordered the french martini and it was fantastic, although it took 25 mins to come.   i had the <mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark> app, and it was delicious,   they had 2 <mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark> app choices and the server helped me decide.  but i bet they are both great.   \n \nfor lunch i had the tomato salad and the onion soup.   one of the best onion soups i've had.  \nwe enjoyed the patio, but many tables and us had to beg for the umbrellas to be raised to find some relief from afternoon sun.   at first we all were told no, but then they accommodated everyone.   yay!  mon ami was recommended to us by a couple of locals,   it had a great setting inside or out.   must have reservations and some time for a relaxed meal.   for lunch for 2, we were there 2 hours (app, i had salad and soup and hubby a burger)", 
            "i liked it. it wasn't overly gourmet breakfast fare but it was on par with bouchon. it's typical french breakfast food, sophisticated. i had the french onion soup which was available on the \"not breakfast\" section, and it was hearty, but could use a little bit more seasoning. my second item i ordered was the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> and bagel, which was straightforward and clean. the smoke on the salmon was not overly harsh and i can still taste the salmon, also served with pickled garnishes which added a unique background flavour. a coulis/jam and <mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark> were the condiments, which i have nothing to say about, they were what they were. i was eating with family and they ordered items such as the flat pancakes which were well made. otherwise, it's a humble, friendly, welcoming, busy environment, our waiter was smooth and organized, but it felt too much like bouchon though.", 
            "i absolutely loved the view at mon ami gabi. we were fortunate enough to get a seat outside and the vegan protest in the view we encountered, only added to the experience. i did not give this 4 stars due to the service. i don't know if our waiter was avoiding our table purposely, but i did feel like we had to flag him down a few times in order to get service. if the case was that he was overwhelmed, then that is an issue the restaurant needs to address. we had a group of 5, so gratuity was already added to our check, so maybe he did not feel the need to work for it and be a bit more attentive to the table. he also seemed to be a bit rushed when he was taking our order. not to mention, the \"secret service\" (probably the floor manager) standing by our table throughout the duration of our meal. it was just a bit cramp to have him hoovering the entire time. \n\nthe meal was ok. i had the beef wellington, but was not pleased with it. the best part of eating in a group is being able to sample a variety of dishes at one time. our appetizer: <mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark> was delicious beyond words. my sister had the salmon which was also tasty. my friend had the hanger steak...arguably the best thing at the table. we had chocolate mousse and caramel cr\\u00e8me brulee for dessert. the brulee was the better of the two.", 
            "i love the location first and foremost. directly across from the bellagio fountains!! prices are med range for the strip and service has been excellent every visit! not part of total rewards though as i recall.   as always, they start you off with a warm baguette and whipped butter which you can definitely fill up on. we then always start with the three <mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark> w/ roasted garlic and mushrooms. i love it. the salmon salad is delicious and the steak is the bomb!! try finishing with the lemon creme brulee! exellent place to people watch, prices decent, and the fountains at night are beautiful."

            "love it...kinda fakeishly parisien...:\n\nfood - 4  stars\nservice - 4 stars\nperformace/cost - 4.5 stars\n\ndefinitely the kind of a restaurant that i'd like to spend my friday nights.  we made a reservation for 7pm and were seated right away.  we had requested the outside seating but actually wanted to be inside since there was too much construction outside right next to bellagio.  but we were seated just inside with a tantalizing view of the bellagio and the water show.  sweet.\n\nwe started the evening with some cocktails, <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, and some pate, just enough to get us tipsy and get hungry for the steak.\n\nall three of us order steak frites - mine was perfect, the hanger steak was perfectly cooked to medium and the fries were excellent.  we took in a bottle of 2004 silver oak cab with us...a beautiful complement to our steaks.  \n\nwe had to run out since we were in a hurry to make it to our show, but it was a wonderful experience.  i'm shying away from giving a 5 since the presentation of the food could be better and the restaurant was a bit loud.  but it's a french bistro, what more can i expect?\n\ni'll definitely be back here for more!", 
            "great french restaurant at paris. excellent food and service. make a reservation as the wait was 45-60 mins when we arrived, thankfully we had reserved on open table and walked right in. ordered the peppercorn steak, it was good. my girlfriend had the roasted chicken, that was also good. it's not  the best french food but the price is great. we had a <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> appetizer, two entres, all for under $70, that's a decent deal..", 
            "really wonderful. better than i expected. our server was wonderful and really attentive but didn't hover. she knew the menu in and out, which is important to me since i'm that annoying diner who asks loads of questions. \nthey bring out a delicious and warm baguette to get you started with their shaved carrot 'accoutrement.' i honestly don't think it's a french dish, but nevertheless, it was tasty. herbs, vinegar, and something else i couldn't put my finger on all blend nicely with the carrot. we got the jumbo <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> to start - most of their appetizers were shell fish related and my honey is allergic, so the shrimp had to do. it was tasty, and their cocktail sauce had the lovely horseradish punch that i love. the only downside was the shrimp tasted a little 'fishy' to me. \ni had an heirloom tomato salad with basil pesto, <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and baguette croutons. i would have been happy if dinner ended here. the tomatoes were so flavorful and the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> was really nice with the acidity. \nwe both had steak for dinner. it's a steakhouse after all, why go against the grain? we chose their classic cut which is pounded thin. i was worried about the doneness and tenderness of the meat, but was pleasantly surprised to have a perfectly medium steak that was anything but tough. i chose to have the roquefort sauce while the man went with b\\u00e9arnaise. their b\\u00e9arnaise was authentic and really quite good; i've had terrible representations lately. now, possibly the best thing about dinner were the impossibly thin and delicious frites that they serve. what machine cuts then in such a way, i haven't the slightest, but i want one in my home! they are crispy, perfectly fried and lightly sea-salted. \nmoving on to dessert (and honestly, we should have stopped to avoid the utterly bloated feeling that was to come, but if you ever get to chance to eat this dessert-do it). we decided on the banana's fosters crepe. best. decision. ever. there should be movies written about this crepe. i am a banana's fosters fan to begin with, but this had just the right amount of rum to cinnamon to banana to caramel. oh heavens...\nwe really enjoyed our dinner here, and before tip it was under $100. we were shocked. i even had 2 cocktails! really worth it - and if you're lucky, you can get a seat outside to watch the bellagio water show, too!", 
            "i ate dinner at mon ami gabi, the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> was not clean.  they brought another one it was very salty as well.  the food not great.  i have eaten there for lunch as well in past years lunch is fine the salads are good.  if you have the extra money to spend the best steakhouse on the strip in my opinion is prime in the bellagio.", 
            "one of the best places to eat in las vegas, mon ami gabi is the perfect restaurant whether its only you and your significant other, or a group of 8! i came here with a group of friends for my boyfriend's 30th birthday. we had made reservations ahead of time through their website and noted that we were celebrating his birthday and requested a table near the windows so that we would have a view of the bellagio fountains.\n\nwhen we got to the restaurant, we were seated immediately and got a wonderful table inside by the window and the view was amazing! on a side note, if the weather permits it, it is definitely worth it to wait for a table on the outside patio. the restaurant does not reserve these outdoor tables, so it is on a first-come-first-serve basis. but you can still request a table inside with a view.\n\nfresh french bread was brought with some creamed butter and a little bit of something that resembled a reddish pink coleslaw, but it was so tasty with the bread! i ordered a caraffe of the frangria (so delicious) and a bottle of perrier water for the table, and my boyfriend ordered a separate glass of wine. for appetizers, my boyfriend and i shared a <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>. our friends ordered a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and a french onion soup that had the cheesiest layer of cheese baked right on top!\n\ni ordered the steak classique rare. my boyfriend ordered the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, and our other friend ordered the beef bourguignon. one thing i noticed when they served the beef bourguignon was that the server kept the noodles and beef stew separate and spooned the stew on top of the noodles at our table. it looked and tasted so rich and beefy and stewy! everything looked fantastic! i have to admit that my steak was a little hard to cut and was chewy, but it was because i had ordered it rarer than usual. the finely cut pommes frites were also a perfect addition to my steak. at the end of it all, we decided to get dessert at another place just to explore more sweet options, but the waitress brought us a complimentary profiterole, a pastry that was filled with ice cream  and topped with a candle for my boyfriend! next time i am definitely staying after dinner for an artisan cheese platter or a cr\\u00e8me br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e\n\nmon ami gabi's prices were another big reason i chose to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday there. the prices are very fair for the quality of food, service, and experience you get and also low enough to not break the bank or feel guilty that one of your friends could only afford a glass of water. i will definitely be returning to mon ami gabi to celebrate my birthday!\n\nalthough the service was awesome, the view was phenomenal, and the food tasted great, we still had one gripe: being a very classic french bistro, there simply was not enough food on the plates for both my very american boyfriend and his friend. they ended up leaving and buying a hamburger right after dinner haha! so i recommend mon ami gabi if you and your date aren't too hungry, or with a group of girls. but if you're not into french restaurants with relatively smaller portions, head for the bellagio buffet across the street. : )", 
            "wonderful location right on the strip across the street from the bellagio. we stopped here for a late dinner after a long day of shopping. even though it was busy we were able to get a seat on the patio, right on the strip.\n\nthe food was really good, we started with the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> - the shrimp were huge and cooked to perfection. i had the roast chicken and frites which was very tender and tasty. i liked the crispy skinny \"frites\". could've used a little more veggies to balance out the plate, but other than that it was all good.", 
            "i just had brunch here on easter sunday with my sister, brother-in-law, and a few friends.\n\nservice was fairly prompt and efficient, but not too friendly for the entire meal. ironically/coincidentally, he became quite friendly and talkative at the end of the meal after we asked for the check.\n\nwe were served freshly baked mini baguettes and a creamy butter. we also asked for some jam that seemed to be freshly made strawberry jam. all of the above were quite good.\n\nwe ordered <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, a tuna salad dish, corned beef hash with poached egg, and brioche french toast with blueberries and macerated blueberry sauce.\n\ni was told the tuna salad was not fresh and barely edible. i personally ate the corned beef hash with a poached egg and the aforementioned french toast. i'd give the cb hash a 3.5; it was a bit mushy for me, i prefer to have my cb hash to be crisped in the pan to provide some texture and also to be seasoned a bit more. after adding some salt, pepper, and tabasco it was closer to a 4 star dish. the poached egg was ok, but not perfectly poached as so few ever are; would've preferred it to be a bit runnier.\n\nthey used a nice thick brioche bread for the french toast, dipped it in a light custard before cooking. topped it with a very light vanilla whipped cream and blueberries. then served it with their macerated blueberry sauce (which is listed as maple syrup on their website's menu, but has no maple taste to it at all). i really enjoyed this french toast, with the blueberry sauce it wasn't overly sweet. in fact, it was barely sweet at all. this french toast and the one stuffed with vanilla bean custard and fresh raspberries at bellagio cafe are the 2 best in town.\n\nif i was writing a review purely on the french toast here, i would give them 5 stars...but since i have to take everything else in to account they get a 4 for now until i try something else. i will definitely be back to eat the french toast again.", 
            "3.5 stars\n\noh god.  as i mentioned in my last review, we came back here for my friend's bachelorette.  i made the reservation a week in advance.  \n\nwhen i got there, i had to change it because a girl dropped out. if you use yelp to get phone numbers, this one is incorrect.  it takes you to effiel tower restaurant.  i did eventually get through and told her i needed to \"change tomorrow's reservation.\" (the reason i changed it for one person is because if your entire party isn't seated, you can't be considered for deck seating.) she told me she couldn't find me anywhere and i was put on hold for a long time, several times.  finally she said \"i found your reservation under tomorrow.  there must have been an error.\" me: \"nope. i wanted it for tomorrow.\" gah.  so that was figured out.\n\nthen the day of, the girls are running late and ask me to push it back.  i tell the hostess, \"can you push the reservation for ninette for 11 back 30 minutes?\" she said, \"ok clark (or something equally ridiculous) for 5!\" what now? eh, maybe it was loud.\n\nwe did make it there and were seated inside (outside was a 2 hour wait).  my friend and i ordered the escargot for appetizer to share and the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> for our entree.  the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> came with 4 oysters, <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, tuna cervice, seaweed salad, several sauces and an entire lobster.  i also just checked and there were supposed to be crackers. huh. never saw that. either way, it looked pretty impressive, not going to lie.  the escargot were good.  they came in a pesto-ish sauce.  the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> was all good except for the main event: the lobster.  the lobster was chewy and overcooked.  we thought we would need steak knives.  i don't know what kind of lobster it was called but it had the spongy legs/claws that i didn't really like either.\n\ni still think this place is pretty reasonably priced and a good balance between casual and fancy for vegas.  the bad lobster and confusion put me off a bit more than the first time, but for mostly-good food and prices, i'll keep my 3.5 stars under 4.", 
            "came here for dinner before my boyfriend and i went to see the cirque du soleil show mystere. i had looked at the menu earlier in the day and there were quite a few things that i was interested in, however we had eaten a larger lunch than we had anticipated and ended up just getting appetizers. \n\nanyways, i got the endive & bleu <mark>Warm Goat <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark></mark>--it was so delicious! it is very simple; endive, bleu cheese, arugula, and grapes with a very light vinaigrette dressing. in the past the endive i have had has been slightly bitter, but this was just perfect! also, the bleu cheese was pretty mild (which i prefer). again, very simple but if you are looking for a salad before dinner i highly recommend it!\n\nmy boyfriend got the french onion soup--it was alright, not the best i have had though. it wasn't horrible or anything, but i have made this type of soup before and i felt like mine was better! oh well. \n\nthird thing we shared was the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>--with huge shrimp! shrimp was good, so was the tartar sauce. can't really mess it up too much..\n\nwe tried the mojito as well (i was immediately drawn to it because it had st. germain and champagne in it..it was very good!) their version of sangria was delicious also.\n\ni guess this might not be the greatest review since we didn't really eat substantial food there lol, but i guess just try the salad, i swear it's amazing!", 
            "with a girlfriend of mine, went here twice on our vacay to vegas and absolutely loved it. the first night, before heading out for the night, we got dressed up and decided to have a fancy dinner. their fresh, warm baguettes are amazing. we both had the french onion soup and shared a bottle of their house chardonnay. the soup was soooooo delicious. burnt cheese is always delicious. brothy and full of flavor, i don't think i've ever had a better french onion soup. their wine was yummy, but we are not wine connoisseurs, so we could really have cared less- just wanted to catch a buzz. our waitress wasn't the greatest. a little slow and seems disinterested in our table.\n\n the second time, we grabbed lunch. baguette was a little hard, but still tasty. my friend got the soup again and i swear it tasted even better than the night before. i had the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> and it was delish. jumbo shrimp were served on ice with a really yummy cocktail sauce with fresh garlic on top. so good! much better service this time around.", 
            "so disappointed in mon ami gabi. \n\nbased on the excellent reviews i was very excited to try mon ami. we made reservations to eat here on our last night in vegas and were also celebrating my mother's birthday. i am not sure if mag was just having an off-night but our experience was all around pretty terrible. the dinner started with a very chaotic and unorganized seating systems. despite having reservations you have to stand and wait in a line to speak to the hostess. then they have you stand aside in the crowded bar area and wait some more. meanwhile, they call names but do it so quietly and from a different area that it is impossible to hear. all of this made for a stressful start to our dinner. once seated we ordered drinks which were mediocre in preparation and mine came with a very long dark hair curled around in it and hanging out the side of my martini glass. very disgusting and off-putting way to start the meal. we let the server know and he was not really apologetic at all and then brought back a new martini that was not prepared the way i had ordered. the waiter was incredibly inexperienced and told the table next to us that thier bottle of wine would cost \"whatever 12 times 4 is\". he then proceeded to break the cork into thier bottle of wine. we ordered appetizers that came out freakishly fast- within two or three minutes of ordering them. i had the house salad which was very small and had wilted brown lettuce in it. my mother had <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> which was mushy and my father had french onion soup which was watery, had little or no onions in it, and had very little taste (my work cafeteria makes french onion soup that is way better). at this point with the combination of hair in our poorly made drinks, very disappointing food and terrible service, we decided to cut out losses and cancel our entree orders. \n\none star for the manager (i think his name was constantine) who was very nice and apologetic and did not charge us for anything. \n\nas a side note- we crossed the street and wandered into caesar's looking for somewhere else to eat and got right into the palm restaurant (in the forum shops) with no reservations and had an excellent meal of lobster tail and steak!", 
            "ok, first let's dispel the rumor that sitting across the street from the bellagio fountains indoors or outdoors is a worthwhile experience.  without the music the fountains are just a bunch of overgrown water sprinklers and, unfortunately, the music cannot be heard.  even outside, the road noise and crowd noise from the restaurant drowned out the music.  so if you're going to go here, go for the food alone.\n\nextensive and interesting menu and wine list.  we enjoyed the following:\n beet and apple salad (complimentary) served with the french bread and butter.  very good and quite interesting.\n <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> - very good\n <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> with toast points, cornichons, olives, and pickled onions - great!\n flat iron steak bordelaise - good if you like bordelaise\n fish and chips - wonderful and possibly our favorite dish\n garlic spinach - very good\n frites - very good - a cross between potato chips and fries.  must try.\n french onion soup - fair.\n jumbo lump crab cakes - excellent - some of the best we've had.\n house merlot - average\n\nservice was excellent.  outdoor seating is fun for people watching but is first come first serve only.  inner patio covered seating is same.  indoor seating would definitely be my last choice and might not be a choice for us as there was a strong fish smell throughout the indoor areas.  in fact, it even drifted out onto the patio when we were first seated.  hopefully a one time thing.", 
            "oh.  mah.  gah.\n\nperfection.  \n\nfriendly, professional service.  \n\nparsnip and apple soup blows your mind.  it was amazing.  \n\n<mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> were good.  nothing fancy, but it was just <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>.\n\nribeye and filet were ordered by the table and they were delicious. well prepared.  flavorful.  beefy.  everything you want in a steak.  \n\nstay for dessert.", 
            "i made a reservation on opentable.com before we got there.  total lifesaver.  the line was well out the door when we arrived for our 6:30pm reservation.  we were sat inside, the patio was full.  \n\n*warm olive jar- $6.95- delish!  the olives had so much flavor and i used the garlic on the bread!\n\n*<mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>- $14.95- a little pricy but they were 3 bite shrimp...they were huge\n\n*french onion soup- $8.95- not as salty as i thought it was going to be.  very good.\n\n*filet with merlot sauce- $32.95- melt in your mouth delicious.  i was super bummed when it was gone.\n\n*fries- a little odd but they were very good soaked in the merlot sauce.\n\nvery very very good.  the service here is excellent and the bread is to die for.  will be back next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "everything was to die for (and we were sober when we ate). <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> app is a must try! fresh baguettes straight from paris. <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> huge. filet sooo tender and cooked perfectly. sangria was amazing and only 20 a carafe or 5 a glass!  definitely make a reservation online or you'll wait a couple hours!",

            "our second time to mon ami gabi, our first visit was the day after we got married with a bunch of family members. on the patio on a lovely evening in march. it was great. my first time trying escargot and i'm a fan.\na group of friends decided to have dinner at mon ami gabi, knowing how good it was we couldn't resist. we made reservations, for 18 people, unfortunately they couldn't keep us all at the same table but the tables were near each other.\nour waitress, christin, was fantastic, she's been working there for 12 years so she knew exactly what to recommend for your taste.\nthe free loaves of bread are so good, not anything like the tasteless bread you get in real paris. flawlessly accompanied by butter and a carrot slaw to spread on your bread. the fish of the day was barramundi with pole beans over a light tomato sauce. it was cooked perfectly, with a nice crisp skin, seasoning was excellent on my fish as well as my vegetables. my husband ordered the chefs special of the day which was a prime rib roast with long beans and scalloped potatoes. he ate every morsel, the only thing i tasted were the potatoes, which i thought were a bit peppery for my taste. everyone else in our group seemed to love their food, some of the orders included <mark>Trout Almondine</mark>, steak, <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark>, <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, and onion soup just to name a few.\nfor dessert we ordered creme brulee to share, it was an enjoyable ending to our meal, light creamy vanilla custard with a nicely caramelized top layer. yum!", 
            "in recent years, we've seen 99-cent <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> fall by the wayside as vegas has evolved into one of the best restaurant cities in the country.  with our mix of celebrity chefs and other vittle visionaries, we've become a dining destination.  \n\nrather than holding tightly to their treasured recipes, some of these chefs are throwing open the doors to their kitchens and teaching us to cook like they do.  the classes are terrifically good time, and i have actually learned a lot each time i've attended.  it's a wonderful way to spend a saturday morning.\n\nyou may want to have a designated driver on standby, though, because your wine glass will never be empty!\n\nhere are \"quelque choses\" i learned at a fantastic mon ami gabi french cooking class in january of 2012:\n\n* when caramelizing mushrooms, don't wash them because they won't carmelize properly. instead, brush them off. and, use pomace oil, rather than extra virgin olive oil, because it has a higher heating point. \n\n* the fine mesh sieve is a chinois.  it's used to strain the four mushroom soup after it's been blended. it's so-named because it resembles a chinaman's hat. :)\n\n* sear the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> only on one side to avoid making them rubbery.\n\n* don't pair a dessert wine with dessert. it's too much sweet, and they will diminish each other.\n\n* preparing the fresh cream to top the warm chocolate pudding cake, i learned the proper way to whip is with a figure 8 maneuver.  it's a workout!\n\nthe next class at mon ami gabi is july 21.  taking no chances, i registered a month ago.  it's gonna be \"magnifique\"!",

            "(edited on 11/17/12)\n\ni have been there about 7 times. i like to sit outside - to watch bellagio fountain show. \n\nfood quality wise, you can't compare to robuchon or bouchon - mon ami gabi is a french version of denny's. that's for sure. or maybe worse... \n\ni've had <mark>Freshly Ground Ahi Tuna Burger</mark> and bacon cheese burger - nothing special, nothing better than burgers at hard rock cafe.\n\ni've had <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> - it is ok. seafood is not fresh. could be using frozen seafood.\n\ngratin - greasy - heavy - rich - if you like to gain fat, this should be fine. i am worried if someone get heart attack. \n\ntrout - i remembered it was no good. \n\nfish and chips - very thin sliced fish make it pretty greasy. kinda same as one at todd english at aria. (it was my fault to get fish&chips at french bistro, yo know)\n\n(newly edited) \n\ni used to like all their mousse and pate - along with oysters to pair with wine - with a great fountain view. however, i went back and it was a huge disappointment.\n\njumbo <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> - when the server put the dish on our table, something was wrong - shrimps looked kinda brown - we thought it was some sort of spices,,, then as soon as we ate it, we realized that it was an unfresh, oxidized shrimp! it tasted like dirt. horrible! i'm sure they use the same old shrimps for other dishes. gross!\n\nliver mousse and pate - i guess no one orders these items here - i could tell because all the edges were all dried out - pretty disgusting. \n\n<mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark> - it is not a great experience to have green leaves turn brown and wilt. \n\nmussels - bad,,,,, they didn't break my expectation. not fresh! at this point, i was concerned about food poisoning. so, i asked to get a check. it was enough...\n\nwhen the food, especially seafood, gets old, they should throw them away - because you know, there is a risk of spreading food poisoning! don't give me these stained shrimps, dude.\n\nbtw, frites are better than lay's potato chips. complimentary baguette is pretty terrible. you can get better baguettes cheaper at albertson's.\n\nmy suggestion - never get seafood here if you know what decent seafood tastes like. just get burgers - cheap and simple. i guess those people who are giving 5 stars just eat burgers and steaks, not seafood. \n\nservice - not that great - too busy all the time - my server wasn't nice at all - she didn't stop at our table. no refills. i saw she was chatting for a while at another table, tho. \n\nyou will see all the men in black here - they indeed look professional in a funny way - but imagine if they change it to denny's uniforms - surly enough, they would fit really well.\n\nalso, when i made a reservation today (sat. nov 10 2012 around lunch time), the hostess was really rude over the phone.  this is karma on yelp, haha.\n\ni have been going there to see bellagio, not to enjoy food and service, but it was way too terrible.... i will never go back again.\n\n1 star is for bellagio's fountain show.",

            "we had just arrived in vegas on a thursday afternoon and wanted our first meal after flying all morning to be great. mon ami gabi did not disappoint. we arrived around 2pm and were seated at an outside table with a fantastic view of the eiffel and of he strip for prime people watching. service was attentive. food was quite yummy. we ordered a new drink on the menu that had lavender, pineapple and vodka. it was so divine we had two (first bartender made it better than the second). \n\nwe kept it simple with a <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> appetizer (fresh, plump and succulent) and with burgers which came with their hand cut fries. delicious and believe me, it is in fact easy to mess up a burger. the hand cut fries were perfect for snacking on later in the day. \n\ni wish i had been brave enough to order the lobster roll. something tells me they would have in fact done it justice. highly recommend this place.",

            "great atmosphere. great view. great drinks. great food.there is nothing that disappoints me more than paying $$$ for a mediocre meal. mon ami gabi always lives up to my vegas expectations. this place was such a treat. i enjoyed some fresh oysters, <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, house baked bread and a main course while sipping on \"frangria\" (a french sangria) and enjoying the bellagio water view. you can enjoy a dinner with friends or a romantic dinner with your significant other!", 
            "i love this place!!!! it helped that we had arguably the best table for a view of the bellagio fountains as well as a supposedly french waiter. the setting is absolutely perfect for both people watching and a great view of the city.  we had the bacon and <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> upon our waiter's recommendation, and it was delicious. we also had <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> and steak frites with merlot butter sauce as well as peppercorn sauce on the side. we decided we liked the peppercorn slightly better, but both were delicious. our waiter was also a real character and kept us entertained, even bringing us a free dessert at the end.", 
            "my gf had mon ami gabi bookmarked; so, during this stop over in lv, we decided to give it a try.  we were looking forward to trying the beef wellington, but upon sitting down we soon found out that it is their sunday special, and since it was thursday we were sol on that front.  ok, no problem.  surely there is a lot of other good stuff here to eat.  we started looking over the rather brief menu.  we decided to go with a <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, the summer tomato salad, and the fish special of the day - sea bass.  the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> was nothing special and very over-priced: $15 for 5 shrimp on a bed of ice with a very small cocktail sauce container.  the summer tomato salad was even more disappointing: a few slices of tomatoes spread over a plate with a basil leave or two, a few very small pieces of grilled zucchini, and an almost non-existent marinade.  i can make a more impressive looking and tasting tomato salad.  i understand this is a french restaurant, and smaller portions are the nom in europe.  i have no problem with that provided the quality of the dish makes up for it.  mon ami gabi's did not.  but the real icing on this cake, and the reason for two stars instead of three, was the incredibly lousy service we received from our server, gabriel.  from the moment we sat down, it was a lot of attitude, and a lot of waiting.  we were planning on trying a desert, but we got tired of waiting for our waiter after we finished eating, and decided to not give mon ami gabi any more of our business.",

            "i think this is one of my new favorite restaurants ever. the setting is very romantic, the location is convenient, the food is delicious, and it is not prohibitively expensive. the service was a little inconsistent, as our waiter was a little abrupt and unprofessional, but the other employees were very friendly and quick to keep our water glasses full and clear plates. \n\nwe made a reservation through yelp for 8 p.m. with only an hour's notice on a friday night with no problems. that turned out to be a great decision, as there was a long line for walk-ins around then, and we were seated right away. \n\nthe baguette and butter served before our meal was delicious, but we were smart to limit the bread - the steak frites we both ordered were delicious and way too big to finish. we also shared a <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, which was the best i've ever tasted. \n\nwe skipped dessert, but i'm sure everything on the dessert menu is delicious.", 
            "we are locals and came here on our anniversary on 3/31/15.  we had very high hopes for this restaurant.  we waited for outside dining since it was a beautiful night and our anniversary. \n\nwe started off by ordering the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> appetizer.  it was average.  we got 5 pieces of shrimp.  one of the pieces of shrimp had a very odd texture to it almost like it had frostbite rubbery but dry texture to it.\n\nfor dinner, i ordered the scallop dinner which came with brussel sprouts and pureed butternut squash.  the scallops were very sandy and did not care for the taste of the butternut squash.\n\nmy husband ordered the <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark>.  the chicken was good, but it came with some type of squash that was extremely dry, lacked flavor and was overly charred from the broiler.  it was inedible.  \n\nservice from the waiter was average.  we got better service from the individual who brought our bread and beverages. the waiter never once asked me if my meal was good.  \n\nunfortunately, this is not somewhere we will come again and it's even more unfortunate we received very poor meals on our anniversary.\n\non a positive note, the ambiance of sitting outside was wonderful.  we had a beautiful view of the fountains at the bellagio and it was a great spot to people watch, but unfortunately won't be a place we come back to.", 
            "restaurant has a good cuisine! it's really an island of france in vegas. steak and scallops were greate, waiters are polite! recommend! paid 166$ for steak, scallops, <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> and  a bottle of chardonnay.", 
            "mon amis always been one of my favorites every time i visit the strip. located inside of paris, the outdoor seating in the heart of the city is one of the best in terms of setting and ambiance. the one thing i do love about mon ami is the flexibility with the menu. most places refuse to serve breakfast items after a particular time but this restaurant always accommodates my requests and the service is typically on point. the waiters are not overly enthusiastic, but they are friendly and quick which, i believe, are better qualities to portray in food hospitality. on this particular visit i ordered: \n\n<mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark>: with mushrooms, black garlic and sherry reduction. be warned this item is garlicky, but it is delicious. if you love mushrooms and garlic this is a must try. the toasted bread with the gooey <mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark> and garlicky saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms are  an amazing flavor combo. \n\n<mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>: jumbo shrimp served with cocktail sauce and lemon. the shrimp is very fresh and the simplicity of the dish speaks for itself. \n\nmaine lobster roll: served on a toasted brioche roll with house chips on the side. the lobster is fresh and mixed with a creamy mayonnaise. this is one of the heavier items on the menu; if you do not like mayo, you may want to skip out on this one. the chips are also a bit bland, but can be subbed out for house fries, which are delicious. \n\ncustom crepe: i wanted to order a sweet crepe and the waiter suggested a fresh banana and strawberry crepe with whipped cream. i opted for this dish and added a side of nutella (chocolate hazelnut spread) to my crepe. the crepe was served on its own with the toppings served on the side. the fruit was fresh and the cream was whipped in house. the portion is also very large and can easily be shared between two people. \n\nall in all, i recommend mon ami if you enjoy french cuisine and a great view. although i cannot vouch for every food item on the menu, but there are several items that i always eat when i am here. there is typically a wait to sit outside, even on the weekdays, but well worth it!", 
            "still awesome ! went there this weekend and had the baked goats cheese appetizer which is awesome and i had the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> ( clean and good) while my daughter loved the classic steak frite.this is the best place to grab a great meal and people watch- while also catching the bellagio  fountain show", 
            "wow, seriously?  what would have been a fine dinner took a real turn for the worse.  in short, the <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> was not deveined properly and after eating two and biting into the third and seeing heavy remains on not one but two of the 5.  needless to say it killed my gf appetite.  i nicely pointed this out to our sever jeremy whom agreed that was gross then he brought us our bill, our full bill.  really??  i'm not paying $16.95 for shrimp with shit hanging off of it that my gf nearly stuck in her mouth.  at this point when i questioned him he still agreed it was gross but offered to nothing.  i told him i shouldn't even have to ask and i'm not paying for the shrimp.  the manger never came over as i asked either.  what's bunch of morons, over $16?  jeremy just received my first ever $0 tip!!  plenty of other options that i'm sure know how to proper prepare food or own up to mistakes with proper service.", 
            "mon ami gabi, i hyped you up way too much in my head. i almost feel guilty giving you three stars as fellow yelpers below seemed to have had an amazing experience here. \n\nfirst off, our waiter was super rude! i guess since we came as a party of 6 and gratuity was included in the bill maybe he felt he didn't need to provide top notch service to us. our water was refilled once, he seemed upset having to make two separate trips back for napkins and extra bread and he even gave us the bill before we looked at the dessert menu...in fact, if it wasn't for the service we received, i probably would have bumped it up to 4 stars...\n\nnow onto the meal, i ended up ordering the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> $37, a seafood starter platter $55 which included a lobster, <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark>, <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> (4) and fresh oysters (4) as well as two orders of escargot. now the escargot wasn't bad, however it seemed we had more olive oil than actual pesto in it. the filet mignon was cooked almost perfectly but the fries it came with i could've done without. the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> was the winner, the lobster and oysters were very fresh, the shrimp was good but the <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark> needed something more. i guess it's hard to compare when i've only had <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark> in portugal. \n\nfor dessert, our table shared a caramel creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e which was amazing. the dessert was 5 star worthy! if you tell them it's your birthday they also bring out a small ice cream dessert. \n\noverall, this place wasn't bad. perhaps i came on an off day. i don't think i'd come back to the same waiter if i dined here again but other than the service, everything else was pretty good!",

            "we had a lovely time at mon ami gabi before seeing \"o\" across the street at the bellagio. reservations are a must unless you arrive early or are prepared to wait. the restaurant is affordable fine dining for the strip (if you can't splurge for michelin-starred robuchon or nobu) so we thoroughly enjoyed it but only noticed a few drawbacks. \n\nit was cold and rainy outside so we skipped the patio (though it did have heat lamps) and we liked the fancy, romantic atmosphere inside. the entrance to the restaurant is inside the paris casino, so there definitely is the smell of smoke inside the restaurant - not overpowering but a little disappointing. \n\nthe service was very professional - our waitress asked us our evening plans and made sure our food arrive promptly so we could get to it on time. we loved the complimentary warm baguette with butter and the small plate of pickled shredded beets that accompanies it. \n\nfood was delicious. i had the roquefort steak (blue cheese sauce) with frites and though i ordered it medium-well, i was very thankful when it came out an absolutely perfect medium (usually i order mw because some restaurants either over- or under-cook their medium). the dollop of blue cheese spread over the meat was divine and the size of the steak was perfect - generous but not too heavy. the frites were good, but a bit too salty to finish them all.\n\nmy friend ordered the <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark>, served in a lovely glass with avocado and a side of gaufrette chips (thinly-sliced waffle chips) that seemed to be house-made. the plate was garnished with assorted olives and caper berries. she loved it all. \n\nmy other friend ordered the warm <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> salad - mixed greens, oven-dried tomatoes, and herbs served with a warm, creamy, mustardy but light vinaigrette. it was simple but right en pointe. \n\nthis place is very popular for a reason - it's centrally located and very reasonably-priced for a delicious dinner right in the middle of all the excitement. we all loved our dinners, but the finer details of a 5-star experience just weren't there - the tables were a little too close together (probably to accommodate as many guests as possible), which wasn't a problem until it got very busy right when we left and two other patrons had to literally squeeze into the table next to us. it also is awkward that you have to walk through part of the casino to get to the restrooms, which were not very clean and crowded with casino patrons. even though smoking is not permitted in the restaurant, we wished there wasn't associated-casino smoke floating in.\n\nall in all, we'd definitely return, but knowing those things ahead of time can prepare you for a great dinner and just a good dining experience.", 
            "this was the spot for our valentine's dinner.  although we had made a reservation months ago, there was still about a 20 minute wait since it was packed!  we didn't mind, as i got the play the slots while waiting.  \n\nonce our table was ready, we were seated in my favorite area with a view of the bellagio fountains.\n\nthe fresh baguette was warm and delicious.  it came with a carrot concoction i'm not crazy about and cold butter which i love.  we were so hungry that we ate the entire loaf before our food arrived.  \n\nwe ordered...\nescargots - delicious!!!\ncrab cake - yummy!  my husband gobbled most of it up!\n<mark>Salmon Tartare</mark> - fresh and delicious!  but there was more avocado than salmon.  \nbutternut squash puree - tasted like baby food.  would have been better with shaved cheese and herbs on it.\nmac and cheese side - with all that cheese melted on it, it was difficult to get to the pasta.  once you got to it, it was cold and bland.\nsauvignon blanc - we finished the bottle and it was perfection with our meal.\n\nour server, ibrahim was professional, funny, helpful and attentive.  the food was mostly good.  \n\nwill be back again but will not be ordering the mac and cheese or the butternut squash.", 
            "been here four times, twice for dinner and twice for lunch. ordered the steak classique all four times, both dinners were great, yet both lunches failed. the <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark> was very good the first time and so so the last couple of times. they're not very consistent and therefore i'm not sure if i would go back. the service also ranges from great to so so.", 
            "this is one of the best restaurants in vegas. the boyfriend and i came here and loved everything we ate. we ordered: \n\n<mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> medium - probably the best <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> i've ever had. i had no idea a <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> could taste so good. and it went with the dip so well. the bread is soft enough to be chewed on, but hard enough to not get all soggy once dipped. \nchicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> - delicious flavors in this crepe. it had brie cheese, which made it all the much better. \n<mark>Salmon Tartare</mark> - the <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark> was delicious and fresh, with nice crunchy chips and avocado. \nfrench onion soup - delicious french onion soup with the beautiful layer of cheese on top. i think the only good memories i have of great french onion soup has been in vegas. \n\nthe seating was perfect. we asked to be seated outdoors, but we weren't placed literally outside. instead, we were still under an air conditioned glass room, where we had an outdoor view of the poor passerbys suffering the hot sun. we got the best of both worlds. \n\nour server wasn't the best. she was rude and inattentive, but the food was so good i couldn't care less. \n\ni'd come back.", 
            "mon ami gabi, i hyped you up way too much in my head. i almost feel guilty giving you three stars as fellow yelpers below seemed to have had an amazing experience here. \n\nfirst off, our waiter was super rude! i guess since we came as a party of 6 and gratuity was included in the bill maybe he felt he didn't need to provide top notch service to us. our water was refilled once, he seemed upset having to make two separate trips back for napkins and extra bread and he even gave us the bill before we looked at the dessert menu...in fact, if it wasn't for the service we received, i probably would have bumped it up to 4 stars...\n\nnow onto the meal, i ended up ordering the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> $37, a seafood starter platter $55 which included a lobster, <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark>, <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> (4) and fresh oysters (4) as well as two orders of escargot. now the escargot wasn't bad, however it seemed we had more olive oil than actual pesto in it. the filet mignon was cooked almost perfectly but the fries it came with i could've done without. the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> was the winner, the lobster and oysters were very fresh, the shrimp was good but the <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark> needed something more. i guess it's hard to compare when i've only had <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark> in portugal. \n\nfor dessert, our table shared a caramel creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e which was amazing. the dessert was 5 star worthy! if you tell them it's your birthday they also bring out a small ice cream dessert. \n\noverall, this place wasn't bad. perhaps i came on an off day. i don't think i'd come back to the same waiter if i dined here again but other than the service, everything else was pretty good!", 
            "in one word, outstanding!  excellent foods, excellent atmosphere, excellent view facing the bellagio fountains across the strip, and excellent service!  both the boyfriend and i have enjoyed and loved this place a lot!  i would highly recommend the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark>; the jumbo prawns were super huge, the lobster was one whole lobster, in addition to the 4 oysters and <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark>, everything was just fresh and delicious!  the french onion soup ($10-ish) and the chicken & kale crepe ($17-ish) were pretty good too, and inexpensive!  i look forward to coming back here next time i stop by vegas!", 
            "we ate here for our re-wedding dinner on 10/8/15 and we were seated on the patio near a  young couple who had also gotten married that day,  my husband and i ordered the escargot <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> hors d'oeuvre - delicious plump  oven-roasted snails in garlic-herb butter. we had the <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> and the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> for two - cracked whole maine lobster, jumbo shrimp, those wonderful fanny bay oysters (smaller here) and <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark>. it comes with mignonette, cocktail sauce  and sauce gribiche.  at the end of the meal, they brought us and the table next to us an order of profiteroles. i was stuffed but my husband said it was yummy. it was fun sitting on the patio watching the incomparable view of the water show at caesars' palace! this is a very busy, very loud restaurant which sometimes made conversation difficult.  i am in a wheelchair and they had no problem accommodating me. i expect french service from a french restaurant even if it is a bistro and mon ami gabi did not disappoint. everyone was on their toes and the course progression was perfect. we will be eating here the next time we are in las vegas!"

            "finally, we had time to try this place. we made a reservation, (recommended), showed up a little early but we still got seated right away. \n\nall the tables in this place and they put us at a little table tucked in the corner right by the windows of the patio and in direct sunlight! thank goodness it wasn't too warm, but did have a lot of glare!\n\nwe ordered a couple of apps, the warm brie cheese, black pepper honey hazlenuts and croutons, and the <mark>Jumbo Crabcake</mark> with citron butter. the berie cheese was super warm, gouy and very good, a few cloves of roasted garlic, soft hazlenuts so good! the crab cake was very fresh, crab rich and the butter with a splash of acid in the lemon was right up there on the elite list of ceab cakes. definetly recommend both apps!\n\ni also love french onion soup and ordered a bowl, it was cheesy and rich in beef broth, plenty of onions could have used just a bit more baguette, but overall very good.\n\nfor the main event we both got the steak and frites, basically a very thin steak with some thinly cut fries. it was delicious but nothing more then just steak and fries. \n\nfinally we had the white chocolate bread pudding, not that good, dry needed the ice cream and the chocolate cake, at least it was warm and very moist smoothered in two types of sauces and walnut sprinkles. \n\nvery good service food was overall good, wouldn't mind trying their breakfast!", 
            "probably the best meal i had in vegas in terms of price point and flavor! i actually didn't have our last full day in vegas planned out meal wise. while sitting on the balcony at our hotel looking at the strip, i spotted mon ami gabi. i'd been here once about 8 years ago for dinner and enjoyed the food. i thought a nice lunch outside would be a great way to revisit.\n\n*sauvignon blanc: saint bris, 11 ($11)\nperfect for a nice sunny day. crisp and light.\n\n*<mark>Jumbo Crabcake</mark>: pickled celery, citron butter ($17.95)\nthis was huge! had chunks of crab and a light beurre blanc sauce.\n\n*<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>: the french classic baked with gruyere cheese ($10.95)\nyum! a huge portion. the soup was full of flavor and the cheese was nice and melty. the best onion soup i've had in a while.\n\n*frisee, kale & <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>: soft-poached egg ($11.95)\ncompared to the <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> we had for dinner a couple nights before, this was amazing. exactly what i wanted from a <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>. the vinaigrette cut into the richness of the bacon and egg. perfectly balanced.\n\n*<mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark>: white wine & herbs ($11.95 half order)\nthe sauce was so good! i even ate some bread just so i could soak up the sauce. a nice portion for a half order and the mussels were plump and tender.\n\nsitting outside is a nice way to enjoy the sun and people watch. but beware that it can get intensely hot in the direct sunlight. they don't have umbrellas outside so you can walk away with a little more color than you bargained for.\n\nthis was a nice light lunch to bring us into our last day in vegas. and who doesn't love a taste of paris?!", 
            "we made reservations for brunch on saturday. it turns out that if you make a reservation, you must sit inside the restaurant, so we opted to wait the 45 minutes for a table outside. since they have a make-it-yourself bloody mary bar on the weekend, we tried that. it's fun to make it yourself, as spicy as you like it, and there are a lot of fun things to garnish your drink with. also, at $12.00, it was less than a glass of champagne we had had the day before at another location. a lovely baguette and butter was delivered to our table shortly after we returned with our drinks. we were really hungry, and it was so tempting that i ate too much before my food arrived. the <mark>Jumbo Crabcake</mark> was pretty good, not the best i have ever had, but pretty good. i also ordered the small house salad, which was very simple, fresh, and good. my friend ordered the ham and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark>. everything about it tasted good, but the ham wasn't heated through and most of the cheese was unmelted. that was a little strange.\n\nthis place is crowded and busy. you really have to navigate carefully through the place to get to and from your table. sitting across the street and watching the fountains at the bellagio was fantastic. the people watching was great, as well. a band from seattle u even went by as we were eating.\n\noverall, this was a really fun experience. the waiters were very friendly and efficient. even though the place is packed, with people waiting for tables, they don't make you feel rushed to leave. i would definitely go back."

            "it's my birthday and i want mussels - mon ami gabi has them and off we go on a very hot sunday afternoon.  we immediately ask if we could sit outside, and the hostess is quick to tell us there is no shade whatsoever if we choose to sit out there.  (hmm...it's like over a hundred degrees today!)  so, we decide to sit inside, but as we are headed out, i notice a handful of people sitting in the blazing heat and we decide to go for it.  smack dab in the middle of the patio and perfect for people-watching!\n\nit's a quick peek at the menu and we're set to go!  waters arrive shortly, along with warm french baguettes and butter.  the bread and butter is so good, and just so french!  yum!\n\nour food soon arrives:\n* <mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> with frites ($21.95 full order) - loaded with tons of onions, we start digging in.  one of my favorite things about eating mussels is the yummy sauce that comes with it, perfect for dipping warm french bread into!  what i don't like is finding the beard still attached to the mussel.  sure, i can let one go.  but there were at least four mussels were i was spitting the beard out.  yuck.  the frites are usually one of my favorite parts too, but i wasn't digging their version here.  it's more like deep-fried potato sticks\n\n  * county style pate \"cornichons, whole grain mustard, country toast\" ($9.95) - the pate was just okay, nothing spectacular.  you take a piece of pate and put it on the country bread, and take a bite.  have a cornichon too while you're at it.  but it wasn't something that transported me back to the french countryside.\n\nour waiter also forgot the husband's kronenbourg, which required a bit of reminding.\n\nservice was good in the beginning with our water glass being filled often and more baguettes coming our way.  then i think there was a shift change because all of sudden we were forgotten about and we had to wave the staff down for more water and our check.  we also noticed that we didn't get any kind of dipping sauce for our frites, but noticed other tables automatically got ketchup.  i would have been happy with mayo!\n\noverall, i guess i was expecting more - from the service and the food.  everyone raves about this place, and i was left feeling underwhelmed.  the location is perfect, and if you sit outside, it's fabulous for people watching and the bellagio water fountain show.  perhaps i'll go again and further explore their menu.",

            "great environment. great food. great service! \n\nmy gf and i were running late so we extended our reservation and gladly they were able to do so. in the end, we were still very late (we had to walk from aria to take the tram from city center to get bellagio then walk over to paris).  for a sec, i thought we would have to wait in line for our table and then we would have to run to mgm to catch our show @ 930. but turns out, our table was still there and it was a pretty good spot (right next to the window). so we didn't have to sit outside and deal with heat, but at the same time we were able to see the fountains at bellagio. \n\nfood wise. we decided to go with seafood because we had enough of buffets and steaks. we ordered 3 dishes: <mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> (white wine and herbs), escargots, seared <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>. i must admit i was really impressed with the scallops and mussels. scallops and mussles were really fresh and tender. due to bad experiences with escargots, i have not had it for years until i came to mon ami gabi. and lets just say the escargot was not too bad. also, i believe the mussels came with fries, which tasted like chips. not bad. \n\ndinner was served quickly. service was great. we didn't need to rush for the show. we had more than enough time. we ended up having time to walk from paris to mgm. overall, this was a fantastic experience. my gf and i will be back on our next trip to vegas.....mon ami gabi.", 
            "outdoor seating is great for people watching and seeing the bellagio fountains.  mon ami gabi was a family affair before seeing our show at the rio.  it was a great reminder of my recent trip to paris.  some of the food was just fantastic, but others lacked flavor.  \nas a party of five, we started off with a carafe of \"frangria,\" which was fantastic!  then had three different appetizers to share:  warm brie cheese, warm duck confit salad, and the <mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark>. two onion soups <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>.  then for our individual entrees we ordered:  frisee & <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>, steak classique, bone-in ribeye, <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, \"poisson <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>\" = sea bass w/ roasted corn couscous.  being so full, we still had room for dessert...(drum roll please)... bananas foster crepe.  \nin summary, here's what i would definitely get again and what items i would pass up.  \nfive stars:  frangria, <mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> (so memorable!), warm brie cheese--was finished off, but i personally didn't have any because i'm not a cheese person, frisee & <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> (yummy poached egg!), bone-in ribeye (perfectly cooked and juicy), <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, bananas fosters crepe\nfaaaaahget about it:  warm duck confit salad (supbar duck confit to the ones served in paris--lacked salt/flavor), onion soup (not impressive--didn't have a depth of flavor was was too sweet, plus the cheese wasn't gooey), steak classique (ehhh....least the fries were good)",

            "i am normally averse to eateries on the strip because i am of the opinion that they tend to be more bark than bite, and prices tend to be inflated too. but after a long day of hiking, we wanted something close by, which is to say we were hungry, it was late, and options were becoming limited. so we settled on mon ami gabi. i've stayed at the paris before, and walked by this place many times, but it never really caught my eye. i'm glad it did this time.\n\nwe got here at 9:15 pm, with a reservation, but still had to wait 10 minutes or so, which wasn't terrible. the place looks like a french cafe, with incredibly tightly packed tables. there is a constant din from the other diners, and this being vegas, the din is alcohol and tourist fueled. there was a table nearby of retirees singing do you know the way to san jose and another large table where some jackass kept dropping f bombs until he had food in his mouth. i kid you not. ask for a seat on the patio, where you'll have a front row view of the bellagio fountain. \n\nas soon as you're seated, a baguette with whipped butter appears pdq, but because it was so busy, the rest of the service tended to be a bit slow. don't let that discourage you from coming here though! \n\nfor appetizers, we had the jumbo lump crab cake and <mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark>. the crab cake was literally just one little crab cake, served with a celery salad and a sauce gribiche, which is like an aioli. the gribiche was delicious, and the crab cake was decent, but was obviously overmixed. the lump crab was unmercifully beaten into shreds. the mussels however, were fantastic! they were huge, plump, and juicy, served in a delicious white wine and butter herb sauce. they must have been mediterranean mussels, since blue mussels don't get this big. \n\nwe also tried the seared salmon and steak roquefort. the salmon was cooked to perfection, flaky, but still moist. i was impressed with their technique, though i am pretty sure it was farmed atlantic salmon, as the flavor was tame. but still, it was a good piece of fish. \n\nbut this place is known for its steak frites, so i had to have a steak, and i chose the steak roquefort. all of the steak frites, save for those steaks specifically identified as another cut, are top sirloin, which for my money is among the beefier cuts of meat. top sirloin is sometimes a bit tough, though not here. my steak was pounded so thin it only had one side to it! but it was amazingly moist and tender (ordered medium rare), and the roquefort sauce was packed with flavor. each bite just melted in my mouth!\n\nwe finished our meal with a warm flourless chocolate cake, which was also delicious. deeply chocolatey and moist, but light and fluffy, which is unusual for a cake of this type. it was served with a dollop of whipped cream and some berries, which provided a nice counterpoint to the chocolate.\n\nall in all, this was one of the best meals i had in a while, and mon ami gabi will become one of my regular haunts in vegas.", 
            "made reservations for 4. luckily we did, 'cause their line for walk-ins was getting pretty dang long when we arrived. for starters, we shared a half order of the <mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> with white wine and herbs. very yummy. can't really go wrong with them mussels! i also ordered their four-mushroom soup on the side. also, very yummy.\n\nthe service is a bit slow because it's a fancy sit-down restaurant. but we munched on the bread while we waited for our entrees to come. 3 of us ordered steak. the steak classique with butter, the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> with brandy and peppercorn, and the steak bordelaise with caramalized onions and red wine. each steak dish came with frites. and their frites were amazing! it's like well-done in-n-out fries. or string-like thin potato chips! \n\nthe steak itself was thin, tender, and bit. but i've had better steak. the sauces could be better as well...\n\ndon't know if i can give them 4 stars. the ambiance is nice but the food isn't all that memorable... if i go back, i think i will try their breakfast menu instead...", 
            "well my friend, this is a great place to dine at.  it was our last night in vegas and wanted to dine someplace where we could people watch on the strip.  so after trying to decide between 2 places we went with mon ami gabi.  since we didn't have reservation and we wanted to sit out on the patio the wait was over an hour.  \n\nwe were seated towards the corner and was soon greeted by our waiter scott.  he was all smiles kinda reminded me of marc anthony.  very friendly and helpful in trying to decide on what to order as he shared the recomendations.\n\nstarted off with some drinks and got 2 appetizers.  \n\nsea <mark>Scallops Gratinees</mark> ~ was broiled to yummygoodness i could have easily eaten 2 plated of these.  \n\n<mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> ~ cooked in white wine with slithers of garlic.  they were very good.  \n\nscallop potato and green beans that came with the prime rib was very addicting.  the scallop potatoes had a pretty good garlic flavor throughout it was really good. \n\nprime rib ~ this was one huge honker of a prime rib.  cooked perfectly to a medium rare.  it was juicy and tender.  mmmm meat!\n\n<mark>Skate Wing</mark> ~ one thing i always order when its on the menu.  if you have never had one its like the best of crab, lobster and fish.  its sooo damn good.  i could have eaten 2 of these things.  its very lightly pan fried and served with pureed cauliflower.  \n\nafter pigging out we needed to settle out tummy so as all reasonably sound person would do we ordered some cappuccino and dessert.\n\nbananas foster crepe ~ it wasn't like the bananas fosters you get in new orleans but it had the right flavor.  it was very good and with the tasty cup of cappuccino it was the perfect end to a great visit in vegas.\n\neyes ~ great place to people watch and catch the show of the bellagio fountains.\nnose ~ smelling like its gonna be a great dinner!\near ~ its a typical dinner time vibe!\nmouth ~ really tasty good stuff!\ntummy ~ everything was tasty good and was totally satisfied!",

(sangria with rosemary) - rosemary was overwhelming, and the drink was incredibly sweet. it was okay but i wouldn't order it again.\n\nappetizers:\n<mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>: 5 stars. i love pate. <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>, classic, terrines of all sorts. this one had a nice meaty texture to it, and i loved the bread and mustard it was served with. would definitely order this again. they also have a chicken liver mousse on the menu that i want to try. next time!\n\nmixed salad with kale: 4 stars. can't remember too much about this salad, but it was good, from what i can recall.\n\n<mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> (boyfriend's order): 5 stars. the rest of the trip, we were talking about coming back to get more of these mussels!!! we ordered a half-order for $10.95 and they were big, tender, and that broth was amazing and perfectly seasoned. best dish of the meal for sure! ***tip: the resto gives you a loaf of bread at the beginning of the meal. save it for sopping up the broth. too good.\n\nbone-in ribeye: 4 stars: perfectly seasoned and very well cooked, but excessively fatty (not marbled--we're talking chunks of fat). i also had a bit of gristle in mine but it wasn't much. the fries that come with the rib eye are so good. it's like a potato chip made babies with a french fry. crispy and tasty and awesome and they soak up the meat juice and become little crispy meat-juice carriers. my mouth is watering at the thought of it.\n\nscallops with ratatouille (boyfriend's order): 4 stars. the scallops (order came with 4 or 5 large scallops) were perfectly cooked--tender and flavorful. the basil pairing was perfect. the ratatouiile was just okay according to him. plate portion was on the smaller side, but the awesomeness of the scallops made that okay for him.\n\nwe will definitely be back, especially for the pate and mussels. for the price and ambiance (especially if you can get a table overlooking the bellagio fountains), it can't be beat!", 
            "if you sit outside for dinner the view is awesome. food is good with limited choices but the qualitative. tried there <mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> and chicken grandmere both were quite a deliscious.", 
            "we had an enjoyable dinner tonight.  it was really busy but i was able to make a 7:45 pm reservation via opentable 40 minutes before the reservation.  what made the dinner so enjoyable was the friendliness of the staff, starting with the hostess and ending with our stellar waitress, tracy.  she checked up on us often without being intrusive.  our water glasses were filled constantly.  the dishes we ordered included:\n\n-two bowls of french onion soup- very filling with the right amount of melted cheese and bread.  it was on the sweeter side but good.\n-trout amandine:  the trout was tasty but just slightly over cooked. the green beans were crispy and well seasoned.\n-<mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark>, full order with frites.  the creamy white  sauce was delicious as a dip for bread.  the mussels were good but a bit too small.  however, the portion was big. the frites were thin fries that were slightly too crispy for me.\n-bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream- it typically is one of my favorite desserts.  however, the  bread was slightly too dense. \n\nwe liked the fresh french bread in a bag.  the restaurant is easy to get to- it is across the street from the bellagio fountains. the dining room was dimly lit- i would have preferred a brighter dining area.  overall, we really liked our friendly and attentive server.  the food was good so i would give it 3.5 stars.", 
            "i live in las vegas, and my boyfriend and i love to frequent this restaurant! great atmosphere, great food, and great people watching!  we enjoy going any afternoon/evening.... we always request to sit on the patio front so that we can have the strip view, and it also gives us the opportunity to see the beautiful bellagio fountain show as well.... we always have a few beers or glasses of wine while enjoying the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>, the <mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> and the yummy fresh baked bread!\n\ni have always had a great time at this restaurant! the service has been consistently wonderful and charming each time we have been.  would definitely recommend going for anyone who hasn't been!", 
            "probably the best meal i had in vegas in terms of price point and flavor! i actually didn't have our last full day in vegas planned out meal wise. while sitting on the balcony at our hotel looking at the strip, i spotted mon ami gabi. i'd been here once about 8 years ago for dinner and enjoyed the food. i thought a nice lunch outside would be a great way to revisit.\n\n*sauvignon blanc: saint bris, 11 ($11)\nperfect for a nice sunny day. crisp and light.\n\n*<mark>Jumbo Crabcake</mark>: pickled celery, citron butter ($17.95)\nthis was huge! had chunks of crab and a light beurre blanc sauce.\n\n*<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>: the french classic baked with gruyere cheese ($10.95)\nyum! a huge portion. the soup was full of flavor and the cheese was nice and melty. the best onion soup i've had in a while.\n\n*frisee, kale & <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>: soft-poached egg ($11.95)\ncompared to the <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> we had for dinner a couple nights before, this was amazing. exactly what i wanted from a <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>. the vinaigrette cut into the richness of the bacon and egg. perfectly balanced.\n\n*<mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark>: white wine & herbs ($11.95 half order)\nthe sauce was so good! i even ate some bread just so i could soak up the sauce. a nice portion for a half order and the mussels were plump and tender.\n\nsitting outside is a nice way to enjoy the sun and people watch. but beware that it can get intensely hot in the direct sunlight. they don't have umbrellas outside so you can walk away with a little more color than you bargained for.\n\nthis was a nice light lunch to bring us into our last day in vegas. and who doesn't love a taste of paris?!", 
            "when in vegas, i always frequent mon ami!\n\nthey never disappoint, they are the most consistent restaurant i've ever been too. i always know i will have a delicious meal, with excellent service and wonderful drinks.\n\non this trip i enjoyed:\n\nthe french martini -  alway memorable and delicious!\n\nthe french onion soup - a great starter before a meal, hot with melted cheese on toast, floating on  onion broth.\n\n<mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> -  always delicious, creamy and texture is smooth\n\n<mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> - with its white wine & herbs.... it was perfect for dunking the fresh french baguettes in.\n\n<mark>Freshly Ground Ahi Tuna Burger</mark> - a pleasant burger without the guilt.\n\ni always look forward to dining at mon ami! will definately return and highly recommend!", 
            "i swear i thought this place was a korean restaurant, where some immigrants couldn't spell \"galbi\" correctly in english. heh, jokes on me now. i def didn't take french class back in school. anyways, went here for a birthday celebration. \n\nfresh baked free bread- 3 star. it was good, but i've had better. why couldn't they make this better considering that it's a french resto?\n\nbone-in rib-eye- 5 star. it was a tad tad tad bit overly seasoned (with salt) but it was cooked to perfection, with charring on the outside. i had mine medium rare, and it was delicious. the fries (think french fry chips) were okay. i wish they'd stick with regular pomme frites. the burnaise sauce was sooooo gooooooooooood. dip that meat in the sauce and it's a game changer! \n\n<mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> with pumpkin puree and brussel sprouts- 4 star. the scallops were ok. it was delicious, but scallops are scallops no matter where you go i guess, as long as it's cooked correctly. the standout is the brussel sprouts that were included. this is what brought the dish up from a 2 to a 4 star. \nthey were the best brussel sprouts i have ever had in my life. it was charred on the edges, and just enough crunch to make this pungent veggie go from nasty to \nfantabulous. you can order these as a side. \n\n<mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> (white wine and herbs) - 3 stars. i wish there was a bit more lemon or garlic flavor in the sauce. it was ok for me. i couldn't even taste the saffron (or maybe it wasn't even in it?) \n\n<mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark>- 3 star. this was good, but a very tiny portion as a side for $7.95. it wasn't spectacular or memorable, and i'd skip this next time. plus, it's carby...i just did you a huge favor. \n\nfree dessert for my bday- some eclair with ice cream. meh, but it was free. \n\nas strange as this may sound, i'd go back here just to eat the brussels sprouts. i'm drooling thinking of this veggie that normally smells like someone let out a huge fart and left it lingering for a hot minute. i have been \"de-traumatized\" via the mon ami gabi experience.", 
            "by far the best meal we had during our 3 days in sin city!  mon ami gabi exceeded our expectations in every way possible.  since i knew that we would be making a trip to las vegas, i yelped the highest rated restaurants on the strip and mag came up in the top feed.  coincidentally, the other half decided to make a dinner reservation for us there.  it had to be fate.  \n\nhaving passed by mag a few times while walking on the strip, you truly get the vibe of a french bistro with the outdoor seating and decor.  once inside, it's quite romantic with dim lighting and charming ambiance.  we opted to sit inside since it was still upper 90 degree temperatures out on the patio.  they do have misters, but i think i prefer not to have my food misted.  inside was perfect as we had our table for two set up in a more private corner, but still able to see the outdoor patio.  our waiter, though professional, was a little dry in the beginning but warmed up a bit throughout service.  our food came out with perfect timing.  service was on point.  we were checked on periodically and our glasses were always filled.  \n\nbeing a sucker for any type of fresh baked bread, i pretty much ate the majority of the french baguette that was served with a carrot type slaw and butter.  i've never been to france before, so i'm not sure if they always serve their breads with this carrot slaw.  it reminded us of a ban mi and i suppose that's one way of french influence in vietnamese cuisine?  either way, that baguette was damn good and we had to refrain ourselves from having another when the waiter asked if we wanted more.  we didn't want to fill ourselves up with bread before dinner.  \n\nthe waiter was patient and let me try the pinot noir and cabernet from the rolling wine cart before settling on the bordeux ($11/glass).  they have an extensive wine list and lots of wonderful options listed as well as a fancy cocktail menu. \n\nthe cooking and execution at mag really shines.  everything we ordered that was perfectly prepared, had delicious flavors and nice presentation.  most impressive was that every single dish was a hit! \n-<mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> ($12.95/half order):  by far the best mussels we have ever had!  the mussels were tender and just cooked to perfection.  most times they are overcooked and somewhat chewy.  we thought we had the best mussels in ny's flex mussels but mag really impressed.  the herb wine sauce was also so good we used the remaining french bread to sop it all up.  for a half order, generous portion and a great appetizer to start with. \n-<mark>Skate Wing</mark> ($25.95):  being an adventurous eater, i wanted to give it a try since i've never had it before.  i must say, it was moist, tender and a flavorful white fish.  the way it was prepared was delicious - pan fried golden brown on the outside.  it was served on a bed of white asparagus and baby asparagus.  veggies were fresh and blanched just right.  i asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side since i normally think it's too thick and heavy.  however, the mag hollandaise was light and delicate (probably as it should be) and amazingly delicious!  best hollandaise vert we've ever had! \n-new york strip ($37.95):  wherever he goes, he must have his steak and frites.  the other half ordered it medium and it came out medium.  the steak was a good size and came with a huge pile or thinly hand cut fries.  i tried a piece of the steak and it was tender with simple flavors of garlic, salt and pepper.  the steak didn't even need the bordelaise sauce that it came with.  fries weren't too greasy or salty.  \n-classic profiteroles ($9.95):  my favorite dessert of all time!  not too many places serve profiteroles, so whenever i see them on the menu i must order, no matter how stuffed i am. mag profiteroles were also the best i've ever had.  they were decadent and sinful.  three large pastry puffs with a scoop of vanilla ice cream sandwiched between each puff with double dark chocolate fudge drizzled on top - i was in heaven!!!  highly highly recommend! \noverall one of the best meals i've had from start to finish in a very long time.  total tab was $135 for two.  very reasonable prices, great value, spectacular dining experience without being pretentious, nice wait staff, excellent cooking and very enjoyable food!", 
            "this place is amazing!\n\nthe <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> ($15.95): oven-roasted snails, garlic-herb butter is to die for. try this with their freshly made house bread. it's the perfect combination.\n\nfor my entree, i had the <mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> ($12.95 for half or $23.95 for full with fries): white wine and herbs. how can you go wrong with mussels?\n\nmy boyfriend had one of their specials that night: beef wellington. i can't remember what exactly was made with the beef, but i do remember this being crazy delicious. there was a good-sized chunk of meat wrapped around a pastry and of course a special-house sauce. there was also pommes frites to accommodate the steak. i would definitely make a trip back."

            "i love consistency and mon ami gabi continues to have nothing but.  i've checked-in here 12 times, though i've probably been here around 15 times.  and every time has been a very solid dining experience without any disappointments.  if you've read all my previous updates, i have always ordered something different and the trend continues on with this review.\n\nbreakfast still continues to shine:\n\neggs benedict special with turkey and avocado -- at mon ami gabi http://bit.ly/1nntvsy\ni've had their crab cake and standard eggs benedict before and they were great, this special was really good as well.  but like those two other dishes i've had before, their hash browns keep stealing the show!\n\nham & <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> w/ egg -- http://bit.ly/1z8qqef\ni had this during my last trip in december and it was first crepe at mag.  it was delicious!  had a good amount of ham and cheese inside and you gotta add the runny egg as it really completes the crepe even though it costs extra.\n\ndinner on the patio at night is also still one of my favorite things to do in vegas whenever i visit:\n\n<mark>Scallops Gratinees</mark> --  http://bit.ly/1z203p6\nw/ fennel, onion, mussel cream\nthis was not bad.  it's basically like a scallops version of oyster rockefeller.  really cheesy but the scallops were a little on the small side.\n\ncassoulet --  http://bit.ly/1z20gsc\nduck leg & pork belly, oven dried tomato\nmag continues to surprise me with their take on classic french dishes.  this cassoulet was excellent!  and loaded!  along with the huge duck leg, it came with at least 3 generously sized pieces of pork belly.  it's a very different cassoulet than others i've had before but it still delivered.\n\ndespite being considered now one of the \"older\" restaurants on the strip, mon ami gabi still manages to stay fresh and current with their menu.  you have to dine here a least once if you're ever visiting vegas.", 
            "love that i made a reservation about 20 minutes before arriving and got seated right away.. i love how they walked us to our seat into a bright room with a view of the bellagio fountain. we came in for my wifes birthday for lunch and was really excited to come here. i really dont have too much to say bout how good this place was because it was just a mediocre experience so lets get to what we ordered.\n\nfresh baked french bread (really good had 2 loafs there and 1 to take home)\nhousmade <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> (least favorite)\n<mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>\n<mark>Scallops Gratinees</mark> (favorite)\nsteak frites roquefort (really good)\ncaramel creme brulee (great dessert)\n\ni really could have done without the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> because it totally changed the whole dining experience if you know what i mean. the prices here really make you think thats affordable but the portions dont support it. its a spot for the tourists for sure. i like the steak frites but since i eat steak so much and know it was just flap steak served with some fries i know that they were just playing it safe which is fine. i wouldnt mind eating here again but i know now that i should stick to certain things maybe my next experience would bump them up to a confident 4star rating. thank you for the food."

            "3.5 stars\n\noh god.  as i mentioned in my last review, we came back here for my friend's bachelorette.  i made the reservation a week in advance.  \n\nwhen i got there, i had to change it because a girl dropped out. if you use yelp to get phone numbers, this one is incorrect.  it takes you to effiel tower restaurant.  i did eventually get through and told her i needed to \"change tomorrow's reservation.\" (the reason i changed it for one person is because if your entire party isn't seated, you can't be considered for deck seating.) she told me she couldn't find me anywhere and i was put on hold for a long time, several times.  finally she said \"i found your reservation under tomorrow.  there must have been an error.\" me: \"nope. i wanted it for tomorrow.\" gah.  so that was figured out.\n\nthen the day of, the girls are running late and ask me to push it back.  i tell the hostess, \"can you push the reservation for ninette for 11 back 30 minutes?\" she said, \"ok clark (or something equally ridiculous) for 5!\" what now? eh, maybe it was loud.\n\nwe did make it there and were seated inside (outside was a 2 hour wait).  my friend and i ordered the escargot for appetizer to share and the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> for our entree.  the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> came with 4 oysters, <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, tuna cervice, seaweed salad, several sauces and an entire lobster.  i also just checked and there were supposed to be crackers. huh. never saw that. either way, it looked pretty impressive, not going to lie.  the escargot were good.  they came in a pesto-ish sauce.  the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> was all good except for the main event: the lobster.  the lobster was chewy and overcooked.  we thought we would need steak knives.  i don't know what kind of lobster it was called but it had the spongy legs/claws that i didn't really like either.\n\ni still think this place is pretty reasonably priced and a good balance between casual and fancy for vegas.  the bad lobster and confusion put me off a bit more than the first time, but for mostly-good food and prices, i'll keep my 3.5 stars under 4.",

(and good during the summer time)\n\noverall - i'd highly recommend! great food, great service.. and won't burn a hole in your wallet ;)",

            "on our last night in vegas i took my wife here for a late dinner. this location had been recommended by a local for the romantic atmosphere. we sat on the patio which sits facing the bellagio. we didn't eat until almost 8pm, the fountains where putting on their show every 15 minutes giving it a little extra to the atmosphere.\n\n the service was remarkable. our waiter was very helpful and friendly, answering my questions. he asked if we wanted a bottle of wine. at first i said no, but changed my mind as it was our last night in vegas and i wanted to have a special dinner with my wife. of course i know nothing about wine. my palette is mainly attuned for beer and spirits. the waiter asked some questions then made a recommendation. his recommendation was spot on. i really wish i could remember the name of the wine as we both loved it. \n\nfor an appetizer we ordered the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>. we both enjoyed it. it had a rich flavor, but it wasn't overpowering. it was a great way to start the meal. \n\nthe main course my wife wanted the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> for two: lobster, shrimp, oysters, tuna tartar and seaweed salad. the shrimp were huge. the lobster was delicious and cooked perfectly. my wife didn't like the oysters, but i enjoyed them. the tuna tartar had a great flavor and was combined with avocado that helped balance out the tuna. neither one of us liked the seaweed salad, but i think that's a personal taste issue. the best part of the meal was the sauce they provided for the lobster, it was like a horseradish mustard. the tasted fantastic! definitely worth a try. \n\nwe contemplated ordering dessert, but we were both full. \n\nif you go, and the weather is right, i would recommend sitting on the patio. the combination of the fountains, the d\\u00e9cor and being able to watch people walking up and down the strip made for a fun evening. \n\noverall the entire experience was amazing. i would definitely go back if i ever go to vegas again.",

            "read the reviews and was intrigued. wanted to go someplace nice but not over the top. \n\nmade reservations for 9 on a saturday night. arrived to a small line. told her about our reservation. she robotically told us to go to the other line. once i was in the fro.nt of the second line, another hostess gave me one of those square light filled waiting thing. felt kinda like chili's. all hostesses seemed overworked and none really smiled. it seemed they were all overwhelmed students doing this for the first time.  eventually a hostess led us to our table. asked her how her day went and she said it was busy. i thought to myself, but it's sat in vegas. is this something new?\n\nupon entering, you see well decorated interior. everything in the place screams paris sophistication. dimly lit amber chandeliers hang from the vaulted ceilings. decorative windows w colored cutouts. marble tables. the place looks like a million bucks. decor is a comfortable elegance. everything is beautiful yet approachable. perfect for a romantic dinner.\n\ni ordered the special of the night, prime rib served w potatoes <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> and sting beans. cj ordered the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark>. a combination of lobster, oysters, shrimp, tuna tartar and seaweed salad. food came relatively quickly. was all as expected. taste was ok. 3/5. which was a little disappointing considering the ambiance. platter was also $24/person minimum 2. considering, it was very little food for the price. was more ice than anything else.\n\nwait staff was also peculiar. waiter walks by. makes eye contact. then continues walking by. 10 minutes later he turns out to be the waiter. now at chili's a chain restaurant, they would have typically said \"i'll be right back\", or otherwise indicate they were our waiter.  he was cordial and informative though. food as said came out as ordered. but minutes later he is refilling our water. after a round or two, a bus boy finally starts refilling our water and removing plates. overall the feel is poor staff training and disorganization. this place has one of the best locations across from the bellagio fountains.\n\noverall, great ambiance but food and service like a national chain restaurant. a shame because this place could be so much more. save yourself money and have drinks or dessert here",

            "good food, great service, outstanding views! \n\ni've come here every time i've been to vegas and have tried every possible meal from breakfast to a late dinner. the best time to enjoy gabi's is at nighttime: the bellagio fountains will be going off every 20 or so minutes, the strip will be packed, and the patio cool and pleasant even in the summer months. however it can get crowded in the evening so if you want to sit outside be prepared to wait for 20 or so minutes and get a reservation in advance. i've come here with a friend once without reservations and was told there would be more than an hour wait to get a seat anywhere on a saturday night. since the restaurant is so versatile it's hard to recommend 1 or 2 dishes in particular so it's probably best to list the highlights by meal:\nbreakfast: croque madame or the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>. help yourself to some champagne too, it's vegas\nlunch: chilled zapacho, <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>, and the trout amandine are all great. on friday they serve an australian cod which is brilliant\nbrunch: do yourself a favor and order a french 75. it's no longer on the menu but they make the best in town. add in the eggs benedict and it'll rival bouchon for the best french-themed brunch in vegas.\ndinner: the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> is the best deal for an appetizer. 50 dollars for a whole lobster, oysters, tuna tartare, shrimp and even more. follow that up with the steak bearnaise or roquefort and finish up with profiteroles accompanied by cognac. be careful: the calories will add up but it will have been well worth it.",

            "yummm !\n\nso the last 2 times i've been to vegas, i've eaten at this place. the first time i was brought by a cold tofu classmate that recently moved to the area. its a nice french style steakhouse that serves steaks, sandwiches, seafood and the like. walking in here really reminded me of my wonderful time in france and of all my amazing journeys. it seriously took me home :*)\n\nthe first time i was here, i tried the french onion soup, moules-frites and the escargot.\n\nnow, i must say that since walking into this place brought back so many intense memories of happier times, i was really setting the bar high for the food. maybe a little too high? if i were to compare my dishes to those i tried in france, then i must say that the food was just mediocre at best. \n\nthe french onion soup was definitely wayy too salty to be consumed without the amazingly fresh bread that they brought out to our table. we asked for bread about 6 times throughout our meal, and every time, it came fresh outta the oven and piping hot. that's how bread should be (: on the plus side, if you're a poor college student coming to vegas to party and want a slice of the good life, you could always come and order a bowl of french onion soup and dip it with the bottomless bread they have here. that would definitely get you full while letting you basque in the french ambience for a while. just saying (;\n\nmy mussels were also a tad on the fishy side, the sauce a bit too salty for my liking but my fries were outta this world deeelicious ! although, i must say that they are definitely not french style frites. these fries are sliced thinner than usual and so they are crispy all around, and stay that way throughout your whole meal ! (even 3 hours later back in our room at planet hollywood !) \n\nmy escargot was also on the saltier side (seriously, i used to smoke, so i definitely don't eat my food bland. if everything i ordered was too salty for my taste than something's gotta give), but i think it had to be like that to help cover the \"unfresh\" aroma of the actual snail. once again, that's where the bread came in handy ! the herb butter sauce that the escargot was prepared in was super flavorful, it just had a handful too many pinches of salt and so it needed the super carb of the bread to help soak it up.\n\nthat night, the friend that brought me had ordered a steak bearnaise on my recommendation. (it was one of my favorites in france, along with the steak roquefort. nommm) the bearnaise was a bit thin, but the flavor was spot on. and it came with a side of their amazing frites that just complete the meal.\n\njust a month later i decided to take the fam here for lunch during labor day weekend. there wasn't a wait, which was amazing for a saturday at 12 ! they seated us in the bright dining area with open windows, and ac blasted on high ! it felt so great to be able to be seated \"outdoors\" without the 100 degree plus weather.\n\nthe menu is different for lunch, as it should be i suppose ! the entrees are a lot lighter, and there are more salads and sandwiches to choose from. we ordered the tuna melt, <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>, bacon cheeseburger, and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. every sandwich/burger came an order of delicious fries ! i believe the only sandwich that stood out among all of our choices would have to be the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. it was flavorful, the steak was tender and the side of au jus to dip had just the right amount of kick to it ! i believe it was a grainy mustard that made the difference ! the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was a total disappointment, i believe there were literally 8 bites of overdressed salad for $10 and we could have added another 2 and just got another burger or sandwich. will definitely never order a salad form here again. i would have been much happier with wendy's caesar side salad for $1 ! that's how bad it was :/\n\nanyway, i know that i will definitely be back to visit this wonderful place again sometime in the future to try their <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> ! i saw a couple eating it together and it looked so scrump-diddly-umptious ! hahahaha, definitely needa find a bf to take me here for that one day (;\nhappy eating !", 
            "the view was wonderful. dinner in front of the bellagio water show. the outdoor heaters kept me comfortably warm from the below 40f temperature (i went here during winter). \n\nthe crab cake was delicious. <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> was not as large as i expected, but it was enough to satisfy me. <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> was nothing special, though. small lobster, small but fresh oysters, a few pieces of <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, raw tuna pieces with avocado.  pricey, but the ambiance and service was good.", 
            "i usually steer clear of the strip when it comes to dinner out around town. the main reason being that everything is overpriced just because of the location.\n\nthis place is no exception, but not to such extremes as other locations. and being that there is such a limited amount of outdoor dining there on the strip, i'm willing to shell out a little more for the experience of dining on las vegas blvd. \nunfortunately we didn't get that experience when we were here, and were tucked away at a tiny table right next to the door. \nno big deal except we seemed to be a little to hidden from our server as well.\nthe table was tiny and felt like a table in a coffee shop.\nagain this would have been fine if we were stopping in for a small bite at a cafe, but we were starving, and came for a serious dinner.\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> ($49.95) which is an entree meant to be split by 2 people, and in addition ordered the largest steak on the steak frites menu, the 22 0z. bone in ribeye ($39.95).\n\nthe frites were crispy and a real surprise, but the steak was a bit disappointing. it was a high quality cut, but the flavor of the steak just wasn't there for some reason, and it came at the same time as the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark>, which we specifically asked to have brought out as an appetizer and the steak later. so after we finally finished the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> the steak had continued cooking for another 10 minutes on the plate to a little past medium, and had gotten cold.\nwe were a little disappointed but at the time we couldn't flag down a server to let him know we had a few issues.\n\nthe <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> was exactly as it should have been. very fresh, and very filling. although i'm not an aficianado on french food, and maybe i'm just a redneck who's eaten at red lobster one too many times...but i can't help but feel like i need some drawn butter with lobster and shrimp.\noh well, ces't la vie.\n\nservice: 2 stars\nfood: 3 stars\nprice: 3.5 stars\nambiance: inside 2 stars/ outside 5 stars.",

            "mon ami gabi, i hyped you up way too much in my head. i almost feel guilty giving you three stars as fellow yelpers below seemed to have had an amazing experience here. \n\nfirst off, our waiter was super rude! i guess since we came as a party of 6 and gratuity was included in the bill maybe he felt he didn't need to provide top notch service to us. our water was refilled once, he seemed upset having to make two separate trips back for napkins and extra bread and he even gave us the bill before we looked at the dessert menu...in fact, if it wasn't for the service we received, i probably would have bumped it up to 4 stars...\n\nnow onto the meal, i ended up ordering the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> $37, a seafood starter platter $55 which included a lobster, <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark>, <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> (4) and fresh oysters (4) as well as two orders of escargot. now the escargot wasn't bad, however it seemed we had more olive oil than actual pesto in it. the filet mignon was cooked almost perfectly but the fries it came with i could've done without. the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> was the winner, the lobster and oysters were very fresh, the shrimp was good but the <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark> needed something more. i guess it's hard to compare when i've only had <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark> in portugal. \n\nfor dessert, our table shared a caramel creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e which was amazing. the dessert was 5 star worthy! if you tell them it's your birthday they also bring out a small ice cream dessert. \n\noverall, this place wasn't bad. perhaps i came on an off day. i don't think i'd come back to the same waiter if i dined here again but other than the service, everything else was pretty good!", 
            "in one word, outstanding!  excellent foods, excellent atmosphere, excellent view facing the bellagio fountains across the strip, and excellent service!  both the boyfriend and i have enjoyed and loved this place a lot!  i would highly recommend the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark>; the jumbo prawns were super huge, the lobster was one whole lobster, in addition to the 4 oysters and <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark>, everything was just fresh and delicious!  the french onion soup ($10-ish) and the chicken & kale crepe ($17-ish) were pretty good too, and inexpensive!  i look forward to coming back here next time i stop by vegas!", 
            "service was great.\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> everything was fresh.\n\nfor the entree i irdered the lamb t-bone medium rare. it was cooked perfectly. it came with a side of ratatouille which was full of flavor. it was the best ratatouille i have ever had. \n\nthen dessert we all shared a crepe suzette. its had vanilla ice cream and orange marmalade. the ice cream was amazing. the crepe with the marmalade was sweet  it had just the right amount of orange flavor.", 
            "paris is not that far away...\n\nif you need a little parisian influence in your world this will do the trick until you get to the real place. \n\ni've been coming here for years and its honestly one of my favorite strip spots. it's also open for breakfast, lunch & dinner and dinner time is my favorite for sitting outside and taking in people watching along with the beautiful bellagio fountains. people watching in vegas never gets old! \n\nthe food is excellent and i need to try breakfast here as that's the only thing i haven't done yet. for lunch i love the quiche, lemon salmon dish or the ham & cheese tartine. and for dinner i've had the salmon as well that usually comes with some type of pur\\u00e9e like peas or potato and the steaks with frites here are excellent! you pick whether you would like the classic with some herb butter or get a little fancy with it and have caramelized onions and red wine sauce! this one is sweet and we loved it last night! the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> are excellent here along with the fantastic cheese plates. i haven't had anything i didn't like...\n\nnow the best part about this place is the ambiance! and of course the company...\n\ni bring my favorite people here and last night was extra special as it was my moms first time. every time we've attempted to come here in the past its either raining or full. \n\nthis time was perfect. we sat outside. the temperature was amazing in the high 70's and we just enjoyed ourselves. bring someone special here and whether it's a friend, lover or family member they will most likely enjoy it. \n\nparis holds a very special place in my heart and this is as close as it gets in vegas...", 
            "i've always wanted to try this place, so we finally did!! i need to go back when there are actually better seats outdoor though. we went on a hot day and no matter where you were seated, the sun would be shining at you. no biggie though, we just moved inside. \n\nwe had the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> which was enough for 4 people. it was not bad and came with a variety of seafood. the steak wasn't all that great. \n\ncustomer service was great as well. it was a great experience overall!", 
            "super nice high quality food and service. we had a wedding reception for 12 people. the server was extremely helpful. the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> appetizer was worth the money. we ordered 2 hunger steaks and had to order the third one. it's a must try dish. the oysters were also fresh. we will definitely go back every time we are in vegas.", 
            "we ate here for our re-wedding dinner on 10/8/15 and we were seated on the patio near a  young couple who had also gotten married that day,  my husband and i ordered the escargot <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> hors d'oeuvre - delicious plump  oven-roasted snails in garlic-herb butter. we had the <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> and the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> for two - cracked whole maine lobster, jumbo shrimp, those wonderful fanny bay oysters (smaller here) and <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark>. it comes with mignonette, cocktail sauce  and sauce gribiche.  at the end of the meal, they brought us and the table next to us an order of profiteroles. i was stuffed but my husband said it was yummy. it was fun sitting on the patio watching the incomparable view of the water show at caesars' palace! this is a very busy, very loud restaurant which sometimes made conversation difficult.  i am in a wheelchair and they had no problem accommodating me. i expect french service from a french restaurant even if it is a bistro and mon ami gabi did not disappoint. everyone was on their toes and the course progression was perfect. we will be eating here the next time we are in las vegas!", 
            "i was so excited to try this place out and left disappointed. the prices were reasonable, but the food wasn't the best. we started with the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> which was good, probably the best part of the meal! everything about this platter was delicious. but when it came to our main courses, they were alright. i got the steak classique and frites, the fries were pretty good, nice and crispy. the steak was very chewy though, i only finished half of it because it was so chewy. my boyfriend ordered the bass special and the fish was tasty! the sides didn't pair very well with the fish though. our server was nice, but he forgot to put our main course order in so we were there for almost two hours total. it was a pretty long wait just to get the check as well. overall, if anything, i would come back for the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> and the baguette but nothing else really stood out.", 
            "this is my second time here, gotta love their patio seats, you get to enjoy the views while having good foods. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> to share, their seafoods are just sooo fresh. i'm a seafood lover so trust me on this. my medium rare <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> was cooked to perfection. my friends ordered the trout and ragu, they said the trout was just alright but the ragu was very tender. \n\ni would come back again soon."

            "i had dinner here with my husband and some friends while in town for march madness. the group size changed a couple times and the staff rolled with it and moved the whole table to accommodate the larger party.  and they were full with a long wait at the time.\n\nthe waitress was amazing.  several in the party wanted a glass of wine but didn't know what so were looking for suggestions (note: only french wines here, no ca ones.)  she went out of her way to bring over 4 different bottles of wine (opening 2 of them just for us) for them to taste.  and did it all with a smile.   \n\ni wasn't that hungry so only had the butter lettuce salad and the mac and cheese (<mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark>) on the appetizer menu but i loved them both. i had a taste of my husband's steak (steak classique) and it was delicious.  everyone else seemed to thoroughly love their food as well.  \n\nwe were too stuffed to try dessert - but i will save room next time!\n\nif you sit outside or near the front window, you can see the bellagio fountains so that is very nice.\n\ni dislike most things french (cheese and bubbly are noted exceptions but really...still done better in ca) but this was quite yummy without the attitude at most french restaurants (yes, masa's in sf i am talking to you.)\n\ni would definitely come back here on my next trip to vegas.", 
            "wonderful experience. we decided to go to dinner last minute before the 10:30pm show of \"o\". we tried to get a patio table, but it was a 30 min wait. so they gave us the next best thing: table bordering the patio. it was an awesome view, i would say it's better than being out on the patio. we just went this past weekend and it was unseasonably cool and pleasant for vegas. bellagio fountains and weather made for a great dinner. \n\nwe had the escargots to start. it was decent, i say too much butter. i had the bone-in ribeye with a side of <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark>. the steak could have been more flavorful, but still good. the mac gratin was very good. service by matt was good as well. \n\nthe restaurant has a great ambiance and that's what makes this place. go, the food is decent and the view is unlike any other.", 
            "i went with robin l. so see her reviews for the cons.  like her, the waiter / food runner spilled water all over my place setting (pretty much the first thing that happened after we were seated) so everything within an arm's reach of me was wet.  but that aside, considering what i paid and what i got, i was definitely satisfied.  bf and i split the filet mignon with merlot butter reduction.. the steak also came with these crispy little steak fries that i didn't think i would like.. but they went really well with the sauce and the steak.  we also split some side dishes: french green beans and <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark>.  everything was really good.  our steak was a little more cooked than what we asked for; we got medium-well instead of medium.  but it was still good.  and of course, the green beens were cooked perfectly and the <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> was absolutely yummy.  we also ordered a bottle of bordeaux which, unfortunately, the waiter forgot about until after our steaks had arrived.. but no serious damage was done :)\n\nmy total share of the bill came to $40 (that's including tip).  not bad considering i had filet mignon, two sides, and a full glass of wine.  i'd definitely be willing to come back, especially on those trips to vegas when i can't afford to pay $80 at craftsteak ;)", 
            "if you like butter, cheese and more butter, this place is for you. while the set-up is cute (if not a bit too kitschy) and the service is very pleasant, the food tries to be french but just hits you with as much fat/grease/butter as possible. i'm always one for unhealthy food, but this was a bit much.\n\nstarters:\n-chicken liver mousse: good, flavorful, huge portion\n-french onion soup: the broth was good, but it was so hard to get a taste of what the soup was like with the huge glob of cheese on top of the soup. now, i love cheese, lactose-intolerant as i may be, but i had to scoop the last third of the cheese out bc it was just way too much.\n\ndinner:\n-roast chicken: this isn't the roast chicken of bouchon, that's for sure. it was good but a bit dry...and the vegetables were so completely soaked in oil, it was hard to figure out what you were eating.\n-skate: i love skate because it's such a nice, light fish...but again, i thouht i was eating a pound of butter mixed with some lemon and capers. the vegetable salad was a very nice accompaniment, though - very refreshing.\n-<mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark>: i make it a habit to order mac n cheese at nearly every restaurant i go to, if it's available. this version literally had a pound of cheese on top; i was confused on whether there were even any noodles in the dish. again, ended up scraping off 2/3 of the top cheese layer to even enjoy the dish.\n\ni think this restaurant has potential if they laid off the cheese/oil/butter and just let the food speak for itself. it's really not necessary to make america fatter than it already is!", 
            "i don't know what people's problem is, because i loved my dinner at mon ami gabi. a steak dinner on the strip, with a great view and reasonably priced. what more could you ask for? ok sure, the steak could be thicker, but it's perfectly cooked with delicious sauce and a huge side of perfectly thin, crispy frites! plus you can easily upgrade to a filet for a few dollars more. i was torn between having the french onion soup or the <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> on the side but i quickly decided on the macaroni. boy was i glad i did! the side is plenty for 2 to share and sooo delicious! plenty of creamy cheese sauce and crunchy breadcrumbs with parmesan! yum! they have a nice list of wines by the glass, i went with a spicy cote-du-rhone that complemented the steak perfectly.\npersonally, i think it's pretty hilarious that people are concerned that this is a tourist trap. i mean, hello! it's on the strip! isn't this whole street the glaring, glittering, bare-assed definition of a tourist trap? given everything surrounding it i think that this place is a gem and an exception to the  vegas rule of being over-the-top expensive and more glitz than substance.", 
            "delicious ... great atmosphere ... great service!!! the value? well, that's relative to what food costs in las vegas. i thought it was decent pricing for great food. we went for lunch on saturday of thanksgiving weekend. we did not have reservations. we were told the wait would be 15-30 mins but they buzzed us for a table within 5 mins. we were seated outside, near the sidewalk in the front, with a beautiful view of the bellagio fountains (we were able to watch 2 fountain shows while seated). they serve you a mini-baguette while waiting for your meal. i loved it, the hubby didn't love it as much as i did; then again, i'm a breadie. i had the french onion soup (perfect for the cold day we had - it's not something i'd recommend having in the middle of the day in summer). the gruy\\u00e8re cheese on top of the soup was yum! for an entr\\u00e9e i ordered the <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark>. it's not kraft mac-n-cheese. this is adult macaroni with cream, butter, and more gruy\\u00e8re! i shared this with the hubby who ordered the steak frites with the caramelized onioins and red wine sauce. i would've licked this sauce off the floor if the plate was dropped. it's that good! the frites were not pomme frites, which is what i was expecting. they were very small, thinly sliced french fries. blah when paired with the delicious steak. it needed a heartier side. the frites would've been perfect with a burger. we were not able to order dessert, as we were stuffed. i believe the bill was around $50 for all the food we got. also, we only had water (hangover nursing) and did not partake in the wine. the wine list was extensive and on a normal day, the wine would've been tested. this is the reason for the low food bill. will we be returning? yes!!! we will never go to vegas again without a stop at this lovely restaurant.\n\ni do recommend this for adults. i do not recommend this for children. even though they have a children menu, i think taking your kids will ruin the experience for the other adult patrons. take your kids to mcdonalds or the buffet. please do not take them to this restaurant!!! let's leave this place to being intimate and romantic.", 
            "we didn't have plans to dine at mon ami gabi on this night. we were gonna eat somewhere downtown, but it was scary and we headed back to paris. i ran back to the room to drop off our box of dunkin donuts, and my husband grabbed a table. the wait for the outdoor seats was 90 minutes, so he just nabbed a seat inside.\n\nour waiter was very sweet, making a few jokes after i finally showed up. the fresh, crusty bread came with this cherry tomato/corn salad thing that was delicious. i had the half chicken & frites, while the husband had the <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark>. my chicken was very herby, and the chicken skin (my favorite part) was nicely crisped. the husband loved the paillard. he got a side of <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark>, which he loved, but i wasn't that crazy about it. even our glasses of roy rogers tasted better than most places.\n\nmy only real gripe is that it was a little too dark inside. i know it was all about the ambiance, but i still wanted to see where i was cutting my chicken.\n\ngoing by all the reviews, it sounds like we'll have to try their breakfast.", 
            "while i was back in vegas for a conference a small group of us decided to drop by and grab a meal.  it was about 8 pm and it was packed and a long line of people waiting to get in.  the hostess told us it would be 1.5 to 2 hrs....wow!  we could get seated right away if we sat outside....but it was raining off/on, so we'd have to take a chance.  i walked outside and they have umbrellas, so we took a chance and chose to get seated immediately.\n\nluckily for us it didn't rain while we dined...ha!  i ordered:\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> - (w/butter, red wine reduction) $34.95\n<mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> - $6.95\n\n....to wash it down, we ordered a bottle of malbec for $58.\n\nwhile we waited for our food, it rained a little bit.  however, with the umbrellas and patio space heaters, we were comfortable and dry.  it was actually kind of cool to sit outside on the las vegas strip and watch the clouds pass overhead and rain on the city.  in the 20+ yrs i lived in vegas, i never had an experience like that.  having wine during the rainfall was even better.\n\nthe food came out after a while and my filet was cooked perfectly.  i ordered it medium-well with just a little \"pink\".  the red wine reduction was heavenly and smooth on the palate.  the mac gratin was rich and complimented the filet very well.\n\noverall, it was an awesome dining experience.  don't know if i can replicate the ambiance and scenario.  the waiter was super cool and handled the weather/packed restaurant situation very well.\n\nreturn factor - 100%", 
            "get the steak frites! \n\nit was the best thing i ate along with the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> which i thought was very bland. the steak frites was the perfect hearty meal for breakfast. go early and get a table outside so you can watch the people walking down the strip being drunk or take the walk of shame!", 
            "i'm gonna have to make my first yelp review on this place...\n\nwhat can i say?!  i'm really impressed by the food and portions mon ami gabi offers considering that it's a french restaurant with very reasonable prices.  i've been to vegas 7 times since the time i've turned 21, and have only tried out this place out earlier this month, but thank goodness i've finally taken the time to try it out.  i'm gonna have to make it a point that from every vegas trip on, i'm going to make every effort to come back here!\n\nwe had made a reservation via opentable for 8:15 and was slightly late, but they were accommodating and almost seated us immediately anyways.  server was attentive, and had recommended us the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> since it's the most popular so that was my dinner choice.  the other girls in our party had the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, steak bordelaise, and chicken grandmere, and we all shared the whipped cauliflower and <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> sides.\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> and filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> were both on point!  medium rare for the two of us and i could not get over how tender the meat was and how effortless it was to cut into it.  both were served with frites, which i obviously could not stop myself from also devouring considering how much i love potatoes/fries.  haha.\n\nsteak bordelaise on the other hand wasn't as impressive... comparatively to the filet mignons, but not bad for it's meat cut.\n\nchicken grandmere was also to die for.  i haven't had a chicken this good since beatrice inn in ny!!!  seriously so tender and juicy, was not dry at all.  would be my second choice if i wasn't much of a steak eater.\n\nwhipped cauliflower was the first i've had of it's kind, and was super nomsy!  was pretty much like mashed potatoes ... but more like super creamy mashed cauliflower.\n\n<mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> was also a meh... nothing spectacular to rave about.\n\nbut overall, i had a very pleasant time.  the decor and ambiance is quite romantic and perfect if you're looking to have a nice, classy dinner away from the rest of the crazy vegas life.  i'd love to eat here again and try eating outdoors with the beautiful view of the bellagio fountains!", 
            "another great dining experience at mon ami gabi. there were 2 of us and we decided to share everything.  we started with the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>, always a favorite.  we shared a full order of mussels and <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> (mac n cheese) and brussel sprouts.  the mussels were big and juicy, <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> is made with gruyere and was very yummy, brussel sprouts were made with bacon making them very flavorful.  i have been here many times and am never disappointed.", 
            "i made a reservation through open table for a family birthday party celebration. when we arrived i confirmed that they knew one of the people on our party was in a wheel chair.  i said it twice and the hostess barely acknowledged me and was more concerned with me getting our entire party into the tiny, packed entry way to prove all of us were there.  we proceeded to block traffic with the wheelchair so no one old get in or out which really didn't seem safe and made a number of people trying to leave angry.  the hostess, however did not seem to care.  \n\nonce we were seated i ordered specialty martini for $12.50 and while it tasted good it was very light on the alcohol.\n\nmy husband started the meal with the chilled apple and celery soup with creme freche and sprinkled dill.  it had a nice flavor and consistency. \n\nfor dinner my husband and i both ordered the filet.  i chose the merlot and butter sauce and he went with the creme freche.  both steaks were cooked nicely and were very tender.  i had the frites (fries) which were seasoned better than the steak in my opinion.  my husband had the <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> (mac and cheese).  we both agreed it was ok.  nothing bad about it just nothing spectacular.  other people in our party had hanger steaks, salmon and burgers.  overall, the salmon with green beans seemed to get the best reviews.  \n\nwe ended our meal with the chocolate torte with salted caramel ice cream.  the torte was bitter but the ice cream helped to cut the bitterness.  the ice cream was delicious. \n\nthe best part of our meal was our server.  he was very attentive and all of our food was prepared correctly.  he answered all of our questions and we never had an empty glass.\n\nall in all it was an ok experience, but for the price i'll definitely choose a different restaurant next time.", 
            "loved it! we came twice.\n\nbreakfast: good <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>, fluffy egg omelet & nice view if you sit in the indoor patio. \n\ndinner: awesome!!! we sat inside, it was very cozy with dim lighting.\n\nthey serve a warm baguette with creamed butter. for starters, we had the escargot. it was very good. my hubby had the soup special which was an oyster soup. it was amazing. it was creamy.. but not too much.. more like velvety. i had the duck leg confit & a side of fries for my meal. that was the best duck confit i've ever had in the u.s. the meat would just fall off the bone. my hubby had the <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark> & the <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> which he said were very good. the waitress recommended a white chocolate bread pudding. it was served warm with ice cream.. very good too. \n\nthis place has great food, great service, nice atmosphere and a reasonable price. our dinner bill with a glass of bordeaux was $95. \n\ndefinitely make a reservation (i used open table).", 
            "i had the most amazing meal at mon ami gabi with my girlfriends! our server (louis or #67) was amazing and ever so accommodating. imagine 4 girls with a million questions about the wines and menu?!?!? most servers would get really impatient, but not louis he took his time to answer our questions and make sure that we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. \n\ni had the escargot as a starter and the hanger steak with the <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark>. can i say that i am craving that meal again.. like right now. writing this review is making my mouth salivate like no other! every bite of that meal was to die for. everything was prepared perfectly and not a step was missed.\n\ni highly recommend this place and i totally recommend sitting out on the patio to watch the water show at the bellagio. its a total romantic place for you and your boo or a great place to have a fine dining experience with your girl girlfriends. \n\ncan't wait to visit vegas again and try their other menu items!!!!", 
            "to me this is just not worth the money given so many other great options on the strip. i have been here 4-5 times since it was one of my gf's favorite restaurants (it is one of the lettuce entertain you places if you are a rewards member with them). \n\nmost of the time i got steak frites. the cut of steak you get is pounded very thin and to my taste always overcooked- despite ordering medium rare it always comes grey throughout, so that is a pretty big deal breaker. the fries themselves are ok, they are the very thin style, and you do get an insane amount of them. the steak, however, should be the star of this meal and it just isn't.\n\nthe one time i didn't get steak i got  a scallop entree and this was much better than the steak- the scallops were seared well and came with a nice sauce- if you go i would highly recommend this over the steak. \n\nsome random other items i have had\n\nfrench onion soup- this is ok but honestly if you are accustomed to french onion soup at a steakhouse you probably won't like it- it is much more subtle than what we have come to expect from the dish in america\n\nescargots- very good but very garlic tasting, hopefully if you are getting this you aren't on a date.\n\nduck confit- this was pretty clumsily done and dissapointing\n\nwhipped cauliflower- this is actually pretty good- esp if you are trying to avoid potatoes for health reasons this is the side for you\n\n<mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark>- nothing special, best had elsewhere on the strip \n\n\n\nambiance- many people like sitting outside as you get a good view of people walking the strip and the bellagio fountains so if the weather is amenable i would recommend that.", 
            "we had lunch here with friends who were visiting. first, it was pricy...but expected, due to the strip location. the reason they get two stars is because the ambiance was lovely, service was just ok but the food quality was fairly lousy. the sangria was good as was the baguette they brought for appetizer. i ordered <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> (french restaurant, right? should be good). it was about 30 seconds from being burnt. it was so \"well-done\" the eggs were dried out. portion was very small considering it came with about six potato chips on the side for $14 or $15. my husband ordered <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark>. it was also dry and flavorless. he sent it back and ordered a hamburger, specified no raw onions! it was cooked to order but raw onion on it and no condiments! the waiter dropped it and ran. never came back to check on us. finally had to grab another employee to get new lettuce and tomatoes that were contaminated by the onion and some condiments. not in any hurry to go back.", 
            "this place was delightful! we went here for a late lunch and wanted to eat outside, and we barely had a 10minute wait. we ordered the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>,the <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. everything was delicious!! i wanted to go there again but my friend insisted on trying different places. i almost went there by myself when she left because it was so good. it is across from the bellagio fountain so besides people watching (which you can do anywhere in vegas) there was always a little fountain show going on. highly recommend!", 
            "i swear i thought this place was a korean restaurant, where some immigrants couldn't spell \"galbi\" correctly in english. heh, jokes on me now. i def didn't take french class back in school. anyways, went here for a birthday celebration. \n\nfresh baked free bread- 3 star. it was good, but i've had better. why couldn't they make this better considering that it's a french resto?\n\nbone-in rib-eye- 5 star. it was a tad tad tad bit overly seasoned (with salt) but it was cooked to perfection, with charring on the outside. i had mine medium rare, and it was delicious. the fries (think french fry chips) were okay. i wish they'd stick with regular pomme frites. the burnaise sauce was sooooo gooooooooooood. dip that meat in the sauce and it's a game changer! \n\n<mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> with pumpkin puree and brussel sprouts- 4 star. the scallops were ok. it was delicious, but scallops are scallops no matter where you go i guess, as long as it's cooked correctly. the standout is the brussel sprouts that were included. this is what brought the dish up from a 2 to a 4 star. \nthey were the best brussel sprouts i have ever had in my life. it was charred on the edges, and just enough crunch to make this pungent veggie go from nasty to \nfantabulous. you can order these as a side. \n\n<mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> (white wine and herbs) - 3 stars. i wish there was a bit more lemon or garlic flavor in the sauce. it was ok for me. i couldn't even taste the saffron (or maybe it wasn't even in it?) \n\n<mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark>- 3 star. this was good, but a very tiny portion as a side for $7.95. it wasn't spectacular or memorable, and i'd skip this next time. plus, it's carby...i just did you a huge favor. \n\nfree dessert for my bday- some eclair with ice cream. meh, but it was free. \n\nas strange as this may sound, i'd go back here just to eat the brussels sprouts. i'm drooling thinking of this veggie that normally smells like someone let out a huge fart and left it lingering for a hot minute. i have been \"de-traumatized\" via the mon ami gabi experience.", 
            "ahhh mon ami gabi. i'm a local and i enjoy going here. add this to my list of awesome patios. \n\nthe food is great. although most of the menu may be too fancy for some people's taste, there is steak so anyone could eat here. \n\nthe patio is gorgeous. right across las vegas blvd from the bellagio fountains, and lots of people to watch, being dead center on the strip. \n\nwe had: \n\n<mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark>: i think i just died and went to heaven. don't let the fancy shmanchy name disguise fool you. this is mac & cheese, but better than most out there. it's just classic noodles and cheese, but the crispy melted cheese on top and the mini shells really take this one to the next level. i consider myself a mac & cheese connoisseur, and this is an 8/10 on my mac & cheese scale. \n\ngarlic spinach: pretty good! i am a sucker for veggi side dishes so this one was decent. the garlic really showed up in the spinach even though saut\\u00e9ed spinach can overpower a lot of flavors. delish! \n\n22 oz rib-eye with herb butter and b\\u00e9arnaise sauce: i'm not a huge meat person, but my husband so is and he loved this. the ribeye is his favorite cut of meat and this one had so much flavor packed in. not just char and meat flavor. there was a lot of depth. texture wasn't bad either. and the frites are fantastic here. crispy and soft. \n\nthis place is a must if you are visiting or just looking to see the strip for the first time in a long time of living here.", 
            "finally got to try mon ami gabi last week and it did not disappoint.  called in to get reservations and had no problems with that.  got seated promptly and service was fantastic throughout the entire night.  \n\ni started with the onion soup which was pretty good. \nthe steak, although it was thin, was cooked medium rare and was delicious. sauce was nice and spicy. \n \nwe also split some sides: garlic spinach, whipped cauliflower, sauteed mushrooms, and the <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark>.  mushrooms were really good, everything else was ok, but not memorable. \n\noverall, all the food was great.  service was fantastic.  ambiance/atmosphere was nice, probably a nice date spot.", 
            "nice to sit outside and face the bellagio fountains. i had the <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> which was vegetarian and eggless. good service. the staff were able to determine what was vegetarian and eggless, but not much other than salads."

            "five stars for ambience and service! our party of 8 was seated on the patio, where we enjoyed a view of the bellagio fountains. the warm bread, nice wine selection, and desserts with attentive coffee service stood out for me. as a vegetarian i didn't have many options (at a steakhouse on the strip i didn't expect to) but the side dish brussels sprouts were incredible. the <mark>Vegetable Tagine</mark> was the sole vegetarian entr\\u00e9e option and while i enjoyed the flavors (preserved lemon with almonds, especially) i feel like it was too light to be a meal. i wish it had been a heartier tagine with chickpeas, served with rice. everyone else at our table loved their meal including my partner who is a foodie. i would absolutely come back for the sweet ambience alone though. a great pick for a memorable family or group meal. def get reservations and be sure to sit outside to get the full experience.",

            "we didn't have plans to dine at mon ami gabi on this night. we were gonna eat somewhere downtown, but it was scary and we headed back to paris. i ran back to the room to drop off our box of dunkin donuts, and my husband grabbed a table. the wait for the outdoor seats was 90 minutes, so he just nabbed a seat inside.\n\nour waiter was very sweet, making a few jokes after i finally showed up. the fresh, crusty bread came with this cherry tomato/corn salad thing that was delicious. i had the half chicken & frites, while the husband had the <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark>. my chicken was very herby, and the chicken skin (my favorite part) was nicely crisped. the husband loved the paillard. he got a side of <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark>, which he loved, but i wasn't that crazy about it. even our glasses of roy rogers tasted better than most places.\n\nmy only real gripe is that it was a little too dark inside. i know it was all about the ambiance, but i still wanted to see where i was cutting my chicken.\n\ngoing by all the reviews, it sounds like we'll have to try their breakfast.", 
            "i had heard great things about this place and finally decided to try it for my husband's birthday weekend. it was fantastic! we ate outside on the patio around 10pm on a friday night and it was still fairly busy. it was cold, like 40 degrees, but the patio had heaters everywhere and that made it comfortable enough to eat (with your coat on). it is arguably one of the best outdoor eating spaces on the strip. you can easily see the fountains of the bellagio shows and watching the people on the strip is always entertaining. in fact, next time my friends and i are going to play some people watching bingo while eating dinner here!\n\nwhile mon ami gabi could rely solely on its location, the food is actually quite delicious and the service was fantastic. my husband had the bone in rib-eye steak and it was cooked perfectly for him. the bearnaise sauce was lemony and a perfect compliment to the steak and a great dipping sauce for the frites. oh the frites! they don't look like much at first but they have the flavor of a fry with the crunch of a chip! a delicious pile of perfection. \n\ni had the <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark> with their mashed potatoes. the waiter suggested one of us try the mashed potatoes instead of both of us getting the frites and i was so thankful for that recommendation. the mashed potatoes were impeccable. i think i ate almost the entire pile before my husband got a bite. they were creamy and delicious and most likely overlooked since everyone raves about the frites. the chicken was also very good and served with fresh lemon and herbs. \n\noverall, we had a great experience. the service was some of the best that i have ever received, our server was funny and made helpful suggestions. the view was fantastic and the food was delicious and affordable by vegas standards. we will definitely be back!", 
            "the service was amazing, the decor was great as well as the view on the patio but the food did not meet my expectations. i was in a party of 7, and we came here for a late lunch. we did not have any reservations, but they were able to seat us within 5 minutes. \n\nour server offered us bread and whipped butter. the bread was really hard, but hot and the butter made everything taste better! my friend and i split a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> along with steak bordelaise and i was pretty much in disbelief when the salad came out. it's a very, very, very small serving for $10. it tasted fine, you can't go wrong with <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. when i got the steak bordelaise i was also disappointed. there was barely any color on the plate besides brown, and branch of some leaf they put on the plate. it did not look appetizing, nor was the steak good. it was hard and the only thing good about the dish was the caramelized onions. the fries weren't that amazing either. i really wish they would pair their steak frites up with veggies instead of just an enormous serving of fries. \n\nother people in our party ordered the natural <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark>, chicken broccoli and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark>, grilled salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>, a cheeseburger and chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>. the best dishes out of those would be the chicken, broccoli and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> along with the grilled salmon salad. \n\nnot sure if i would be back, i expected it the food to be a little better considering that it is a french restaurant with prices on the higher end, but it was a good experience.", 
            "i've ventured to mon ami gabi a handful of times- one of the few places that, as a local, i enjoy going to on the strip- & truly feel it's a place everyone should treat themselves to, at least once. when i go somewhere like, say, pf chang's, it's generally the same experience every time. each experience at mon ami has been a different vibe but all equally enjoyable. over the years, my g.f.'s & i have joked about playing hooky & meeting there for the afternoon. i'd recommend reservations, if possible; otherwise, depending on the day/time, anticipate a bit of a wait. i've never been disappointed by the fare. leading up to today's celebratory work lunch, i had my tastebuds set on the <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark> but made a last minute switch to the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. upon my 2nd or 3rd bite, i enthusiastically declared \"i don't even like meat but if it all tasted like this, i'd love it!\" there's a misconception that mon ami is \\u00fcber pricey but it's really not that much different than going to places like outback, cheesecake factory, (the previously mentioned) pf chang's, etc. the ambiance is spot-on, even when it's a packed saturday nite, & the service is consistent. a few items to take into consideration: warm brie cheese appetizer, mussels, <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark>, onion soup, quiche, warm chicken & <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> & flourless chocolate cake. go. eat. take in the moment. enjoy.",

            "many of the reviews rave about the outdoor seating and the view of bellagio's water. however, imho, coming at it from the foodie point of view, mon ami gabi was a disappointment. we had a lacklustre experience here. even though the restaurant was not full, the food took forever. the   baguette was warm and crusty, delicious. we also got the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> which was rich and decadent with garlic bread. the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> sat in a dish of tomato bisque, prefect for dipping. but that was all that was good. \nwe got the recommended <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark>, a pounded pan fried chicken breast sitting on a supposed basil aioli send with salad. first, the chicken was underseasoned. and the basil aioli was not what it was supposed to be. it was very bitter with only a slight hint of some herb. when we told or server that it was bitter, she reiterated what it was supposed to be and walked away. the salad had greens and pickled beets which were extremely sour. \ni got the recommended wild boar ragu cencioni pasta. the pasta was good and the ragu was ok. nothing to wrote home about and certainly not worth  the pricing.", 
            "the mussels were great. everything else was seriously substandard. the <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark> was so bad that two of us couldn't even finish it. way overpriced for the quality."

            "this review is long overdue.  i have a meal at mag every time i am in vegas, which is three times a year.  i have never had a disappointing meal here.  last night, before we went to see jubilee, we had dinner at mag.  i love the atrium room in the evening.  the lights are low, but not so low that you can't see anything.  and having the b fountains as a backdrop is perfect. \n\nservice at mag is top notch, very attentive without being intrusive.  i love to sit in server #100's section - he's great, kinda reminds me of chef robert ivrine.\n\nanyway, this time the order was:\n\nsteak bordelaise:  the steak was cooked to perfection topped with carmelized onions in a red wine sauce.  oh yeah.\nmag <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>:  just the right amount of dressing, fresh romaine and shavings of pecorino cheese.\n<mark>Trout Almondine</mark>:  seared to succulent goodness with just a crispness around the edges, covered with green beans.\nto start there was a celery, green apple slaw tossed in olive oil and the baguette with butter.\n\nwhat a wonderful meal, what a wonderful atmosphere in a wonderful city.\n\nthanks, mag!", 
            "without a doubt, one of the best in vegas! we had the filet with merlot butter, scallops, <mark>Trout Almondine</mark>, awesome, awesome, awesome! you really can't beat the view (patio view of the bellagio fountains), food, price for the quality of food on the strip, and romantic to boot!", 
            "absolutely love this place.  flew in on a friday afternoon and went in for a late lunch/early dinner right after check-in.  had great seating on the patio with amazing people watching.  had the <mark>Trout Almondine</mark> which was delicious.  we also shared an escargot appetizer that was amazing with their great loaf(s) of bread.  wonderful list of french wines to go with it all.  we plan to eat here every time we visit vegas!", 
            "our second time to mon ami gabi, our first visit was the day after we got married with a bunch of family members. on the patio on a lovely evening in march. it was great. my first time trying escargot and i'm a fan.\na group of friends decided to have dinner at mon ami gabi, knowing how good it was we couldn't resist. we made reservations, for 18 people, unfortunately they couldn't keep us all at the same table but the tables were near each other.\nour waitress, christin, was fantastic, she's been working there for 12 years so she knew exactly what to recommend for your taste.\nthe free loaves of bread are so good, not anything like the tasteless bread you get in real paris. flawlessly accompanied by butter and a carrot slaw to spread on your bread. the fish of the day was barramundi with pole beans over a light tomato sauce. it was cooked perfectly, with a nice crisp skin, seasoning was excellent on my fish as well as my vegetables. my husband ordered the chefs special of the day which was a prime rib roast with long beans and scalloped potatoes. he ate every morsel, the only thing i tasted were the potatoes, which i thought were a bit peppery for my taste. everyone else in our group seemed to love their food, some of the orders included <mark>Trout Almondine</mark>, steak, <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark>, <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, and onion soup just to name a few.\nfor dessert we ordered creme brulee to share, it was an enjoyable ending to our meal, light creamy vanilla custard with a nicely caramelized top layer. yum!", 
            "we had the onion soup, <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>, <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, <mark>Trout Almondine</mark> and fillet mignon with bearnaise sauce.  the onion soup is is definitely a must.  i always get the os when i go here.  the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> with garlic bread was a welcome treat.  it was unique and very flavorful.  the fillet was very good and enhanced with the bearnaise sauce.  the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> were very tasty and cooked just right.  the <mark>Trout Almondine</mark> was surprising very good.  not a bog trout fan but i tried it and really enjoyed it.  the service was perfect as we were well taken care of.  had a couple of drinks which were very good.  the patio area is really nice and perfect for couples.  a great place to share with someone special...", 
            "my wife, daughter and son-in-law recently made a road trip to las vegas from their home in palo alto. our lunch here was perhaps my best meal there, and it was also surprisingly affordable, at least by the standards of the vegas strip. the location is also great.\n\ni had the steak frites classique, which was superb, and well worth the 20-some dollars i paid for it. the steak was perfectly prepared (i ordered it medium rare), and was accompanied by a large mound of interesting and tasty french fries, fresh cut into ribbon shapes. (see my daughter adrienne m's review for photos.) i am informed that the fries taste very good cold the next day, like good potato chips. my wife had the lobster roll, which was her second choice (she had asked for the <mark>Trout Almondine</mark>, but was told after she ordered it that the trout had not made it to the restaurant yet that day). she was, however, very satisfied with her lobster roll, and was particularly pleased that it was served on a maine-style bun. my sil enjoyed his <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. my daughter wasn't wild about her chicken/brie/apple sandwich; she thought it had a sour taste. the bite she gave me did have a bit of a sour taste to it (probably from the apples), but i didn't mind it at all, although being a true carnivore i preferred my steak. \n\nthe meal was preceded by a fabulous crusty baguette, served with butter. this didn't last long with the four of us, but a request for a second was cheerfully and promptly satisfied (no extra charge).\n\nservice was also very good, prompt and courteous at all times.\n\nhighly recommended for an excellent and reasonably priced meal in a town where these two descriptions often contradict one another.", 
            "dined here recently after reading all the wonderful reviews of this restaurant. we made reservations for dinner which is recommended.  mon ami gabi has a very romantic atmosphere as well as great service.  the view from the patio where we were dined  was also great.  we saw the water show at the bellagio four times during our dinner.  unfortunately, our excitement dissipated more quickly than our food. started with escargot which required seasoning.  my wife ordered the <mark>Trout Almondine</mark> which she said was tasty but had numerous scales.  my steak frites was less than memorable. to be honest, the steak was cooked as requested, but did not warrant a return visit. the potatoes were so overcooked, i couldn't use a utensil to eat them. these are not major issues, but i do expect more for what i paid. won't be back!"

            "after a disappointing experience at onda the night before, we were hoping mon ami gabi would live up to our expectations and it certainly did! we had a great dinner and would definitely go back next time we are in vegas. we went with a group of 13 on a saturday night and had 6 pm reservations. our server was really nice and joked around with us. plus the fact that at the end of the night he was willing to do seperate checks and split it anyway we wanted was really cool of him.\n\nmy husband and i split the cheese plate for an appetizer...the st. andre triple cream was by far my favorite of the three cheeses on the plate.  the fleur de marquis was ok and the blue cheese was probably my least favorite.  for dinner, i just had the crab cake appetizer. the crab cake was full of jumbo lump crabmeat and did not have much filler at all...in short, it was delicious.  the only part about the crab cake appetizer i did not like was the celery root remoulade.  i didn't care for the flavor and didn't feel that it complimented the crabcake well at all.  my husband had the seared <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> which he graciously let me try.  they were awesome...cooked perfectly as opposed to the disgusting ones i had at onda the night before.  for dessert we had the chocolate mousse which was good and a perfect way to end the meal.\n\nmy only real negative is that if you have to use the restroom, you have to leave the restaurant and go around the corner back near the sports book to the bathroom there.", 
            "i really wanted more for a $60 meal.  the restaurant is beautiful but you expect that in the nice hotels in vegas.  service was also nice and very attentive.  the mixed drinks were pretty tasty also.\n\nnow to the main purpose of a restaurant...the food.  blah!  the french onion soup had so much cheese and almost no onion.  i don't think i can  express how much cheese....soooo much.  too much.  for my entree, i had the seared <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> with whipped cauliflower and spinach.  the scallops were still raw and cold in the center and although there was a nice sear on them, the outside was cold too.  the cauliflower was more runny than whipped and the spinach was just okay.\n\ni gave up at dessert. friends who did have dessert said it was good but nothing they couldn't have had somewhere else, cheaper.", 
            "the top 3 vegas french restaurants on my list are: alize, fleur de lys and mon ami gabi.\n\ni go to mon ami gabi at paris for dinner just as much as i go to taqueria canonita at venetian for lunch. alize and fleur de lys i've only been to once, because they're more of a very special occasion type establishment (i.e. valentine's day dinner/wedding rehearsal dinner)\n\nhere's what we always order:\nappetizers: country style pt, <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> & crab cake\nsalads: double duck leg confit salad &/ steak <mark>Petite Salad Maison</mark>\nsoup: <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>\nentrees: filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, seared <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> &/ skate\ndessert: can't go wrong, just order what you feel like\n\nand if the weather permits, ask for the outdoor seating in front of the bellagio dancing water fountain. i also suggest asking the waiter to make suggestions for the right wine to go with your meal.", 
            "this place is pretty awesome! great outdoor seating with great views of the bellagio water show.  \n\ni've been here for lunch and dinner.  the bread they serve you is warm and good.\n\nfor lunch, tried the sea <mark>Scallops Gratinees</mark> appetizer and this was soo awesome!! i could've ate the whole dish to myself.  tender <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> filled with tons of carmelized onions and the sauce complemented it soo well! i love the scallops that were more well done with a lil burnt cheese covered on top... yum!!\n\nalso tried the cheeseburger with brie, which was similar to any other burger.  the fries here were french style and super thin.  not my thing since the'yre wayy too oily.\n\nthe chicken and gruyere crepes were good.  the <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> it comes with is tiny though.  the dough is heavy, so i just ended up eating all the chicken inside, which was pretty tender.\n\nfrangria is just like sangria... nothing new here.\n\nfor dinner, the salmon & <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> was good.  decent salmon fillet.  orange and grapefruit pieces went well with the salad.\n\nthe french style steaks were awesome!! large portion cooked to order! \nthe steak bordelaise with onions and red wine sauce was soo good! the steak bearnaise was the same!  however, i wasn't as fond of this sauce.  \n\noverall, the food is great!  service was on and off.  the atmosphere was very nice, and the scenery was one of the best....  watching the bellagio water shows in a french inspired atmosphere, what more can u ask for!! :d", 
            "my overall experience was very good. for a vegas restaurant, these prices are really very reasonable. you can pay more for a steak at many of the generic steakhouses inside casinos, and the wine by the glass is really very reasonable at 7 or 8 bucks per glass for their more basic wines (i had both a sauv blanc and a glass of gsm and both were good and recently opened). \n\nas for the food:\ni started with the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> which were in a mussel cream sauce. outstanding, though perhaps a touch too much parmesan. that's not really a complaint though... just finding something to quibble about.\n \ni had their prime rib special which looking back on it was a mistake. the prime rib was fine though not outstanding and it was reasonable at 35 dollars. it was also too much food in the end when combined with my other dishes. \n\nthe others in my party had salmon (i didn't get the verdict), the new york strip (judged good and the shallots very good), the crab cakes (judged outstanding), the salmon salad (good), as well as the french and soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> (a apple and parsnip soup). \n\nfor dessert two of us had chocolate mousse. the mousse was exactly what you'd hope and expect. they topped it with dark chocolate crunchy things which are good, but unfortunately just put pink berry in mind for me because they have to be exactly the same thing. another person had the peach parfait and was a fan of it. \n\n---\nso i'd give this 4 stars. the food was very good, but not truly exceptional, which i think it needs to be at this price range to earn a 5. the service was very good, refills on water came swiftly, and the pacing was appropriate for a french restaurant (i.e. slow, but purposefully and not annoyingly so). \n\nof course, mention has to be made about the atmosphere. it's really nice. i asked for a table with a view of the belaggio fountain, and they made us wait about 15 minutes upon arriving, but they gave us a good table for it. it was very pleasant. \n\ni'd definitely suggest this restaurant. i think you could probably get a better meal if you stepped up a price category somewhat, but then you wouldn't have the nice sidewalk cafe feel.", 
            "i came here for lunch with my family.  i must say i really enjoyed this place.  i didn't expect to wait for seating midday saturday, but there was about a 20 minute wait.  we ended up getting a table on the outside patio with a straightshot view to the bellagio water fountain.  there were trees in our view, but we still got to experience 3 or 4 water shows.  \n\nbeyond the location and environment, the food was quite good.  the first thing to note is the bread.  fresh baguettes from the oven, properly made and served with a crisp crust and soft inside (baguettes aren't supposed to be rock hard).  we started with a dozen oysters (blue points, i think).  my parents have never had \"real\" raw oysters, having most of their experiences from ayce asian buffets.  they were very impressed at the freshness and quality of these oysters.  objectively, they were very fresh and tasty.  i couldn't figure out how a restaurant in the middle of the desert could have such a ready supply of fresh oysters, but nothing about the flavor or odor suggested that they weren't top notch quality.  for our main dish, our table had the <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>, <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>, roast beef sandwich, and the halibut.  just about everything was good, but i especially liked the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>.  large <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> adorned on a shrimp and fish crepe.\n\nall in all, it wasn't super pricey, the food was great, and the environment was fun and refreshing.  i would definitely return.", 
            "oh, mon ami gabi. so yummy. this place also holds a special place in my heart for two reasons: 1) it was when i started becoming a foodie and appreciating what i ate (i'll blame it on the escargots), and 2) the first time i went to vegas with my best friend and now-husband, we ate here and it was amazing.\n\ntwo of us arrived for a reservation for four (the other two were parking the car). even after being told that, we were led to a corner table with only one extra chair. the guy who took us over was in a suit, so i'm assuming he was one of the managers and not a regular server. he looked more than slightly annoyed and aloof when i reminded him that we were a party of four.\n\ndespite the spotty welcome, our server was attentive and we had a wonderful time (even saw some behind-the-scenes raging in the kitchen behind us, haha), we started off with their warm bread, french onion soup, lobster bisque, <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, and escargots. everything was delicious as expected, especially the french onion soup and the massive amount of cheese. mmm!\n\nfor entrees, i had the seared salmon. it had this lemon cream on it that was soooo good. it was cooked perfectly too; it melted in my mouth. i had a bite of my husband's grilled cheese with short ribs and kinda wished i had room for that as well, haha.\n\nour friends got a sandwich special and the trout, but i didn't have a bite so i can't comment.\n\ndessert was the profiteroles. we all said \"oh we'll just have a small bite\" when we ordered, but we absolutely devoured the thing when it came out.\n\nyes, it was a lot of food, but hey, it was new year's day and we were living it up. ;)", 
            "great environment. great food. great service! \n\nmy gf and i were running late so we extended our reservation and gladly they were able to do so. in the end, we were still very late (we had to walk from aria to take the tram from city center to get bellagio then walk over to paris).  for a sec, i thought we would have to wait in line for our table and then we would have to run to mgm to catch our show @ 930. but turns out, our table was still there and it was a pretty good spot (right next to the window). so we didn't have to sit outside and deal with heat, but at the same time we were able to see the fountains at bellagio. \n\nfood wise. we decided to go with seafood because we had enough of buffets and steaks. we ordered 3 dishes: <mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> (white wine and herbs), escargots, seared <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>. i must admit i was really impressed with the scallops and mussels. scallops and mussles were really fresh and tender. due to bad experiences with escargots, i have not had it for years until i came to mon ami gabi. and lets just say the escargot was not too bad. also, i believe the mussels came with fries, which tasted like chips. not bad. \n\ndinner was served quickly. service was great. we didn't need to rush for the show. we had more than enough time. we ended up having time to walk from paris to mgm. overall, this was a fantastic experience. my gf and i will be back on our next trip to vegas.....mon ami gabi.", 
            "i have always walked by mon ami gabi and always wanted to eat there. it has a great view of the bellagio fountains. this place has great food and service. 15 of my closest friends enjoyed a nice dinner here on a hot july day. the server was great. he was on top of everything. my friends and i shared our meals. we had the lemon-thyme seared salmon, prime rib, <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>, roast chicken & frites, steak bearnasie and seared <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>. the food was excellent. i would come back just to eat the oysters, it was so good! it also didnt hurt that i was with people i love most in my life.", 
            "great french bistro\n\nwhat i ate:\n- baguette: i usually dont mention the bread, but this bread was pretty amazing! came out warm with lovely butter and some type of corn orzo salad\n- <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> gratinee: very flavorful, but decided this was not the best way to eat scallops. the flavor of the scallops was covered by the sauce. although the sauce was amazing. i soaked up every bit with baguette\n- steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>: i was expecting a much more peppery and flavorful sauce. i ordered the steak rare, so that it was very tender. of course, amazing fries\n- skate: delicate and flavorful. the bite i had was delicoius\n- seared <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>: i should have ordered this as my app instead of the gratinee. perfectly cooked\n\npros:\n- reservations: they were so gracious and accommodating. we changed the reservation about five times before we got there, and then ended up needed to move to another table to fit in one more person. despite all the changes they were very willing to work with us\n- food: excellent french bistro food. everything i had was cooked well\n- service: attentive. constantly filling our wine glasses and water glasses\n\ncons:\n- outside bathroom: i guess this is just one of those vegas hotel restaurant things, but restrooms are always located outside. kind of a drag to have to walk a bit to get to the ladies room, especially if youre seated way inside the restaurant\n- price: definitely not cheap, but honestly, not that expensive either. it really depends on what you splurge on - if you get an app, if you get wine, it all adds up.... i got an app, an entree, and had two bottles (share them with three others) and got away with paying $70 - tax+tip included\n\nwould i go again? ... im not sure. while dinner was great, it wasnt crazy amazing. there are just so many other restaurants in vegas that i want to try. despite my caution about going again, i am still very glad i had dinner here.", 
            "delicious everything, great service, great setting and inside a hotel i'm very fond of. came for a nice dinner out with my mom while she was in town and i wanted to try mon ami gabi; it was definitely the right choice. our waiter was very attentive without being overbearing (that's hard to do since he came around often but was just so polite and not pushy at all). we had reservations for 8 pm and when we arrived had a 10 minute wait, so we went to the bar to grab drinks in that time. i had a bloody mary and my mom had a lemon drop martini (very good). we were seated just in front of the kitchen so there was a lot of traffic going by. in some restaurants i think it can be annoying but it didn't bother me here. everyone seems very professional, which is how it should be! a lot of people dress up but there are also others dressed casually, so whatever floats your boat, but they do have a no sleeveless shirts requirement for men.\n\ni had the french onion soup (yum), my mother had the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> which she absolutely loved (i don't really like or dislike pate so my opinion is void), and then we shared the hanger steak (the merlot butter was so delicious) and the seared <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>. i ordered the steak medium rare but would get medium next time since it was a little tough to cut. those are seriously the best scallops i've ever had, tasty and soooo tender. my mother also had 2 glasses of the sauvignon blanc which was very very smooth. what was refreshing to me was the music. it wasn't just piano instrumentals to fall asleep to, but they played a lot of norah jones mixed in with contemporary soft rock/pop songs. that might sound weird how i'm describing it but it was contemporary while still being appropriate for the setting.\n\nour total was just over $100 including drinks and tip which i completely think is worth it for fine dining without being stuffy and amazing food all around. we were too full for dessert but i'll definitely be back for that steak and to experiment with their specialty drinks menu. i'd also like to sit outside when the weather isn't too hot, it's fun to people watch!",

            "i have eaten here a couple of dozen times and they have without a doubt the best steaks in vegas for the price and other than a long wait to be seated i have never had a bad experience.  this past friday was no exception.  \nthe ambiance is great and we had a window seat view for the bellagio water show. our waiter was fast, professional and overall did a great job. \nthe fresh and hot french bread is served warm in a bag and we asked for an amuse-bouche of finely cut carrots( reminds me of the carrot salads i have had on the tgv trains in france) \nthe two of us shared the following: \nthe fris\\u00e9e & <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>, good not great.   \n the hors d'oeuvres of  <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> gratin\\u00e9es with  caramelized fennel and onion marmalade and mussel cream was off the charts. \n thefilet mignon with  merlot butter, red wine reduction  and thin ribbon cut pom frites delivered in spades, perfectly cooked and very tender, tons of flavor.   \nif you are staying at paris this place is a must try. they are generally very busy at night and service and seating can be challenging at times, especially patio seating in the summer months. they do have two small bars where you can eat a full meal off the menu, great for solo people on business travel.", 
            "i don't know what it is about this place. i always want to dine here when i'm in vegas. i have relatively no desire to dine at its sister restaurants in reston and bethesda. they pale in comparison to vegas. the service here is always phenomenal, the food stellar. they have a varied wine list, but their \"frangria\" (sangria) is what brings us here. yes, not the steaks. the sangria. most places either add too much wine (a rare instance but not necessarily a bad thing), too much fruit/juice, or water it down with ice. this french bistro chain gets it right, the perfect ratio with fresh sprigs of rosemary to give it that je ne sais quoi. they've raised the price of the sangria to $19, but it's still reasonably priced compared to wine by the glass or half-bottle.\n\nfor an appetizer, i ordered the roasted sweet potato soup. this is one of those entrees with a pretentious presentation, but mon ami gabi tones it down a touch. my server sets an average-sized bowl at the table and has a tea kettle that dispenses my soup. it's then garnished with a toasted orange meringue. my friend went simple and decided to get the handmade potato chips with dip. the chips were ridged, crispy and not greasy, and tasted great with my soup.\n\ntheir steaks are too thin for me, and i am not a fan of their steak frites. the filet mignon is good but i didn't want to spend too much on dinner, so i got the seared <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> with spinach, whipped cauliflower, and brown butter. four fat diver scallops, cooked to perfection, drizzled with brown butter and garnished with parsley. add some lemon juice and it was divine. my friend ordered beef bourguignon (slow braised in red wine, buttered noodles, bacon, mushrooms). she really couldn't taste the bacon but the beef was very tender. she is a big fan of short ribs so this dish was right up her alley.\n\nwe were too full to get dessert and later wandered into paris to gamble and i won $6 from the penny slots! we have never had an issue walking in without reservations but we generally go to dinner earlier in the night and we're just a party of two. i would recommend reservations for larger parties. all in all, a good night, and we'll certainly be back.", 
            "what is french for \"omg i would totally go back there, that place was so yummy\"...well, it slipped my mind. still. i loved this place. \n\nhaving never been before a girlfriend of mine and i decided to go here for dinner before seeing the nutcracker. we ate inside since it was cool out but the views of bellagio fountains was awesome! \n\nthe atmosphere was beautiful and very romantic. dimmed lights, fancy table settings, attentive wait staff. \n\nthe food was incredible as well. of course to start we had escargot (one each), yum! i had the seared <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> with whipped cauliflower. it was delicious. to end i had the creme brule. it was really tasty as well.  not to mention the sour dough bread and butter that came. the meal was really good.\n\ni would definitely go back here again....good food, good service, good view and good friends. (ok, the last one you will have to get your own on)\n\nj'adore! (french for love people)", 
            "mon ami gabi is a quaint french restaurant, located in paris resort and casino. it was a bit far from the center of the strip ~10 minutes walking. the decorum of the restaurant was very cute and resembles a modern cafe in france. casual and delicious! \n\nservice was ok in that there seemed to be no designated waiter per table so you had to flag one down to ask for the check. however, they did refill our glasses multiple times, so i can't complain. bottled or sparkling water are complimentary. \n\ni recommend coming for brunch, which is only offered on weekends. their lunch menu is very limiting but it is still possible to pick out some interesting and tasty dishes. if you have never had escargot, i would recommend trying it at mon ami gabi because it is not as slimy (which may seem revolting).\n\ni came here on weekday afternoon. we started with the <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> which is oven roasted snails cooked in garlic herb butter. i believe this is true, butter makes everything tastes good. ;) i like escargot and this dish made me like it more. if i had a larger group and a bigger appetite, i would have tried more dishes from their hors d'oeuvres because it truly gives you a taste of authentic french cuisine. i would recommend country style p\\u00e2t\\u00e9, chicken liver mousse, <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> gratin\\u00e9es  and <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> if you're feeling adventurous.\n\nfor lunch, their offerings are predominantly, sandwiches, crepes, salads and steak frites (which is essentially steak with thinly cut fries).\nfor brunch, i have heard good things about their french toast, pancakes, crepes and eggs benedicts. \n\nthe two of us ordered the croque madame and <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> for entrees. croque madame was fine but the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> was show-stopper. first of all, the crepe was buttery and thin, strewn over with a b\\u00e9chamel cream sauce. the shrimps and scallops were fresh, tender and sweet. and the combination of textures and flavors satiated my palate. definitely recommended!\n\noverall, i enjoyed mon ami gabi and will come back next time for their brunch. our check came out for ~$17 pp, which was reasonable compared to how much we ate. also, they provide complimentary, fresh-baked french baguettes. love!", 
            "one of the best places to eat in las vegas, mon ami gabi is the perfect restaurant whether its only you and your significant other, or a group of 8! i came here with a group of friends for my boyfriend's 30th birthday. we had made reservations ahead of time through their website and noted that we were celebrating his birthday and requested a table near the windows so that we would have a view of the bellagio fountains.\n\nwhen we got to the restaurant, we were seated immediately and got a wonderful table inside by the window and the view was amazing! on a side note, if the weather permits it, it is definitely worth it to wait for a table on the outside patio. the restaurant does not reserve these outdoor tables, so it is on a first-come-first-serve basis. but you can still request a table inside with a view.\n\nfresh french bread was brought with some creamed butter and a little bit of something that resembled a reddish pink coleslaw, but it was so tasty with the bread! i ordered a caraffe of the frangria (so delicious) and a bottle of perrier water for the table, and my boyfriend ordered a separate glass of wine. for appetizers, my boyfriend and i shared a <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>. our friends ordered a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and a french onion soup that had the cheesiest layer of cheese baked right on top!\n\ni ordered the steak classique rare. my boyfriend ordered the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, and our other friend ordered the beef bourguignon. one thing i noticed when they served the beef bourguignon was that the server kept the noodles and beef stew separate and spooned the stew on top of the noodles at our table. it looked and tasted so rich and beefy and stewy! everything looked fantastic! i have to admit that my steak was a little hard to cut and was chewy, but it was because i had ordered it rarer than usual. the finely cut pommes frites were also a perfect addition to my steak. at the end of it all, we decided to get dessert at another place just to explore more sweet options, but the waitress brought us a complimentary profiterole, a pastry that was filled with ice cream  and topped with a candle for my boyfriend! next time i am definitely staying after dinner for an artisan cheese platter or a cr\\u00e8me br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e\n\nmon ami gabi's prices were another big reason i chose to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday there. the prices are very fair for the quality of food, service, and experience you get and also low enough to not break the bank or feel guilty that one of your friends could only afford a glass of water. i will definitely be returning to mon ami gabi to celebrate my birthday!\n\nalthough the service was awesome, the view was phenomenal, and the food tasted great, we still had one gripe: being a very classic french bistro, there simply was not enough food on the plates for both my very american boyfriend and his friend. they ended up leaving and buying a hamburger right after dinner haha! so i recommend mon ami gabi if you and your date aren't too hungry, or with a group of girls. but if you're not into french restaurants with relatively smaller portions, head for the bellagio buffet across the street. : )", 
            "eating dinner at the mon ami gabi restaurant was one of the highlights of my vegas vacation.  the dinner prices were extremely affordable (especially considering the location and the pricing of other nearby restaurants) and the food was excellent.  each couple in our group had to pay $100, but this included 2 bottles of wine (approximately $64).  you can't really get much better bang for the buck on the las vegas strip.  i will say that the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> were perfectly cooked and my mouth is watering just thinking of it.  the escargot was also very tasty (although i am admittedly not an expert on that particular appetizer).  and of course, as you will see from other reviews, the views from the patio (where we ate) are spectacular.  not only do you get amazing views of the bellagio fountains, but you also get spectacular views of the heart of the vegas strip.  this would be an ideal place to bring a date or loved one, as the location is about as romantic as it gets.  it was a tad bit cold at night when we went, but the outside heaters helped a little (although if you sit near the street you will be outside the range of the heaters).  the one slight downside is that it did take a while for our food to come to our table, although to be fair they were jam packed.  highly recommended and i would definitely go back again on my next trip to vegas!", 
            "went to mon ami gabi for the first time to celebrate our wedding anniversary with friends. we booked the table on opentable.com a few days before with a note about the celebration. they dont care, not even a congratulatory message. got the table on the patio we requested, the view was awesome. bellagio is right across from the restaurant so we can even see the fountain while eating. the restaurant got really busy right around 7:45-8pm on a saturday night. \n\nwe ordered some frites, soup of the day, <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, pork chop, steelhead (their special that night).  however, there was something wrong with the server. he was not all quite there, twitching, blinking, stuttering, bumping into the backs of our chairs, etc. we received our frites and entrees not long after we placed the order; however, the soup never showed up. we asked the server about it and he was so confused. so we just cancelled the soup as we didn't want to wait.  \n\nfood was okay, nothing special. the frites and scallops were so salty even though they were cooked pretty well. the frites also looked and tasted like the scraps left at the bottom of the pan, brown, over fried crumbs.  the excessive amount of salt totally ruined the dishes. steelhead was tasty, but we realized that it's 28 bucks when we got the check. it's pretty costly compared to most of the entrees on the menu (average $19-$24). \n\ndefinitely not worth going back again for the food and service. for the view? maybe. how disappointing!", 
            "outdoor seating is great for people watching and seeing the bellagio fountains.  mon ami gabi was a family affair before seeing our show at the rio.  it was a great reminder of my recent trip to paris.  some of the food was just fantastic, but others lacked flavor.  \nas a party of five, we started off with a carafe of \"frangria,\" which was fantastic!  then had three different appetizers to share:  warm brie cheese, warm duck confit salad, and the <mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark>. two onion soups <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>.  then for our individual entrees we ordered:  frisee & <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>, steak classique, bone-in ribeye, <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, \"poisson <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>\" = sea bass w/ roasted corn couscous.  being so full, we still had room for dessert...(drum roll please)... bananas foster crepe.  \nin summary, here's what i would definitely get again and what items i would pass up.  \nfive stars:  frangria, <mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> (so memorable!), warm brie cheese--was finished off, but i personally didn't have any because i'm not a cheese person, frisee & <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> (yummy poached egg!), bone-in ribeye (perfectly cooked and juicy), <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, bananas fosters crepe\nfaaaaahget about it:  warm duck confit salad (supbar duck confit to the ones served in paris--lacked salt/flavor), onion soup (not impressive--didn't have a depth of flavor was was too sweet, plus the cheese wasn't gooey), steak classique (ehhh....least the fries were good)", 
            "i am very conflicted about this place...\n\nthe food was excellent.  our personal server was polite and helpful.  \n\nbut the host service was dreadful.  and because of that, i'm giving this place only 3 stars where it normally would earn 4 easy, maybe 5 on a good day.  \n\nnow let me explain...\n\nwe had made reservation for our friend's birthday dinner.  to me, when you make a reservation (especially at a fine dining restaurant like mon ami) there are certain expectations that come along with that.  first and foremost, you expect to be seated in a reasonable amount of time.  we sat down at 9:00 for an 8:30 reservation!  second, you expect the whole process to be relatively hassle-free...you give them your name and they seat at the table that is reserved for you.  but instead they handed up a pager and told us to wait.  when the pager went off they told us they could seat us outside (even though we requested indoor seating for the reservation) shortly or indoors in 5 minutes.  now for most restaurants, i would be a lot more understanding of the hardworking host staff.  but for a place like this, part of the price of the meal goes towards the service offered by the establishment.  i felt we did not get that value on the night we dined.   \n\nall venting and ranting aside, the ambiance, food, and waiter service were excellent.  i would recommend the warm brie cheese and the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> for hors d'oeuvres.  the bone-in ribeye is excellent, and strongly consider their specials.  our group tried their roasted orange duck and sea bass, both very good.  \n\nin closing, chances are, that if you go on any random night, you will have a perfectly pleasant dining experience, but don't be shocked if you find yourself frustrated waiting for your reservation.", 
            "everyone in your party must be present before you can be seated. luckily, they don't have some odd policy about showing up late for a reservation.\n\ni already liked the place as soon as i walked in... a candle at every table created a relatively peaceful environment as opposed to the noisy and busy las vegas lifestyle.\n\ni started off with soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> (soup of the day) which was chilled potato soup with bread crumbs. it did not suit my taste at all. i had 1/3 spoonful and that was the end of it. i feel terrible for wasting food like that, but i couldn't stand it, and i'm even a huge fan of potato-related food!\n\nfor my entree, i ordered <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, and i must say it was delicious. it was a plate of 5 or 6 pieces of baked scallops in veloute sauce, mushrooms, and asparagus. though the portion was quite small, i enjoyed every bite.\n\nunfortunately my friends didn't have a very wonderful time with their steak orders, two of which were steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> and bearnaise. on the bright side, those orders came with their signature hand-cut fries. and man oh man, those were crisp, chew, and addicting!\n\nalso, we had a pretty nice view of the bellagio fountain!",

            "i should probably point out that my trip to mon ami gabi was a bit atypical.  a lot of reviews noted how long the wait was to get a table, but the five of us were fortunate enough to get seated outside immediately.  while that might have been luck, i'm sure when we were there had something to do with it too - a monday morning in early february.  had we been there on a weekend during the summer or spring break instead, it would have been a very different story...and possibly a very different review.\n\nalthough nothing we had really amazed (except the baguettes...so good!), i thought the food was pretty solid overall (four stars is about right).  since my friend and i both wanted to try the sea scallop gratin\\u00e9es, we decided to share an order while i went with the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> for myself.\n\n- sea scallop gratin\\u00e9es (<mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> with caramelized fennel, onion marmalade, and mussel cream) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=mawqupejv5obmfbvs95eba) - the scallops were pretty standard, but i really liked the mussel cream, onion, and fennel.  despite how good it was, i'm not sure i would get it again since i feel like i can find something comparable in sf.\n- <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=uhua_eshqrfwewm6xz-kuq) - pretty damn tasty.  unlike others i've tried, there was a nice balance between the gruyere and cr\\u00e8me fraiche.  the corners of the bread were a little hard and dry, but it's a pretty minor quibble.  and the fries?  delicious.\n\nwhat made me give them five stars though were their baguettes (yes, that good...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=noliktr7ihc8b3ekajbwiq) and the service.  our waitress was terrific - accommodating, friendly, and checked on our table quite often.  what stood out though was how honest she was.  when i asked her about the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> (soup of the day - cream of garlic), she actually recommended i skip it since she thought it was pretty salty.  i passed as she suggested, but she was nice enough to bring out a espresso cup of the soup anyways so i could see for myself...and she was right.  not sure if many other servers would have done the same thing.\n\nconsidering it's the strip, the lunch prices seemed relatively fair, but i can't say if the same is true for their dinner menu.  still, the view alone might be worth the money.  with the bellagio right across the street, i imagine it's pretty awesome to watch their water shows while you eat.  that is, assuming it's on while you're there.  it wasn't for us...", 
            "i kinda feel bad for giving this place a 3-star rating, but here goes.\n\ni've wanted to try this place forever, and although i knew i should have come here for breakfast, it just wasn't happening with the party i was with.\n\nwe came here for dinner on a friday night, 7 pm.  we had reservations through open table, but really, it looked like you didn't need one.\n\nwe were seated in semi-outdoor area that was clear but protected from passerby, smoke, etc.  the view of the water show at the bellagio was great.\n\nbaguettes with a little bruschetta and butter came out.  the food was taking a bit long to come out, so thank goodness that was there.  our waiter wasn't exactly the most friendly person but at least went through the motions.  the south point for me was when one of the people in my party, a diabetic, asked that his frites be substituted with some green salad or something with his filet mignon.  the waiter told him he couldn't \"we don't do that\", and said he'd have to order a side of spinach or something on the side and kept saying that they'd charge for it.  nowhere on the menu did i see \"no substitutions,\" and if there is even a gluten-free menu, i'd expect they'd be a little more considerate in swapping fries for a few measley leaves.\n\nspeaking of measley leaves... another person in my party ordered a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> -- now, these salads aren't cheap -- about $17-$19, and it was honestly one of the smallest i had ever seen -- no crutons, either.  i got the seared ahi tuna salad, which was comparably small with only three pretty small pieces of kind of grey ahi tuna.  i've had this dish at other, less fancy places and got bigger and better tuna.  i didn't really eat a lot of the salad because it otherwise was just average in taste.\n\nto their credit, the chicken dishes, <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, pate mousse, and filet mignon seemed to be enjoyed by the rest of my party.  of course, everything was smothered in butter, seemingly.  also, the frites that came with many of the dishes were like shavings of fries and not really good, in my opinion.\n\ni'd come here again for the breakfast, but the dinner was pretty disappointing to me.  i guess we paid for the view.", 
            "well, with 1800+ reviews, i'm not sure if mine will make too much of an impact, but here goes! \n\nmy 4-star rating is in regards to their lunch-- i've never dined here for dinner, but i have heard good things about that as well.\n\nno matter the day, try to make reservations if at all possible, especially if you're planning on eating around 11:30-1:00. they have beautiful seating on the patio and in the \"bubble\" -- like an atrium, this area is covered by glass with great views of the strip. this is our favorite location to eat in the restaurant as i personally feel that service can suffer farther out on the patio.\n\ninto the food:\nappetizers: \ntheir <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> gratin\\u00e9es is a completely flawless dish-- tender scallops served in a sort of seashell presentation, topped with a carmelized onion marmalade, mussel cream, and carmelized fennel(?). while this normally would not appeal to me in the slightest, this is probably the dish i look forward to most when coming to mon ami gabi! these are downright delicious and should definitely not be passed up. i believe there are 3 in an order. \nfrench onion soup: my favorite of all time. nowhere else have i dined at has surpassed mag's french onion. i can't even describe it anymore without my mouth watering...a ton of sweet onions throughout is what i love most about this. i can't explain anymore without saying to just get this!!\n\nmain dish:\nwarm chicken & <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>: this is quite the item. the chicken is pounded flat and is incredibly tender. the brie is smooth and is a great mix with the green apple slices (also thin) and the spread of carmelized onions (notice the trend with the onions...ha! i love them.) i forget the bread it is on, but it's extremely soft and a perfect match. however, i could pass on their fries. they're so thin, they become crunchy, almost like chips. but, to each their own!\ni've had a few others, but this has been my favorite by far. \n\ndessert: \nwarm apple tatin: extremely french taste, presentation, etc...i was transported back to france just tasting this. it's difficult to explain this item, but it is a round crust (bottom and sides) and it has baked, carmelized apples in the middle. served with amaaaaazing whipped cream. worth every calorie!\n\nbottom line: one of the best places on the strip for lunch that is decently priced. give it a shot-- i bet you'll love it!", 
            "our second time to mon ami gabi, our first visit was the day after we got married with a bunch of family members. on the patio on a lovely evening in march. it was great. my first time trying escargot and i'm a fan.\na group of friends decided to have dinner at mon ami gabi, knowing how good it was we couldn't resist. we made reservations, for 18 people, unfortunately they couldn't keep us all at the same table but the tables were near each other.\nour waitress, christin, was fantastic, she's been working there for 12 years so she knew exactly what to recommend for your taste.\nthe free loaves of bread are so good, not anything like the tasteless bread you get in real paris. flawlessly accompanied by butter and a carrot slaw to spread on your bread. the fish of the day was barramundi with pole beans over a light tomato sauce. it was cooked perfectly, with a nice crisp skin, seasoning was excellent on my fish as well as my vegetables. my husband ordered the chefs special of the day which was a prime rib roast with long beans and scalloped potatoes. he ate every morsel, the only thing i tasted were the potatoes, which i thought were a bit peppery for my taste. everyone else in our group seemed to love their food, some of the orders included <mark>Trout Almondine</mark>, steak, <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark>, <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, and onion soup just to name a few.\nfor dessert we ordered creme brulee to share, it was an enjoyable ending to our meal, light creamy vanilla custard with a nicely caramelized top layer. yum!",

            "might be one of the best #foodielicious scallop dishes i have ever eaten in my lifetime. the scallops were cooked to perfection and served with vegetables that were co-stars in the show. i don't like peas, but the pea puree was incredible. i wanted to lick my plate! if you do anything or order anything...order and eat the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>. if i was in vegas right now i would go to dinner and eat the scallops.\n\nwhat made the scallops even better...the service was impeccable and the view was 5 stars! our server was assaouir and she knows her stuff. i ordered the scallops and she new the perfect wine to pair with the dish. she was so friendly and had excellent knowledge of the food and wine. \n\nand if the food quality and service is not good enough for you...go for the view! we sat on the patio and had a view of the strip sitting underneath the eiffel tower and across the street from the bellagio fountain show. every 10-15 minutes a new song and fountain show was entertaining us. \n\noh, and not to be forgotten is the fresh french baguettes that are served with delish butter. we also ordered dessert...this menu is top notch! the service was on par and the view is world class and classic vegas. but the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>...they were the star of the show! don't miss this place...it's worth every penny!", 
            "when i come to vegas, i always pay a visit to mon ami gabi. i make sure to make reservations, and even then there is often a small wait. this place has a beautiful view of the bellagio fountain show from the patio. the inside seating is more classy and formal. service is excellent. they even come around to scrape the bread crumbs off the table.\n\ni always order the filet mignon with red wine reduction sauce, which is one of the best i've eaten anywhere. it is so soft and melts in your mouth. it comes with a generous side of frites as well, which are pretty good, but nothing too special. my parents got the lobster tail, which was so fresh and sweet. their <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> appetizer is to die for as well.", 
            "i had their trout dinner and it was fantastic! their frangria (their version of sangria) is made with rosemary and wasn't to my liking (tasted like pine tree). their <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> were great too! i think it is a little bit on the expensive side for the amount of food that you get, but then again it is in a major casino on the strip. mon ami gabi is a great place, but it doesn't top my go-to restaurant, maggiano's, which is just down the strip at the fashion show mall.", 
            "i made reservations here out of convenience since i was staying at the paris hotel, and it definitely did not disappoint. \n\nwait - \nabout 5 minutes on a saturday night with reservations. there's a separate line that you wait in if you have reservations, but it moves very quickly. i made the reservations only 2 hours before.\n\nservice - (4/5)\npretty good. nothing particularly memorable. \n\nfood - (5/5)\nexcellent! their freshly made baguette was excellent, and a great starter (not to mention free)! i had their filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> steak frite, which was cooked to perfection at medium rare. at $31.95, it was definitely a good quality steak that was tender all throughout the meat. we also had the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> and the special salmon salad. my only qualm about the scallops is that it was small in portion, and definitely not filling as an entree in itself.\n\nprice - $$$ (including wine)\nfairly affordable considering the meal was less than $150 for 4 including three entrees and two glasses of wine.", 
            "my boyfriend treated me to a late lunch for my birthday. he wanted something different for me and i was fine with that. i'm rating based on my overall experience here. i'm really not picky about where i sit when i eat but i felt uncomfortable where we were placed. the table seemed right in the middle of an area where all the traffic flowed in. the waitress brought us our drinks (soda) and they turned out to be diet. she gladly exchanged them. for the prices listed in the menu i was expecting a bit more on my plate. i had the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, which came 4 pieces (25 dollars) total along with sliced red bell peppers. it looked as if it was missing something, the plate looked a bit bare to me. so i ordered a side of asparagus. the asparagus didn't come until the end of my meal only after i asked about them. my boyfriend got an amazing steak (27 dollars) made my meal look like a toddler's meal:) my meal, although small in size, was very delicious. i don't see myself ordering that dish in the future. i was expecting more overall and i felt disappointed...but it was my birthday so no complaints allowed at the table. :)", 
            "upon arrival at our reservation time we were immediately shown to a table in the inside area which is pretty dark and tends to be noisy. additionally it was located adjacent to a door (i think of the swinging type) with a serving cart occupying some of the table space. rather than sitting down i asked for another table. we were shown to a table in the atrium area (brighter and quieter) which while smaller was significantly better situated. it turned out to be very fine. both couples shared <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which were ample and very tasty. the baguette bread they make in house is wonderful and always served fresh and hot. for entrees we ordered two steak frites bordelaise, one hanger steak, and the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>. while the steak frites were good, the hanger steak my wife ordered was tastier. the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> my friend's wife ordered were very good and of course their signature hand cut fries are outstanding. my friend ordered the green beans but after the salad course was told they were out. he then ordered saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms which arrived halfway through the entr\\u00e9e. five minutes later they brought a second order of mushrooms. when we informed the waitress that we already had one order she took the second order back. i'm not sure who those belonged to or went to. they formerly offered a plate of three small profiteroles (cream puff pastry filled with vanilla ice cream and covered in warm chocolate sauce) for dessert but now it's a single grand profiterole which looks like a chocolate covered jumbo burger. we shared one and thought it was ok but i recall the smaller ones they formerly offered as being more tasty thanks to a softer puff. all in all a good meal at a reliable, fairly priced strip restaurant.", 
            "i've been to vegas so many times and walk by this place.... finally got to try it for late dinner with friends. have to say it was surprisingly pleasant. ambience was nice   dim lighting, excellent customer service, and delicious food. \neveryone raves how nice the patio seating is...i didn't get to dine on the patio . (too hot!) maybe on a cooler night. \nfood: we ordered a few appetizer... <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>, oysters, escargots.  all delicious and flavorful. main dish i ordered <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>. which i highly recommend. i did try my friends steak... it was tender and super tasty. finished off with house coffee... loved it. strong and sweet just how i like it  will definitely try this place again.", 
            "really good food and excellent service! the terrace is really nice. the location is perfect, with views to the bellagio fountains. we had the steaks with different sauces and they were all really good. the meat was cooked just like each one of us said they wanted it and the quality was really good. i had the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> which were amazingly tasty! the only thing we didnt like was that our table was right under the air conditioning and some of us were cold. we asked the waitress to turn it down but she couldnt and instead, she brought some blankets. totally recommendable!", 
            "always a gem to people watch and enjoy some amazing food on the heart of the strip. recommend the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> and a glass of wine :)", 
            "located at the paris hotel and casino.  we dropped in for a very late dinner.  this is a french bistro. when you enter from the strip, it's to the left.  inside the casino, it's called mon ami steakhouse.  that should have been a big clue.\n\nas it was late i wanted to eat light.  i ordered the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>.  big mistake.  it came and right away i could smell how fishy it was.  means not very fresh!  hubby ordered the wild boar with little rags of pasta.   we traded with each other as i didn't want to risk getting ill.  at this point it's like 10:30pm.  i didn't want to wait for another entree. \n\nour friend ordered the hangar steak.  a winner.  her hubby got the wild boar too.  yuck. chunks of wild boar with doughy pasta that stuck together.   shouldn't the boar meat be shredded?\n\nthey also got the cesar salad and the french onion soup,   they enjoyed both.\n\ni got the house merlot.  very good.  and they served a hot baguette in a paper bag.  like a french bakery. excellent bread.\n\nbottomline - i enjoyed my glass of wine and the bread. \n\nour server girard was funny too.", 
            "upon entering mon ami gabi, there were two lines - one with reservations and one without reservations. the hostess gave us the option to sit inside or outside. i liked how the restaurant had tall ceiling and big chandeliers. despite the two building alarms that went off during our dinner before the jersey boys show, the food was excellent. after sitting down for 10-15 minutes, there was a confusion who was our server since no one came to our table. \n\nafter we ordered, our server brought us a white paper bag with a warm baguette and a dish of butter. \n\nguest #1 ordered a lentil soup and endive and blue <mark>Warm Goat <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark></mark>. the lentil soup (soup of the day) consisted of lentil and herb pur\\u00e9e.  the endive and blue <mark>Warm Goat <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark></mark> consisted of endive, greens, blue cheese, warm bartlett pears, and toasted walnuts.\n\nguest #2 ordered an <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> and trout amandine. the french onion soup consisted of beef broth with onions, bread, and melted gruyere cheese served in a bowl over a dish with a paper dolly on it. the trout amandine consisted of a pan seared, crispy trout topped with brown butter and almonds. it was served with steamed green beans and a preserved lemon. he was surprised there was no additional sauce.    \n\nguest #3 ordered the grilled salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> which consisted of spinach, diced avocado, sun dried cranberries, and walnuts tossed in a citrus dressing.\n\nguest #4 ordered <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> which consisted of 4 tender, chewy, possibly a little rare <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> caramelized in maple syrup. it was served with broiled crispy brussels sprouts served over butternut squash pur\\u00e9e.\n\nguest #5 was quite adventurous when he was game for the <mark>Skate Wing</mark>. for those of you that don't know what a <mark>Skate Wing</mark> is, it's a fish belonging to the stingray family. it came with caper lemon spaetzle, roasted cauliflower and brown butter. it was the most delicious dish of the night.\n\nwe finished our meal with a creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e and a caramelized pineapple crepe. the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e was a vanilla flavored egg custard with a caramelized sugar coat. the caramelized pineapple crepe was a warm crepe with coconut cream on the inside. it was topped with caramelized pineapple  \nand drizzled with caramel sauce.", 
            "i swear i thought this place was a korean restaurant, where some immigrants couldn't spell \"galbi\" correctly in english. heh, jokes on me now. i def didn't take french class back in school. anyways, went here for a birthday celebration. \n\nfresh baked free bread- 3 star. it was good, but i've had better. why couldn't they make this better considering that it's a french resto?\n\nbone-in rib-eye- 5 star. it was a tad tad tad bit overly seasoned (with salt) but it was cooked to perfection, with charring on the outside. i had mine medium rare, and it was delicious. the fries (think french fry chips) were okay. i wish they'd stick with regular pomme frites. the burnaise sauce was sooooo gooooooooooood. dip that meat in the sauce and it's a game changer! \n\n<mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> with pumpkin puree and brussel sprouts- 4 star. the scallops were ok. it was delicious, but scallops are scallops no matter where you go i guess, as long as it's cooked correctly. the standout is the brussel sprouts that were included. this is what brought the dish up from a 2 to a 4 star. \nthey were the best brussel sprouts i have ever had in my life. it was charred on the edges, and just enough crunch to make this pungent veggie go from nasty to \nfantabulous. you can order these as a side. \n\n<mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> (white wine and herbs) - 3 stars. i wish there was a bit more lemon or garlic flavor in the sauce. it was ok for me. i couldn't even taste the saffron (or maybe it wasn't even in it?) \n\n<mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark>- 3 star. this was good, but a very tiny portion as a side for $7.95. it wasn't spectacular or memorable, and i'd skip this next time. plus, it's carby...i just did you a huge favor. \n\nfree dessert for my bday- some eclair with ice cream. meh, but it was free. \n\nas strange as this may sound, i'd go back here just to eat the brussels sprouts. i'm drooling thinking of this veggie that normally smells like someone let out a huge fart and left it lingering for a hot minute. i have been \"de-traumatized\" via the mon ami gabi experience.",

            "i seriously love this place.  while mon ami gabi is certainly not comprable to some of the bigger (and more expensive) names on the strip, it holds its own without breaking the bank.\n\ni dined here with my boyfriend a few months ago and we waited it out for an outdoor table (first come, first serve - regardless of reservations).  it was so worth the wait.  being able to watch the bellagio water show while dining on delicious food is quite an amazing experience.  \n\nmore recently, i took my work team here for dinner.  party of 12 required a credit card to hold the table.  oh, and they will not seat you unless your entire party is present.  good luck getting that many people to show up right on time.  several people were late, so we weren't seated on time as per our reservation, and our server seemed to retaliate by making us wait for our beverages and bread.  just kidding...he wasn't doing it on purpose. he was just slow.  like really slow and when people are hungry, ok service gets magnified to terrible service.  the 20min it took to get our bread was soon forgotten once the bread actually got to the table. fresh baguettes...yum.\n\nas far as main entrees, order a steak.  if you don't you will envy all of those around you who did.  since i ordered a steak on my last visit, i decided to go with the carmelized <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>.  they were cooked perfectly, but overseasoned for my tastebuds.  i asked for lemon wedges to cut some of the saltiness.  but, i don't think that will stop me from ordering it again some time in the future in hopes that the chef won't have such a heavy hand with the salt shaker.  \n\ntwo of my coworkers ordered the fish n chips and could not stop raving about how yummy their meals were.  but, my eyes were on all of the other plates...steaks, steaks and more steaks.  i stole some fries off their plates when they weren't looking.  so, next time you're in vegas and want a good meal, get a steak at mon ami gabi...and share your fries :)"

            "i love this place!! \n\ncontext: i was visiting my friend in vegas for a couple of days and she asked me what i wanted for dinner right before my flight out. my request was simple: \"somewhere outdoors with a view of the strip where we can chill, drink, eat some good food and people watch.\" surprisingly, there was only one place that fit my demands: mon ami gabi!\n\napprehensively we drove over to paris expecting a wait at the restaurant that would damper the plans but surprisingly most of the outdoor seating was available when we showed up at around 5:00 pm. we got a prime seat outside facing the bellagio. picture this: sangria, setting sun, water show, slight breeze with beautiful weather. ah...vegas - you gotta love it.\n\nwe ended up ordering the escargot (delicious) and the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> (kind of fishy flavored, a bit disappointing) to share. however, i gotta admit that the whole experience was not really about the food, more about the ridiculously relaxing and beautiful experience.\n\nso again i say: i love love love this place. usually when i'm in vegas i'm just too hungover and in pain and i'm so glad we stopped in at mon ami gabi to just stop for a second, chill, and experience the good life =)", 
            "we decided to eat here rather than at an equal to lower rated restaurant where the meal would cost 2-3x more. there are so many restaurants where it's easily $100/person, and who knows if it's really going to be worth it. coming from sf bay area we get plenty of good eats, and i hate forking out a ton of money for average food and a \"me too\" environment. \n\nthis place was oozing cuteness, and personality. like a vibrant french cafe.  the service was very good, attentive, helpful. the food was great.  we had the english pea soup special which was absolutely great, and i had the scallops, hubby had the <mark>Skate Wing</mark>. both were delish but the scallops were best. you get 5 huge scallops and lots of veggies for like $20. the quality of the food ingredients and freshness of the seafood was apparent, and it was such a good value. we each had 2 glasses of wine and were out of there for like $100 or so.  would definitely recommend this place for dinner (and i bet brunch would be great too!).", 
            "i was so excited to try the place because walking by the restaurant, the smell of the food wafting out of the restaurant smelled divine and i was craving fish. the atmosphere is quite cozy and chic. it is quite busy so service wasn't terrible but not as good as it could've been. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> and the <mark>Skate Wing</mark>. i had not had escargot in a really long time, so i had to try it but it was quite a disappointment. the garlic herb sauce for the escargot was extremely buttery to the point where i could feel the butter after wiping my mouth. definitely not appealing. and the escargot was a bit on the chewy side. when the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> arrived the aroma was intoxicating. the texture was very light (similar to a tilapia type fish) and the flavors wasn't too overwhelming. i was not a fan of the capers (a bit on the tart side which was a little off putting with the dish) that came with the fish. the chips (made in-house) were extremely de-lish! probably would buy a whole bag if i could.\n\nfor fish, this place is fantastic. great atmosphere. would definitely want to go back to try some other dishes as i'm a huge fan of french cuisine.", 
            "i ate here late night after an up night of gambling.  i ordered the following:\n\nfilet mignon\n<mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark>\n<mark>Skate Wing</mark>\nfrench onion soup\n\nthe steak didnt have much flava, even though it was cooked pretty nicely.  that means the meat was not aaaaa+, so veer away from that one.\n\nthe <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> was impressive.  it came with an entire lobster, oysters, shrimp, seaweed salad and tuna tartare.  the lobster doesn't come cracked, so prepare to get dirty.  this dish was $$$ but the lobster is def worth it.  my girl and her mommy loved the tuna tartare with big chunks of ahi and avo combo!\n\nsting ray you say?!  aye mateeeee!  def get this one.  the texture is like a more tender version of scallops.\n\nfrench onion soup.  this one was in alot of the reviews and it was good.  heavy on the cheese, and a hint of sweetness from the onions.  but $8 for a small bowl of soup?!  better get lucky from the tables games then.", 
            "wonderful food and splendid scenery. this was the best  meal i experienced while in las vegas.  i had the <mark>Skate Wing</mark>, and i can tell you it was perfect thanks to the garlic and lime in this dish.  it was so good i had to share it!  i also had the liver mousse which was delicious on toast.  the service was good and the view was great.  it was at the perfect time of the evening, at dusk when everything feels just right.  i watched the fountain show go off across the street and enjoyed a good date ;).  absolutely lovely evening here, i will definitely return.", 
            "right when we were seated we were given an apple and raddish starter, complimentary of the chef.  it was a nice palate cleanser and a surprisingly delightful gesture.  \n\nwe started with the butter lettuce and apple salad with beets and aged <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>.  then we shared the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with brioche and creme fraiche, and the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> with garlic potato chips.  everything tasted amazing!  \n\nwe sat on the patio directly across from the bellagio fountains and we loved the ambiance!  as cheesy as a fake parisian eiffel tower is, the restaurant has a really romantic vibe and we really enjoyed the ambiance.  \n\ntip:  the wait was an hour long for patio seating, so make reservations or be prepared to wait.  good thing the pager works anywhere inside the casino!", 
            "we dined here on a monday evening. i had made reservations through open table and requested a romantic table for our 20th anniversary. they sat us in a two top right in the window overlooking the casino. other than that, things went swimmingly. the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> in lemon and caper sauce was great even if the server didn't quite know how to describe it. the food came out amazingly fast, almost too fast. they did bring us a dessert for our anniversary which was nice. i would have liked to sit out on the patio, but it was raining. the inside of the restaurant is very pretty, but i would expect as much fro a richard melman property. i would go again.", 
            "fabulous and one of the highlights of our trip. we didn't have a reservation, but the wait wasn't too long (35 mins or so at 6:30pm) to be on the patio (which is the best place to be given the weather and people watching aspect). we had the french onion soup and warm brie to start - they were to die for!! for the main entree, we got the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> which was delicious. the only downfall was the steak bernaise - it was too finely \"pounded\" and thus no way for it to be cooked medium rare. it had no taste since it couldn't be cooked properly and our server agreed and had it taken off the bill. i would recommend the filet or any other cut of meat other than the hanger steaks that they offer. service was excellent and i will absolutely be back.", 
            "one of the best fancy schmancy values on the strip. any place with a \"great view of the bellagio fountains,\" whether it be a room, a restaurant, or the ledge in front of the bellagio fountains, brings 'em out. the first come, first served patio wait list is long and they overtly try to dissuade you from it, but as long as you're okay with plopping yourself in front of some slots or video poker to lose a bit of dough while you wait, it's just fine. and once you are seated...boy, that view! it's a wonder there aren't more strip restaurants out near the street like mon ami because the effect is great - the fountains, eiffel tower, and the flanking cosmopolitan and caesars make your seat in the middle of it all both intimate and grand.  \n\nthe service was excellent - we even had an authentic french waiter. the bistro fare menu and prices are completely reasonable given the location, and the food is delicious, from my perfectly cooked hanger steak to the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> i tried, the gentle wine selection (not bold enough to rock you but a solid complement to the food), and of course, the pre-dinner baguette. it's places like mon ami that really make las vegas a well-rounded vacation spot these days, at least for the foodies that want some wine with their sequined cheese. oh, and as date material, let's just say my panties would have been flying, if i'd worn any.", 
            "well my friend, this is a great place to dine at.  it was our last night in vegas and wanted to dine someplace where we could people watch on the strip.  so after trying to decide between 2 places we went with mon ami gabi.  since we didn't have reservation and we wanted to sit out on the patio the wait was over an hour.  \n\nwe were seated towards the corner and was soon greeted by our waiter scott.  he was all smiles kinda reminded me of marc anthony.  very friendly and helpful in trying to decide on what to order as he shared the recomendations.\n\nstarted off with some drinks and got 2 appetizers.  \n\nsea <mark>Scallops Gratinees</mark> ~ was broiled to yummygoodness i could have easily eaten 2 plated of these.  \n\n<mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> ~ cooked in white wine with slithers of garlic.  they were very good.  \n\nscallop potato and green beans that came with the prime rib was very addicting.  the scallop potatoes had a pretty good garlic flavor throughout it was really good. \n\nprime rib ~ this was one huge honker of a prime rib.  cooked perfectly to a medium rare.  it was juicy and tender.  mmmm meat!\n\n<mark>Skate Wing</mark> ~ one thing i always order when its on the menu.  if you have never had one its like the best of crab, lobster and fish.  its sooo damn good.  i could have eaten 2 of these things.  its very lightly pan fried and served with pureed cauliflower.  \n\nafter pigging out we needed to settle out tummy so as all reasonably sound person would do we ordered some cappuccino and dessert.\n\nbananas foster crepe ~ it wasn't like the bananas fosters you get in new orleans but it had the right flavor.  it was very good and with the tasty cup of cappuccino it was the perfect end to a great visit in vegas.\n\neyes ~ great place to people watch and catch the show of the bellagio fountains.\nnose ~ smelling like its gonna be a great dinner!\near ~ its a typical dinner time vibe!\nmouth ~ really tasty good stuff!\ntummy ~ everything was tasty good and was totally satisfied!", 
            "outstanding dinner last night with husbande and two teenage boys.  the french onion soup was great as were our steaks.  our boys really enjoyed the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer and i loved the the <mark>Skate Wing</mark>.\n\ngreat service too.  we waited about 20 minutes to sit inside around 9:00 p.m.", 
            "i came here sunday night, my last night in vegas. this was one of my \"affordable\" culinary trips and a good way to end my trip. \n\nthe meal began with a warm baguette brought to the table in a paper bag. soft and warm and very comforting. \n\ni ordered the cold pea soup as a starter. small chunks of vegetables, creme fraiche, swimming in a pool of a bright green pool of soup. simply delicious. \n\ni had the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> for my main dish. my biggest concern was if i'd spend the rest of the meal picking out bones between bites. crispy and brown on top and a nice flaky interior without the bones, seasoned with salt. it sat in a pur\\u00e9e of roasted cauliflower, which was creamy and almost had a potato-like quality.", 
            "3rd time was not a charm . . . . .\n\nfinished a conference in las, was nearby and needed lunch. have eaten midday in the past with good results.\n\ntable for 1? - greeted with dysfunction, a 40 minutes wait  and poor attitudes,, bypassed the greeters and i  went to sit in the bar and it was full, though surrounded by  lots of open tables?\n\nround 2 - seated when pressed with the situation, was that so hard?\nwaited, waited, waited, waited, waited,\n\nordered the <mark>Skate Wing</mark>, 20 minutes later oops, apologies that it was taken off the menu yesterday, when the chef didn't like the looks of the delivery. ordered the london broil sandwich of the day.\n\nround 3 - cold, poorly presented and clearly sat under the lights for too long. \nshould i complain or suck it up?  the ladies next to me were knee deep in arguing about their check and service . . . . \n\nconclusion - ate, paid, and left - probably won't return.", 
            "time to mainline some lovin' - yes, it was valentine's day. rather than wait for the patio as we had previously, we played it safe and secured an inside reservation. now, i know this won't happen every time, but i really think we got the best seats in the house, right up against the window at a perfect angle to take in the bellagio, cosmopolitan, and eiffel tower, basically as close to the outside as you could get, but keeping warm, too. i wish i could impart a trick but that's just what they gave us, and it really made our night.  \n\noh, the food. filet mignon was insane, and the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> was pretty great too. saved room for their fantastic white chocolate bread pudding, another indelible memory (photo attached).", 
            "we were able to get a seat on the patio right away on winter sat night. the heat lamp was good, though we got cold from time to time from the breeze. the server was excellent, and so was the food. we got the chicken liver mousse, which was good. the filet mignon was good as well, but our favorite was the <mark>Skate Wing</mark>, which was excellent! it melts in your mouth and has great flavor!", 
            "this was just ok for us. good service, but my <mark>Skate Wing</mark> fish was really dry and hubby's burger wasn't anything special. he really enjoyed the mac n cheese and i loved the frites, which were more like actual chips than fries.", 
            "our 2nd time here. we wanted to sit in the patio area, but the wait was just too long. anyway, we already had reservations and were seated within 15 minutes. once again, service was quick. note to server: it's ok to smile. \n\ni'm a little disappointed that they changed their drink menu - samuel smith oatmeal stout was no longer available dammit! the fresh loaf of bread with the accompanying carrot slaw was yummy! for the appetizer, we started off with the duck confit. skin on the duck was nice and crisp, and the meat literally fell off the bone. after reading mostly positive raves about the <mark>Skate Wing</mark>, i decided to go ahead and order it for my entree. great choice! it has a different texture than fish - probably a little more tender, (similar to scallops), but add the lemon-caper brown butter and the cauliflower pur\\u00e9e, and you have the perfect blend of 'just right'. took my time eating it and savored every bite. i will be ordering this dish again in the future! the wife order the salmon & leek quinoa. she said she liked the fish, but didn't really care for the rice. oh well, you should have stuck to your favorite dish veruka! for dessert, the server brought her a complementary profiterole, (since it was her birthday), along with her order of cr\\u00e8me br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e. i had the white chocolate bread pudding. the bread pudding wasn't as good as i remembered it to be last time. maybe it's because i had recently discovered the perfect home-made bread pudding (at my mom's house). we'll try again for patio seating after the summer crowd leaves, and definitely before it gets cold in vegas again.", 
            "had high hopes, perhaps that was the problem. \n\n- nice atmosphere\n- awful wines\n- sub par escargot\n- great steak with merlot reduction \n- <mark>Skate Wing</mark> (sting ray) was decent\n- trout was over salted\n- mussels were decent", 
            "we've eaten there more than once and french food isn't easy to find where we live. the fresh french bread is killer to start the meal. i'd order a bucket of mussels, escargots and <mark>Skate Wing</mark>. when was the last time you saw <mark>Skate Wing</mark> on a menu?\ngreat view, great service. my french place to go now.", 
            "i've never really been a fan of french food, but this is hands down my favorite french restaurant. i make sure to come here every time i'm in vegas.\n\ni've tried the beef wellington, <mark>Skate Wing</mark>, garlic spinach, bread pudding, lobster roll, cauliflower soup, <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>, and french toast. the complimentary bread and butter are so good, i can eat it for days. i thoroughly enjoyed most of the things i tried besides the beef wellington, <mark>Skate Wing</mark>, and french toast. the beef wellington and <mark>Skate Wing</mark> didn't suit my taste. i'm not a fan of the texture of <mark>Skate Wing</mark> and discovered i hate capers after trying this dish. as for the french toast, i felt like it was missing something.\n\nservice is very friendly and nice. this place is great for a romantic date or for a casual brunch. i'll be coming back very soon :d\n\np.s., the bread pudding is very heavy......so try sharing it with at least 3 people. the bf and i almost died trying to finish it.", 
            "my parents took my sister and i here for dinner before heading to the show across the street. we sat inside instead of out on the patio because it was a pretty chilly night. i had the <mark>Skate Wing</mark>. it was cooked so it was a little golden brown. i enjoyed the subtle crunch when i bit down. the chewy texture on the interior was interesting. not bad but not spectacular. next time i'll come with a date, order steak frites, and sit out on the patio to enjoy the fountain show.", 
            "upon entering mon ami gabi, there were two lines - one with reservations and one without reservations. the hostess gave us the option to sit inside or outside. i liked how the restaurant had tall ceiling and big chandeliers. despite the two building alarms that went off during our dinner before the jersey boys show, the food was excellent. after sitting down for 10-15 minutes, there was a confusion who was our server since no one came to our table. \n\nafter we ordered, our server brought us a white paper bag with a warm baguette and a dish of butter. \n\nguest #1 ordered a lentil soup and endive and blue <mark>Warm Goat <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark></mark>. the lentil soup (soup of the day) consisted of lentil and herb pur\\u00e9e.  the endive and blue <mark>Warm Goat <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark></mark> consisted of endive, greens, blue cheese, warm bartlett pears, and toasted walnuts.\n\nguest #2 ordered an <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> and trout amandine. the french onion soup consisted of beef broth with onions, bread, and melted gruyere cheese served in a bowl over a dish with a paper dolly on it. the trout amandine consisted of a pan seared, crispy trout topped with brown butter and almonds. it was served with steamed green beans and a preserved lemon. he was surprised there was no additional sauce.    \n\nguest #3 ordered the grilled salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> which consisted of spinach, diced avocado, sun dried cranberries, and walnuts tossed in a citrus dressing.\n\nguest #4 ordered <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> which consisted of 4 tender, chewy, possibly a little rare <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> caramelized in maple syrup. it was served with broiled crispy brussels sprouts served over butternut squash pur\\u00e9e.\n\nguest #5 was quite adventurous when he was game for the <mark>Skate Wing</mark>. for those of you that don't know what a <mark>Skate Wing</mark> is, it's a fish belonging to the stingray family. it came with caper lemon spaetzle, roasted cauliflower and brown butter. it was the most delicious dish of the night.\n\nwe finished our meal with a creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e and a caramelized pineapple crepe. the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e was a vanilla flavored egg custard with a caramelized sugar coat. the caramelized pineapple crepe was a warm crepe with coconut cream on the inside. it was topped with caramelized pineapple  \nand drizzled with caramel sauce.", 
            "okay this restaurant is spot on. the best escargot i have had in a very long time tender not rubbery nice garlic herb butter awesome. we also had the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> oh my stars this fish was cooked to perfection. the prices are in line to the strip. we got to sit on the patio and enjoyed the water show at the bellagio. service was spot on a little loud but we were sitting outside with the crowds and traffic going by. i may stop in to the bar this afternoon for another round of escargot.", 
            "really lackluster experience here. upon entering, we were met by bored employees chatting with each other. one finally noticed us and guided us to our table. seated, we were able to look around and check out the place. the place does the brasserie look pretty well, but is marred by music which has no relevance to the decor and menu.\n\nservice is just okay and the food was sloppily prepared. my <mark>Skate Wing</mark> was barely pan saut\\u00e9ed (basically white with very little browning) and just past raw. our salads were uninspired. \n\nwhile in the same category as bouchon, it is compares poorly in every way. head to the venetian and go with bouchon.", 
            "the food and the service was excellent.\n\nhad the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> which was cooked to perfection. and the hollandaise that it came with was just delish! \n\nmy mum had the lemon salmon and my dad the ragout, and they were both very delighted about their meals. \n\nwe were six people eating for 300usd including taxes and tips, which i found pretty fair considering the quality and the location.\n\nthe reason for not having five stars was the table we got which was put way too close into a corner so we felt kind of trapped.", 
            "by far the best meal we had during our 3 days in sin city!  mon ami gabi exceeded our expectations in every way possible.  since i knew that we would be making a trip to las vegas, i yelped the highest rated restaurants on the strip and mag came up in the top feed.  coincidentally, the other half decided to make a dinner reservation for us there.  it had to be fate.  \n\nhaving passed by mag a few times while walking on the strip, you truly get the vibe of a french bistro with the outdoor seating and decor.  once inside, it's quite romantic with dim lighting and charming ambiance.  we opted to sit inside since it was still upper 90 degree temperatures out on the patio.  they do have misters, but i think i prefer not to have my food misted.  inside was perfect as we had our table for two set up in a more private corner, but still able to see the outdoor patio.  our waiter, though professional, was a little dry in the beginning but warmed up a bit throughout service.  our food came out with perfect timing.  service was on point.  we were checked on periodically and our glasses were always filled.  \n\nbeing a sucker for any type of fresh baked bread, i pretty much ate the majority of the french baguette that was served with a carrot type slaw and butter.  i've never been to france before, so i'm not sure if they always serve their breads with this carrot slaw.  it reminded us of a ban mi and i suppose that's one way of french influence in vietnamese cuisine?  either way, that baguette was damn good and we had to refrain ourselves from having another when the waiter asked if we wanted more.  we didn't want to fill ourselves up with bread before dinner.  \n\nthe waiter was patient and let me try the pinot noir and cabernet from the rolling wine cart before settling on the bordeux ($11/glass).  they have an extensive wine list and lots of wonderful options listed as well as a fancy cocktail menu. \n\nthe cooking and execution at mag really shines.  everything we ordered that was perfectly prepared, had delicious flavors and nice presentation.  most impressive was that every single dish was a hit! \n-<mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> ($12.95/half order):  by far the best mussels we have ever had!  the mussels were tender and just cooked to perfection.  most times they are overcooked and somewhat chewy.  we thought we had the best mussels in ny's flex mussels but mag really impressed.  the herb wine sauce was also so good we used the remaining french bread to sop it all up.  for a half order, generous portion and a great appetizer to start with. \n-<mark>Skate Wing</mark> ($25.95):  being an adventurous eater, i wanted to give it a try since i've never had it before.  i must say, it was moist, tender and a flavorful white fish.  the way it was prepared was delicious - pan fried golden brown on the outside.  it was served on a bed of white asparagus and baby asparagus.  veggies were fresh and blanched just right.  i asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side since i normally think it's too thick and heavy.  however, the mag hollandaise was light and delicate (probably as it should be) and amazingly delicious!  best hollandaise vert we've ever had! \n-new york strip ($37.95):  wherever he goes, he must have his steak and frites.  the other half ordered it medium and it came out medium.  the steak was a good size and came with a huge pile or thinly hand cut fries.  i tried a piece of the steak and it was tender with simple flavors of garlic, salt and pepper.  the steak didn't even need the bordelaise sauce that it came with.  fries weren't too greasy or salty.  \n-classic profiteroles ($9.95):  my favorite dessert of all time!  not too many places serve profiteroles, so whenever i see them on the menu i must order, no matter how stuffed i am. mag profiteroles were also the best i've ever had.  they were decadent and sinful.  three large pastry puffs with a scoop of vanilla ice cream sandwiched between each puff with double dark chocolate fudge drizzled on top - i was in heaven!!!  highly highly recommend! \noverall one of the best meals i've had from start to finish in a very long time.  total tab was $135 for two.  very reasonable prices, great value, spectacular dining experience without being pretentious, nice wait staff, excellent cooking and very enjoyable food!", 
            "oh man, this was a great meal!  to start it off, we had a charismatic french server (i can't remember his name, sadly) who really made the service for us.  he gave us really prompt and attentive service that really made the night.\n\nthe food was excellent, too, especially given the price point.  vegas steakhouses can be some of the most expensive, but mon ami gabi offered us a delicious meal at a price that we couldn't refuse.  i ended up eating the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> which was deliciously flavorful.  the meat was extremely tender and flavorful.\n\nwould i come back here?  definitely!", 
            "the skinny: better for dinner than lunch or brunch (3), service: solid but nothing special (3), value: overpriced given the location but not a terrible spot for dinner and a view of the bellagio fountains (3).\n\nthe hubs and i come here every once in a while as a part of the lettuce entertain you club member. every year, they send birthday gift certificates and discounts off meals at their restaurants in town (el segundo, strip burger, joe's stone crab, mon ami gabi, eiffel tower restaurant) during the summer months.\n\nwe've used the coupon for breakfast, lunch and dinner. of the three meals, i give the edge to dinner in terms of value. first things first though - use opentable to make reservations. given the location and moderate strip price point (although kind of pricey still), mon ami gabi can be hopping depending on which day you decide to come.\n\nas always, they start you off with a warm baguette and whipped butter which you can definitely fill up on. they also serve a small amount of vegetable salad during dinner - once it was an apple/radish dish, another it was a carrot salad.\n\ni must admit, i am kind of boring when i come here to eat and rarely deviate from my routine. i am not usually this bad but this is because in terms of portion size (they tend to be skimpy on serving sizes here)/price point and yum factor, this dish is probably your best bet. i usually get the chicken grand-mere which is a half roasted cornish hen, sauteed mushrooms and lardons, with mashed potatoes for $23.95. the chicken skin a perfectly crispy while the meat is tender and moist. the mushrooms with lardons are a nice combination which goes well with the buttery mashed potatoes. standard fare but executed well.\n\nthe hubs will either usually get the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> or the special of the day which rotates based on the day of the week. the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> is truly delicious for $25.95 - if you haven't had it, you should try it.\n\nour last venture, he had the friday special which is dover sole lightly pan fried in butter with slightly wilted spinach and roasted potatoes. the dover sole was very good albeit areas were a bit over salted. the spinach was okay. the roasted potatoes were delicious and sported a nice crispy exterior.\n\nwe also came on a sunday where he ordered the beef wellington special. the beef wellington was okay in my books - the puff pastry didn't really hold up to the moisture of the meat and mushroom duxelle. as well, the meat was a bit overdone from what he had ordered (medium rare was made to medium... this is the tough part about ordering beef wellington).\n\nto be honest, we normally do not go for the steak frites mostly because i am not a fan of their frites (more of a potato chip texture than fries per se) and from the looks of other table's dishes, the portion sizes of the steak are small.\n\noverall, if you are coming for a view of the bellagio fountains, this is an inexpensive way to have dinner with a view at reasonable prices for the strip. the food is okay and portion sizes are a bit smaller than what you'd expect for the price. dinner is definitely more reasonable than lunch or breakfast in terms of value and execution.", 
            "my husband and i have eaten here many times and we are always greeted with smiling faces. we dined this past friday night and got a table on the rail ~ we love to people watch. \n\nour server was sean and he gave us good recommendations. we had the jumbo crab cake, escargot, <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, and for our entrees i had the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> and my husband had the filet. everything was delicious, service was impeccable, and we had a fabulous time. \n\na must go to when in vegas!", 
            "today we ate a late lunch at mon ami gabi, translated as \"my friend gabino\". we made a reservation for 2:15 pm, and due to traffic and backed up valet getting into paris hotel, we were running late. the resturant was very understanding and did seat us right away. while i would've preferred an outdoor seating area, it would've been a 35-45 minute wait. the resturant did seat us window side so we could still see the beautiful view of the bellagio fountains. i enjoyed our enthusiastic server, and food was delicious. i usually don't finish my food, but instead i licked the plate clean! my boyfriend had the ham and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> while i had the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> and french onion soup. everything was so flavorful and combination of food and ingredients went great together. my birthday ice cream cream puff was decadent! i should've saved room for the chocolate/ candy store, hexx next door, but our meal was worth it! i highly recommend this place and i look forward to coming back for brunch!", 
            "our friends from back east recommended this place and also to have stephanie as our server. well when we came to vegas last week we had a fabulous lunch and terrific service from stephane, who has a french accent that is real! she helped us with menu choices and was so warm and welcoming. we even got a hug upon leaving. the <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> is delicious, as was the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> and <mark>Skate Wing</mark>. ask for your fries well done and they are superb. great atmosphere and on our next trip to vegas, we will visit our new french friend stephanie! well done."

            "came here for a late night dinner after a memorable vegas show. although we made reservations it took them 10-15 min to set up our table and the front hostess has a bit of a snooty attitude towards us. we were seated by the outdoor balcony facing the bellagio, which had a nice view. the complimentary french bread was very good, it was crunchy and warm. we also had a small complimentary dish from the chef, some sort of shaved carrots with lemon juice and pepper. it was refreshing and has a bit of a ting to it. \n\ni started off with the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>, which was butternut squash/apple soup.  it was creamy and had a very distinct butternut squash flavor. for entree, since it was a \"french steakhouse,\" i ordered the steak roquefort with blue cheese sauce, it was the blue cheese sauce that caught my attention. the steak was a thin 1/4\" thick flank steak, i assumed, with a wad of blue cheese sauce and some frites. i was a bit disappointed in the steak as it was a bit chewy and the exterior was grainy. the cheese sauce was good but i really expect the steak itself to be way better. in addition i ordered a side of ratatouille. my friends ordered the new york strip steak, which i was told was good, maybe i just didn't ordered the right item. finally for dessert i ordered the sorbet, to be honest i really don't know what flavor it was, because when i ordered the waitress said it was blood orange, but it was nothing like blood orange, maybe i just heard it wrong. however, the sorbet was good and refreshing as you can imagine in the hot weather. \n\noverall, service was average, food was not as good as i expected, but the view was magnificent. i give 3 stars for the food and 4 stars for the view, that's 3.5 stars, but i will have to dock 0.5 stars for the snooty hostess.", 
            "i came to mon ami gabi for a sunday brunch. i knew it is gonna be busy, as it was the v-day + president's day weekend. i made reservation through opentable. but when i got there, i found out that reservation was only good for inside tables. outdoor table was walk-in only. well, we weren't too hungry and the wait was 15 - 30 min, so we waited. the tables were really packed, and they have a heater between every table which made it even more packed. people actually ducked under the heater to get to their seat, which could potentially light their hair on fire.\n\nthe waitress was pretty friendly and we didn't expect too much given they were busy. the bread that they served was warm and fresh out of the oven. we ordered a french onion soup and the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>, lobster bisque. they were both pretty good. lots of cheese in the onion soup and they poured the bisque from a pot at the table. then we had a bacon cheeseburger with bleu cheese and a fish and frites. they were delicious. the pommes frites side was one of the best. oh, i ordered a latte, and it smelled and tasted extremely well.\n\nthe ambiance, the food, and the service were not bad. it wasn't amazing, but i enjoyed it. it has a lot of potential. i might come back again for dinner. hopefully, they won't be as busy.\n\non a side note, there's the thing about people in vegas. they are rather pretentious and trashy. the table right next to us was really loud. the women have big blond hair, and one of the men wore a cowboy hat. guess where they're from. they were probably one of those people who would stand on the left side of an escalator. i could hear everything they said and i actually had to raise my voice so that my friend can hear me.", 
            "my overall experience was very good. for a vegas restaurant, these prices are really very reasonable. you can pay more for a steak at many of the generic steakhouses inside casinos, and the wine by the glass is really very reasonable at 7 or 8 bucks per glass for their more basic wines (i had both a sauv blanc and a glass of gsm and both were good and recently opened). \n\nas for the food:\ni started with the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> which were in a mussel cream sauce. outstanding, though perhaps a touch too much parmesan. that's not really a complaint though... just finding something to quibble about.\n \ni had their prime rib special which looking back on it was a mistake. the prime rib was fine though not outstanding and it was reasonable at 35 dollars. it was also too much food in the end when combined with my other dishes. \n\nthe others in my party had salmon (i didn't get the verdict), the new york strip (judged good and the shallots very good), the crab cakes (judged outstanding), the salmon salad (good), as well as the french and soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> (a apple and parsnip soup). \n\nfor dessert two of us had chocolate mousse. the mousse was exactly what you'd hope and expect. they topped it with dark chocolate crunchy things which are good, but unfortunately just put pink berry in mind for me because they have to be exactly the same thing. another person had the peach parfait and was a fan of it. \n\n---\nso i'd give this 4 stars. the food was very good, but not truly exceptional, which i think it needs to be at this price range to earn a 5. the service was very good, refills on water came swiftly, and the pacing was appropriate for a french restaurant (i.e. slow, but purposefully and not annoyingly so). \n\nof course, mention has to be made about the atmosphere. it's really nice. i asked for a table with a view of the belaggio fountain, and they made us wait about 15 minutes upon arriving, but they gave us a good table for it. it was very pleasant. \n\ni'd definitely suggest this restaurant. i think you could probably get a better meal if you stepped up a price category somewhat, but then you wouldn't have the nice sidewalk cafe feel.", 
            "don't let the fact that this place is inside the paris casino fool you.\n\nmy friend gabi, you were so delish.  paris casino has dropped from its prime, if it ever was on same level as the other major properties so you wouldn't expect the food at this place to be at such a high level.\n\nsince the wait was crazy long for outdoor seating, i opted for sitting inside which was fine because it reminded me of the autumn brunches and afternoons i had in paris, very traditional decor inside with dark rich colors.  the tables here just like in paris are crammed together.  the service was great, i had the plate <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>, which was a meatloaf sandwich, this is a classic french bistro so the bread they give you was incredible enough, and the bread for the sandwich did not disappoint either.  the meat in the sandwich was yummy, but it was rather petite, the fries that accompanied the sandwich was a disappoint though.  they were crispy but too thin for me, and this is a french bistro so why are you offering me ketchup?  i had to ask for mayo, and out comes this big-ass gravy boat of mayo, they didn't have any small sauces cups or something.  besides the size the mayo tasted like homemade, french people love mayo to the point that they will make their own, and this is not home-made.\n\noh i had a drink which was okay too, really decent price, good joint, make reservations (online or phone), sit outside unless it is sweltering and enjoy.", 
            "from looking at all the pictures on yelp, magr looked like a pretty casual  bistro feel eatery, but i guess at night it's oooh la la time! i made reservations for a group of 7 and we were seated within 15 minutes  at  round table in the corner.  it was the perfect spot!  when you look up, the celings are so high and the hanging lamps were very rustic looking! i loved that they sat us at a round table.  i hate when you have a large group and they seat you in a rectangle shaped table where you have to lean forward to talk or look at the person you are talking to.  \n\nfood:\nwe started with the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> which was too course for my palate.  we were deciding between the country or the mousse, but we all thought the mousse would be too moussey ( is that a word?).  the flavor was spot on, however i would of liked the texture a little smoother.  it was hard to spread on the break because, well it doesn't really spread!\n\nthe escargots were very tasty and even better when you ask for extra bread and dip it in the left over garlic pesto sauce.  \n\ni think we asked for bread 3 times, and i over heard our waiter say to another waiter, they want more bread???  haha. yes we like our french bread, is that a crime?  \n\ni ordered soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> which happened to be cream of garlic.  could this be a better match for me?  i happen to love garlic so of course i had to order the soup.  it was so good that my two friends sitting on either side of me kept dipping their bread in my bowl!  i was happy to share... they gave such a huge bowl!\n\nfor my entree i decided to go with the scallops gratin which was an appetizer, but by the time this arrived, i was already so full!  the scallops were very flavorful.  in every bite you can taste the caramelized onion, gruyere, parmesan, and garlic.  you however, don't really taste the scallops at all.  this is definitely an appetizer to share.  eating four of these bad boys will leave our mouth thirsty for water the whole night!  this is definitly my kinda dish as i love all these flavors, but maybe one would suffice! =p\n\ni tried a few of the other dishes, seared scallops ( it was very fishy and very scallopy.  i would give this dish 2 *.), steak with herbed butter ( the steak was kinda thin and tough 3*).  \n\noverall, the experience, ambiance, and food was pretty good.  i recommend this for those looking for a romantic restaurant at a good price ( sit outside and watch the bellagio fountain), or those with big groups looking to get a great value in vegas!\n\nfyi be careful of the paper covered table.  i got a huge paper cut from it!", 
            "mmmm...just looking at the pictures of the food we ordered still makes my tongue wag!\n\nfirst and foremost, i have got to thank all of the fellow yelpers for such an awesome find.  everything was absolutely delish!\n\nreservations is a must for this place regardless when you eat here because it's always crowded and the wait is super duper long.  i made my reservation 2 weeks prior to my trip to vegas for lunch at 12:30.  i have also requested outdoor patio seating but there's no guarantees with reservations, you would still have to wait.  the atrium room seating isn't bad at all.  on the afternoon that we went, it was crazy windy so trash was flying all over the place and onto people's food and into their cups. the atrium room is small but right up against the window behind the patio which if weather is permitting, you can definitely enjoy your food with the bellagio water show without the wind or trash blowing all over the place.\n\nthe service was impeccable.  our waitress was charming and had a great sense of humor.  she was super patient with us and accommodated us to the best that she can.  if we had questions, she answered honestly and didn't pressure us into ordering bad or pricey.\n\nfor our lunch, we ordered the french onion soup, soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> (parsnip and roasted garlic), porcini mushroom soup, sea <mark>Scallops Gratinees</mark>, steak frites with brandy peppercorn, sandwich <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> (open faced sandwich with sliced roast beef with micro greens and poached egg), and <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>.  all of the food we ordered was absolutely yumm.  there is no complaint here!  we also ordered from the wine cart they have.  it's a cart filled with a selection of red and whites and you can have a mini tasting from which ever wine is being offered.  our waitress was very generous with the pouring and for $8 per glass depending on the wine is well worth it.\n\nthis has definitely becoming a must for us everytime we play in vegas!", 
            "someone recommended mon ami gabi for dinner during my 24 hour trip to vegas, and to be honest, i was a bit skeptical of going to a chain (especially one a couple metro stops away from my home) during my glamorous vacay. still, after narrowing down what we wanted to eat, here we ended up. \n\nservice was fine, though i almost felt bad leaving the tip for the waiter when i felt like we saw the bus boy more. we were seated quickly (tuesday night), and there was a 45 minute wait for the patio. though it was one of the reasons i got the recommendation, we were way too hungry to wait (and we only had 24 hours in vegas people!!), but lucky to get a table right away just inside the patio. \n\nfood was good, and the portions were very generous. we were brought bread with butter and a little dish of carrot slaw--deeee-licious! we both ordered the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> which was a potato leek vichyssoise, also outstanding. i was a little surprised at the cut of my steak (i was expecting more of a sirloin type piece, but got what looked like hangar or skirt), but it was cooked well and the <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> sauce was flavorful. the frites were very thin and crispy to the point of not really tasting like potatoes anymore.\n\nback to the aforementioned patio: mon ami gabi is located in the paris casino, directly across the strip from the bellagio fountains, which makes it's patio so popular. since we had a window seat, though we couldn't hear the music, we could still see the fountains which made the dining experience very memorable. if you can't wait for the patio, definitely ask for a table inside it.", 
            "very good lunch place, great service, reasonably priced.\n\n<mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> - pretty fresh\nbaked mac & cheese - delicious, cheesy crispy top, hot gooey sauce\nsteak frites - my least favorite dish, the steak was very dry\nseared salmon w/orzo - very, very good.  cooked just enough to perfection.\n\nthe total came out to be about $90 with tax & 20% tip included.", 
            "i have always walked by mon ami gabi and always wanted to eat there. it has a great view of the bellagio fountains. this place has great food and service. 15 of my closest friends enjoyed a nice dinner here on a hot july day. the server was great. he was on top of everything. my friends and i shared our meals. we had the lemon-thyme seared salmon, prime rib, <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>, roast chicken & frites, steak bearnasie and seared <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>. the food was excellent. i would come back just to eat the oysters, it was so good! it also didnt hurt that i was with people i love most in my life.", 
            "another trip to vegas mean another stop at mon ami gabi. i just can't get enough of this place. the food was just as good as before, but the service was ehh this time around. i missed the waitress from before. our waiter this time around was here and there but no connection. \n\nas always, we had the french onion soup, a small salad, and the liver platter. the french onion soup was just how i remember it to be. hot and gooey from the melted cheese and warming with caramelized onions and the broth. the starter salad was just mixed greens with a light vinaigrette. simple yet tasty. the liver platter was a first and it did not disappoint. you get a generous slice of <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark>. it comes with sliced crusty french baguette and pickled mini onions and gherkins. it doesn't taste like <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> at all. it's very soft and creamy in texture. \n\nfor our group's entrees, we had the mussels that was steamed in white wine, burger <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>: open face duck burger stuffed with cheese, open faced ham and cheese sandwich, chicken and apple crepe, the ever so <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>, and scallops. the mussels was fresh and delicious. it was great with the baguettes to soak up all the sauce. the burger <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> was not up to par as before. it was really gamey and needed something to counter balance that taste. but it was good nonetheless, if you like gamey duck. the opened faced ham and cheese was just good. you get a lot of the gooey cheese if you love cheese. it had a comfort food feeling attached to it. the scallops was not as big as the previous visit and it seemed a little bit overcooked this time around. the apple crepe was gigantic. it's a mix of savory and sweet. the chicken the the sliced granny smith apples goes really well together along with the white alfredo sauce. it's definitely bigger than the normal crepes you can get at the crepe stand inside paris. the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> was just like the previous time, wonderfully eggy. \n\neverything was just soo yummy. i think we came in with high expectations from last time so we were a little bummed. it's still nice to see the water show from bellagio across the street every 15 minutes tho!  see you in a few months...", 
            "can i be lame and say i went to paris for brunch? i don't have to specify which paris i'm referring to ;). my girls and i were mad craving for breakfast food after a night of shenanigans we'd very much like to drown in some strong coffee and greasy eggs. it was between mon ami gabi or hash house a go go but we were still feeling pretty fancy so we chose mon ami instead.  prices are average for french brunch, anywhere between $8-$15 for an entree. i ordered the eggs benedict, one friend ordered the soup of the day, and the other two ordered blueberry french toast. it's well known the french love their food in modest portions so we went in very such expectations. color us surprised when our plates came out and the portions were not so modest. i'm fairly certain a french person would've scoffed at the sight but wow, for $14 i got 2 eggs benedicts and a huge hash brown (i was very delighted since i had been craving for hash browns all night). $11 gets you 3 huge pieces of blueberry french toast with house whipped cream. and i forget how much the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> was, guessing between $7-$9. everything came out very fast, which pleased us greatly since we were starving. food was excellent. the blueberry french toast was absolutely delicious, no need for syrup whatsoever. probably the best french toast i've ever had. needless to say, we couldn't finish the food completely. i don't think any of us anticipated how much we would be getting. regardless, it was a lovely experience overall. i'm sure they make their parisian forefathers very proud. \n\np.s. cannot begin to boast about the gorgeous view of the bellagio water fountains. brunch and a show!", 
            "i love random trips to las vegas and this is probably my 3rd one???\nanyways....came here with a friend for a late lunch since we were out the entire night before. we walked from the monte carlo to paris and i have to state that it was one of the best walks ever. :) i haven't really cavorted the strip like that and i felt i was young again...what am i saying, i'm not even that old!\nwe were seated within 3-5 minutes of getting into the restaurant. everyone has to wait in the bar area for a table. finally, our host took us to our table outdoors. the view is spectacular. just as we sat down, the fountain show at the bellagio commenced. it would've been the most ideal late lunch ever,  but it ended up raining and we has to take a booth inside. boo hiss argh.\nthe booths are comfy and it's dim inside, which makes the setting very romantic. there's the more lit area where i'd hang with my friends, then the outdoor patio if i wanted some air.\ni ordered the brie, green apple and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> which was not what i expected. i consider myself a huge brie and apple fanatic...but this one was bland...barely any chicken in my sandwich and it was dry! the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>, which was a cream mash potato mussel soup was delicious! i almost ate it all with the baguette they give you. the baguette was a little burnt at the bottom, but did not taste bad. i also ordered a bloody mary with extra horseradish...it was ok. best bloody mary i have had was at bear mountains hands down, but i'll try anything once.\nmy friend ordered the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> but instead they gave him a croque madame, which we didn't realize until the bill came out. at that moment he exclaimed why his meal didn't look right. it was missing the creamy sauce on top.\nall in all, i mayyy come back here to try their make your own bloody marys. as for the food, i was not impressed. we will see how the make your own bloody marys fare in feb 2011!", 
            "mon ami gabi is a quaint french restaurant, located in paris resort and casino. it was a bit far from the center of the strip ~10 minutes walking. the decorum of the restaurant was very cute and resembles a modern cafe in france. casual and delicious! \n\nservice was ok in that there seemed to be no designated waiter per table so you had to flag one down to ask for the check. however, they did refill our glasses multiple times, so i can't complain. bottled or sparkling water are complimentary. \n\ni recommend coming for brunch, which is only offered on weekends. their lunch menu is very limiting but it is still possible to pick out some interesting and tasty dishes. if you have never had escargot, i would recommend trying it at mon ami gabi because it is not as slimy (which may seem revolting).\n\ni came here on weekday afternoon. we started with the <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> which is oven roasted snails cooked in garlic herb butter. i believe this is true, butter makes everything tastes good. ;) i like escargot and this dish made me like it more. if i had a larger group and a bigger appetite, i would have tried more dishes from their hors d'oeuvres because it truly gives you a taste of authentic french cuisine. i would recommend country style p\\u00e2t\\u00e9, chicken liver mousse, <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> gratin\\u00e9es  and <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> if you're feeling adventurous.\n\nfor lunch, their offerings are predominantly, sandwiches, crepes, salads and steak frites (which is essentially steak with thinly cut fries).\nfor brunch, i have heard good things about their french toast, pancakes, crepes and eggs benedicts. \n\nthe two of us ordered the croque madame and <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> for entrees. croque madame was fine but the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> was show-stopper. first of all, the crepe was buttery and thin, strewn over with a b\\u00e9chamel cream sauce. the shrimps and scallops were fresh, tender and sweet. and the combination of textures and flavors satiated my palate. definitely recommended!\n\noverall, i enjoyed mon ami gabi and will come back next time for their brunch. our check came out for ~$17 pp, which was reasonable compared to how much we ate. also, they provide complimentary, fresh-baked french baguettes. love!", 
            "came here on a weekday night for dinner and it wasn't busy at all. it was pretty chilly so we chose to sit inside, window-side so we could still get a good view of the bellagio fountain. sadly the only view we had was of the street performer outside. you know, those creepy statue men that come to life??\n\nall the candles around the restaurant gives it a very romantic vibe. i felt out of place because everyone around us were, well, senior citizen status hahaha. \n\nwe ordered soups to start. i got the onion soup, which is like wow more please!! best french onion soup i've ever had in my life!! the portion was pretty generous, and it was half cheese (yay cheese! =] ). perfect flavor, perfect proportions of broth, onion, bread, and cheese. i could've had 10 of these! bf ordered the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>, which was some sort of creamy bisque type thing, maybe potato? his soup was good too, and he actually liked it more than mine. if this was a soup review, i'd give it 5 stars hands down!!\n\nfor entrees, we both got steak-frites. they were not satisfying at all. the steak was very thin and flat; we're not really fans of flat iron steaks. and they were cooked a little more than the medium-rare we ordered. i got the steak roquefort, which comes with a blue cheese sauce and fries. he got the steak bordelaise with its carmelized onions and red wine sauce. i preferred the onions and his sauce more than the blue cheese. the frites super thin, like onion straws. there was no potato substance at all, it tasted like pieces of fried..nothing? sad.\n\nlater that night, we had a 5 dollar steak which we enjoyed more than the 25 dollar steaks at mon ami gabi.", 
            "just getting around to writing a review for this great spot.   the view is spectacular from the patio (we always get patio seating here) and a great place to just sit and people watch.  \n\nmy husband and i dined here for about 3 hours just \"noshing\" on several different appetizers plus drinks.  this is a great way to spend the afternoon and everything we ordered was perfectly prepared and delicious.  we both had the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> which was lobster bisque. it was truly wonderful but we ordered a shot of sherry for the soup, which to our disappointment should have been in the soup to begin with.  not a big deal since everything else was over the top.\n\nwe went back for dinner and sat on the patio again.  and again, the food was memorable as was the ambience.\n\nmore recently 2 of my friends and i had lunch here and we all loved it so much we've decided to make this our favorite lunch spot.\n\none ordered the lemon thyme salmon.  she said it was the best salmon she'd ever had and i had to agree.  it was just a bit rare in the center which is what it's supposed to be and the lemon thyme flavor shone through.  \n\nthe other one ordered a steak, done medium rare and she said it was perfect.  i didn't taste the steak but she loved it.\n\ni ordered one of my favorite dishes trout grenoblaise.  wow.  it was absolutely fabulous.  the sides we ordered were shared and there wasn't a thing we could find to complain about here.\n\nservice was a little on the slow side but it was crowded and we were in no hurry.    if you want patio seating next to the railing you need to get there just before they open so you can be seated among the first.  it's worth it just to sit and watch the fountains and the throngs of people walking by.   take your time here.", 
            "outdoor seating is great for people watching and seeing the bellagio fountains.  mon ami gabi was a family affair before seeing our show at the rio.  it was a great reminder of my recent trip to paris.  some of the food was just fantastic, but others lacked flavor.  \nas a party of five, we started off with a carafe of \"frangria,\" which was fantastic!  then had three different appetizers to share:  warm brie cheese, warm duck confit salad, and the <mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark>. two onion soups <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>.  then for our individual entrees we ordered:  frisee & <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>, steak classique, bone-in ribeye, <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, \"poisson <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>\" = sea bass w/ roasted corn couscous.  being so full, we still had room for dessert...(drum roll please)... bananas foster crepe.  \nin summary, here's what i would definitely get again and what items i would pass up.  \nfive stars:  frangria, <mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> (so memorable!), warm brie cheese--was finished off, but i personally didn't have any because i'm not a cheese person, frisee & <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> (yummy poached egg!), bone-in ribeye (perfectly cooked and juicy), <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, bananas fosters crepe\nfaaaaahget about it:  warm duck confit salad (supbar duck confit to the ones served in paris--lacked salt/flavor), onion soup (not impressive--didn't have a depth of flavor was was too sweet, plus the cheese wasn't gooey), steak classique (ehhh....least the fries were good)", 
            "everyone in your party must be present before you can be seated. luckily, they don't have some odd policy about showing up late for a reservation.\n\ni already liked the place as soon as i walked in... a candle at every table created a relatively peaceful environment as opposed to the noisy and busy las vegas lifestyle.\n\ni started off with soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> (soup of the day) which was chilled potato soup with bread crumbs. it did not suit my taste at all. i had 1/3 spoonful and that was the end of it. i feel terrible for wasting food like that, but i couldn't stand it, and i'm even a huge fan of potato-related food!\n\nfor my entree, i ordered <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, and i must say it was delicious. it was a plate of 5 or 6 pieces of baked scallops in veloute sauce, mushrooms, and asparagus. though the portion was quite small, i enjoyed every bite.\n\nunfortunately my friends didn't have a very wonderful time with their steak orders, two of which were steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> and bearnaise. on the bright side, those orders came with their signature hand-cut fries. and man oh man, those were crisp, chew, and addicting!\n\nalso, we had a pretty nice view of the bellagio fountain!",

            "now this review is truly overdue.  i went to vegas months ago, but never got the chance to finish this review.  with a vegas trip possibly in the near future, i thought it pertinent i got this one out.    \n\nwith reservations placed online, we didn't have to wait.  located right in front of the paris casino, you can't miss it.  an exposed patio section displays itself to the strip.  i was in debate whether to have lunch or dinner here and since our schedule forced us to choose dinner.  dinner it was.  the lighting is dimly lit and has a romanticized atmosphere layered with a generally casual ambience.  \n\nlooking through the menu, bun and i had no idea what to order.  thank goodness, we had a hank azaria for our waiter.  it wasn't really him, but it really looked like him.  if you don't know who that is, he's most known for voice acting numerous characters on the simpsons such as chief wiggum and moe.  he played the french guy ben stiller's movie wife had an affair with in along came polly.  coincidentally in that movie, the scuba instructor he plays is french.  my eyeballs opened a little bigger in shock when the first words laced with his french accent popped out.  that waiter whose name i do not recall will be called hank for remainder of this review.    \n\nafter sifting through the entire menu, we both ended up choosing steaks with frites.  there seemed to be a crazy number of different choices of ways they prepared steaks that i had no clue what they were.  hank gave us a full detailed debriefing for each kind and how they were cooked.  i was certainly impressed.  he also gave us the option to make the steak a filet mignon instead.  that was a no brainer.  \n\nas our starters, bun ordered the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> which came in and was served out of a curiously interesting jug.  it was then poured onto the plate which had a little cream in the center.  i wanted to originally get a regular salad, but he convinced me to order the frisee and <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>.  hank said it was a very common salad in french cafes in france.  i guess i played sucker to that one and yielded to his request.  this salad had a poached egg, bacons slices, and caramelized onions.  he even showed me how you're supposed stir the egg evenly through the whole salad before eating it.  the salad was simply marvelous.  i sampled some of bun's soup and it had nice level of creaminess and was really good.   \n\nwhen our filet mignons came, my mouth instantly watered like homer simpson when he sees a donut.  it was tenderness on blast.  cooked to a nice medium rare as requested and served with a side of frites, it filled my stomach up to the brim.  i was really surprised considering the prices.  to not over exceed one's expectation, this wasn't $200 kobe beef.  that would be an unfair comparison.  yet this filet mignon was excellent enough with its simple design to easily deliver the same goal.       \n\nwhile holding our full stomachs, hank comes over to offer a dessert menu or some coffee.  i don't even remember responding back.  i think my stomach said something on the line of needing the bill so we can roll our full buttocks out.  obviously, by now one can tell my impression of their service was very gracious and cordial.  the food was more than just reasonable.  it was a good, unadulterated, affordable vegas meal.  a return visit is in the horizon.", 
            "great atmosphere, with terrific views of the strip nightlife and the bellagio fountains. the service was good, the melted <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer exquisite, and the garlic cream soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> wonderful. the entrees were mediocre, though, with my wife's trout amandine just okay with little flavor, and my steak frites a major disappointment. i was expecting true french steak frites, and this came nowhere close. my steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> was chewy and flavorless, and the fries were like bland potato chips, with none of the traditional french flavor found in a true french bistro.", 
            "i should probably point out that my trip to mon ami gabi was a bit atypical.  a lot of reviews noted how long the wait was to get a table, but the five of us were fortunate enough to get seated outside immediately.  while that might have been luck, i'm sure when we were there had something to do with it too - a monday morning in early february.  had we been there on a weekend during the summer or spring break instead, it would have been a very different story...and possibly a very different review.\n\nalthough nothing we had really amazed (except the baguettes...so good!), i thought the food was pretty solid overall (four stars is about right).  since my friend and i both wanted to try the sea scallop gratin\\u00e9es, we decided to share an order while i went with the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> for myself.\n\n- sea scallop gratin\\u00e9es (<mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> with caramelized fennel, onion marmalade, and mussel cream) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=mawqupejv5obmfbvs95eba) - the scallops were pretty standard, but i really liked the mussel cream, onion, and fennel.  despite how good it was, i'm not sure i would get it again since i feel like i can find something comparable in sf.\n- <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=uhua_eshqrfwewm6xz-kuq) - pretty damn tasty.  unlike others i've tried, there was a nice balance between the gruyere and cr\\u00e8me fraiche.  the corners of the bread were a little hard and dry, but it's a pretty minor quibble.  and the fries?  delicious.\n\nwhat made me give them five stars though were their baguettes (yes, that good...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=noliktr7ihc8b3ekajbwiq) and the service.  our waitress was terrific - accommodating, friendly, and checked on our table quite often.  what stood out though was how honest she was.  when i asked her about the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> (soup of the day - cream of garlic), she actually recommended i skip it since she thought it was pretty salty.  i passed as she suggested, but she was nice enough to bring out a espresso cup of the soup anyways so i could see for myself...and she was right.  not sure if many other servers would have done the same thing.\n\nconsidering it's the strip, the lunch prices seemed relatively fair, but i can't say if the same is true for their dinner menu.  still, the view alone might be worth the money.  with the bellagio right across the street, i imagine it's pretty awesome to watch their water shows while you eat.  that is, assuming it's on while you're there.  it wasn't for us...", 
            "we really enjoyed this restaurant.  the location speaks for itself (directly across the street from the bellagio fountains).  but the real surprise for me was the attentiveness of the service and the quality of the food.  \n\nwe arrived a little late for our reservation and the hostesses went out of their way to accommodate us even though the restaurant was packed.  we got lucky and were given a prime table on the patio.  this is really the way to go if you plan to dine at the mon ami gabi.  keep in mind that they take reservations for the inside of the restaurant but not for the patio.  most evenings you can expect to wait at least an hour and a half to get a table on the patio.  if you have time to kill (or get lucky like we did), this is well worth it.  it's like dining on a street corner in paris with an incredible water show every 15 minutes.  if you want to stick w/ a reserved time, the interior decor is very refined w/ dark woods and classic french accents.\n\nsteak and frittes are the plat <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> and our meal was served hot, perfectly cooked and delicious.  the blue cheese version was mouth wateringly good.  steak was pounded thin, but even so, our medium rare request was met.\n\nour server was friendly and enthusiastic without being overbearing.  she made the experience even better.  \n\nprices are surprisingly reasonable considering vegas' notoriously inflated menu costs.\n\nenjoy!", 
            "my dear, dear sweet friend gabi you never disappoint!  we typically visit mon ami at least once during any given trip las vegas but this time we were drawn in four times in three days.  yup...twice in one day.  do your hear me?  out of maybe seven meals, four were consumed in this great establishment.  \n\nit's located in paris and we were staying there so the convenience factor played in a little bit but we truly love it.  the mussels are phenomenal.  escargot is out of this world...get extra bread to sop up all that parsley garlic butter.  the breakfast cheeseburger did not disappoint.  salmon platter was just right.  <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> also a winner.  <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> were oysters...not the biggest fan but fine.  steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> was, again, just right.  \n\nservers are extremely professional and courteous.  they are well versed about wine selections.  \n\nplease, do yourself a favor...visit mon ami next time you're in \"paris\"!",

            "i went to my first french restaurant in seattle, and though it was a cute little place, it was very uncomfortable for me. however, mon ami gabi was so much fun! the menu was unique and the \"frangria\" was so enticing that i have a whole new outlook on french food. though it is a french steakhouse, i had their sandwich <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> (sp) which is the sandwich of the day and it was amazing! bacon, egg, this interesting spread, on delicious bread, with a side of their very unique french fries. best brunch/lunch sandwich. so filling! they had a ham and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> i was eyeing but when the waiting deliciously described the sandwich of the day, i just melted. it was perfect. \n\nthen their frangria was their version of sangria and it had fruit and rosemary! rosemary gave it a very one of a kind way! i was in heaven. \n\ni am very happy with this trip for a friends birthday and i would like to come back to try their dinner menu! \n\nohh also a plus, they sell kronenbourg 1664, which is one of my favorite beers of all time. \n\nthank you for the awesome service as well mon ami gabi. it was a great experience.", 
            "booked a reservation here for 7:30 on a thursday night and was surprised we still had to wait in line... nonetheless - it moved fairly quickly and we were seated with a cozy table on the inside corner of the main dining room.  \n\nmy date and i ordered the warm brie for an appetizer and though he bit into a large (sexy) piece of garlic on first bite, we both agreed that the flavor was incredible.  i greedily slurped down the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> - a carrot/ginger combination that went down like baby food - and ordered the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> for my main course.  to die for.  the meat was cooked to order and i was only saddened that i couldn't finish because i was so full!  he had the ny strip prepared with carmelized onion and red wine sauce - and it too was amazing.  both meats were served with the best hand-cut frites i've ever tasted... both crunchy and soft, flavored and oh so yummy... i'd go back just for those.  \n\nwe shared a bottle of cotes du rhone and skipped dessert because we'd made reservations upstairs for pistachio souffle at the eiffel. \n\nexcellent meal.  romantic night setting.  could have been the company, but i'd definitely return.", 
            "this is my go to place for the last 12 years, consistent with their dishes and amazing wine selection.for my large groups of 150 or more to my family dinners consisting of 6 ppl, the food tastes exactly the same. great prices for a strip restaurant. must have appitizer <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark>, and steak bordelaise is my favorite. when it's a diet free day i'll ask for roquefort sauce for my pomme frittes. best dish on their plats <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> is the beef wellington.

            "yelps 365 review challenge 2014 - los angeles #24 - #365\n\nif you want to experience french cuisine in a romantic or casual setting, than, \"mon ami gabi\" is the perfect choice for you. this restaurant is located across from the eiffel tower ride in the casino and along the vegas strip where you can watch the bellagio fountains from the outdoor patio. everything here was exquisite, from the staff, restaurant decor and of course the french food!\n\ni came here on a variety of occasions; wedding receptions, birthdays, family and friends. every time i dine at mon ami gabi, it always works out to perfection and it's hard to fault on anything except for the wait, but that's minor. \n\nsome of the items i've ordered in mon ami gabi:\n\n+<mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> - $15.95\n+<mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> - $13.95\n+<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> - $9.95\n+<mark>Caesar Salad</mark> - $11.95\n+filet mignon - $35.95\n+<mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> burger - $13.95\n\neverything here was delicious and the service was 5 stars all the way. if any of my friends of family were visiting las vegas for the first time, than mon ami gabi would be on my, \"must do list!\" especially the patio seating because it offers some of the best views of the center strip and it can be hard to get a table there. \n\ntip: book a table in advance!\n\nbon appetite!!", 
            "i wanted to love this place and i was excited to go here because half my group had gone before and they were looking forward to going back. by the end of the meal, there were very mixed reviews.\n\nservice: 3.5 stars (found ourselves waiting around a lot for service to show up again)\n\nsoup: 4 stars (good, but not standout, carrot soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>)\n\nentree: 2.5 stars. i got the scallops and they were so, so salty, the mushrooms were bitter, and the squash puree was overly sweet. couldn't finish it. i woke up at 5am to swollen fingers and desperate thirst. \n\ni had some of my cousin's wafer thin frites, and they were delicious! \n\nthey get bonus points for having a gluten free menu and serving what we suspect is udi's gf bread by request (with warm olives!).\n\ni won't be back but hopefully this will help you decide if you want to go!", 
            "i'm sure my rating won't contribute much to the huge pool of reviews this fancy pants french bistro has amassed over the years...but i don't give a french. \n\ni came for lunch, although i intended to drop by in the evening because everyone raves about the spectacular views of the bellagio fountains show across the street. however, time did not permit so i decided that i would come for the food, not the views. don't get me wrong, if you sit in the patio during the daytime, there is still plenty of pretty scenery for you. it's just easy to imagine how much better the views are during the night. \n\nanyway, onto the food! my partner and i opted for two sandwiches: maine lobster roll and the sandwich <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> (sandwich of the day). quick tip: <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> are served with mon ami gabi's renowned hand-cut frites, while cold sandwiches are served with gaufrette potato chips (aka waffle fries). these are less acclaimed but still great.\n\nthe maine lobster roll is served on a toasted brioche roll, accompanied with a side of red cabbage salad. if y'all did your research, you would know that maine (and northern new england) generally serves their lobster meat cold. thus, our lobster roll was served with the gaufrette potato chips. i was expecting the hand-cut frites. it's no biggie though because i'm an equal opportunity fried potatoes consumer. these waffle fries were crisp and tasty. i didn't like the lobster roll because it was too buttery and rich for me but my boyfriend had no trouble devouring it. the roll was also smaller than i expected--hence, less lobster meat than what i anticipated. \n\nour sandwich <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>, on the other hand, was sensational! it was a seared ahi tuna sandwich served on a baguette with hand-cut frites. the ahi tuna was delicately seared on the outside, and left rare in the middle. it had a velvety texture. the mayo sauce contained a bit of zest and a lot of flavor. the baguette was hard but also packed a crunch. now to the famous frites! i understand why they're famous: perfectly thin-cut slivers of potatoes and lightly seasoned with salt. these babies were fried to a beautiful golden brown. \n\nthe patio seats are highly touted so the restaurant doesn't accept reservations for outdoor seating; they're on a first-come, first-served basis. yes, the views are lovely but don't forget about the dishes! it's definitely one of the best meals i've had in vegas. service was all right. prices are on the higher end but totally worth it--whether you're there for the view or the food.", 
            "escargot sweet delicious little slimy snails soaked in pesto and oil, a great start to any french meal. they have duck on tuesdays for their plate <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>. ordered the steak with carmelized onions and fries that areborderline chips and ordered<mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>. for the price this place was reasonable and it's french food! the location is perfect right across the street from the bellagio fountains", 
            "delicious food!!! i cant say enough, everything was amazing, we ordered the <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> and the classic steak as our main courses. the oysters were so flavorful and just writing about them makes my mouth water, the same can be said about the steak which melted like butter with every bite! the food was paired with wines and the seating that we had was on the balcony overlooking the bellagio fountain. all in all it was a wonderful night.", 
            "very good!! steak frites, the meat was very tender and juicy. the <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>...oh my, they where fresh and delicious although you only get 6. our table was facing the bellagio fountains. amazing view. on the expensive side.", 
            "love that i made a reservation about 20 minutes before arriving and got seated right away.. i love how they walked us to our seat into a bright room with a view of the bellagio fountain. we came in for my wifes birthday for lunch and was really excited to come here. i really dont have too much to say bout how good this place was because it was just a mediocre experience so lets get to what we ordered.\n\nfresh baked french bread (really good had 2 loafs there and 1 to take home)\nhousmade <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> (least favorite)\n<mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>\n<mark>Scallops Gratinees</mark> (favorite)\nsteak frites roquefort (really good)\ncaramel creme brulee (great dessert)\n\ni really could have done without the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> because it totally changed the whole dining experience if you know what i mean. the prices here really make you think thats affordable but the portions dont support it. its a spot for the tourists for sure. i like the steak frites but since i eat steak so much and know it was just flap steak served with some fries i know that they were just playing it safe which is fine. i wouldnt mind eating here again but i know now that i should stick to certain things maybe my next experience would bump them up to a confident 4star rating. thank you for the food."

            "mon ami gabi is a wonderful bistro/steak house located in the paris hotel and we do not leave vegas until we dine here. sit outside and dine al fresco, you will have a wonderful view of the bellagio fountains and it's fun to people watch. it's a bistro, you can dress casual and no one will judge you.\n\nthere is an excellent wine list, of course! the st. aubyn pinot is lovely. the service is courteous and prompt to see to your needs and you will not feel at all rushed. there are great cocktails on the menu, i tend to go straight for the wine, though.\n\ni like to start with the <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>, the 'french onion soup', you can taste so many layers of flavor and the cheese is melted on top, just starting to get that golden crust. yum. i will have to make a point of trying other things on the menu, i can't seem to get past the steak bordelaise with it's lovely wine sauce and the soft, sweet, caramelized onions, or the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, always with frites, bien sur. excellent steaks, i'm almost speechless...but not quite, there's still dessert! (and no, i'm not sharing, get your own!).\n\nthe creme brulee is excruciatingly delicious, it hurts so bad...the bananas foster crepes are tender and delicious and absolutely decadent. the chocolate mousse is pure decadence!\n\ni can't wait until our next trip, hopefully i can update this review...and add another dish to my list. sigh...lovely...", 
            "the sad french bread and butter that they serve did not cut it for the price of this place. my steak bordelaise was over cooked. some of my asparagus was old and dry. the macaroni <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> was pretty good and the location is perfect for the bellagio water show, but all that still does not deserve any more than 3 stars.", 
            "the top 3 vegas french restaurants on my list are: alize, fleur de lys and mon ami gabi.\n\ni go to mon ami gabi at paris for dinner just as much as i go to taqueria canonita at venetian for lunch. alize and fleur de lys i've only been to once, because they're more of a very special occasion type establishment (i.e. valentine's day dinner/wedding rehearsal dinner)\n\nhere's what we always order:\nappetizers: country style pt, <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> & crab cake\nsalads: double duck leg confit salad &/ steak <mark>Petite Salad Maison</mark>\nsoup: <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>\nentrees: filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, seared <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> &/ skate\ndessert: can't go wrong, just order what you feel like\n\nand if the weather permits, ask for the outdoor seating in front of the bellagio dancing water fountain. i also suggest asking the waiter to make suggestions for the right wine to go with your meal.", 
            "i love the french. \n\nwent here for dinner before the o show at the bellagio. we were late for our reservations but no problem - we were still seated right away. \n\nloved the atmosphere of the restaurant. dimly lit with dark decor. totally reminded me of being in a french bistro (and yes, i have been in a real french bistro in france). \n\nstarted off with the <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> which was tasty and ooey gooey cheesy. i liked how they had slices of baguette with the crust still on which gave it great texture and flavor. i have to admit though that it was a tad salty for my liking but i finished it anyway. \n\nfor our entree, i got the filet with merlot butter and red wine reduction and the fiance got the trout grenobloise. i got my filet cooked medium and when i got it, it was perfectly cooked. juicy and fork tender. it literally melted in my mouth. i didn't get to try my fiance's trout however it was a rather large portion and he was very content with his rich and savory dish. \n\ni also have to a say that service was superb. they were quite attentive with our drinks with always refilling our glasses when the were getting empty. also our soup came out in no time and our entrees were also presented to us before we finished our soup. our waiter was gracious enough to take our entrees back to the kitchen to say warm until we finished our soup. \n\ndining at mon ami gabi was a fantastic experience. loved every minute and bite that i had. i surely will eat here again on my next trip!", 
            "not a bad choice i made for dinner, if i do say so myself.  directly across from the fountains at the bellagio,  inside the paris casino, it's about as european as you can get in vegas.  it's dark, romantic, and seductive, the waitstaff (or at least our waiter) has excellent manners, and the busboys refill your water regularly, and the prices are very reasonable for the level of service and quality.  an excellent, well-organized, french-style restaurant.  they made a little boo-boo on my girlfriend's order, but from my standpoint it was just about perfect.  oh, and betty h. just reminded me of how they put a mini baguette right on the table in the bag - a classy touch, and fresh, tasty bread to boot, with your choice of whipped butter or whipped carrots.  i chose . . . both.\n\nyou might think that a vegetarian foodie (some of you don't understand that there is such a thing, but i'll let you catch up) wouldn't be able to find anything at a french restaurant, but au contraire, mon frere - they have a vegetarian sampler that is anything but an afterthought.  garlic spinach, some spicy lentils, asparagus, potatoes <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>, green beans, and whipped cauliflower . . . it's like someone made your vitamins delicious . . . and i thoroughly enjoyed every bite, and my beat-down-by-vegas body was reinvigorated.  the wine selection is good, but i opted for the brewed-in-quebec triple belgian beer, the fin du monde, and like frank the tank would say, \"it feels so good when it hits your lips . . . so good!\"\n\none word of caution, though - the bathroom is out the door inside the casino and around the corner, so depending on where you're sitting, it might be a hike . . . and the water and the wine keep coming . . .",

            "we were looking for something in between fast food and pretentious. finally decided here because, frankly, i was tired of walking. hostess said would be a\n30 minute wait, no problem i'll just gamble a little. 10 minutes later, our pager went\noff. had to wait a couple more minutes while they changed out table cloth. anyway, received water right away. our waiter came over very friendly, outgoing. he recommended the skate because i was gonna order the salmon. my gf got the special, prime rib w/ aus jus macaroni <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> and green beans . skate came with a fennel, red onion, green bean salad..it was prepared with lemon capers parsley..and had homemade garlic chips. garlic chips were great, light with garlic taste. skate was an interesting fish, kinda chewy but the way it was prepared was delicious. a bit salty but im certain it was the capers. the lemon was delightful. salad was good it was light and made with oil and balsamic vinegar. prime rib was cooked med-rare, this was delicious.  so tender and flavorful, really good. my gf wanted to send it back because it was not hot...i assumed thats the french way..i didn't even notice and i like my food hot! the potatoes were great, nice little crunch but great texture in middle. almost forgot, i ordered the french onion soup and it was very nice flavorful, very cheesy-yummy, and bread was good. try it just to try it. nice little baguette with butter too. \n\noverall, place was great and if it wasn't for this land having thousands of restaurants i would definitely make it back here.", 
            "we reserved on open table, so we only waited about 5 minutes.  i overheard other people saying that the wait without a reservation was about an hour and a half.  so definitely call ahead.  we sat inside and enjoyed the table and the ambiance.\n\nmy boyfriend is a vegetarian, and has a big appetite.  he ordered the vegetable platter, which was great, but not super big.  he also ordered the macaroni and cheese (<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>) to supplement and it was really fantastic.  it comes out all baked and yummy with lots of cheese on top.  i ordered the french onion soup, and it was probably the best i have ever had in my life.  so much cheese, and the broth was really rich.  bonus: it comes out in a huge dish that looks like a hot tub, so it was very, very filling.\n\noverall, we really enjoyed.  the bill for two, without alcohol, was 51 dollars.  the only downside was that the only real vegetarian option was the vegetable platter, and that it was pretty small.  but what what can i expect from a french steakhouse?", 
            "outdoor seating is great for people watching and seeing the bellagio fountains.  mon ami gabi was a family affair before seeing our show at the rio.  it was a great reminder of my recent trip to paris.  some of the food was just fantastic, but others lacked flavor.  \nas a party of five, we started off with a carafe of \"frangria,\" which was fantastic!  then had three different appetizers to share:  warm brie cheese, warm duck confit salad, and the <mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark>. two onion soups <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>.  then for our individual entrees we ordered:  frisee & <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>, steak classique, bone-in ribeye, <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, \"poisson <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>\" = sea bass w/ roasted corn couscous.  being so full, we still had room for dessert...(drum roll please)... bananas foster crepe.  \nin summary, here's what i would definitely get again and what items i would pass up.  \nfive stars:  frangria, <mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark> (so memorable!), warm brie cheese--was finished off, but i personally didn't have any because i'm not a cheese person, frisee & <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> (yummy poached egg!), bone-in ribeye (perfectly cooked and juicy), <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, bananas fosters crepe\nfaaaaahget about it:  warm duck confit salad (supbar duck confit to the ones served in paris--lacked salt/flavor), onion soup (not impressive--didn't have a depth of flavor was was too sweet, plus the cheese wasn't gooey), steak classique (ehhh....least the fries were good)", 
            "read the reviews and was intrigued. wanted to go someplace nice but not over the top. \n\nmade reservations for 9 on a saturday night. arrived to a small line. told her about our reservation. she robotically told us to go to the other line. once i was in the fro.nt of the second line, another hostess gave me one of those square light filled waiting thing. felt kinda like chili's. all hostesses seemed overworked and none really smiled. it seemed they were all overwhelmed students doing this for the first time.  eventually a hostess led us to our table. asked her how her day went and she said it was busy. i thought to myself, but it's sat in vegas. is this something new?\n\nupon entering, you see well decorated interior. everything in the place screams paris sophistication. dimly lit amber chandeliers hang from the vaulted ceilings. decorative windows w colored cutouts. marble tables. the place looks like a million bucks. decor is a comfortable elegance. everything is beautiful yet approachable. perfect for a romantic dinner.\n\ni ordered the special of the night, prime rib served w potatoes <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> and sting beans. cj ordered the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark>. a combination of lobster, oysters, shrimp, tuna tartar and seaweed salad. food came relatively quickly. was all as expected. taste was ok. 3/5. which was a little disappointing considering the ambiance. platter was also $24/person minimum 2. considering, it was very little food for the price. was more ice than anything else.\n\nwait staff was also peculiar. waiter walks by. makes eye contact. then continues walking by. 10 minutes later he turns out to be the waiter. now at chili's a chain restaurant, they would have typically said \"i'll be right back\", or otherwise indicate they were our waiter.  he was cordial and informative though. food as said came out as ordered. but minutes later he is refilling our water. after a round or two, a bus boy finally starts refilling our water and removing plates. overall the feel is poor staff training and disorganization. this place has one of the best locations across from the bellagio fountains.\n\noverall, great ambiance but food and service like a national chain restaurant. a shame because this place could be so much more. save yourself money and have drinks or dessert here", 
            "went to vegas with my parents as a final mini vacay before school starts. this time we went to mon ami gabi for dinner to try the prominent filet mignon w/ merlot butter!\n\nwe made a tuesday, 7:30pm reservation, which i'm really glad we did because it was pretty crowded around that time. we were lucky enough to get a table inside, but by the opening where we could still watch bellagio's water show.\n\nthey give you a complimentary baguette with some type of seasoned radish/veggie thing on a separate plate. interesting, but it wasn't anything that great imo. the baguette was warm and fresh and the butter we slabbed on it made it a great starter to our dinner.\n\nhere's what we ordered that night:\n\n1. butter lettuce & apple salad\n- didn't try it, but my mom seemed to really like it.\n\n2. <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>\n- so good, definitely one of the better french onion soups i've had. it wasn't too salty (which is a common issue most i've had) and the gruyere cheese melted on top was divine.\n\n3. frangria\n- aka 'french sangria'. it was really good! i would get again and a glass of it is only $5.\n\n4. steak bearnaise\n- tender, flavorful, good flavoring.\n\n5. filet mignon w/ merlot butter\n- honestly the best filet mignon i've ever had. it's so tender that it melts in your mouth and that merlot butter sauce they put on it is godly. the frites were tasty and even better when they were sopping up the remaining merlot butter. mmmm!\n\n6. hanger steak w/ merlot butter\n- tender and pretty similar tasting to the filet mignon (obv. because of the merlot butter). honestly, i wouldn't mind just ordering this one since it tastes pretty much the same and it's $20 (cheaper than the filet mignon).\n\ntheir prices aren't that bad when you look at the ambiance and quality of the food and service. very impressive once again!\n\ntips/fyi's:\n- make a reservation just to be safe!\n- their patio seating has a beautiful view of the bellagio water show, but you can't reserve a table there bc it's a first come, first serve basis :(\n- since we went on a weekday, we noticed it wasn't very crowded around 8pm, so it might be easier to walk-in around that time?", 
            "right when we were seated we were given an apple and raddish starter, complimentary of the chef.  it was a nice palate cleanser and a surprisingly delightful gesture.  \n\nwe started with the butter lettuce and apple salad with beets and aged <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>.  then we shared the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> with brioche and creme fraiche, and the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> with garlic potato chips.  everything tasted amazing!  \n\nwe sat on the patio directly across from the bellagio fountains and we loved the ambiance!  as cheesy as a fake parisian eiffel tower is, the restaurant has a really romantic vibe and we really enjoyed the ambiance.  \n\ntip:  the wait was an hour long for patio seating, so make reservations or be prepared to wait.  good thing the pager works anywhere inside the casino!", 
            "booking a table? beware! indoor tables are open for reservations. the patio and conservatory are not. for those wanting to forgo the dark, atmospheric inner room for the bright, light buzz of the other dining areas, be ready to wait the standard 20 minutes. \n\ni love that the interior does actually feel a little french, if not a little disneyesque-french. the service is thoroughly american: friendly and completely casual. the food seems to be a hit-or-miss. and the lunch menu is not too exciting for food lovers.\n\nour appetizers--<mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>--were filling, hearty and verrrrrry tasty! our mains offered a totally different experience. the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>, sadly, was not at all hearty or rustic. if you're hoping it'll be an oven-toasted pairing of tasty french bread and gorgeous ham, don't. it's basically sub-par toasted ham and cheese sandwich, storebought sliced bread to boot. the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> was flavorful but already cold upon arrival. fries here are unique. they are so thinly sliced that they're actually like chips/crisps--not like what i remember of bistro fries in france.\n\ngo here for the cute outdoor and conservatory seating, and view of the bellagio fountains. food is decent and filling--but nothing to write home about.", 
            "mmm the bread came with this carrot spread - so delicious; that was probably one of the highlights. we got great seating (a four person table all to my boyfriend and i) with a lovely view of the bellagio fountains. \n\nwe were craving french onion soup (<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>) and this hit the spot! there's a generous amount of gruyere cheese in the soup; so ooey-gooey delicious. \n\nmy boyfriend and i shared the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, it was nice but nothing super special. \n\none complaint is that our server didn't seem to know much about wine recommendations...other than that the food came quickly and was above average quality.", 
            "the service here is excellent they're incredibly attentive (they'll fold your napkin when your not looking, so be on guard. lol) \n  my waiter coerced me into getting the \"special\" 16oz porter house with creamy <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> and string beans. at first sight i blushed like a little girl when i saw this beautiful piece of bloody meat laid before me, oh yeah this behemoth is pretty darn good too. they cooked in medium rare and served it as is with a little horse radish sauce, and that's all you need to achieve meaty nirvana. \n  but as much as i loved the porterhouse the half-chicken nearly stole the show, simply because it was prepared perfectly. i was at a lost for words for how good it was, i would have to say it rivals the one over at at last cafe.  \n  the only bummer was that you had to walk out of the restaurant to find the bathrooms. also if you make a reservation you better be on time or notify them, because they'll charge you $100 on your card. (wtf?!?! they don't play) \n this place will make your wallet just a little more lighter, but you can't beat the outdoor seating overlooking the strip while dining on such fine cuisine.", 
            "my friends and i came here for brunch/lunch and didn't have to wait long for a table.  it gets packed on the weekends so make reservation if you have a large group!\n\nit has a nice ambience to the place.  seat indoor or outdoor.  you get a great view if seated outdoor in the shades.  \n\nservice is great...our waitress is attentive to our needs and if we want something extra or water, she gets it to us right away.  excellent service!\n\nthe price is pretty reasonable.\n\nwe ordered and tried the following:\n*<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> - it's like you're class french onion soup but even yummier.  the grueyere cheese just melts in your mouth (5/5)\n\n*chicken, broccoli & <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> - it's your classic crepe..delicious and with just the right flavor.  (4/5)\n\n*steak frites - apparently it's what some were raving about so overall, it was pretty delicious!  well marinated and savory.  (5/5)\n\n*sea <mark>Scallops Gratinees</mark> - it's mixed with caramelized fennel, onion marmalade, and mussel cream.  sounds yummy?  yes indeed!  well-seasoned flavors to go with the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>. (5/5)\n\n*endive & roquefort <mark>Warm Goat <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark></mark> - fresh ingredients..you can definitely taste the freshness!  the roasted barlette pears they added into the salad makes it even yummier! (bonus point) (5/5)\n\nso stop by mon ami gabi if you're ever in vegas to enjoy some yummy food! =)", 
            "i enjoy going to this french bistro everytime i am visiting las vegas. i just enjoy the location, the menu, and the food. sometimes, it is a miss, but i still really enjoy coming back to mon ami gabi. it is super quaint as one can sit inside or outside. i usually prefer outside seating, but then it gets too sunny. but i still love it.\n\n* <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> baked with gruyere cheese $8.95 (5 of 5) yummy. so much cheese. i love it. it is one of my favorite places to order french onion soup. \n* sea <mark>Scallops Gratinees</mark> with caramelized fennel & onion marmalade, mussel cream $12.95 (3.5 of 5) so cute. i didn't realize they made stainless steel scallop plates so they can put the scallop into the oven. fresh and tasty. but more pieces would make me happier.\n* steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>-brandy peppercorn sauce with signature hand cut fries $25.95 (4 of 5) this steak is flattened, so don't expect it to be a thick cut. looks like a piece of liver, but tastes like a piece of juicy steak. very unique to this restaurant and pretty tasty. but i don't favor their choice of cut fries. it is like flattened cuts of potatoe. not to my liking. \n* maine lobster roll toasted brioche roll with gaufrette potato chips $17.95 (4 of 5) fresh and tasty. the roll was soft and lightly buttered toasted. very delicate but held the lobster meat quite well. no complaints here and i enjoyed their gaufrette potato chips on this dish more than the signature hand cut fries. \n\nthis is one of my preferred restaurants on the las vegas strip. i really enjoy this bistro and always down to bring others to try this place.", 
            "i took my girlfriend on a first date here and it was the perfect restaurant choice to do so.\n\ni requested to be seated with a view of the bellagio fountains and that's exactly what i got. there is no better back drop when in vegas then the towering fountains. i highly suggest making this request to better your chances on getting lucky. the odds would be better than any other casino game you would be playing anyway. \n\nthe prices are very reasonable for vegas. everything we got was standard tasty french food. as an appetizer i recommend the warm brie cheese. just marvelous with the black pepper honey, hazelnuts and croutons. i ordered the steak classique that came with thin fries which paired well and both were very satisfactory. the <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> is standard. my date got the daily fresh fish which she seemed to enjoy.\n\nthis time around what happened in vegas, didn't stay there. i still got the girl. she's an absolute beauty. peace out!",

            "what can i say that 2800 people haven't already said in their reviews? christy g. and i always try to dine at mon ami gabi when we're in vegas, and every visit has been spectacular. for one, the service is always impeccable. the location can't be beat, with an amazing view of the bellagio fountains and truly top notch people watching. i particularly like watching the drunk bambi-legged girls (\"weenie wobbles\") trying not to fall in their too-high heels :) or even worse, the ones holding their heels and walking down las vegas blvd in their blackened bare feet *shudder*\n\nthe <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> ($9.95) is a definite must-have. the broth is rich and savory, packed with perfectly soaked baguette slices and caramelized onions, and topped with about a pound of melted gruyere. i crave this soup even when it's triple digits outside; it's that good. \n\nanother staple is the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> ($34.95), which comes with a merlot infused butter and a red wine reduction. the filet (medium rare for me) is always perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth. i don't personally care for the frites that everyone raves about, but they've always been super accommodating about switching it out for another side at a small upcharge. i've had the pommes puree, garlic spinach, sauteed mushrooms, and the macaroni <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> - all amazing. \n\ni'm always way too stuffed for dessert, so i won't comment on those. they also have a pretty substantial wine list, and about two dozen wines by the glass. and if you stop by for brunch, the build your own bloody mary cart is a godsend! \n\nbottom line: don't miss out; this place is amazing! ask for a table on the patio and come hungry!", 
            "got the steak classique which didnt seem like anything special. the quality of the steak was average and felt like i could make it at home, but the maitre d'hotel butter that was on top was pretty good. i think i was deciding between this and my usual choice of steak which is the filet, but it was lunch time so it seemed more proper to get this dish. should've been safe and went with the filet. their fries were interesting but not amazing, got kind of oily near the end.\n\nthe item i remember most would probably be the french onion soup, or the \n<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> which was baked with gruyere cheese. that was full of cheesy deliciousness, one of the best french onion soups i've had in awhile.\n\ni also tried my friend's steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> (brandy peppercorn) and steak bordelaise (caramelized onion & red wine sauce), and ultimately their sauces were satisfying, but i just didnt enjoy the steak itself.\n\nalso, the two guys i was with were both wearing tanks and had to wear a huge white t over because apparently a tall t is so much better.\n\noverall, not bad but maybe i should give it another shot before jumping to conclusions. if you do come here definitely try the french onion soup because that was what made a lasting impression.", 
            "great place. i went there with my 2 yr old and we had boeuf bourguignon, which was splendid, and a mac <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>, which we did not care much for. service was great and accommodating!", 
            "mon ami gabi is situated at the front of the paris las vegas hotel, but the parisian theme is applied much more subtly inside the dining room than in the rest of the host resort.\n\nwe were seated at a table located at an odd intersection between two dining areas and the kitchen doors which meant a steady stream of servers passing back and forth. this added a fun air of hustle-and-bustle that you might experience in a parisian bistro. it was fine at lunch time, but might not be what you want during a romantic date night dinner.\n\ni started with the <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>, which arrived piping hot and topped with a bubbling layer of gratineed cheese. the soup itself was far too sweet and far too gloopy, a symptom of the baguette slices that had been submerged in the dish rather than floated on top of it as is traditional.\n\nmy entree was much better; filet of pacific snapper pan-fried in a light herb batter that lent a subtle texture to the fish. the fish sat on top of lobster cream and butternut squash orzo pasta, which was light and flavorful. \n\nthere was a broad selection of french wines available, plus a limited, but high quality selection of beers.\n\ni would eat at mon ami gabi again.",

            "upon entering mon ami gabi, there were two lines - one with reservations and one without reservations. the hostess gave us the option to sit inside or outside. i liked how the restaurant had tall ceiling and big chandeliers. despite the two building alarms that went off during our dinner before the jersey boys show, the food was excellent. after sitting down for 10-15 minutes, there was a confusion who was our server since no one came to our table. \n\nafter we ordered, our server brought us a white paper bag with a warm baguette and a dish of butter. \n\nguest #1 ordered a lentil soup and endive and blue <mark>Warm Goat <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark></mark>. the lentil soup (soup of the day) consisted of lentil and herb pur\\u00e9e.  the endive and blue <mark>Warm Goat <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark></mark> consisted of endive, greens, blue cheese, warm bartlett pears, and toasted walnuts.\n\nguest #2 ordered an <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> and trout amandine. the french onion soup consisted of beef broth with onions, bread, and melted gruyere cheese served in a bowl over a dish with a paper dolly on it. the trout amandine consisted of a pan seared, crispy trout topped with brown butter and almonds. it was served with steamed green beans and a preserved lemon. he was surprised there was no additional sauce.    \n\nguest #3 ordered the grilled salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> which consisted of spinach, diced avocado, sun dried cranberries, and walnuts tossed in a citrus dressing.\n\nguest #4 ordered <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> which consisted of 4 tender, chewy, possibly a little rare <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> caramelized in maple syrup. it was served with broiled crispy brussels sprouts served over butternut squash pur\\u00e9e.\n\nguest #5 was quite adventurous when he was game for the <mark>Skate Wing</mark>. for those of you that don't know what a <mark>Skate Wing</mark> is, it's a fish belonging to the stingray family. it came with caper lemon spaetzle, roasted cauliflower and brown butter. it was the most delicious dish of the night.\n\nwe finished our meal with a creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e and a caramelized pineapple crepe. the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e was a vanilla flavored egg custard with a caramelized sugar coat. the caramelized pineapple crepe was a warm crepe with coconut cream on the inside. it was topped with caramelized pineapple  \nand drizzled with caramel sauce.", 
            "probably the best meal i had in vegas in terms of price point and flavor! i actually didn't have our last full day in vegas planned out meal wise. while sitting on the balcony at our hotel looking at the strip, i spotted mon ami gabi. i'd been here once about 8 years ago for dinner and enjoyed the food. i thought a nice lunch outside would be a great way to revisit.\n\n*sauvignon blanc: saint bris, 11 ($11)\nperfect for a nice sunny day. crisp and light.\n\n*<mark>Jumbo Crabcake</mark>: pickled celery, citron butter ($17.95)\nthis was huge! had chunks of crab and a light beurre blanc sauce.\n\n*<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>: the french classic baked with gruyere cheese ($10.95)\nyum! a huge portion. the soup was full of flavor and the cheese was nice and melty. the best onion soup i've had in a while.\n\n*frisee, kale & <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>: soft-poached egg ($11.95)\ncompared to the <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> we had for dinner a couple nights before, this was amazing. exactly what i wanted from a <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>. the vinaigrette cut into the richness of the bacon and egg. perfectly balanced.\n\n*<mark>Mussels Mariniere</mark>: white wine & herbs ($11.95 half order)\nthe sauce was so good! i even ate some bread just so i could soak up the sauce. a nice portion for a half order and the mussels were plump and tender.\n\nsitting outside is a nice way to enjoy the sun and people watch. but beware that it can get intensely hot in the direct sunlight. they don't have umbrellas outside so you can walk away with a little more color than you bargained for.\n\nthis was a nice light lunch to bring us into our last day in vegas. and who doesn't love a taste of paris?!", 
            "first time i came here, i didn't like this place at all but that was when i ordered something totally wrong--a cheeseburger.  i came back again and fell in love. \n\nmon ami gabi is located inside paris hotel but their outside patio is right on the strip.  they are always busy so try to come at off times if you're planning to dine here for lunch or dinner.  i've only been here for lunch on the weekends but i'd definitely recommend this spot to anyone who's never been.\n\nmy boyfriend and i shared:\n<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> & <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> upon recommendation.\n\nthey also give you bread and butter to start off with which is always a plus in my book.\ni also noticed they had a bloody mary bar in the middle of the restaurant that i thought was interesting.  if i was a bigger bloody mary fan i would've been down to try it but perhaps next time.\n\nthe <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> was a lot bigger than expected and boy was i glad!  definitely one of the top french onion soups i've ever had--the soup had a savory flavor with onions, bread and tons of melted cheese.  the warm bread they bring out to you while you wait, also pairs well with this soup.  must get!\n\nthe <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> was amaaaaaazing.  i was so happy i went with this recommendation as it did not disappoint one bit! we asked for our steak to be medium rare and it came out with peppercorn mayo and tons of carmelized onions.  everything complemented each other and each bite was better than the first.  the steak was so tender and juicy... and the buns they used were warm and soft.  the sandwich also came out with fries too which were good but nothing special.  i actually prefer my fries to be a bit more crispier.  \n\nthe service was excellent and there isn't really anything to complain about except i do wish the tables were a bit further apart from each other.  maybe it's just me but it feels like all the tables are closely set to each other and a bit crammed.  the prices are a bit steep but then again, it is vegas so it's expected.  i'd definitely recommend this place for lunch.", 
            "blown away! and not just from the roaring bellagio fountain show!\n\nstarted with carrot salad (compliments of the chef) which was an excellent palate cleanser.  tabletop baguette was hot, crusty but soft inside. excellent!  whipped butter on the side, too.

(if you want patio seating, it's not possible to get reservations for it.  there's a waitlist, and it's first-come-first-serve.)\n\nwith that being said, we ended up sitting inside with a view of the bellagio fountains, near the patio seating!  we enjoyed several shows of the bellagio fountains throughout our two hour meal, at the height of dinner service.  \n\nyes, we were impressed with the quality of food, service and ambiance!  thank you for making our anniversary dinner be such a treat!!

            "ehh.... i don't get the hype behind this place.  it's really pricey.  if my company wasn't paying for it, i probably wouldn't get dinner here.  \n\nordered:\n\n<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> - 6/10.  it was a good onion soup to be sure, but for $11... i dunno about that.\n\nfilet mignon w merlot wine reduction - 7/10.  this was a beautifully cooked steak.  maybe i'm just over $40 steaks at restaurants when i feel like i can make a better one using my sous vide at home.  there are still some steakhouses that outdo me and my sous vide, but this place wasn't one of them. the merlot reduction was tasty though.\n\nthe free table side bread is a solid 7/10.  \n\nview - 8/10.  \n\nso that places this kind of in the 3.5star range. i do have to note, you want to sit outside.  the view of the bellagio fountains from these seats is amazing.  it's honestly a better view than from the bellagio restaurants themselves (thinking olives, picasso, etc), since you get to watch the show head on instead of from a side angle.",

            "now this review is truly overdue.  i went to vegas months ago, but never got the chance to finish this review.  with a vegas trip possibly in the near future, i thought it pertinent i got this one out.    \n\nwith reservations placed online, we didn't have to wait.  located right in front of the paris casino, you can't miss it.  an exposed patio section displays itself to the strip.  i was in debate whether to have lunch or dinner here and since our schedule forced us to choose dinner.  dinner it was.  the lighting is dimly lit and has a romanticized atmosphere layered with a generally casual ambience.  \n\nlooking through the menu, bun and i had no idea what to order.  thank goodness, we had a hank azaria for our waiter.  it wasn't really him, but it really looked like him.  if you don't know who that is, he's most known for voice acting numerous characters on the simpsons such as chief wiggum and moe.  he played the french guy ben stiller's movie wife had an affair with in along came polly.  coincidentally in that movie, the scuba instructor he plays is french.  my eyeballs opened a little bigger in shock when the first words laced with his french accent popped out.  that waiter whose name i do not recall will be called hank for remainder of this review.    \n\nafter sifting through the entire menu, we both ended up choosing steaks with frites.  there seemed to be a crazy number of different choices of ways they prepared steaks that i had no clue what they were.  hank gave us a full detailed debriefing for each kind and how they were cooked.  i was certainly impressed.  he also gave us the option to make the steak a filet mignon instead.  that was a no brainer.  \n\nas our starters, bun ordered the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> which came in and was served out of a curiously interesting jug.  it was then poured onto the plate which had a little cream in the center.  i wanted to originally get a regular salad, but he convinced me to order the frisee and <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>.  hank said it was a very common salad in french cafes in france.  i guess i played sucker to that one and yielded to his request.  this salad had a poached egg, bacons slices, and caramelized onions.  he even showed me how you're supposed stir the egg evenly through the whole salad before eating it.  the salad was simply marvelous.  i sampled some of bun's soup and it had nice level of creaminess and was really good.   \n\nwhen our filet mignons came, my mouth instantly watered like homer simpson when he sees a donut.  it was tenderness on blast.  cooked to a nice medium rare as requested and served with a side of frites, it filled my stomach up to the brim.  i was really surprised considering the prices.  to not over exceed one's expectation, this wasn't $200 kobe beef.  that would be an unfair comparison.  yet this filet mignon was excellent enough with its simple design to easily deliver the same goal.       \n\nwhile holding our full stomachs, hank comes over to offer a dessert menu or some coffee.  i don't even remember responding back.  i think my stomach said something on the line of needing the bill so we can roll our full buttocks out.  obviously, by now one can tell my impression of their service was very gracious and cordial.  the food was more than just reasonable.  it was a good, unadulterated, affordable vegas meal.  a return visit is in the horizon.",

            "you know over the course of several years ive revisited mon ami on several occasions and each time has gotten better than the last. i used to laughingly refer to mon ami as the olive garden of french restaurants, homogenized versions of french bistro classics. but as i grow older and (hopefully) wiser ive found that this isn't really the case. yes this is a chain but they do try to do their best with what they do. i re-read my previous review (2008) and wow did i just sound like an arrogant dick. i apologize for that and sure i could delete it but think its much better left to show a contrast of me growing up. \n\nnow with all that being said, i have to say that i always crave their ribeye steak slathered in deliciously sweet bordelaise sauce when we visit. this is vegas and there are loads of steakhouses pretty much everywhere but for the price point this steak is a great value as well as a great taste! its slightly fatty, beefy richness is cooked exactly how i love it, medium rare. this imho is the only steak on the menu to order. while the lesser priced steaks are alright its only a few bucks more for the ribeye. \n\nif you haven't tried it, the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and tomato sauce appetizer is super tasty. creamy <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> melts into the tomato sauce fortifying it with amazing flavor. it comes with a slab of garlic butter soaked bread which is kind of greasy so i opted for hot fresh baguette. the fris\\u00e9e, kale and <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> make for an awesome salad that's covered with a single poached egg. you know you can put warmed egg yolks on anything and it'll taste good. the dressing is nicely acid with a slight sweetness that cuts the bacon and egg richness. so good.\n\nwho knows, maybe my supposed standards have gone down or perhaps, just perhaps, good food is just good food no matter where it comes from. regardless of the case one (me) doesn't need to act like an arrogant bitch about it.",

            "i am taking the time to inform you of my unacceptable dining experience at mon ami gabi in las vegas on january 20, 2013, from 11am-1pm. we came with a group of 10 and were seated promptly, with our drink orders taken and fresh bread served. there were a few incidents where i found my dining experience unacceptable:\n\n1. my friend ordered the corned beef hash, and shortly after ordering, the waiter returns and says they are out of corned beef hash. this is disappointing but acceptably okay, but given this is las vegas, and a huge restaurant, how do you run out of such a popular dish, especially at a time like sunday brunch? i wanted to order this but changed last minute after hearing the special.\n\n2. the second incident was when our waiter told us the specials of the day, so i ordered the \"portobello\" eggs benedict. except, when our food came, the waiter tells me it's \"pork loin\" eggs benedict instead of \"portobello\". the thing is, the waiter should've known what the specials were, and second, he should have came back and told me earlier, the same time he told my friend they had ran out of corned beef hash, that the special was not \"portobello\" but \"pork loin\". i would've have elected to switch to something else. i do not want \"pork loin\" eggs benedict, and my second choice would've been the corned beef hash, which the restaurant ran out of. the worst thing was that he told me when our food came, so it wasn't like i had any choice to change my order. i was starving and didn't want others to wait for my food to arrive so they could start eating while they already had their food served, and there wasn't really anything else i really wanted on the menu. had the waiter informed me earlier, at least i could have ordered something else. the waiter, did however, said he would check back to see if i wanted to change my order, and when he did return to check back a long while after, i was more than three-quarters done with my food because i was way too hungry, and i wasn't enjoying the food, but merely eating just to fill up my stomach. i was rather upset by that. \n\n3. the last incident was my other friend's hot water. she ordered a tea, and needed a refill in the hot water. the waiter took the pot, and never returned. when we asked the waiter about the hot water, he replied, \"oh, we gave it to the other end of the table.\" obviously, the waiter forgot about it and made it up. we ordered 3 hot teas, and now there were only 2 hot water pots. i mean, normally it wouldn't have been a huge issue, but i was already upset from my meal. \n\n4. given, we had a large party, but the wait was unbearably long. i was starving!\n\nthe service was nonetheless friendly, i wouldn't fault the waiter. the fressi, kale, <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> was good and light, however the bacon was cold. both the chicken liver and pate were on par.\n\nin conclusion, i was quite disappointed with my dining experience. the view was great, they had nice fresh bread (although the butter was cold and hard), and that's where it ends. given, we had a large party, but the wait was unbearably long. i was starving!", 
            "saw great reviews on yelp, so we thought we'd give it a try for dinner.  we had such a great experience we went back the next day for breakfast and then had dinner later that day as well.  we were seated on the patio in each case with a very short wait (we were early for dinner).  the atmosphere and service was excellent and pricing was very reasonable in each case.\n\nwe started our first dinner by sharing the frisee and <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>.  flavors were outstanding with a poached egg highlight.  i rarely order steak, but my steak bordelaise was excellent (thin cut, but tender) and my wife's hanger steak with merlot butter was tender and very flavorful.  the potato chip/fries on both entrees were salty and crispy.\n\nfor breakfast i had the turkey & egg white omelette and my wife had eggs benedict and both were excellent.\n\nwe started our second dinner by sharing the duck confit.  it was a generous helping with dark, tender meat accented with balsamic cherries.  this paired with the baguette bread could have been a meal itself.  for my entree, i have the lamb shank (large and again awesome) and my wife had the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>.  the scallops were melt in your mouth and the brussel sprouts were the best she's ever had.\n\nall great experiences. we know where we'll be going again the next time we're in vegas.",

            "yay me for being review #4000 (i think)!\n\nanyways, my sister, brother-in-law, and i stopped by mon ami for a late dinner around 10. worst part about vegas is that if it's open, it's busy. the hostess originally told us that they were not accepting walk-ins until 11 but my sister was clever enough to make a reservation through yelp for 10:30.\n\nafter losing money at the slot machines, we were seated promptly. our server was a bit awkward but extremely helpful and courteous. we ordered 2 hanger steaks, 1 mac & cheese, and a <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>. the hanger steaks were exquisite. they were super tender and the fries were super thin and crispy albeit over salted. the <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> was okay. nothing special. the macaroni and cheese was pretty good too though but i believe technically it would be shells and cheese. \n\nwe also shared a carafe of \"frangria\" and it was good but i would've preferred regular sangria. it was almost too light and juicy. it was almost like watered down wine. \n\noverall the dinner was good but pricy. i would come back since everything in vegas is expensive but at the same time it seems more popular than it deserves.",

            "i had an excellent dinner experience here on a friday night. we sat right by the window and go to watch the bellagio water show. i ordered the filet with a side of the cauliflower mash. delicious. i am paleo, so it was nice that they had options for gluten-free, although the fresh french bread looked pretty amazing. \n\ni came back the next afternoon for lunch/brunch on sunday, and the food was great, but the service was sub-par. the server, i believe his name was jose, was not friendly. maybe he was having a bad day, which we all have, but it was unfortunate it had to impact our experience. my grandma asked him for a glass of ice, and he completely forgot to get it. another server, at our request, had to bring it over. when taking our order, he seemed to be distracted. my mom asked if the <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> had bacon, and he said it did. she asked if she can have it on the side. he said she could not because it was in the dressing. my mom got the salad, with bacon on the salad, and the dressing on the side (that had no bacon in it). the man who delivered the food was very nice, and took the food back. he apologized. our server did not apologize, never said anything about giving us incorrect information, just said the other salad is on the way. \n\ni recommend this place for dinner. it was great. it was too bad we received the bad service at lunch, but i would still try it again.",

            "i took my boyfriend here last night for our first night in vegas and for a little birthday dinner. i give this place five stars for several reasons. first, the location/layout/decor is brilliant. it's located right next to the bellagio (where we stayed) fountains at the paris hotel. it's indoor seating looked beautiful, which what i had originally made 7:30 reservations for , but we opted for the first come first serve patio seating so we could catch the fountain shows. plus, vegas around sunset is perfect in terms of temperature and lighting.\nthe other reason i give it four stars is because the service from jump street was impeccable. the hostesses were kind and attentive. they clearly remembered to tell our waiter later on about my request for a surprise birthday dessert with a candle at the end. the bar tenders at the bar where we got a drink and an appetizer were also very attentive and fast. our waiter later on, ibrahim, was beyond friendly, eager to please and professional (but not overwhelmingly in our faces). \nthe other reason on give this place four stars is the food and wine. i love a french menu. the food is always fresh and made the way you expect it to be and then some. i swear, french chefs have a cooking gene that i don't think others do! all the food we had here was exquisite.  appetizer: wild escargot that was oven roasted in some garlic herb (and pesto i think) sauce. salad: fris\\u00e9e, kale and <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>. dinner: a rare <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> (a butter and red wine reduction) with a side a saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms and hand cut fries. now, let me pause and comment on this dinner dish. first, the steak was o m f g amazing. perfect cut of steak and cooked just to our liking: rare. second, the red wine reduction and butter sauce we ordered on the side bc normally we would never spoil a filet mignon with any sauce, but again, !!!o m f g!!! this sauce blew us away. i could eat it with a spoon. you must must must order this dish of you enjoy filet. the mushrooms and fries were also very fresh and complimented the steak very nicely. oh and, the portion sizes were fair. not small. not huge. fair. filling. perfect amount. \nlast but not least, we ordered a bottle of their house red (a suggestion from our waiter), and i could not have been happier with it. i'm kind of a picky wine lady, but i really liked our waiter so i trusted his suggestion and i'm glad i did. also, i really appreciated our waiter refilling our days wine glasses for us as we dined throughout the evening. \nlast but not least, the last reason i give this place four stars is the fair pricing for the quality of food. our bill was only $111. that's about a third of what most fine dining places would cost in vegas. for instance, the filet mignon was only $37, as opposed to $60 plus it would be at most other steak houses in vegas. for a wonderful experience and exemplary food, $111 felt like a steal. \nmy boyfriend and i definitely plan on dining here again before we leave. if you find yourself in vegas and want an amazing dinner with every bank for a your buck, go here!!", 
            "blown away! and not just from the roaring bellagio fountain show!\n\nstarted with carrot salad (compliments of the chef) which was an excellent palate cleanser.  tabletop baguette was hot, crusty but soft inside. excellent!  whipped butter on the side, too. (yes, ask for more bread if you have the space.)\n\nwe started with the st. germaine spritzer (small carafe, enough for two). sweet as expected but refreshing.  lemon wedge, definitely worth a squeeze into the drink! :)  $14.95\n\n<mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> were delicate and definitely, garlic heaven, so make sure to use the tabletop baguette to get out every last drop of butter! $15.95\n\nfris\\u00e9e, kale, & <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> with poached egg.  it was very tangy!  chopped thick cuts of bacon with slightly bitter fris\\u00e9e, finely chopped kale, and tangy dressing--and don't forget to pop the poached egg!   $12.95\n\n<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> (french onion soup).  been a long time since i've had a great french onion soup, and this place definitely hit the high notes!  savory but a bit sweet, perfect blend and piping hot.  hearty portion.  $10.95\n\ni chose one of the specials for the evening--striped bass. the fish was very moist with a very crispy skin.  the fish sat on a bed of perfectly cooked yukon gold potatoes, tender fava beans and earthy morel mushrooms.  definitely a delightful dish!  the fish was fabulous! $30.95 \n\nsteak frites, bordelaise. perfectly pounded steak with their signature handcut pommes frites.  the bordelaise sauce (caramelized onion, red wine sauce) was savory and rich.  he loved it.   $28.95  (they offer various sauces, so don't fret! classique, <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, dijon, roquefort and bearnaise.)\n\nwhipped cauliflower.  this side dish stood out, and it was phenomenal. if you're in the mood for mind-blowing pureed cauliflower, with notes of cream and perfect seasoning... this is it!  $5.95 \n\ndecaf cappuccino $5.00  \nlatte $5.00\n\nanniversary dessert--their profiterole. french choux pastry ball filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with double chocolate fudge.  it was a very nice touch from the restaurant for a special occasion!  much appreciated. \n\ndaily sorbet--strawberries. this was so refreshing and a perfect end to a delicious and filling meal! $8.95\n\n\nservice = excellent. attentive, friendly, and just wonderful. shelly p. was a fabulous server and made our visit very enjoyable!! \n\nprices = moderate.  we went a bit overboard but it was well worth it!! total: $150.91 with taxes. \n\nhighly recommend getting reservations ahead of time.  (if you want patio seating, it's not possible to get reservations for it.  there's a waitlist, and it's first-come-first-serve.)\n\nwith that being said, we ended up sitting inside with a view of the bellagio fountains, near the patio seating!  we enjoyed several shows of the bellagio fountains throughout our two hour meal, at the height of dinner service.  \n\nyes, we were impressed with the quality of food, service and ambiance!  thank you for making our anniversary dinner be such a treat!! (and i must thank my friend for recommending this place!)  \\u00c0 bient\\u00f4t!", 
            "my wife and i went here as we were excited to try french food. it has a nice romantic environment where we sat inside but the outside patio looked awesome too. unfortunately my wife wasn't feeling well so after we ordered we had to ask the waiter to box up our food so we could get back to the hotel. he was awesome about it and even offered us free dessert if we came back. the sangria was amazing!!! it has rosemary infused into it! yum! i had the lobster / corn chowder soup ... it was a cold soup which i wasn't expecting so i wasn't crazy about it but the flavors were good. the <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> was so good- even out of a box! we will definitely go back next time we are in vegas!", 
            "-food: very fresh and tasty with a great selection. i had the salmon <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> which was perfect. my friend had the salmon which she loved and my hubby ordered the beef wellington which he enjoyed. we also loved the bread\n-prices: on the high side but worth it\n-location: conveniently located in the middle of the strip and (best part!) across the street from the bellagio fountains! if you're on the patio you can watch them which is awesome and adds to the classy ambiance\n-staff: the waiter was very helpful, quick, and friendly\n-overall: i will keep this on my list of places to eat at while on the strip", 
            "i have been itching to try mon ami gabi and finally had the opportunity during a bachelorette weekend we had in sin city. our party of 7 absolutely enjoyed the ambiance, service, and food of this cute french bistro right on the strip, located at the paris hotel & casino.\n\ncheese plate ($15.95): 3 cheeses, 6 pieces of bread, chickpeas, and apple slices. i'm not a huge fan of fancy shmancy cheeses so i wouldn't recommend this if you can't eat strong cheese. the bread and chickpeas were the only things i could really enjoy!\n\nsalmon, spinach, and baby <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> ($20.95): yummy! great sized salmon over a bed of fresh spinach, kale, blueberries, walnuts, avocados paired with a citrus dressing.\n\nthank you keith for the great service!\n\n-1 star for having to wait in the same line as walk-ins!", 
            "on a weekend trip to vegas, we stayed at paris hotel. this is right in the hotel! we went on a saturday night, later. it is really cool if you can sit on the patio, because you can watch the fountain show at the bellagio! very cool. however, it was definitely full. we made reservations in the morning and we still had to wait for about 20 minutes. don't even think about going without reservations unless you can wait for over an hour. i had the hangar steak. it was sooo good. i would definitely recommend. other dishes at the table included one of their specials for the night (salmon and pasta/vegetables) and a salmon, spinach and baby <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>. i didn't try those, but they said that they loved their dishes! i would definitely go back!", 
            "attended a business dinner here with a group of 12, although the line was out the door and the restaurant was filled to near capacity we were seated immediately upon arriving in one of the side rooms to the left of the hostess station. our server met us with a warm smile and went over a few of the night's specials. it was apparently that the staff was really being stretched as the simple menus were being distributed and the water glasses filled, our server very politely informed us she'd return shortly to get our drink orders. \n\nafter about 10 minute as promised she returned and took our drink orders although we were wanting to order a selection of appetizers for the table to share she dashed off to enter our drink orders. having been seated for a least 20 minutes our drinks arrived and she began taking the appetizer orders avoiding mentioning anything else referencing to placing our dinner orders although we had possession of the menus for at least 30 minutes and the first rounds of drinks were mostly expired. now we all understood this was a informal business dinner and time wasn't really a concern except for a few that had rather be spending their time at the craps table or feeding the one arm bandits. the appetizers arrived and a second round of refreshments were ordered, after clearing the table of the seafood food selections and distribution of the recently order round of cocktails to the dismay of a few inpatient souls who seemed unimpressed with the evening  and felt the evening was slipping away we finally placed our entree orders. \n\ni will say the oysters were exceptional not only were they fresh and cleanly shucked with the shells still full of the natural liquor, they were sized nicely and delicious as well as plentiful. \n\nafter more than a hour a half the entrees began arriving after and after being somewhat surprised at how inexpensive the dinner selections were i wasn't that surprised on the quality and in fact was a little disappointed to find such a popular venue didn't have a more upscale selection. i should of known during the orientation upon arriving i remembered it was stated that \"the sirloin\" was pointed out as their signature dish huh, along with their signature fries which i chose to pass on. i chose the filet with asparagus and a <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> adorned with a soft poached egg, honestly the salad was amazing with its generous portion of shredded kale and fresh cooked bacon with a warm bacon dressing. the filet ordered medium rare came out well done and the asparagus was cold and tough. \n\nalthough the venue was very nice with good service for the amount of customers being crammed in, the food was just okay considering the dinner went on for more than two and a half hours with time for only two cocktails to be served. several of us chose to exit once the desserts were explained and our gracious host offered this as an option since it was getting rather late in the evening. with all the exceptional dinner choices available on the strip i would consider this restaurant again for breakfast or lunch or even for an afternoon drink with oysters appetizers but not for dinner.", 
            "i know this restaurant has a million reviews already so this may fall on deaf ears but i still feel the need to commend it as a great establishment. i'm gone to mon ami gabi three or four of my trips to las vegas and the service is always impeccable and the food is always scrumptious. this time i went for a leisurely brunch by myself and enjoyed a fantastic <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>, some huge pieces of brioche, and the bloody mary bar. the bar was super fun and had anything you could want in a bloody mary short of the kitchen sink. the salad had bacon and egg on it so it was the perfect brunch dish - breakfast and lunch on a plate. the bread was huge and soft with a lovely strawberry jam. if you're looking for breakfast or lunch in vegas - go here. you won't be disappointed.", 
            "steak frites, s'il vous pla\\u00eet !\n\nmon ami gabi is an awesome little restaurant located in the paris hotel and casino that serves up delectable french dishes and plentiful plates of steak and fries that won't break your wallet.\n\nour group decided to come here on a weeknight for dinner and were met with two options; there was little to no wait to be seated on the inside of the restaurant, but if we decided to sit on the outside terrace with a view of the bellagio fountains, we would need to wait 40 minutes or more. we decided to stick it out and wait for a seat outside. time goes by quick when the gaming tables are just a few steps away!\n\nwe split the frisee, kale and <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> as an appetizer. this was delicious! even for salad haters, you can't go wrong with bacon and a soft egg. the runny yolk over everything added a nice richness to the crisp greens, and the savory bacon added a nice crunch. \n\nfor my main, i went with the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>. it's a little pricier than the other steaks on the menu, but if you're a meat lover like me, then i think it's totally worth the extra $10! the thick cut of steak steak was cooked to medium perfection, as i requested, and the brandy peppercorn sauce was divine! the meat was perfect; juicy, and amazingly tender. fries were pretty meh - i'm not the biggest fan of fries in the world, and plus i prefer the thick cut style to thin and crispy. to compensate, we ordered sides to share. we ended up getting the saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms and an order of garlic spinach. the mushrooms were standard steakhouse fare, but the garlic spinach was delicious! super garlicky. plus i felt a little better having some green on my plate. kinda healthy.\n\nthe view of the bellagio fountains cannot be beat, especially during dinner. it's a great spot for people watching and i have to say that i think it's a little better suited for groups than for a romantic dinner. the tables are bunched up pretty close together, so much so that you can pretty much eavesdrop on your neighbors conversations! the servers here are very welcoming and friendly, but not the most attentive. we asked for ketchup twice and didn't get any until towards the end of the meal. i'd cut them some slack though, even on a weeknight the outside patio looked totally slammed!\n\nin terms of value, this place cannot be beat! the steak is delicious, and after splitting the appetizers, my tab for dinner came out to be what i would pay for an ala carte steak anywhere else on the strip. cheap, yes. but not cheap tasting! if you're craving steak in vegas, mon ami gabi is not to be missed!"

            "overall, a great restaurant! not too overpriced- of course price will depend on your hunger, pocket and taste. this is perhaps the only restaurant that allows you to sit outside & view the beautiful bellagio musical fountain show (every 15 minutes or so), while enjoying fine gourmet french-american cuisine.\n\ni'd give it 5 stars, except for the following few reasons:\n1. it is slightly on the noisy side (being on the busy 10-lane las vegas blvd s)\n2. it takes more than an hour to get seated outside, due to the popularity.\n3. some of the waiters are not very friendly or personable. especially this one guy called kareem: he is too moody for a waiter at a french restaurant. and unpredictable... he snapped at me in a very unkind way for simply telling him we're ready to order \"why- are you in a hurry?\" no, i am not in a hurry, but we waited over 80 minutes to sit here! \"well i have so many customers before you\". i guess you must be overworked, kareem- but it is none of my business. as far as i am concerned, you still need to treat me as a valued customer! i don't deserve to be given attitude in front of my lady. at a restaurant that costs $60 or more per person...\n\nother than that... highly recommended!\n\nour favorites here are:\n- escargots bernaise\n- warm baguette bread\n- delicious \"market salad\" with fresh tomatoes\n- belgian <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark> (with blue cheese and pears).\n- steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> (peppercorn wine sauce)- prepared medium\n- red wine from burgundy (around $7.50 per glass) sorry cannot recall the name :) - goes so well with the meat!\n- creme brulee - amazing\n- tarte tatin - apple & cinnamon- but ummm, so yummy, so warm, so sensual. not your average apple cobbler!", 
            "this is an example of another reason vegas is a difficult place for a normal person.  the entire experience was, frankly, magical.  the service was a bit obsequious, but she was lovely, friendly, and warm.\n\nthis is a casual eatery we walked into in paris and had no reservations.  it was a saturday night, and we were sat by a lovely, romantic window within seconds.\n\nthe atmosphere was incredible.... across from the bellagio water show, and next to a window in a romantically lit restaurant that had a wonderful aesthetic... tiled floors (slippery in heels), lovely deep wooden grain finish on the classic bar.  it was as close to a dimly lit french bistro as you might find out of france.\n\nthe food was awesome.... \n\nthe oysters had one of the best mignonette's i have ever had.  for las vegas, oyster country (sarcasm button on), they were fresh and shucked decently.  luckily, nothing like andy k.\n\nthe endive and blue <mark>Warm Goat <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark></mark> with watercress and roasted pear was sublime.  the french onion soup was great.  again, i don't like it sweeter than smoky or \"zesty\"... but it was great.\n\nthe salade maison was very good, but the presentation of the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and croutons being the piece of toast with cheese spread ontop of it was confusing... in that lauren ate that without realizing that was the \"<mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> & croutons\" inherent to the salad.\n\nthe french martini was great (grey goose with pineapple, champagne, and chambord....)\n\nthe french 75 was perfect.  i subbed beefeater for the sapphire, and it was just awesome.  awesome!\n\nbut being on the strip, even a casual, non reservation type of meal... the bill came to $140 or something.  1 app, 2 salads, 4 cocktails, one soup.... $140.\n\ni know it is demanding to ask vegas to be cheap, but to sit for a couple apps <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> and see a bill like that is just... disheartening.\n\nso... go to vegas with money.  please please shove cost out of your head prior to sitting down anywhere.\n\nbecause vegas is pricey.  check out my las vegas as to why.... but it isn't just expensive.  i work in fine dining and high end hotels, and the price point is at least 20%-35% over a normal meal.  \n\nas long as you recognize that, even a casual, spur of the moment meal can be magical, romantic, delicious, and stunning.\n\ni would go back here in a second, with the awareness i wish i had previously had.  i think having not been to vegas much, it is something i simply need to plan for across the board.",

            "honestly, our experience at mon ami gabi was off to a very rocky start. despite the fact that we had a reservation, we had to wait in a long, long line - one that was longer than the line for people without a reservation. does this make sense? okay, we wait patiently. we ask if we could be seated outside. the wait is an hour and a half. okay, we opt for inside, take our pager, and head to the slots. lo and behold, 15 minutes later we are paged and then inexplicably seated outside! call it beginner's luck. and what a great view of the strip all abuzz with activity, and a great view of the infamous bellagio fountain just behind the palm trees! perfect. \nthe food? the endive, pear & bleu <mark>Warm Goat <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark></mark> was delicious, and the ribeye on the bone was cooked a perfect medium rare. the frites were a cross between a french fry and a potato chip. addictive, but we had to save room for dessert. profiteroles were freshly assembled - a perfect rendition of the bistro classic. cocktails and wines with entree and dessert were perfect as well.\nwe lucked out with a dynamite server named dawn! she was always right on top of things. all told, a perfect start to our vegas weekend! the prices were not out of the ordinary for any good restaurant in vegas. the only strange thing that happened was that i later received an email from open table saying that mon ami gabi had cancelled my reservation - after we had already dined there. ah well, just a technical glitch that didn't change our experience in the least. bravo, mon ami!", 
            "i absolutely adore mon ami gabi! the atmosphere is perfect, service is always good and the food is delicious.\n\nmy boyfriend & i decided to have our anniversary dinner here out of allllll the vegas restaurants simply based on the ambiance. the outdoor seating is the best (hello, bellagio fountain show!) but be prepared to wait because they only accept reservations for their indoor seating. for such a popular restaurant with an amazing location, the price point at mon ami gabi is totally reasonable. the restaurant falls between a casual/lively/family setting and an intimate/date setting.\n\nthe pear & <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark>, trout amandine and classique steak frites we ordered were on point. i seriously cannot get enough of their frites! it's the perfect cross between crunchy potato chips & fries....so addicting. the service was really welcoming & not pretentious at all. i was even surprised to see our waiter open a brand new wine bottle for me at our table when i only ordered a glass of pinot grigio...impressive.\n\nbrunch here is delicious as well...i love their quiche! and if you've ever been curious about escargot, i would recommend ordering it here only because it's drenched in garlic & parsley...not as scary as one would think ;)", 
            "(edited on 11/17/12)\n\ni have been there about 7 times. i like to sit outside - to watch bellagio fountain show. \n\nfood quality wise, you can't compare to robuchon or bouchon - mon ami gabi is a french version of denny's. that's for sure. or maybe worse... \n\ni've had <mark>Freshly Ground Ahi Tuna Burger</mark> and bacon cheese burger - nothing special, nothing better than burgers at hard rock cafe.\n\ni've had <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> - it is ok. seafood is not fresh. could be using frozen seafood.\n\ngratin - greasy - heavy - rich - if you like to gain fat, this should be fine. i am worried if someone get heart attack. \n\ntrout - i remembered it was no good. \n\nfish and chips - very thin sliced fish make it pretty greasy. kinda same as one at todd english at aria. (it was my fault to get fish&chips at french bistro, yo know)\n\n(newly edited) \n\ni used to like all their mousse and pate - along with oysters to pair with wine - with a great fountain view. however, i went back and it was a huge disappointment.\n\njumbo <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> - when the server put the dish on our table, something was wrong - shrimps looked kinda brown - we thought it was some sort of spices,,, then as soon as we ate it, we realized that it was an unfresh, oxidized shrimp! it tasted like dirt. horrible! i'm sure they use the same old shrimps for other dishes. gross!\n\nliver mousse and pate - i guess no one orders these items here - i could tell because all the edges were all dried out - pretty disgusting. \n\n<mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark> - it is not a great experience to have green leaves turn brown and wilt. \n\nmussels - bad,,,,, they didn't break my expectation. not fresh! at this point, i was concerned about food poisoning. so, i asked to get a check. it was enough...\n\nwhen the food, especially seafood, gets old, they should throw them away - because you know, there is a risk of spreading food poisoning! don't give me these stained shrimps, dude.\n\nbtw, frites are better than lay's potato chips. complimentary baguette is pretty terrible. you can get better baguettes cheaper at albertson's.\n\nmy suggestion - never get seafood here if you know what decent seafood tastes like. just get burgers - cheap and simple. i guess those people who are giving 5 stars just eat burgers and steaks, not seafood. \n\nservice - not that great - too busy all the time - my server wasn't nice at all - she didn't stop at our table. no refills. i saw she was chatting for a while at another table, tho. \n\nyou will see all the men in black here - they indeed look professional in a funny way - but imagine if they change it to denny's uniforms - surly enough, they would fit really well.\n\nalso, when i made a reservation today (sat. nov 10 2012 around lunch time), the hostess was really rude over the phone.  this is karma on yelp, haha.\n\ni have been going there to see bellagio, not to enjoy food and service, but it was way too terrible.... i will never go back again.\n\n1 star is for bellagio's fountain show.", 
            "my friends and i came here for brunch/lunch and didn't have to wait long for a table.  it gets packed on the weekends so make reservation if you have a large group!\n\nit has a nice ambience to the place.  seat indoor or outdoor.  you get a great view if seated outdoor in the shades.  \n\nservice is great...our waitress is attentive to our needs and if we want something extra or water, she gets it to us right away.  excellent service!\n\nthe price is pretty reasonable.\n\nwe ordered and tried the following:\n*<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> - it's like you're class french onion soup but even yummier.  the grueyere cheese just melts in your mouth (5/5)\n\n*chicken, broccoli & <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> - it's your classic crepe..delicious and with just the right flavor.  (4/5)\n\n*steak frites - apparently it's what some were raving about so overall, it was pretty delicious!  well marinated and savory.  (5/5)\n\n*sea <mark>Scallops Gratinees</mark> - it's mixed with caramelized fennel, onion marmalade, and mussel cream.  sounds yummy?  yes indeed!  well-seasoned flavors to go with the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>. (5/5)\n\n*endive & roquefort <mark>Warm Goat <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark></mark> - fresh ingredients..you can definitely taste the freshness!  the roasted barlette pears they added into the salad makes it even yummier! (bonus point) (5/5)\n\nso stop by mon ami gabi if you're ever in vegas to enjoy some yummy food! =)", 
            "went here for an early 5 pm dinner before a 7 pm show. got seated right away and got to sit on the patio...on a friday night. that was exciting. the service was great. we both ordered dirty martinis with blue cheese olives which were delicious. we ordered the escargot and warm brie for appetizers. the escargot is buttery, cheesy delicious! i recommend it! the warm brie was good, but the escargot was the highlight. my husband ordered the filet with merlot sauce. it was delicious and cooked perfectly. i had the <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark> which was actually a quite beautiful presentation and tasted delicious as well. for desert we had the creme brulee which was as good as i've had in a while. overall we were very happy with this place, we had a delicious dinner, made it to our show in plenty of time, sat outside and watched the 'interesting' people on the strip...all for about $130.00. with the way that most restaurants over charge in vegas, especially on the strip, this was a great place for a great price. we will be back!", 
            "excellent service, meal, experience.  on time for our reservation for dinner 6:45 seated promptly just inside the restaurant short of the patio (out of the sun - longest day of the year) across from the bellagio.  we had cocktails, appetizers - escargot for the wife, roquefort <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark> for me.  she had the filet mignon with the wine reduction, i had the special which was a steak tartar.  we enjoyed a bordeux superior during the meal and a cafe latte at the completion.  dion was very attentive throughout and this was possibly the best meal we enjoyed in vegas that week.  the decor is a styling of turn of the 19th century old paris, and we were comfortable for the entire time we languished at our table.  dinner was around a couple of hundred when you added a tip, definitely worth it and a very fond memory for my wife and i.", 
            "loved it! we made a reservation and were seated right away. i love that you enter from the casino but then it's like you're in your own little world. quiet and cozy, with beautiful decor, you instantly relax - the perfect escape before you head back out into the craziness of vegas.\n\ni ordered probably the best soup i've ever had, a creamy pea and leek special, and our table shared the ricotta and olive tapenade appetizer. i had an <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark>, my friend had the vegetarian dish with goat-cheese stuffed vegetables and her husband had steak. all great.\n\ni notice they have a big patio outside, too, which would be a totally different experience and an awesome place to sit during the day for wine and lunch.", 
            "came here for thanksgiving dinner. gotta say everything was pretty delicious.....except for the turkey.  we got lucky and there was patio seating available which gave us a perfect view of the bellagio fountains.  it's kinda funny to think that a main draw of this restaurant is based off of its view of a competing hotel.  the <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark> was really good, but the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> was amazing. kinda wish i had double of that instead of my turkey. i simply cannot dock this restaurant because i thought their white meat of their turkey was exceptionally dry.  any other day of the year i would never order turkey.  lastly, i had pumpkin bread pudding. i usually don't love bread pudding, it's more of my gf's thing, but this time it was amazing. so rich and moist. too bad it's probably a seasonal item.  i'll likely be back, next time to try a steak or something.", 
            "upon entering mon ami gabi, there were two lines - one with reservations and one without reservations. the hostess gave us the option to sit inside or outside. i liked how the restaurant had tall ceiling and big chandeliers. despite the two building alarms that went off during our dinner before the jersey boys show, the food was excellent. after sitting down for 10-15 minutes, there was a confusion who was our server since no one came to our table. \n\nafter we ordered, our server brought us a white paper bag with a warm baguette and a dish of butter. \n\nguest #1 ordered a lentil soup and endive and blue <mark>Warm Goat <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark></mark>. the lentil soup (soup of the day) consisted of lentil and herb pur\\u00e9e.  the endive and blue <mark>Warm Goat <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark></mark> consisted of endive, greens, blue cheese, warm bartlett pears, and toasted walnuts.\n\nguest #2 ordered an <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> and trout amandine. the french onion soup consisted of beef broth with onions, bread, and melted gruyere cheese served in a bowl over a dish with a paper dolly on it. the trout amandine consisted of a pan seared, crispy trout topped with brown butter and almonds. it was served with steamed green beans and a preserved lemon. he was surprised there was no additional sauce.    \n\nguest #3 ordered the grilled salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> which consisted of spinach, diced avocado, sun dried cranberries, and walnuts tossed in a citrus dressing.\n\nguest #4 ordered <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> which consisted of 4 tender, chewy, possibly a little rare <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> caramelized in maple syrup. it was served with broiled crispy brussels sprouts served over butternut squash pur\\u00e9e.\n\nguest #5 was quite adventurous when he was game for the <mark>Skate Wing</mark>. for those of you that don't know what a <mark>Skate Wing</mark> is, it's a fish belonging to the stingray family. it came with caper lemon spaetzle, roasted cauliflower and brown butter. it was the most delicious dish of the night.\n\nwe finished our meal with a creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e and a caramelized pineapple crepe. the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e was a vanilla flavored egg custard with a caramelized sugar coat. the caramelized pineapple crepe was a warm crepe with coconut cream on the inside. it was topped with caramelized pineapple  \nand drizzled with caramel sauce.", 
            "always perfection on my taste buds here.  got the half order of mussels in white wine, french onion soup (perfectly seasoned and crisp cheese overflowing baked on bowl a plus),  pear <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark> (not bad), and delish vanilla hot latte.. made it perfect for breakfast!"

            "ate here with a group, and it was good, but not to the five-star level.  i started sharing the escargot, which was a first for me.  they tasted like mushrooms, which i guess is was most people say.  chalk one up for the adventure but i'm not sure if i'd get them again.  next, i had the oysters, which were good except for the horseradish, which was too chunky.  the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> had a little too much dressing but it was still a little bland.  for dinner, i had the filet with merlot butter, which apparently was the same filet i had last time that i didn't especially like (but it still obviously looks good on the menu because i still got it).  it was cooked well, and the merlot butter gives it a different taste... not necessarily bad, but not what i was expecting (which is why i didn't like it the first time).  i didn't eat any of my fries and i would have much rather had something else.  for dessert, i tried the bananas foster crepe, which was delicious!  \n\noverall, an alternative to a fancy steakhouse, but beware of the unique steaks.   the fries were excessive (yes, i know, that's why people like this place), but the desserts were good.", 
            "i really wanted to like this place. a lot. i really did. \n\ni guess my experience had a bit of lackluster, but i wasn't thoroughly pleased with my visit here.  \n\ni went with my gf over valentine's day weekend for lunch during on valentine's day.  we made reservations over open table a week before and we were seated inside the outer facing windows of the restaurant.  the atmosphere of the place is really beautiful, it really has you feeling like you're somewhere french other than sitting in a restaurant in vegas. \n\nshe got the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> while i got the cheese and onion soup (my apologies, i don't remember the actual name of it), and while the salad wasn't as tasty as others i've had, the soup was something to try if you've never had it.\n\nshe had ordered mussels for her main dish while i ordered the macaroni and cheese.  i should've ordered something else but i didn't know what else to order; i didn't like my dish at all. =t\n\nmy gf keeps raving about the place a lot, though she prefers that we go in the evening than during lunch (she says the menu is completely different at night).  i'll give this place another chance, but i surely won't get that macaroni dish ever again.", 
            "i've been to mon ami gabi plenty of times -- and so i trusted it would be a  reliable dinner spot last time i was in vegas. (july 25).  \n\nthe patio is generally highly sought after, as it provides a great view of the strip and the bellagio fountains. surprising, even in 100 degree heat, there was an hour wait for the patio.  we elected for the inside and immediate seating.\n\nwe were sat in front of the giant swinging doors where the servers/runners come out with all the food -- which meant that every few seconds the ambient light vanished and all i could see were giant flourescents and an assembly line worth of staff in the kitchen.  i wasn't pleased, but i knew i could \"manage.\"\n\nour server, sarah, was nice enough, although i could tell just how corporatized the restaurant was (i never felt she was talking to me, but rather over me, as though there were too many other important things that needed her attention).  my boyfriend and i only eat organic meat, and so we were turned off by their \"grain-fed\" steaks advertised on the menu.  instead, we went with $100 worth of appetizers and sides. let me preface that all the items were simple items and nothing that required a long cook time.  \n\nwe started with the chips and dip.  my boyfriend and i thought that these sounded good on the menu.  when we got them we thought they were like store bought ruffles.  fellow yelpers, pass on those, unless you are craving a generic potato chip.  (when we asked sarah how they were, she didn't exactly give us an honest answer).\n\ni ordered a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and the bf ordered the tomato salad.  mine was $8.95 and his was $9.95.  his sucked.  the tomatoes tasted mealy and old.  my caesar was definitely better.  i considered it a save from the horrible chips.\n\nwe also ordered the mac and cheese, scallop app, crab cake, and steamed asparagus.  there were 2 tables on either side of us.  each of those tables had their steak dinners looooooonnnngggg before we got the items we ordered.  i even called a manager over to complain as it had been well over 35 minutes since we finished our salads (and unfortunately, the wine hadn't got me buzzed enough to ignore my stomach).\n\nhe quickly brought out the scallops and crab cake -- but no mac and cheese or asparagus.  when i looked at him confused, he said \"was there anything else?\"  i was pretty annoyed.  he then brought out the mac and cheese and their garlic spinach.  i told him i didn't order the garlic spinach and he said \"well why don't you keep it because we'll just throw it out.\" so i did, and he brought the asparagus.\n\nthe crab cake was just ok as was the scallop.  we both have had better.  the mac and cheese was good enough and so was the asparagus.  the \"free\" spinach was horrible.  overly sauteed and buttered.\n\nwhen the bill came, i noticed that i in fact was charged for the \"free spinach\" and then credited for it.  it appeared i was also credited for the asparagus.  i asked the server quite simply,\" after all that you are comping me $7?  it was insulting.\n\ni'll never go back.  i was overly disappointed in the service, the management and the food.\n\nau revoir mon ami gabi.", 
            "service was pretty ok, when we went. there was a bit of confusion with our orders they accidentally put our order in twice. and my friend asked for scissors and they kept bringing out <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.\n\nthe food was decent, i had the salmon with lemon and thyme it was delicious but the portion was extremely small. my other friends had the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, portion wise it was small and unfilling. but she loved that the cauliflower was creamed and made to look like mashed potatoes. my other friends had salads that they said they could've made better on their own. \n\nit was also my friends birthdays and they got free cream puff desserts! this place really isn't that bad, just portions are small.", 
            "i discovered mon ami gabi restaurant during my last visit to vegas. i was so impressed. that during this trip, i made it a point to reserve a spot at this classic french bistro. i think the family agrees that this was an unforgettable experience. \na bagged baguette. is placed on the table and our <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> were served. \nwe all ordered the steak frites\nthe steaks are listed as \"steak\" no particular cut. just steak. nice tender steak. and the french fries were perfectly done.  \nsteaks around the table were, steak roquefort, steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, and steak bearnaise.   \nwith so many steak houses in vegas it surprised me that,.. in a very french way, this place stands on it's own. the grain-fed midwest beef is undoubtedly the best beef i've had in a long time. the service is friendly, efficient, and not snooty in any way. \nif you find yourself in las vegas make it a point to visit mon ami gabi.\n during the summer months, sit out side, under the misters and watch the water show across the street at the bellagio. it's a perfect romantic setting.   \n\nthings to remember\nno matter how close, a hotel looks...it's not. it's all an illusion\ncab everywhere\nthe winter months are frigging cold, take a coat", 
            "meeting up with friends for lunch, we stopped at mon ami gabi restaurant as it was close to another stop we were making. the other 4 were already there (coming from the venetian) and i was on foot coming way down from the luxor. needless to say, i was holding up the crowd. the rest of the party could not be seated or put their name on the list until i arrived as well. when i finally did arrive, we were seated outside on the patio - which was a plus. nice weather, good views - but the table was very small. too small to crowd 5 people around. inevitably, there was frequent bumping from people walking by on their way to and from their tables. \n\ni thought the service was a bit lower than expected. one guy came out to give everyone water. he filled up everyone's glass and when it came to mine there was only enough for 1/3 of a glass. did he get more? no. so i drank it thinking it would be a sign to bring more - but it wasn't. we did receive two sleeves of baguettes. one saucer was filled with the olive oil for dinner and there were four other saucers for people to put their bread - except there were five of us. i had to eventually stop someone and ask for a plate. \n\nlooking over the menu i selected the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. when everyone's plate was brought out everything looked so good. another guy at our table ordered another kind of salad and it was huge - then mine came out. it was one of the smallest, most boring things i have seen ever: a few strips of lettuce, some cheese and a shard of bread - all for the nice price of $9. \n\ni could definitely do without a repeat visit here.", 
            "one of the best places to eat in las vegas, mon ami gabi is the perfect restaurant whether its only you and your significant other, or a group of 8! i came here with a group of friends for my boyfriend's 30th birthday. we had made reservations ahead of time through their website and noted that we were celebrating his birthday and requested a table near the windows so that we would have a view of the bellagio fountains.\n\nwhen we got to the restaurant, we were seated immediately and got a wonderful table inside by the window and the view was amazing! on a side note, if the weather permits it, it is definitely worth it to wait for a table on the outside patio. the restaurant does not reserve these outdoor tables, so it is on a first-come-first-serve basis. but you can still request a table inside with a view.\n\nfresh french bread was brought with some creamed butter and a little bit of something that resembled a reddish pink coleslaw, but it was so tasty with the bread! i ordered a caraffe of the frangria (so delicious) and a bottle of perrier water for the table, and my boyfriend ordered a separate glass of wine. for appetizers, my boyfriend and i shared a <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark>. our friends ordered a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and a french onion soup that had the cheesiest layer of cheese baked right on top!\n\ni ordered the steak classique rare. my boyfriend ordered the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, and our other friend ordered the beef bourguignon. one thing i noticed when they served the beef bourguignon was that the server kept the noodles and beef stew separate and spooned the stew on top of the noodles at our table. it looked and tasted so rich and beefy and stewy! everything looked fantastic! i have to admit that my steak was a little hard to cut and was chewy, but it was because i had ordered it rarer than usual. the finely cut pommes frites were also a perfect addition to my steak. at the end of it all, we decided to get dessert at another place just to explore more sweet options, but the waitress brought us a complimentary profiterole, a pastry that was filled with ice cream  and topped with a candle for my boyfriend! next time i am definitely staying after dinner for an artisan cheese platter or a cr\\u00e8me br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e\n\nmon ami gabi's prices were another big reason i chose to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday there. the prices are very fair for the quality of food, service, and experience you get and also low enough to not break the bank or feel guilty that one of your friends could only afford a glass of water. i will definitely be returning to mon ami gabi to celebrate my birthday!\n\nalthough the service was awesome, the view was phenomenal, and the food tasted great, we still had one gripe: being a very classic french bistro, there simply was not enough food on the plates for both my very american boyfriend and his friend. they ended up leaving and buying a hamburger right after dinner haha! so i recommend mon ami gabi if you and your date aren't too hungry, or with a group of girls. but if you're not into french restaurants with relatively smaller portions, head for the bellagio buffet across the street. : )", 
            "cute little french bistro! it's the perfect place to sit outside in warm weather as well.\n\nit was pretty busy when i went, so i'm not sure if that kind of attributed to the less than impeccable service (hey, i get it. people get tired and overwhelmed so they only lost one star for this.) the other star is for the location. it's conveniently located on the strip and right across from the bellagio and the water fountain, but at the time there was construction going on and the people that were walking by were the obnoxious drunks/people recovering from the night before.\nbut we didn't let that ruin our lunch, we took in the bellagio fountain shows that would come on ever 15-30 minutes and ate our grilled salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>, and mon ami <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and basked in the warm las vegas weather.\n\nultimately, it was pretty good.\nseeing as how we only ordered salads, i can't exactly give them major kudos on their food but the combination of ingredients in the salad were pretty good, and the spinach/lettuce leaves were very fresh.", 
            "not too pricey (for vegas) and great food. very touristy, but hey what places aren't in vegas? i had the delicious trout and <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. good wine selection too.", 
            "man, my list of restaurants i must go to every time i'm in vegas is getting too close to capacity!  \n\ni tried mon ami gabi for the first time last weekend.  the bread.  my god, the bread.  they give you a mini-baguette of hot french bread (free) with butter and a little plate of vinegary shredded vegetables. (we were given one plate of apple slaw, and one plate of carrot.  both were good.)  the bread is heaven, and they didn't even make a face when we asked for more!\n\nwe ordered the warm brie appetizer, onion soup, <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, crab cake, and a side of frites.  as a vegetarian, i was a bit worried there wouldn't be enough options for me, but there were plenty.  they have salads, soups, and a variety of vegetarian sides (like mac and cheese, which i will be getting next time), along with a \"vegetable platter\" entree - doesn't sound very awesome, but who knows.\n\nthe brie was amazing.  i will be recreating it at home shortly.  warm brie with honey, cracked black pepper, and roasted garlic cloves.  perfection.\n\nthe onion soup was also good, my only complaint is that it was too cheesy.  sure, i love cheese, but i'd like some soup with my soup too.\n\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was nothing special, and at $8, i won't be ordering it again.  i know, i know, <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> generally aren't special.  i mean, what can you do with lettuce, croutons, and dressing?  you can add capers, for one thing, as i do at home.  and, this salad was over-dressed.  not horrible, but not worth it.\n\nmy old man said the crab cake was the best he'd ever had, and he has tried crab cakes at many-a-restaurant.\n\nthe frites = in-n-out fry shnivelings.  and yes, that is a good thing.   they are awesome, a must-order!\n\nthe service was quick and friendly, the wait was correctly quoted (30 minutes on a sunday night), and the prices were reasonable.  the whole meal, including tax and tip, was only $60 (plus our two free loaves of bread....).  nice!", 
            "we dined here recently on the 16th, a saturday night, and it was absolutely fantastic.  we didn't have reservations, and were told that an inside table was about a 30minute wait, versus 90minutes for outdoor seating.  we chose to dine indoors.  i know that everyone is raving about the balcony seating, but the inside dining room was well appointed and perfect for a cozy dinner.  the bottles of their wines-by-the-glass sat close by at a serving station, and the server was generous with offering a taste before ordering a full glass.  the baguette in the bag was delicious and came accompanied by both butter as well as a yummy carrot compote.  the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was simple yet quite delicious.  but their famous steak frites are simply to die for.  i had the steak bordelaise, which came smothered in sweet caramelized onions and a red wine reduction, together with a mountain of frites that looked like shredded homemade potato chips -- airy and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  it was simply too much food to finish so i couldn't try any of their desserts.  next time! and oh boy, absolutely no question about it there will be a next time! each time i'm in vegas, baby!", 
            "a perfect choice to enjoy delicious food with a great view. their outdoor seating is ideal on a beautiful day. \n\ni started with a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and my boyfriend had their french onion soup. the salad was fine but not great, the soup was very cheesy. i'm not a big fan of onions, but it was quite tasty. our starters were good, but i couldn't stop eating their delicious french bread! they also brought us some very good apple and fennel salad. \n\nwe are both steak lovers and we had some of the best steak here. we opted for the filet mignon and it was the most tender steak ever! he ordered the filet with merlot butter and i ordered their filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>. mine was great, but my boyfriend's steak was even better! their frites were very good as well. don't expect fries, they're more like chips. we each had a glass of pinot noir to accompany our meals. \n\nfor dessert, i ordered their bread pudding which was moist and delicious and my boyfriend tried their bananas foster crepe. we also had their cafe gabi. it is coffee with bailey's, grand marnier and frangelico. yum!\n\nthis is definitely a place we plan on revisiting. very soon!", 
            "bottom line: there are enough good things about mon ami gabi to deserve a four star review based on our dinner there last week. with so many restaurants in las vegas on the strip, this is not one we'd necessarily seek out again unless it was a matter of convenience and timing that led us there.  but the outdoor patio seating provides a great opportunity for people watching and seeing the bellagio fountain both, the food is good and the prices reasonable by las vegas standards.  so we're glad we went and can easily recommend it.\n\nseating: we were a group of ten and we wanted an outdoor table so some of the folks involved  who had not been to las vegas before could watch the bellagio fountains, right across the street, as they had dinner. \n\nreservations are not taken for outdoor seating, and it was impressive that they could cobble together a table for ten with only about a 30 minute wait at 6:30. but what we learned from this is that mon ami gabi's outdoor patio seating is probably best for couples or groups up to six just for the logistics of putting tables together. \n\nservice: the restaurant was hopping inside and out and yet service was efficient for taking the orders and getting the food to the right diners and served at the right temperature. not particularly friendly, but efficient worked in this case. \n\nfood: for a las vegas restaurant the range of choices, all with a french bistro bent, was impressive and the prices seemed more reasonable than other comparable places on the strip. \n\nas example, a duck confit small plate that included a good dried cherry garnish was only about $11 and plenty for an entree for a light eater. same with the crab cake served with a small slaw type salad for about $15. same for the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> that was about $10. steaks (served with pommes frites) for roughly $25.00 each. scallop entree was about $30. and so on. meals included some really good, crusty baguette set in the middle of the table in paper bags at the start. \n\nvalue:  total bill for ten, excluding cocktails but including a couple of beers, a couple of coffees and a soft drink,  was about $230.  a bargain by strip standards. \n\nlibations: while we waited on our table, some of us adjourned to the (tiny) indoor bar for a cocktail. my hubby said his maker's mint julep was very good and my sidecar was one of the best i've had. cousins in law had good things to say about their rum and cokes and whiskey and sodas. cousin in law who picked up the tab said they were spendy. as i recall, five cocktails topped $60. \n\nambiance: the outdoor patio can be fun, for the reasons named in the start of this review. the indoor portion of the restaurant is actually quite large and seating in some of it offers a white tablecloth, cozy bistro ambiance. but, the indoor seating adjacent to the outdoor bar is not the best in the place...not the charm of inside and not the view perspective of outside and with a lot of traffic through it from wait staff and diners. so we'd recommend avoiding this section of the restaurant.\n\nreservation note:  if you make a reservation (indoor seating only) you will need to provide a credit card.  two hour in advance cancellation is required or your credit card will be charged $50 per head of the reservation. (example, for a reservation for six people the default charge is $300.)  this isn't the only restaurant in las vegas to employ a similar tactic (mesa as example does something similar).  but may be helpful to know this in advance.", 
            "although we had to wait 30 minutes for a table, it was well worth it. we sat outside, which is beautiful and great for people watching. i ordered a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and within what seemed like five minutes it was on the table. it was delicious, i loved the cheese and dressing. i also ordered the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>. i'm a big sucker for quiche, my grandmother made it countless times for me when i was little and i have to say eating this quiche sent me back to my childhood. it was amazing..and incredibly filling. i couldn't even finish all of it!\n\nour waiter was very friendly and attentive. not only that but the food comes out so quickly that i barely had time to finish my <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> before my lunch was served. my boyfriend got the warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>. it had thin slices of apple and caramelized onions on top. absolutely delicious.  all in all a great experience, great food and an elegant yet not pretentious atmosphere. when we go back to vegas we will definitely be dining here again.", 
            "this review is long overdue.  i have a meal at mag every time i am in vegas, which is three times a year.  i have never had a disappointing meal here.  last night, before we went to see jubilee, we had dinner at mag.  i love the atrium room in the evening.  the lights are low, but not so low that you can't see anything.  and having the b fountains as a backdrop is perfect. \n\nservice at mag is top notch, very attentive without being intrusive.  i love to sit in server #100's section - he's great, kinda reminds me of chef robert ivrine.\n\nanyway, this time the order was:\n\nsteak bordelaise:  the steak was cooked to perfection topped with carmelized onions in a red wine sauce.  oh yeah.\nmag <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>:  just the right amount of dressing, fresh romaine and shavings of pecorino cheese.\n<mark>Trout Almondine</mark>:  seared to succulent goodness with just a crispness around the edges, covered with green beans.\nto start there was a celery, green apple slaw tossed in olive oil and the baguette with butter.\n\nwhat a wonderful meal, what a wonderful atmosphere in a wonderful city.\n\nthanks, mag!", 
            "came here for a romantic dinner before my boyfriend and i went to see le reve.  absolutely a perfect experience.  i highly recommend making a reservation, as this is a very popular spot right across from the bellagio.  apart from the ambience and the impeccable service, i have to say this place deserves a 5 star review for the food alone.  \n\ntogether, we ordered the filet mignon with the merlot butter sauce, the mac n cheese (macaroni a gratinee if you want to be particular), the mussels, the drink special \"frangia,\" the french pun on sangria much appreciated, the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, and the creme puffs for a perfectly sweet ending.  \n\ni would go into much more detail about how delicious these dishes were, but really words could not do it justice.  just go, eat, enjoy, and sit back while your waistband continues to expand.", 
            "nice view of bellagio and the watershow, romantic environment, friendly staff, and great food!\n\ni just wish it wasn't so darn expensive =/ a plate of small <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> is already $9!", 
            "mon ami gabi, located in the paris las vegas \n\nmy husband and i decided to come here on our most recent trip to las vegas before catching jersey boys (now at the paris.)  reservations, while not required, definitely expedited our wait.  \n\nyes, there was still a little bit of a wait, even with reservations.  probably about 15 minutes on a saturday night, so not too bad at all.  \n\nthe bottled beer selection is pretty extensive as is the cocktail list.  \n\nmy husband was happy with his steak bearnaise and we both loved the fries.  i had the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, which was tasty.  the dressing was light and mild and my only complaint was that the salad was very small.  it should be listed as an appetizer salad, but i was under the impression that it was entree sized.  \n\nthe service was a little bit slow, but our waitress was adorable, friendly, and helpful when she was serving us.  \n\nmake sure you follow the dress code, i saw some people being turned away for dressing too casually.  \n\noverall, good food, great location, and i would dine there again.", 
            "i kinda feel bad for giving this place a 3-star rating, but here goes.\n\ni've wanted to try this place forever, and although i knew i should have come here for breakfast, it just wasn't happening with the party i was with.\n\nwe came here for dinner on a friday night, 7 pm.  we had reservations through open table, but really, it looked like you didn't need one.\n\nwe were seated in semi-outdoor area that was clear but protected from passerby, smoke, etc.  the view of the water show at the bellagio was great.\n\nbaguettes with a little bruschetta and butter came out.  the food was taking a bit long to come out, so thank goodness that was there.  our waiter wasn't exactly the most friendly person but at least went through the motions.  the south point for me was when one of the people in my party, a diabetic, asked that his frites be substituted with some green salad or something with his filet mignon.  the waiter told him he couldn't \"we don't do that\", and said he'd have to order a side of spinach or something on the side and kept saying that they'd charge for it.  nowhere on the menu did i see \"no substitutions,\" and if there is even a gluten-free menu, i'd expect they'd be a little more considerate in swapping fries for a few measley leaves.\n\nspeaking of measley leaves... another person in my party ordered a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> -- now, these salads aren't cheap -- about $17-$19, and it was honestly one of the smallest i had ever seen -- no crutons, either.  i got the seared ahi tuna salad, which was comparably small with only three pretty small pieces of kind of grey ahi tuna.  i've had this dish at other, less fancy places and got bigger and better tuna.  i didn't really eat a lot of the salad because it otherwise was just average in taste.\n\nto their credit, the chicken dishes, <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>, pate mousse, and filet mignon seemed to be enjoyed by the rest of my party.  of course, everything was smothered in butter, seemingly.  also, the frites that came with many of the dishes were like shavings of fries and not really good, in my opinion.\n\ni'd come here again for the breakfast, but the dinner was pretty disappointing to me.  i guess we paid for the view.", 
            "the service was amazing, the decor was great as well as the view on the patio but the food did not meet my expectations. i was in a party of 7, and we came here for a late lunch. we did not have any reservations, but they were able to seat us within 5 minutes. \n\nour server offered us bread and whipped butter. the bread was really hard, but hot and the butter made everything taste better! my friend and i split a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> along with steak bordelaise and i was pretty much in disbelief when the salad came out. it's a very, very, very small serving for $10. it tasted fine, you can't go wrong with <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. when i got the steak bordelaise i was also disappointed. there was barely any color on the plate besides brown, and branch of some leaf they put on the plate. it did not look appetizing, nor was the steak good. it was hard and the only thing good about the dish was the caramelized onions. the fries weren't that amazing either. i really wish they would pair their steak frites up with veggies instead of just an enormous serving of fries. \n\nother people in our party ordered the natural <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark>, chicken broccoli and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark>, grilled salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>, a cheeseburger and chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>. the best dishes out of those would be the chicken, broccoli and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> along with the grilled salmon salad. \n\nnot sure if i would be back, i expected it the food to be a little better considering that it is a french restaurant with prices on the higher end, but it was a good experience.", 
            "yummm !\n\nso the last 2 times i've been to vegas, i've eaten at this place. the first time i was brought by a cold tofu classmate that recently moved to the area. its a nice french style steakhouse that serves steaks, sandwiches, seafood and the like. walking in here really reminded me of my wonderful time in france and of all my amazing journeys. it seriously took me home :*)\n\nthe first time i was here, i tried the french onion soup, moules-frites and the escargot.\n\nnow, i must say that since walking into this place brought back so many intense memories of happier times, i was really setting the bar high for the food. maybe a little too high? if i were to compare my dishes to those i tried in france, then i must say that the food was just mediocre at best. \n\nthe french onion soup was definitely wayy too salty to be consumed without the amazingly fresh bread that they brought out to our table. we asked for bread about 6 times throughout our meal, and every time, it came fresh outta the oven and piping hot. that's how bread should be (: on the plus side, if you're a poor college student coming to vegas to party and want a slice of the good life, you could always come and order a bowl of french onion soup and dip it with the bottomless bread they have here. that would definitely get you full while letting you basque in the french ambience for a while. just saying (;\n\nmy mussels were also a tad on the fishy side, the sauce a bit too salty for my liking but my fries were outta this world deeelicious ! although, i must say that they are definitely not french style frites. these fries are sliced thinner than usual and so they are crispy all around, and stay that way throughout your whole meal ! (even 3 hours later back in our room at planet hollywood !) \n\nmy escargot was also on the saltier side (seriously, i used to smoke, so i definitely don't eat my food bland. if everything i ordered was too salty for my taste than something's gotta give), but i think it had to be like that to help cover the \"unfresh\" aroma of the actual snail. once again, that's where the bread came in handy ! the herb butter sauce that the escargot was prepared in was super flavorful, it just had a handful too many pinches of salt and so it needed the super carb of the bread to help soak it up.\n\nthat night, the friend that brought me had ordered a steak bearnaise on my recommendation. (it was one of my favorites in france, along with the steak roquefort. nommm) the bearnaise was a bit thin, but the flavor was spot on. and it came with a side of their amazing frites that just complete the meal.\n\njust a month later i decided to take the fam here for lunch during labor day weekend. there wasn't a wait, which was amazing for a saturday at 12 ! they seated us in the bright dining area with open windows, and ac blasted on high ! it felt so great to be able to be seated \"outdoors\" without the 100 degree plus weather.\n\nthe menu is different for lunch, as it should be i suppose ! the entrees are a lot lighter, and there are more salads and sandwiches to choose from. we ordered the tuna melt, <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>, bacon cheeseburger, and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. every sandwich/burger came an order of delicious fries ! i believe the only sandwich that stood out among all of our choices would have to be the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. it was flavorful, the steak was tender and the side of au jus to dip had just the right amount of kick to it ! i believe it was a grainy mustard that made the difference ! the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was a total disappointment, i believe there were literally 8 bites of overdressed salad for $10 and we could have added another 2 and just got another burger or sandwich. will definitely never order a salad form here again. i would have been much happier with wendy's caesar side salad for $1 ! that's how bad it was :/\n\nanyway, i know that i will definitely be back to visit this wonderful place again sometime in the future to try their <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> ! i saw a couple eating it together and it looked so scrump-diddly-umptious ! hahahaha, definitely needa find a bf to take me here for that one day (;\nhappy eating !", 
            "we've been here a few times in the past for lunch and keep coming back.  this place is really good and we always leave happy.  we ordered the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> (sandwich), steak bordelaise, and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.  all were great and the servers were very attentive as well.  they have outside seating too, which is perfect at lunch time in november.  the sun was out and temperature at lunch was in the low 70's.  if you go on a sunday, the fountains at the bellagio just across the way provide added entertainment too.  we love this place.", 
            "love this place!  we've eaten here a few times- breakfast, lunch and dinner. \n\nour most recent experience was for lunch. fantastic seating outside on the strip, beautiful view and weather.  a great place to take a break from gambling. \n\nour waiter was charming and attentive, great service. \n\nstarted with the classic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>....yum.  we had the fish and chips- simply amazing.  the fish is served as one thin filet with a wonderful crust and pan seared - not your traditional heavy battered deep fried fish. also had the ham and cheese - delicious. \n\ntop it off with a nice sauvignon blanc and its a wonderful lunch!\n\nyou have to eat here!", 
            "i'm certain that every single person that has been to vegas have at one point or another noticed this restaurant. it's really hard to miss with their gorgeous sidewalk cafe with a great view of the bellagio fountains. my family and i ate here for our little brother's birthday. i have to give them a lot of credit for service because we gave them an almost impossible feat. due to poor time management on our part, we had a little over an hour before we had to get to our show. our server somehow managed to expedite our food and we were able to get to our show on time. \n\nwe started with the classic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and their house bread which came with some carrot slaw. i actually didn't care for it much. it was really ordinary and i've definitely had better at a much lower caliber restaurant. the bread was good though and so was the carrot slaw that came with it. for our entrees, we ordered the fish and chips, the cheeseburger with frites, and roasted chicken. sounds like ordinary dishes but they were executed perfectly. everything was seasoned nicely, and cooked right. the fish was really good. probably the best piece of fish i've had at a restaurant. my little brother enjoyed his chicken dish and pretty much inhaled it. i think the frites here are pretty special. i haven't had fries quite like these before. thin and perfectly crispy. loved them. \n\ni want to come back and have a longer meal next time. come check it out because it's well worth the money. next time,  brunch it is! 4/5",

            "this place is awesome!  actually ended up eating dinner here twice on my 3-day trip to vegas last month. nothing beats sitting on the patio, overlooking the strip.. great views & great people-watching! thoroughly enjoyed a steak frites plate on my first visit.. the strip steak was cooked to perfection and the fries were delicious.  on my second visit i enjoyed gabi's martini, which was terrific. the highlight of all my time at mon ami gabi? the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>! absolutely, hands-down the best dish out there. the flatbread, the sauce, and the cheese make the perfect combo. only wish it was served with more bread!  i also had the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and an order of 6 oysters on the half shell which were in special that night... everything was great! a very memorable evening, can't wait to return!", 
            "great atmosphere outside, right across from the bellagio fountains and great for people watching. \nmy drink of choice was the frangria! the french twist on sangria! it wasn't too sweet and not much fruit in the drink itself, except for some orange slices, but it was good. i ordered a second round. \nfood was ordered. appetizers included escargot - it came in a delicious garlicy sauce perfect for dipping the bread in. could probably make this a meal with the bread and amazing sauce! i tried one of the snails too and it really doesn't taste like anything. but daaaaamn, that sauce!!! nom nom nom! \ni had a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and it was nothing to rant and rave about. when it hit the table i was actually rather disappointed with the presentation and how plain it looked. the french onion soup wasn't too bad, the usual saltiness and nice and cheesy.\nfor my entree i of course had to order the scallops! i was actually not impressed with the scallops at all. i ate two of them and had the rest boxed up. normally no matter how full i am, i would devour my scallops. they were just so-so. not as tender, buttery, awesomely-delicious as ones i've had in the past. \nfriend ordered the special, bacon wrapped filet medallions with fingerling potatoes. i like bacon, but i really don't care for bacon wrapped foods. i tried a piece with the bacon on it and wasn't really impressed. then i tried a piece without the bacon and it tasted a lot better to me. \nfor dessert we ordered the chocolate mousse which was okay. it came with these little chocolate crunchy balls on top that i didn't care for too much, but the mousse itself wasn't bad. \nthere was also white chocolate bread pudding which was good! i've had bread pudding before and never really liked it but this one was actually delish. \ni believe my dessert was the best one out of the three: the banana's foster crepe! so so good with the caramel, sliced bananas and vanilla ice cream! it was fresh tasting and awesome! nom nom!", 
            "this was my first time dining here in about 4 years and my hopes were way up. i remember the fish and chips being one of the best things i've had. since i was back in vegas with my boyfriend i raved about how much we had to go. well when i visited last night i was extremely disappointed. the fish was very bland and the chips seemed a little hard and old. i'm not sure what changed over the years but it was not a change for the better. we were seated quickly because we ate inside and the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and baguette were very good. thus the 2 stars and not 1. our bill was $65 for dinner and so not worth it. there are so many better restaurants to spend that kind of money on. i will not be visiting or recommending again.", 
            "upon arrival at our reservation time we were immediately shown to a table in the inside area which is pretty dark and tends to be noisy. additionally it was located adjacent to a door (i think of the swinging type) with a serving cart occupying some of the table space. rather than sitting down i asked for another table. we were shown to a table in the atrium area (brighter and quieter) which while smaller was significantly better situated. it turned out to be very fine. both couples shared <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which were ample and very tasty. the baguette bread they make in house is wonderful and always served fresh and hot. for entrees we ordered two steak frites bordelaise, one hanger steak, and the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>. while the steak frites were good, the hanger steak my wife ordered was tastier. the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> my friend's wife ordered were very good and of course their signature hand cut fries are outstanding. my friend ordered the green beans but after the salad course was told they were out. he then ordered saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms which arrived halfway through the entr\\u00e9e. five minutes later they brought a second order of mushrooms. when we informed the waitress that we already had one order she took the second order back. i'm not sure who those belonged to or went to. they formerly offered a plate of three small profiteroles (cream puff pastry filled with vanilla ice cream and covered in warm chocolate sauce) for dessert but now it's a single grand profiterole which looks like a chocolate covered jumbo burger. we shared one and thought it was ok but i recall the smaller ones they formerly offered as being more tasty thanks to a softer puff. all in all a good meal at a reliable, fairly priced strip restaurant.", 
            "this place was delightful! we went here for a late lunch and wanted to eat outside, and we barely had a 10minute wait. we ordered the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>,the <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. everything was delicious!! i wanted to go there again but my friend insisted on trying different places. i almost went there by myself when she left because it was so good. it is across from the bellagio fountain so besides people watching (which you can do anywhere in vegas) there was always a little fountain show going on. highly recommend!",

            "very decent steakhouse. most people are here for the view but if you don't want to wait, they offer opentable reservation for indoor seating (no view).  i opted for the latter as i did not want to wait nor i care about the view since i have been to vegas countless times.  we were seated immediately and the servers were very efficient taking care our orders and rush it for us per our request.\n\nthe meal itself was fine, not stellar but up to the point. very solid 4 stars dining.  escargot was meh, too watery but lack of the real chewy escargot taste to it.  <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was good, again not memorable. we opted for the famous hanger steak with our choice of dressing/sauce (my recommendation - get peppercorn dressing).  it compliment the steak well.  for the price, i think it is quite a good value in vegas!\n\ndon't order their oyster, it was bad.", 
            "my husband and i have eaten here many times and we are always greeted with smiling faces. we dined this past friday night and got a table on the rail ~ we love to people watch. \n\nour server was sean and he gave us good recommendations. we had the jumbo crab cake, escargot, <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, and for our entrees i had the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> and my husband had the filet. everything was delicious, service was impeccable, and we had a fabulous time. \n\na must go to when in vegas!"

            "amazing french restaurant in the paris hotel. lots of choices for steak and seafood, but delicious appetizers <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> too. very extensive, although pricy, wine list as well. but, you must try the french onion soup, it was my favorite thing on the menu the multiple times i've gone there. (ok fine, by multiple i mean twice. but i plan on going there more.) and apparently amazing seats for the bellagio water show. but it's too cold right now for that (december) so for now, sit inside until spring rolls around.", 
            "i went to this restaurant by myself and was about to be seated in a table in a corner with no view. i promptly requested another table. \n\nafter i got a better table, i sat down and promptly served with a warm mini baguette with whipped warm butter. i was happy. this is a restaurant who's smart to warm their butter. honestly, why do some restaurants serve chilled, cold butter i do not understand, particularly those who serve cold butter with room temperature bread. why? \n\nanyway, back to the bread. \n\nstarving, i broke part of the baguette and smeared it with butter. oh my god.. when you're hungry, eating a warm baguette that's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, smeared with warm whipped butter is to die for. my mouth was so happy. the waitstaff put a small pat of minced garlic for the bread but i prefer sugar with my bread and butter. haven't tried the bread-butter-sugar yet? try it. it's very good. the sugar needs to be the refined, regular sugar though. sweet n low, splenda and all the fake sugar crap won't cut it.\n\nmm.. mmm. i ordered the appetizer (melted cheese with marinara sauce with garlic toasted bread) <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> (roasted pear with bleu cheese, walnuts and mix of greens).\n\nthe melted cheese was good, but i wished it was real cheese rather than <mark>Warm Triple Cream Cheese</mark>. the salad was superb. i was too full to order dessert even though i really wanted to try their banana foster. \n\nthis restaurant has one of the best location in las vegas. imagine dining on the terrace on a nice evening with the bellagio waterworks in action. next time i have to bring my dad here since he loves watching the bellagio waterworks.\n\nnice.", 
            "a nice french restaurant at the paris resort.  my friends and i went there for brunch during our weekend in vegas and were completely satisfied with everything.\n\nwhat initially peaked our interest was the bloody mary bar.  two of my friends partook and went and created their own bloody maries.  when you arrive, they provide baguettes in the paper bags you would receive if you bought them at a boulangerie in france.  \n\ni had a <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> with fries and a mimosa.  the sandwich was good and so was the mimosa.  the fries were unique.  they were cut very thin.  my friends ordered other sandwiches <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> and everyone was very happy with their meal.  \n\nwe sat outside b/c it was a beautiful, sunny afternoon.  the staff let us linger at the table for two hours as we ate, drank and laughed.  since paris is across the street from the bellagio, we were able to witness the musical fountain shows every 1/2 an hour.  it made us laugh to watch the fountains soar into the sky to the voice of celine dion.  \n\ngreat food, friendly staff, good drinks.  would return when in the mood for french food.", 
            "this is an example of another reason vegas is a difficult place for a normal person.  the entire experience was, frankly, magical.  the service was a bit obsequious, but she was lovely, friendly, and warm.\n\nthis is a casual eatery we walked into in paris and had no reservations.  it was a saturday night, and we were sat by a lovely, romantic window within seconds.\n\nthe atmosphere was incredible.... across from the bellagio water show, and next to a window in a romantically lit restaurant that had a wonderful aesthetic... tiled floors (slippery in heels), lovely deep wooden grain finish on the classic bar.  it was as close to a dimly lit french bistro as you might find out of france.\n\nthe food was awesome.... \n\nthe oysters had one of the best mignonette's i have ever had.  for las vegas, oyster country (sarcasm button on), they were fresh and shucked decently.  luckily, nothing like andy k.\n\nthe endive and blue <mark>Warm Goat <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark></mark> with watercress and roasted pear was sublime.  the french onion soup was great.  again, i don't like it sweeter than smoky or \"zesty\"... but it was great.\n\nthe salade maison was very good, but the presentation of the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and croutons being the piece of toast with cheese spread ontop of it was confusing... in that lauren ate that without realizing that was the \"<mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> & croutons\" inherent to the salad.\n\nthe french martini was great (grey goose with pineapple, champagne, and chambord....)\n\nthe french 75 was perfect.  i subbed beefeater for the sapphire, and it was just awesome.  awesome!\n\nbut being on the strip, even a casual, non reservation type of meal... the bill came to $140 or something.  1 app, 2 salads, 4 cocktails, one soup.... $140.\n\ni know it is demanding to ask vegas to be cheap, but to sit for a couple apps <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> and see a bill like that is just... disheartening.\n\nso... go to vegas with money.  please please shove cost out of your head prior to sitting down anywhere.\n\nbecause vegas is pricey.  check out my las vegas as to why.... but it isn't just expensive.  i work in fine dining and high end hotels, and the price point is at least 20%-35% over a normal meal.  \n\nas long as you recognize that, even a casual, spur of the moment meal can be magical, romantic, delicious, and stunning.\n\ni would go back here in a second, with the awareness i wish i had previously had.  i think having not been to vegas much, it is something i simply need to plan for across the board.", 
            "this place is pretty awesome! great outdoor seating with great views of the bellagio water show.  \n\ni've been here for lunch and dinner.  the bread they serve you is warm and good.\n\nfor lunch, tried the sea <mark>Scallops Gratinees</mark> appetizer and this was soo awesome!! i could've ate the whole dish to myself.  tender <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> filled with tons of carmelized onions and the sauce complemented it soo well! i love the scallops that were more well done with a lil burnt cheese covered on top... yum!!\n\nalso tried the cheeseburger with brie, which was similar to any other burger.  the fries here were french style and super thin.  not my thing since the'yre wayy too oily.\n\nthe chicken and gruyere crepes were good.  the <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> it comes with is tiny though.  the dough is heavy, so i just ended up eating all the chicken inside, which was pretty tender.\n\nfrangria is just like sangria... nothing new here.\n\nfor dinner, the salmon & <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> was good.  decent salmon fillet.  orange and grapefruit pieces went well with the salad.\n\nthe french style steaks were awesome!! large portion cooked to order! \nthe steak bordelaise with onions and red wine sauce was soo good! the steak bearnaise was the same!  however, i wasn't as fond of this sauce.  \n\noverall, the food is great!  service was on and off.  the atmosphere was very nice, and the scenery was one of the best....  watching the bellagio water shows in a french inspired atmosphere, what more can u ask for!! :d", 
            "okay, so i'm probably not a prime candidate to make an interesting review of mon ami gabi, but what the heck... the reason being is that i had their cheeseburger... it was awesomely awesome!  some of the other items had at our table were, fish, filet mignons, chicken, vegetarian <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>.  everyone said that they liked the food and the presentation was great!  \n\nmy burger was really tender and cooked to perfection, the bun was tender (a bit big), i had mine with gruyere cheese and that was a nice touch and added some great flavor.  \n\nthe main reason that i wanted to write this review is to rave about the fries (or frittes i believe they're called)... they're the craziest thing ever!  they were like a hybrid of a french fry and a potato chip, but soft, yet crunchy... i can't even explain it, they were so good i could have had a meal just entirely of those!  i also did try my wife's hanger steak and it wasn't too bad either, tender and juicy for  sure!  \n\ntheir menu was smaller and not a lot of dishes that stood out to me... i really didn't give it a thorough read over, because i was in the mood for a big ol' juicy messy sloppy burger!\n\noverall, really cool atmosphere, nice and friendly servers/waitstaff  and excellent fries.....", 
            "we go here every time we are in vegas! we love to sit outside and watch the people and fountains. \n\nthe food and wine is always good. \n\nthis time i had a simple soup <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> - \nfrench onion was excellent and the salad was the blue cheese on frissee that was okay. \n\ni ordered a white bordeaux - my favorite white - but they had to substitute the wine and it was just okay. \n\nthis dinner will take about 2-3 hours so enjoy the time and scenery!", 
            "made reservations nearly a month in advance for dinner for 4, and looked forward to the experience because i had eaten here once before and loved it. but this time - yuk! \n\nfirst, server appeared before we had even fully sat down (i was still trying to figure out where to set my purse) and asked what we wanted to drink. told her we needed a few mintues - bad move as she did not return for a full 20 minutes. we had chosen a bottle of wine and an appetizer for the table, but she refused to take the appetizer request until she went and got the wine! when she returned with the wine she proceeded to fill my glass nearly to the brim. this is a pet peeve of mine. when i spend $80 for a bottle of wine i want it poured correctly so that there is room in the glass to aerate it and develop the flavor.\n\nanyway, we remind her of the appetizer we want and order our meals. appetizer never came. waited 25 minutes <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> arrived. told her we never got the appetizer we ordered and she said, \"oh sorry, we won't charge you for it then\". less than 5 minutes later the entrees arrived and she tried to take the salads away even though we had barely had a chance to touch them!\n\nwe had ordered the steaks cooked \"medium\" and they came cold in the middle. returned them for more cooking - another 20 minutes go by. finally she delivers the steaks again and also the bill! we mention that we just might want to look at a dessert menu once we have finished the meal, so she runs right off and brings one to us.\n\nwe try to eat the rest of our meal, while she continually visits the table to ask if she can take plates away and if we want dessert. when we do finish she is nowhere to be seen. we give up and pay the bill and go elsewhere for dessert.\n\nthis evening was pretty much a total loss. was embarrassed because i picked the restaurant and was telling my friends how good it was. i'll think twice before going here again. there's just too many good restaurants in vegas to take a chance on this one again.", 
            "this is a really cute brunch place, and an excellent alternative to buffets if you so incline.  we stopped in saturday morning (ok, who am i kidding, it was afternoon) with a group of seven and were seated promptly.\n\none or more of us was definitely hungover.  sat down, one quickly asked for orange juice.  and hash browns.  cuz that's all he wanted.  the waitress must be used to this.  she put in our orders right away, and our food came shortly after.\n\n<mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=p2jfy0riunbvogmqsra6zq) and <mark>Cobb Salad</mark> (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=5ohxwa2qm86xsmbqoisfvq) were both fresh, with the right amount of dressing.  good portion if you're not super hungry but feel the need to eat something so you're not starving an hour later.\n\nhamburger with a fried egg on top (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=_ctkpcyf6wjyliggwuo87q).  amazing texture, cooked to order.  comes with a side of skinny fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=eud7yxhwucaizvduyqhy6g).\n\nthe fruit platter (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=pxcw7s7uc9yorpu9rru-7a).  pretty to look at, hard to eat.  definitely hard to share.  false advertisement!\n\nthe rest got the corned beef hash, with a side of hash browns (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=smi354sdqzfhbitcvyufbq).  huge portions, but didn't stop any of them from wolfing it all down!\n\ngood spot to watch the bellagio water show, too :)", 
            "on a chilly night got a table on the patio. heat lamps kept it comfortable. had a nice view of the bellagio fountains. told the waiter of my wife's gluten allergy and he said \"don't worry, we'll take care of it\".  they swapped out the walnut date bread on the cheese board with some rice flour crisps that were excellent. i had the oyster cream soup, superb. we both had salmon, mine in a <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> and hers on a bed of yukon gold potatoes and onions. both were awesome. we shared a very good bottle of ros\\u00e9 and the bill came to only $108. service was attentive yet inconspicuous. considering the setting, quality, service and price, i have to give this 5 stars, it's a fantastic option for a romantic meal in vegas at a reasonable price.", 
            "fantastic food! great service. we had the warm brie with roasted garlic (the garlic was roasted in someting that made it sweet and a bit crunchy). this was soooo good. next we had the roast beef sandwich w/fries (almost like thin sliced french fries) <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> with salmon. both excellent. dessert - creme brulee. very good, but not the best i've had. service was exceptional. would like to try other menu items. would definitely go back!", 
            "i love this restaurant!! my friends and i were staying at paris and we decided we wanted to come here for dinner for my friend sharmendra's birthday. we came on a tuesday night  and it was pretty crowded. we thought that we would have to wait but we ended up getting seated right away. it was dark which gave the restaurant a very intimate ambiance. \n\nas we were seated, we were greeted right away and someone took our drinks. after about sitting for 15 minutes, our server came to to greet us. after taking our orders, we waited another 15 to 20 minutes to get our food. i had ordered the sea seared scallops. they were quite delectable! i had never tasted anything like this in my life! i was very satisfied with the quality. my friend jennifer ordered the hangover steak, which she thought was divine. michelle had ordered the french onion soup and the crab cakes. she was very content with what she had ordered. sharmendra ordered the grilled salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>. it looked so good from afar and he agreed. we were all pleased with our food selections. \n\ni would have given this place 5 stars, but the service was not all that great. our server only returned once after we had received our food and he wasn't that friendly. but overall, the food was very delightful and the atmosphere was very relaxing.", 
            "i am not into french food per se but man o man! delish! of course they had a great wine selection. i had the fish special which was trout. i am very picky about fish - i don't like to order it away from the coast but lv is the exception. i also usually only like ahi, swordfish etc. \"safe fish\". i was feeling adventurous and at the coaxing of a local (aka my aunt) ordered with much reservation. i have been thinking about that meal for 2 week and as i am in lv once again- i am going back. the salads were great...i had a nice <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>. also- they have a niceeee rose wine. not white zin blechhhh. the real deal is nice. perfect for a warm evening dinner when you don't want white, you don't want red. people that know what i am saying know what i am saying here. by the way, if you are looking at my reviews and saying oh she gives high marks to everyone...i don't. i just don't have time to comment on all the mediocre spots. so if i write about something its because it should be written about.",

(whipped cauliflower very good!)\nduring lunch, they do a good veggie burger.\nmy favorite thing right now at this place is the warm brie cheese with honey and pepper and frangria (french sangria) - so good.\n\ncan be very romantic as you are right across the bellagio fountain show and under the eiffel tower. great atmosphere!", 
            "i have walked past this restaurant many times...thinking it would be way too pricey...but by default of my party, we ended up here and really loved it!  there was a longer wait to sit outside to watch the bellagio fountain show...so we ended up inside and had a great view with no wait! a few of us had the <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> with grilled salmon ($17) and another member had the roasted duck ($25).  portions were generous and we could have easily shared a plate.  we all loved our dishes and would definitely eat here again and again! as for dress code - we were casual - i think the only rule is no bare feet or sleeveless t-shirts for men (collared t's ok)...and for the \"warm fresh-baked bread\" lovers - si!", 
            "cute little french bistro! it's the perfect place to sit outside in warm weather as well.\n\nit was pretty busy when i went, so i'm not sure if that kind of attributed to the less than impeccable service (hey, i get it. people get tired and overwhelmed so they only lost one star for this.) the other star is for the location. it's conveniently located on the strip and right across from the bellagio and the water fountain, but at the time there was construction going on and the people that were walking by were the obnoxious drunks/people recovering from the night before.\nbut we didn't let that ruin our lunch, we took in the bellagio fountain shows that would come on ever 15-30 minutes and ate our grilled salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>, and mon ami <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and basked in the warm las vegas weather.\n\nultimately, it was pretty good.\nseeing as how we only ordered salads, i can't exactly give them major kudos on their food but the combination of ingredients in the salad were pretty good, and the spinach/lettuce leaves were very fresh.", 
            "i was quite excited when i learned that mon ami gabi served breakfast and brunch. we had eaten here, years ago, for lunch and dinner - and both were good experiences.\n\neven though it was a little chilly, we opted to have our saturday breakfast outside on the patio (they have heaters). the menu looked great. i appreciated that they offered some non-breakfast items (french onion soup, <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>, etc.) in addition to the more typical breakfast items. the breakfast items ranged from omelettes to chocolate and bacon waffles to sweet and savory crepes.\n\nwe decided to play it somewhat safe and go with an omelette. i liked that their omelettes had what felt like a french-twist (brie, etc.). when our omelette arrived, everything looked delectable. the omelette came with hash browns, green beans (yeah, green beans), and toasted bread. we also ordered a side of bacon. \n\nthe omelette was very light and fluffy - cooked perfectly. while it had a lot of spinach, i tasted little cheese. and despite being advertised as \"spinach and green vegetables\", it was just spinach. 2 stars. the green beans (seriously, green beans) were outstanding. i don't know what they were cooked in (there seemed to be a hint of garlic?), but they were awesome. 5 stars. the hash browns were also great. good balance of crispy and soft - and there were a lot of flavors going on. definitely no need for hot sauce or ketchup or anything. 4 stars. the bacon looked amazing, but was a bit of a let down. the glaze was incredible, but the bacon itself wasn't crisp enough (despite the menu calling it \"crispy bacon\") and was too fatty. 2 stars.\n\nthe drinks were nothing special. the mimosa was just your standard mimosa. the bloody mary bar (they bring you the glass and vodka, you visit the ingredient station and create your own drink) was pretty eh. they had standard bloody mary mixes in ice, ok selection of hot sauces, no worcestershire sauce, not enough tongs for everything, etc. 2 stars.\n\ni so want to give this place 4 stars, but based on our particular meal, i just can't. however, the service and ambiance are definitely 4 stars. and i think we may just have ordered the wrong thing. as we were walking out, we were both drooling over some of the plates at the other tables. we will definitely be back here for breakfast / brunch and hope to eat something better.",

            "i've been here twice before and recently went here for a group dinner for a friend's birthday during my weekend in vegas. \n\ni ordered the grilled salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>. the vinaigrette was a bit too acidic, the inside of my mouth started to hurt - i should've asked for dressing on the side. but the flavor combination was delicious and the salmon was cooked perfectly.\n\nfor dessert, i shared the bananas foster crepe. i can't remember if this was amazing or just good... i'm gonna say it was good, but not memorable, since i can't remember (obvs). \n\nservice is great and the prices are reasonable. it's a really good place for fancy steaks and frites in a casual atmosphere; and for around $25, not bad! (doesn't compare to $3 steak and eggs specials elsewhere, though, but that is a different review entirely.)", 
            "just a quick review.  the service was excellent, the wait was short (no reservations for a party of 8). the atmosphere was a bit dark (had it been dark outside the dimness of our table would have been ok).  i had the skate fish my brother in law had the seafood combo, my sister had the pate plate, and my nieces had mussels <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>. i also had the french onion soup. my skate fish was ok (thin and firmer than i had expected) but my brother in-laws dish was superb. the mussels were also really good.  it was nicer than expected considering it was in a tourist area.", 
            "the service was amazing, the decor was great as well as the view on the patio but the food did not meet my expectations. i was in a party of 7, and we came here for a late lunch. we did not have any reservations, but they were able to seat us within 5 minutes. \n\nour server offered us bread and whipped butter. the bread was really hard, but hot and the butter made everything taste better! my friend and i split a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> along with steak bordelaise and i was pretty much in disbelief when the salad came out. it's a very, very, very small serving for $10. it tasted fine, you can't go wrong with <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. when i got the steak bordelaise i was also disappointed. there was barely any color on the plate besides brown, and branch of some leaf they put on the plate. it did not look appetizing, nor was the steak good. it was hard and the only thing good about the dish was the caramelized onions. the fries weren't that amazing either. i really wish they would pair their steak frites up with veggies instead of just an enormous serving of fries. \n\nother people in our party ordered the natural <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark>, chicken broccoli and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark>, grilled salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>, a cheeseburger and chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>. the best dishes out of those would be the chicken, broccoli and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> along with the grilled salmon salad. \n\nnot sure if i would be back, i expected it the food to be a little better considering that it is a french restaurant with prices on the higher end, but it was a good experience.", 
            "this place was delicious! definitely one of my new favorite spots in vegas! it's located in paris and there's a patio on the strip.\n\nwe ordered escargot, the salmon appetizer, salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>, some egg pie thing, muscles, and a bacon cheeseburger with fries. escargot was on point! great sauce they used for that. the salmon appetizer was to die for! the salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> was amazing! they definitely were not greedy with the size of the salmon either. the muscles were awesome, and the sauce on it went perfect for the free bread they give you in the beginning. the bacon cheeseburger was huge! and the french fries with it were different but delicious!\n\nthe only downer was that the bloody mary bar is only on sundays and they didn't have oysters because they were doing construction on their oyster bar.", 
            "we love mon ami gabi.  it's on the short list for lunch on our visits to vegas for several reasons.\n\nraison 1:  french onion soup.  the classic french preparation.  nothing fancy.  just cheesy, oniony goodness iin a wonderful beef stock with just the right amount of saltiness. oooh la la...\n\nraison 2:  the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> is a terrific semi-open face ham and cheese sandwich.  with gruyere and creme fraiche accompanying the ham, this is one marvelously decadent sandwich.  fork and knife required.  the fries that come with the dish are frite-style:  thin cut and delicious. magnifique!\n\nraison 3:  the grilled salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> is nice piece of fish, perfectly prepared, on a bed of fresh spinach with advocado, blueberry and a walnut vinaigrette.  perfect.  healthy.  tasty.\n\nbtw, for dinner mon ami's steaks are darn good, too.\n\na few years ago we experienced an issue with our dining experience, and i wrote to the parent company.  i received a beautiful note in return offering personal assistance on my next visit.  i never took mon ami up on that offer, but i happily return, knowing that someone is watching the store at mon ami, and doing a pretty good job keeping customers happy.\n\nbon appetit!", 
            "a little bit of paris, smack dab in the middle of the strip.  it's a perfect lunch spot with a grand view of the bellagio fountains.  unfortunately, the fountains don't start running until 3 p.m., so i guess if you're here in the summer, come for an early dinner (and avoid the lunch time heat if you're on the patio), if you're here in the winter, just come for lunch, minus the active fountains.  don't be scared, they have heat lamps everywhere.  \n\nfor seating, try to request either the open air patio or the enclosed glass ceiling bistro area (does remind me of bistro floors in paris, only cleaner and brighter).  the formal seating area inside is dark and gives off that reddish brown light of a stuffy steakhouse.  if the restaurant isn't packed full, then you're safe, because they default to seating people outside or in the bright covered area.  \n\ni started with a frangria, which i'm sure is not french.  it's red sangria that had good fruity/sweet balance and was inexpensive.  \n\nheavily recommended by my server was the french onion soup (which i normally love), but i didn't order it because i would've been too stuffed.  next time.  our server was very attentive.  \n\ni had the steak frites/steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> (brandy peppercorn sauce, $25.95) medium rare.  the steak is big flat piece, smothered with peppercorn sauce.  it was tender, juicy, and flavorful.  the steak frites are definitely worth getting, just pick your preferred sauce (butter, caramelized onion with red wine reduction, peppercorn, blue cheese).  \n\nthe frites/fries that accompany the steak are thinnish potato shavings that curl a bit after frying.  have you ever tried pik-nik ketchup fries from your grocery store?  their cut reminded me of that, except they have more give on the inside from fresh frying.  unique, yes.  i can see how some people would love these fries while others might hate them.  \n\nshe had the grilled salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> with avocados, blueberries, walnuts and citrus dressing ($17.95).  the salad was a solid choice, the citrus salmon played well with the avocados and blueberries.  \n\nwe were here for lunch.  if you come for dinner, you get more choices on the steak cuts.  added choices include filet mignon, hanger, new york strip and bone-in rib eye.  \n\nthis is a very relaxing place to have a meal with one of the grandest views in all of vegas, i can't wait to come back!", 
            "so, just visiting las vegas and ended up having lunch at this place. my family was very pleased with their food (mussels, macaronni gratin and quiche). im vegetarian and my options were more restricted, their onion soup was awesome (with a lot of cheese) <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> (kind of simple).", 
            "pretty cool little joint. my first time at a french restaurant (in the past, i've avoided them like the plague). my partner ordered soup <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>, and he enjoyed it. i had the night's fish special and a <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> dish. all of the food was very good. they provided us with an endless supply of bread, which was nice.\n\nthe real reason to come here is the view. you can't beat the fountains at night time (just make sure you're close to a heater, if it's cold).",

            "maybe it was what i ordered but i just didnt really enjoy anything about the place. \nfirst we want outdoor seating so we get an hour wait, an hour goes by they encouraged us to wander off and come back, which we did. when we get back the staff lets us know that the wait had been less time than expected so we have to wait a bit longer. \nonce we get seated outside we ordered their pate, soup, <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>, with a french martini, and a beaujolais red. all of it was just ok. for the price we paid i was expecting something a little more memorable but it was all just meh. \ni would rather save the money and go elsewhere in all honesty.", 
            "decent steakhouse that's not too pricey. would be a good stop for steak lovers in vegas who don't want to make reservations at the star chef restaurants on the strip. i was overall satisfied although my steak was slightly overcooked (ordered a medium). crab cake appetizer <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> were quite underwhelming though.", 
            "wow! that is one of the best french restaurants i've ever been to (including a few in paris). everything was top-notch! we had a lovely lunch there and it's all thanks to you, dear yelp users! i researched few places nearby and mon ami gabi had so many good reviews that i decided on trying it right away. \n\nfirst impression - this place is enormous! we wanted to sit on a patio and to get there we went trough three or four different dining rooms. the view outside is great, as the restaurant is facing bellagio and its beautiful fountains. the staff was very nice and organized, we were promptly seated and handed menus. a lot of dishes seemed appetizing so it took a while to order. \n\nfor a starter we shared <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and snails in garlic, butter and herbs. both were simply delicious! escargot were best i ever had and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> came with creamy tomato sauce and fresh and crispy baguette. mmm... next we all ordered onion soup. it was very nicely prepared, with the melted cheese on the top. i don't know why i ordered it as i absolutely hate french onion soup. it must have been peer pressure :d. however, it was still one of the most passable onion soups i ate. and others like it very much, so it's probably great. after the first course we were already pretty full, but we made a mistake of ordering everything at once, so a few minutes later spinach and salmon salad with walnuts and blueberries arrived before me. and it was a surprising dish. in my opinion a salmon salad always consist of lots of small salmon pieces, not one big hunk of fish and all the other stuff next to it. it was more of the size of the main course and should have been named 'salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>' not 'salmon salad'. but it's all semantics. walnuts and blueberries gave the dish a refreshing taste, and even though i didn't manage to finish it, it was still very tasty. our friends decided on salmon tatar with chips and it was probably the weakest part of the meal, but still not bad. it just lacked some herbs or spices. during our visit we also drank a lot of lemonade. at the beginning i made a mistake of ordering home made tea. in poland, where i live, it always taste sweet, however, as i quickly learned, in america it's just regular tea, only cold. it did not taste good. the waiter was so nice, that upon noticing my mistake, she proposed switching it for sweet lemonade right away. and she didn't even put the tea on the bill. \n\nwe left the place full and content. looking back, it was probably one of the best restaurants i visited during the stay. definitely recommend."

(i don't know how they made them so flat and perfect). crispy and browned on the outside and soft on the inside...they soaked up the red wine reduction from the filet mignon...words cannot describe how good i thought they were. the red wine reduction was intense and tangy. the filet mignon was super tender. did i mention dinner was perfect?\n\ni have since then been waiting for the day i find steak frites like i had at mon ami gabi. i have made a few futile efforts but overall i'm not trying very hard...i want it to just happen one day like mon ami gabi happened.\n\ni love when places unexpectedly sweep me off my feet with amazing food and wine, and an excellent environment!", 
            "while i was back in vegas for a conference a small group of us decided to drop by and grab a meal.  it was about 8 pm and it was packed and a long line of people waiting to get in.  the hostess told us it would be 1.5 to 2 hrs....wow!  we could get seated right away if we sat outside....but it was raining off/on, so we'd have to take a chance.  i walked outside and they have umbrellas, so we took a chance and chose to get seated immediately.\n\nluckily for us it didn't rain while we dined...ha!  i ordered:\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> - (w/butter, red wine reduction) $34.95\n<mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> - $6.95\n\n....to wash it down, we ordered a bottle of malbec for $58.\n\nwhile we waited for our food, it rained a little bit.  however, with the umbrellas and patio space heaters, we were comfortable and dry.  it was actually kind of cool to sit outside on the las vegas strip and watch the clouds pass overhead and rain on the city.  in the 20+ yrs i lived in vegas, i never had an experience like that.  having wine during the rainfall was even better.\n\nthe food came out after a while and my filet was cooked perfectly.  i ordered it medium-well with just a little \"pink\".  the red wine reduction was heavenly and smooth on the palate.  the mac gratin was rich and complimented the filet very well.\n\noverall, it was an awesome dining experience.  don't know if i can replicate the ambiance and scenario.  the waiter was super cool and handled the weather/packed restaurant situation very well.\n\nreturn factor - 100%", 
            "i'm gonna have to make my first yelp review on this place...\n\nwhat can i say?!  i'm really impressed by the food and portions mon ami gabi offers considering that it's a french restaurant with very reasonable prices.  i've been to vegas 7 times since the time i've turned 21, and have only tried out this place out earlier this month, but thank goodness i've finally taken the time to try it out.  i'm gonna have to make it a point that from every vegas trip on, i'm going to make every effort to come back here!\n\nwe had made a reservation via opentable for 8:15 and was slightly late, but they were accommodating and almost seated us immediately anyways.  server was attentive, and had recommended us the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> since it's the most popular so that was my dinner choice.  the other girls in our party had the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, steak bordelaise, and chicken grandmere, and we all shared the whipped cauliflower and <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> sides.\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> and filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> were both on point!  medium rare for the two of us and i could not get over how tender the meat was and how effortless it was to cut into it.  both were served with frites, which i obviously could not stop myself from also devouring considering how much i love potatoes/fries.  haha.\n\nsteak bordelaise on the other hand wasn't as impressive... comparatively to the filet mignons, but not bad for it's meat cut.\n\nchicken grandmere was also to die for.  i haven't had a chicken this good since beatrice inn in ny!!!  seriously so tender and juicy, was not dry at all.  would be my second choice if i wasn't much of a steak eater.\n\nwhipped cauliflower was the first i've had of it's kind, and was super nomsy!  was pretty much like mashed potatoes ... but more like super creamy mashed cauliflower.\n\n<mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> was also a meh... nothing spectacular to rave about.\n\nbut overall, i had a very pleasant time.  the decor and ambiance is quite romantic and perfect if you're looking to have a nice, classy dinner away from the rest of the crazy vegas life.  i'd love to eat here again and try eating outdoors with the beautiful view of the bellagio fountains!", 
            "we try to stop by here whenever we are in vegas.  the restaurant is located in the paris paris, just off the main casino floor.  if the weather is nice, try to get a table on the patio, or the windows near the patio, as they overlook the beautiful bellagio fountains.  the patio is raised above the busy las vegas boulevard sidewalk, so all those inebriated tourist don't get in the way of the view.\n\nin my opinion, the food at most of the restaurants on the strip is overhyped and overpriced; this is not the case at mon ami gabi.  the food here is excellent for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and appropriately priced.  my personal favorites are the <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark>, the warm chicken & <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, and the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> steak frites.", 
            "i really wanted to love this place.  it has great ambiance and a wonderful location.  they also have a good wine list filled with french wines.  we ordered the warmed brie for an app and it was good, but came with 3 toasted slices of baguette.  3 slices for two people?  is it really going to break the bank to add one more piece so a party of 2 could share the brie with 2 pieces of bread?\n\ni ordered the steak roquefort and my friend ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>.  we both ordered our meat medium.  we also ordered a side of green beans to share.  we were halfway through our bottle of wine (and we aren't fast drinkers) before our meals arrived. the \"roquefort\" was actually a blob of butter with some roquefort mixed in.  there was so little roquefort in it that i asked the waitress what was on my steak.  \n\nin addition, my steak came barely warm and totally raw on the inside.  fortunately, my friend enjoyed the filet mignon.  by the time the waitress came back, returning the steak was no longer an option since i figured we would have to wait another 30 minutes for a replacement.\n\nsince i was still hungry, i decided to order the bananas foster crepe thinking that there was no way they could do a dessert wrong.  i am not a bananas foster pro, but i believe it is supposed to be served warm (as the description states warm bananas).  it was served cold with the sauce being more crystallized sugar rather than a warmed flambe.  basically they pre make these, barely warm them and pass them off as \"gourmet.\"  \n\ni came to the restaurant looking forward to a wonderful meal and evening, instead i was disappointed at every turn and the $150 bill was very hard to swallow.", 
            "j'adore mon ami gabi. i've eaten here a few times and whether it's been sitting on the patio, or inside near the windows it's been excellent. awesome location on the strip with a front row seat of the bellagio fountains. the french onion soup is very well done and the steak frites are magic! my favorites are the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> with butter and a red wine reduction, and the hanger steak with merlot butter. the restaurant is huge, but the service is always great. a consistent favorite over the years (and through the hangovers!)", 
            "if you want a nice restaurant that won't leave your wallet crying and your stomach still starving, this is not a bad place to go. just be sure to make reservations or the wait can be quite long. reservations only guarantee the indoor dining area, which is dim, romantic, and not conducive to instagram pictures. if you can, though, i'd recommend the patio area so you can people-watch from a heated and equally romantic vantage point.\n\nthe boyfriend and i ordered the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> appetizer, which was served with 4 large pieces of the creamiest salmon i've ever had and (maybe just a tad too much) red onions and capers atop brioche. the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> was definitely on the small side and probably could have done with a little less cooking, but the merlot reduction tasted amazing. what i should have gotten was the boyfriend's ribeye, which was bigger, fattier, juicier, and overall just more tasty. i was not, however, impressed with the steak frites that came with our entrees--they were paper-thin (like eating a deep fried potato peel) while i like more substance to my fries. \n\nthough the food was a little hit or miss, the ambiance and the attentive server who kept up with my water-guzzling boyfriend's refill needs upped my rating for this place to a 4.", 
            "i was a bit hesitant to try this place at first because of my awful experiences over at sugar factory (also in the paris), however i'm glad i decided to come here!  \n\nmy first visit i got:\n-<mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark>: snails seasoned with a tasty green garlic sauce, served on a sizzling plate\n-<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> : steak was about 8-10 oz. and had a delicious sauce with it\n-frites: side that comes with the steak, they are basically thinly sliced french fries which complimented my steak quite well!\n-frangria: their take of sangria and each glass only costs about $5.50...just get it\n\nmy second visit i got:\n-<mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> again\n-bacon wrapped pork tenderloin (special): comes with mashed potatoes and an apple and fennel salad, the entire plate was delicious \n-steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>:  (boyfriend's dish) very generous serving of a flattened steak seasoned with peppercorn, also very good\n-frangria again\n\nthe service was excellent and everyone was friendly.  if you decide to come here just make sure you book a reservation because the wait here can be long (patio seating is first come first serve).", 
            "nice location, great ambiance. my partner and i ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, both medium-well. server suggests to get them \"butterflied\" so it cooks all the way through. that didn't work out so well. my steak was well done and my partner's was well done on one side and the other medium-well. my teeth hurt after attempting to chew the steak. so disappointing. frites were only \"okay\", however, the side of garlic spinach we ordered were pretty good. \n\nour server only came back once to ask if i wanted more iced tea. didn't ask how the food was or anything. he also took a long time to give us our check. we literally just sat there for 10 minutes waiting to pay for our overcooked dinner. \n\nthis place is overrated in my opinion. will never come back again. staff wasn't too friendly either. should've made a reservation at gordon ramsay steak instead.", 
            "i wish it was my anniversary everyday. \n\nmy boyfriend and i visited mon ami gabi to celebrate our two year anniversary. his sister-in-law used to continually rave about this place and after months of waiting, we decided that our anniversary would the perfect date. \n\ni don't know why but for some reason, we decided not to make reservations. foolish, foolish idea. you most definitely should make a reservation. we waited for about 40 minutes and finally got seated in a table made for two. seeing that my boyfriend is a 6'2\", 200lb man, let's just say that the table was just a bit on the tiny side.\n\nwe were greeted by a curly haired waitress-- she was terrific! she first started us off with some bread and butter to accompany my glass of merlot and my boyfriend's glass of cotes du rhone. i know that he enjoyed his wine but it definitely didn't compare to the most smooth and soft bodied merlot i have ever tasted. mmmm, soooo good!\n\nwe went on to order the warm brie cheese as our appetizer. oh this is so very, very good. i'm not a huge cheese fan but i decided to order this for my cheese-loving man. good thing because i couldn't stop my hands from reaching for the platter! the croutons gave such a nice crunch and the slightest bit of saltiness to contrast the soft and gooey, sweet honey-covered cheese. i swear i think this is the only appetizer we'll ever order here!\n\nfor the main, my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> and i ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>. both of our steaks were cooked to perfection, juicy and well seasoned. however, we both agreed that t the end of the day, mine was much more flavorful due to the merlot reduction. either way, we definitely enjoyed our steaks. we also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms and it went well with our steak, although it had too much black pepper for our taste.\n\nwith the help of many hours of masterchef australia, i became familiar with different types of french desserts and was extremely excited to order profiteroles... until i saw the chocolate fudge cake with homemade caramel ice cream, that is. we ended up ordering the chocolate cake which was beyond incredible. then, our kick ass waitress sensed much hesitation from me and brought out some profiteroles--on the house! score! :d needless to say, it was phenomenal. \n\nobviously, my overall experience was absolutely superb, and i definitely recommend this place for people who are celebrating a wonderful occasion. just brace yourself- you're gonna want some more real soon!", 
            "my favorite spot for any meal (the brunch is awesome, the dinner is amazing, and so is everything in between) is mon ami gabi! it truly is my favorite restaurant in vegas, and that says a lot considering there are so many. i came here for a birthday dinner (and then back repeatedly) and was blown away every time- the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> is melt in your mouth tender, and the merlot butter sauce was perfect with it! \n\na few other things i have tried and loved:\n-the <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> with the poached egg on top- amazing!\n-fresh oysters\n-<mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>\n-corned beef hash-yum\n\nand that is just to name a few. this is the best place for people watching while enjoying great, reasonably priced wine/food and having a fantastic meal. i will be back!",

            "7/4/13  dinner\n\nmy third time dining at mon ami gabi doesn't disappoint. for a french steak restaurant on the strip, this place offers great food at a great value. my party of 4 arrived promptly for 6:30pm reservation. surprisingly we were offered the option of indoor dining or the patio outside overlooking bellagio fountain across the street. patio is usually first come-first serve but on a 108f day we just didn't feel like eating outside. plus all the hustle-and-bustle on the street.\n\nserver was friendly, ready to make cocktail suggestion. despite being very busy for 4th of july, service was not pushy at all. we spent almost a cocktail's time looking over the big menu, which features grain-fed mid-west beef.\n\n*paris romance ($12): a rum base cocktail with a tinge of lemoncello. \n*grey goose cosmopolitan ($14): just the way i like it, a slightly more vodka compared to cranberry juice, fresh lime (there's pulp) a beautiful pink\n\nour table goes for beef since this is a classic french bistro specializes in meat.\n\n*<mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> ($10.95): the tangy red wine mustard goes really well with the very creamy liver spread on warm toast. it really set the mood of dinner for the evening.\n\n*<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> ($34.95): very tender, almost like wagyu, beef seared to a medium-rare pink, with a butter/red wine reduction. i've had harris's filet mignon and loved it. but mon ami gabi is just as juicy, and every bite of meat is \"even.\" this is one of the best filet mignon i have had. the handcut frites are warm crispy, with the texture of sliced potato chips. they give you so many that i couldn't finish.\n\n*steak classique ($24.95): a slimmer cut sirloin steak served with house-special herb butter. my bf also had it medium rare and it was pink like mine. he did better with the frites and licked the plate clean.\n\n*steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> ($25.95): probably the strongest tasting steak on our table, served with a brandy peppercorn sauce. our dining companion also opted her sirloin medium rare. i was very impressed at the overall consistency in how their meat was prepared here. \n\n*prime cheeseburger ($12.95): with blue cheese. this is a mon ami gabi's classic and they charge the same price as for lunch. medium cooked beef patty served on a brioche bun. instead of fries, my dining companion got french green beans on the side. \n\nwe concluded the meal with warm chocolate torte and assorted sorbet. the whole experience---food, service, drinks, and decor, is top-notch but you pay decent prices for it. it's one of the best value on the strip. make sure you have a reservation. i always have dinner here when i'm in vegas.", 
            "what a great restaurant! inside and out has great ambiance! we made a reservation for dinner and were seated inside but were just at the big open doors for the patio with a view of the strip and bellagio, great spot!!! our table enjoyed the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> (brandy peppercorn sauce), <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> (butter, red wine reduction) and steak bearnaise. everything was delicious but my personal fav was the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, delicious and highly recommend!!!! we substituted our side for the whipped cauliflower and the sauteed mushrooms, both excellent choices!!!!", 
            "what can i say that 2800 people haven't already said in their reviews? christy g. and i always try to dine at mon ami gabi when we're in vegas, and every visit has been spectacular. for one, the service is always impeccable. the location can't be beat, with an amazing view of the bellagio fountains and truly top notch people watching. i particularly like watching the drunk bambi-legged girls (\"weenie wobbles\") trying not to fall in their too-high heels :) or even worse, the ones holding their heels and walking down las vegas blvd in their blackened bare feet *shudder*\n\nthe <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> ($9.95) is a definite must-have. the broth is rich and savory, packed with perfectly soaked baguette slices and caramelized onions, and topped with about a pound of melted gruyere. i crave this soup even when it's triple digits outside; it's that good. \n\nanother staple is the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> ($34.95), which comes with a merlot infused butter and a red wine reduction. the filet (medium rare for me) is always perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth. i don't personally care for the frites that everyone raves about, but they've always been super accommodating about switching it out for another side at a small upcharge. i've had the pommes puree, garlic spinach, sauteed mushrooms, and the macaroni <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> - all amazing. \n\ni'm always way too stuffed for dessert, so i won't comment on those. they also have a pretty substantial wine list, and about two dozen wines by the glass. and if you stop by for brunch, the build your own bloody mary cart is a godsend! \n\nbottom line: don't miss out; this place is amazing! ask for a table on the patio and come hungry!", 
            "\"style, class, and a patio to make me come back.\"\n\nmaybe it's cause i'm always on vacation. maybe the memories, maybe its the weather  or the good company that i've shared my time here.  on top of this, it's on one of the premier patio spots outside paris in the dead centre of the strip. these are some reasons why this is my favorite restaurant in vegas. then there's the food...let's move on to that.\n\nlet me set the tone: it's a classic french bistro.  white table clothes, fancy setup, however the vibe is casual so even if you're out there in shorts, you're not totally out of place.  \n\nthere are 3 dining areas: indoors, indoors with view of patio, and patio.  trust me, you want to sit on the patio and experience some pinnacle views which include the bellagio, pretty people, and the rest of the strip.  call in for a reso if you can, otherwise you may be waiting 1-2 hours on a busy day. again, for me its worth the wait.  scared of the heat, well don't' worry, there is appropriate shade and air-conditioning and misters outside!  even in 40 degrees they managed to keep me cool.\n\neach table is given fresh baguette and butter to start.  one thing i've noticed is that the bread hasn't always come out hot.  a small annoyance, but something that could be easily remedied with a warmer of sorts.  save some bread cause you'll need it for something else, stay tuned.\n\nif you are a professional meatitarian like myself, you will have no problem quenching your thirst.  first off the bat get a steak.  i don't even care which one, just do it.  all three steaks that i've had were beautiful cuts of meat, cooked exactly how i wanted it, and could be cut with a butter knife.  myself i struggle between the fillet <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> and (if i'm feeling hungry) the 22oz bone in ribeye.  \n\naren't a suffer of meatabetes like me, then why not try some of the mussels?   a light white wine and herb broth dips very well with the bread you remembered to save.  the mussels aren't as fat and juicy as we're accustomed to in the west coast, so this one dish won't fill you up. regardless, i love mussels and i loved this dish. \n\nneed something to wash it down? their wine list is extensive.  however if you want a refreshing treat on a hot day then i'd try their sangria. \n\ngive gabi a try.  you won't be disappointed.", 
            "absolutely amazing!!\n\nwe had 9pm reservations with a request to be seated near the patio, since the patio is first come first serve only.  unfortunately we were late by about 15 or 20 minutes.  not a problem.  we waited maybe 5 minutes and were seated in a great location next to the patio so we could also enjoy the bellagio water show.  \n\nthe service was great and the food was even better.  my wife and i split the duck confit & fingerling potato as our appetizer and both ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> (steak lovers:) as the main course.  the duck was a great way to start.  the meat was just falling off the bone it was so tender.  very impressed, we were anxiously waiting for our steaks and we were not disappoint.  probably one of the best steaks i've had.\n\nthere's really nothing more to say.  wonderful service.  great location.  amazing food.",

            "service here is awesome. i had originally made reservations for 8:15 after being told 7:30 was unavailable. we got hungry so i got there at 7 and asked them what the wait time was. the response was 45 minutes to one hour for a party of two. i let them know that that was fine and i had reservations at 8:15, so i would take whichever availability came first. the hostess then said that since i had reservations, they would take me right away because it would be unfair for me to wait. i told her we would be staying at paris anyway so it really was fine, but she insisted and we didn't wait at all! the waitstaff is also courteous and well-spoken. food came promptly and warm. i couldn't have asked for better service.\n\nbreakfast: \n\nspecial eggs benedict: consisted of bacon, spinach, and tomatoes with a side of hash browns. i didn't think it was all that special. it was good/okay, but nothing outstanding. the english muffins were very... toasted and a bit difficult to bite into. there was very little spinach and only a small piece of bacon. i think it was one bacon slice for the entire plate. the hollandaise sauce was bland and seemed watered down. the hash browns were good, however it was salted unevenly so we got little pockets of salt here and there.\n\nmushroom omelette with egg whites instead - consisted of mushrooms and brie cheese with hash browns and a slice of toast. omelettes don't usually wow me since it's such an easy breakfast item to make. they didn't skimp on the brie although the brie wasn't a strong one. it was okay. i did like their bread though.\n\ndinner:\n\ndinner starts out with a warm baguette served with butter and a small pickled shredded root vegetable \"salad\".  last year it was carrots, this year it was jicama.\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> - the filet came out really fast this time. i would say our food came out within 15 - 20 minutes of ordering. the filets were ordered medium well and they were cooked perfectly with a nice seared crust. the potatoes came warm and perfectly salted and crisp.\n\nvegetable farcis (last year) - it was so flavorful and bursting with flavors i didn't feel i was missing out on anything. i hadn't been that excited about vegetables for awhile. i was very impressed with a steakhouse creating such a unique vegetarian dish. it consisted of herbed quinoa on a bed of sauteed tomato/sauce and topped with grilled zucchini, squash, and eggplant. some of the vegetables had a creamy stuffing that was pretty decadent.\n\nbananas foster crepe - the caramel sauce is sweet and nutty with the bananas perfectly sauteed to remain firm, yet have that nice cooked banana flavor. one mistake i find many places make when making bananas foster is overcooking the bananas to mush. i don't think i detected any rum; the caramel is very strong so if there was any rum, maybe it brought out the caramel flavors. the crepe batter they use yields a nice thin, slightly chewy crepe. i'm not one to favor the crispy type crepes so this was perfect. inside the crepe is vanilla ice cream and on top is a dollop of whipped cream.\n\nstar items - <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, bananas foster crepe.", 
            "i had an amazing experience here and would absolutely recommend it to anyone!\n\ni made reservations for 7:45 and arrived around 8:00 due to strip traffic. the host joked around about me being late (which i appreciated), but was able to seat me within five minutes despite the long line at the hostess desk!  the person who escorted us to our table was warm, welcoming, and hilarious to talk to!\n\nwhen making our reservation, we were advised that it would be for inside the restaurant and that outside seating would be first-come, first-serve (about a 90 minute wait at that time). however, we were seated on a deck area that was between the indoor seating and balcony seating. we loved this area because we still had a beautiful view of the bellagio fountains without the wait (nor the drunks roaming the strip). \n\nas for the food, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, as well as escargot, saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms, and a glass of sauvignon blanc. the filet was scrumptious!  one of the best filets i've ever had and reasonably priced. it was so tender and flavorful, and i loved the merlot sauce!  it was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. additionally, the frites were delicious (albeit salty), especially when you dipped it in the merlot sauce.  i would not recommend the saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms, and the escargot was just mediocre. i was surprised they did not provide toast or pastry puffs with the escargot, but they did serve complimentary bread so it worked out. \n\nthe service at mon ami gabi was great!  everyone was extremely friendly and comfortable cracking jokes - which i liked. however, they were also efficient and accurate, which is equally important.  the view of the bellagio fountains was the cherry on top!  the restaurant was not too noisy, especially compared to sugar factory. \n\nif you are looking for a high-quality restaurant (especially a steakhouse) with a view of the bellagio fountains, but cannot afford bellagio's high-end restaurants, mon ami gabi is the perfect place!  i will definitely return!",

            "reservations wouldn't be a bad idea.  though, it's not a definite requirement.\n\norder the carafe of st. germain spritzer!  it's good with your starters.  the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> is excellent while you wait for your entrees.  and you can't go wrong with the french onion soup (which accommodates two); it's one of the few places that gets the soup right for me.\n\nthe duck a l'orange, <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, short ribs, bone-in ribeye and <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> have all been high hitters.  and all things considered, the prices aren't bad at all for what you're getting.  there's even a convenient view of the bellagio water show!  as well, the waitstaff is knowledgeable and generally helpful.  haven't had a bad experience to date.  if i'm in vegas, it's always a pitstop.",

            "a perfect setting to enjoy bellagio fountain show and people watching. i ordered a <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, cooked perfectly and tender. but i feel that it needed a bit more seasonings. my husband's beef bourguignon was also okay. i was excited to taste the app escargot, but somehow the herb butter sauce tasted weird or \"off\". they forgot my escargot order, so i don't know if they cooked it in a hurry or what. anyway, the chef was very nice to give us a complimentary prifiterole (to make up the forgotten escargot order) which was delish.",

            "lettuce entertain you's mon ami gabi is a triumphant disaster. in a town where service is of upmost importance, mon ami gabi's waitstaff wouldn't be acceptable at a prison cafeteria. the coven that awaits you at the hostess desk is comprised of people who were rejected from even the local denny's. the food quality is exceptionally poor and is surprising to find outside of a second rate casino's buffet. the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> was fatty and had almost a strange jelly like taste. the beef bourguignon was simply tragic with a mound of what was supposed to be egg noodles but could have been tape worms for all monkey could tell in the poorly lit venue.  mon ami gabi receives two stars as it has a decent view of the strip and respectable manager kyle.  if you do choose mon ami gabi, just simply order a bottle of wine and order the children's mac n cheese and watch the strip without wasting time with the food that only the most unsophisticated tourist would find palatable.  monkey wanted to enjoy mon ami gabi since they have branches in maryland and virginia near monkey's mom house.  additionally monkey wanted to be psyched about a trip to paris but oh well c'est la vie.",

            "i took my boyfriend here last night for our first night in vegas and for a little birthday dinner. i give this place five stars for several reasons. first, the location/layout/decor is brilliant. it's located right next to the bellagio (where we stayed) fountains at the paris hotel. it's indoor seating looked beautiful, which what i had originally made 7:30 reservations for , but we opted for the first come first serve patio seating so we could catch the fountain shows. plus, vegas around sunset is perfect in terms of temperature and lighting.\nthe other reason i give it four stars is because the service from jump street was impeccable. the hostesses were kind and attentive. they clearly remembered to tell our waiter later on about my request for a surprise birthday dessert with a candle at the end. the bar tenders at the bar where we got a drink and an appetizer were also very attentive and fast. our waiter later on, ibrahim, was beyond friendly, eager to please and professional (but not overwhelmingly in our faces). \nthe other reason on give this place four stars is the food and wine. i love a french menu. the food is always fresh and made the way you expect it to be and then some. i swear, french chefs have a cooking gene that i don't think others do! all the food we had here was exquisite.  appetizer: wild escargot that was oven roasted in some garlic herb (and pesto i think) sauce. salad: fris\\u00e9e, kale and <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>. dinner: a rare <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> (a butter and red wine reduction) with a side a saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms and hand cut fries. now, let me pause and comment on this dinner dish. first, the steak was o m f g amazing. perfect cut of steak and cooked just to our liking: rare. second, the red wine reduction and butter sauce we ordered on the side bc normally we would never spoil a filet mignon with any sauce, but again, !!!o m f g!!! this sauce blew us away. i could eat it with a spoon. you must must must order this dish of you enjoy filet. the mushrooms and fries were also very fresh and complimented the steak very nicely. oh and, the portion sizes were fair. not small. not huge. fair. filling. perfect amount. \nlast but not least, we ordered a bottle of their house red (a suggestion from our waiter), and i could not have been happier with it. i'm kind of a picky wine lady, but i really liked our waiter so i trusted his suggestion and i'm glad i did. also, i really appreciated our waiter refilling our days wine glasses for us as we dined throughout the evening. \nlast but not least, the last reason i give this place four stars is the fair pricing for the quality of food. our bill was only $111. that's about a third of what most fine dining places would cost in vegas. for instance, the filet mignon was only $37, as opposed to $60 plus it would be at most other steak houses in vegas. for a wonderful experience and exemplary food, $111 felt like a steal. \nmy boyfriend and i definitely plan on dining here again before we leave. if you find yourself in vegas and want an amazing dinner with every bank for a your buck, go here!!", 
            "my most recent visit to mon ami gabi had a little bit of a disappointment which was really my fault for coming in at the wrong time.  currently, their sunday dinner special is beef wellington which i've been really looking forward to try.  the only beef wellington i've had is the one over at gordon ramsay steak, so i was looking to try one from another restaurant to compare.  well, i finally came in on a sunday night for a late dinner and by the time i got seated, my waiter told me that they had just ran out of beef wellington.  nooooooooo!!!\n\nwell, as an alternative, my waiter suggested ordering their <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>.  it's actually been a few years since i last ordered steak at mag, so he enlightened me.  plus, because it's a different cut of beef than the hangar and ribeye i've had before, it still continues my steak of ordering something new on their menu.  and to add to that, i ordered their wild escargot <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> appetizer.  i've never had escargot served this way so i was really intrigued.\n\n<mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1btorxp\noven roasted snails, garlic-herb butter\noh man.  butter and garlic galore!!  the snails were chewy just like i expected and they were drowned in so much butter and garlic that i couldn't really tell if they were actually snails.  they could've been mushrooms and i probably wouldn't know the difference.  they were was good though.  and with the complimentary baguette, it was the perfect bread to dunk into the garlic-herb butter wells.\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1qhygp5\nbutter, red wine reduction\ni understand that mon ami gabi is more of a budget friendly steakhouse that's part of  the middle tier of steakhouses on the strip, but i have to say that this filet mignon was awesome!  cooked to a perfect medium rare and it literally cut like butter! (http://bit.ly/1n0fjpx)  and the red wine reduction sauce just added a more robust flavor to the filet.  i'm so glad that i ordered this!  kudos to my waiter for the recommendation!\n\nmon ami gabi delivers once again even when there's disappointment with an item being sold out.  i love how there's plenty of 'plan b' entrees and based on my past visits, i really couldn't have gone wrong with any of them, but i'm glad that i got to try their <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>.  that's something that i wouldn't mind ordering again if i ever go back for to mon ami gabi for steak.  hopefully next time i'll make better judgement with coming in for an earlier dinner so i can finally try their beef wellington.  til next time mon ami gabi....", 
            "overall this place is really good. \n\nwe started off with the escargots. it was nothing special, and we've had better. the baguette was fresh, which was nice. \n\ni ordered the hangar steak which was delicious. the steak was nice and thick and served with frites which were a cross between french fries and potato chips. \nmy sister had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> which was also good. my mom throughly enjoyed her bernaise steak.\n\n\noverall we will probably come back.",

            "when i flew in on monday night, i fear that i may miss my reservation getting here via the shuttle bus, but i did manage to get there on time.  now for starters, everyone keeps mentioning to go out and eat outside and enjoy the view of bellagio's water show.  no i wouldn't recommend it.  it was freezing cold and literally everyone who was sitting outside scrambled to find the last remaining seats inside.  luckily the evening wasn't so packed, and managed to find an open seating inside that is rich with rustic feel. my opinion is to stick around inside the room away from the bar.\n\nto start off with, i had the pumpkin soup that had a light cream base and crusted almonds.  unfortunately with all the craze the hostess and waiters and waitresses were scrambling to find seats for people, the soup came after my main course which was a little harder to finish, but i insisted on tasting and finding what made this the place to eat! the soup was by far delicious and flavorful and it immediately warmed you up after this craze weather!\n\nonto the main course, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> with a glass of merlot. when it came out, the meat was shimmering glazed and a stack of frites. i ordered a side of brussel sprouts on the side to balance the sweetness of the filet mignon. by making that first cut into the filet, you can feel the tenderness of the cut fall slowly to the plate glistened in the glaze.  taking that first bite of the filet mignon was just explosion happening and enjoying the moment! food was just amazing!\n\noverall the meal was by far amazing minus the crazy hiccup of the weather, but the staff and team managed to get everyone in and everyone enjoyed the night.  this is definitely worth going again.", 
            "got the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> cause why not: steak was cooked really well..but who comes here for the steak anyway??? \n\nthis place has a 5/5 view with ac blasting to enjoy the bellagio fountain show...which has the magical power to make the food taste exponentially better.\n\nservice is fine. price is decent for the view you get. nom noms.", 
            "this is my second time here, gotta love their patio seats, you get to enjoy the views while having good foods. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> to share, their seafoods are just sooo fresh. i'm a seafood lover so trust me on this. my medium rare <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> was cooked to perfection. my friends ordered the trout and ragu, they said the trout was just alright but the ragu was very tender. \n\ni would come back again soon."

            "overall, a great restaurant! not too overpriced- of course price will depend on your hunger, pocket and taste. this is perhaps the only restaurant that allows you to sit outside & view the beautiful bellagio musical fountain show (every 15 minutes or so), while enjoying fine gourmet french-american cuisine.\n\ni'd give it 5 stars, except for the following few reasons:\n1. it is slightly on the noisy side (being on the busy 10-lane las vegas blvd s)\n2. it takes more than an hour to get seated outside, due to the popularity.\n3. some of the waiters are not very friendly or personable. especially this one guy called kareem: he is too moody for a waiter at a french restaurant. and unpredictable... he snapped at me in a very unkind way for simply telling him we're ready to order \"why- are you in a hurry?\" no, i am not in a hurry, but we waited over 80 minutes to sit here! \"well i have so many customers before you\". i guess you must be overworked, kareem- but it is none of my business. as far as i am concerned, you still need to treat me as a valued customer! i don't deserve to be given attitude in front of my lady. at a restaurant that costs $60 or more per person...\n\nother than that... highly recommended!\n\nour favorites here are:\n- escargots bernaise\n- warm baguette bread\n- delicious \"market salad\" with fresh tomatoes\n- belgian <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark> (with blue cheese and pears).\n- steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> (peppercorn wine sauce)- prepared medium\n- red wine from burgundy (around $7.50 per glass) sorry cannot recall the name :) - goes so well with the meat!\n- creme brulee - amazing\n- tarte tatin - apple & cinnamon- but ummm, so yummy, so warm, so sensual. not your average apple cobbler!", 
            "vegas closes down early, and there aren't many decent places to eat on the later side.  and there are many things to steer away from at this restaurant.  the fries, for example.  they call these fries?  and yet, and yet . . . . there are some terrific wines, not horribly priced.  the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> is terrific, as good as any sf bistro (except for the frites which, frankly, suck).  the salads are executed poorly as to presentation, but the ingredients?  actually pretty good.   for example, we had a serrano and mozzarella and fig salad.  big old pile of the jambon, sliced too thickly, and there was no art in the presentation.  it looked like no one cared enough to make it pretty.  but the taste?  quite good.  all very high end ingredients, and even the dressing was good.  same with the heirloom tomato salad (flown in, who knew they cared) and the frisee with lardon.  \n\nso if you order carefully and not on the outer limits of cuisine (you know, plain and simple, don't get creative), you'll get a good, maybe even a great, late-night meal.  sit outside and it's perfect.  just like paris (except it's the bellagio fountains and hordes of americans, so maybe not so much like paris, except it's outdoor bistro dining, so that's like paris, right?)", 
            "my experience at mon ami gabi was amazing, and i will definitely go back next time i'm in vegas. actually i believe that is not the requirement that my girlfriend set next time we go back.\n\nseating & interiors - inside is nice, but appears a little crowded and thus can get quite loud. thankfully i sat outside..no wait at all for our table (we showed up at 6:30 pm and had a reservation through open table..15 minutes later, huge line outside the door).  the outside was very nice, with a great view of the bellagio fountains (very romantic)...and even though it was slightly cold outside, they had a good amount of heaters outside to keep things regulated...was very nice outside.\n\npricing - very, very fair. considering most meals were $18-20..except for the $29 filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> i ordered...starters were around $10 which is very good as well (hell, chili's costs almost as much for appetizers)...i believe desserts were around $8. the only thing slightly pricey were bottles of wine (cheapest bottles $28-35, everything else around $40-70).  total price including (generous) tip for two people, two appetizers, one dessert, two entrees and a bottle of wine (remember i had the filet)..$128. \n\nservice - spectacular. our server juan, was very articulate, friendly, on the ball with everything, and knowledgeable on all the foods.  examples: it was slightly windy outside, my napkin fell, when i went to pick it up, he was there in an instant, picked it up, and told me he'd get me a clean one.  after eating our baguette, while crunching up he baguette paper, he was immediately at my side to pick up the trash, and offered another baguette. \n\nfood - the filet mignon was delicious, my girlfriend's lemon chicken was perhaps the best chicken i've ever had. at first i was a little scared of having only an 8 ounce steak for fear of being hungry..but i came out quite full..the banana crepe was also delicious. presentation was nice...although the escargot could've been presented better, but tasted delicious..the lobster bisque..was truly to die for.  the baguette was good as well..the frites weren't my favorite type of frites, but still quite good, filling, crunchy, but with enough potato inside to make it more than a chip. \n\noverall: the prices are very fair, i highly suggest sitting outside, the service is great ( at least my experience was tremendous). the food is awesome. i highly, highly recommend mon ami gabi.", 
            "j'adore mon ami gabi! i've made it a point to visit this place more than once on my many trips to vegas. granted, i visit it when i'm on my more mellow trips, for example: with the bf's parents or when on a conference. i do not go here when i'm on bachelorette party trips or trips with 10 of my friends. it's right across from the bellagio, so depending on your seating, you can see the awesome fountain shows and taken in pavorotti's voice while you sip le vin. \n\nfor dinner i had the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> with brandy peppercorn sauce and awesome fries. another time i went for lunch and had the creamy chicken & mushroom crpe, which was tres excellent! it came with a spring salade and was large and delicious. wine list was great - at lunch time they had a wine cart so you could see the bottles and take a taste if desired. \n\ndessert - my friend got the bananas foster crepe - he loves it. it's not my cup of tea, but if you enjoy bananas foster, you might like this!\n\nnote: i just looked on the website and i guess it's a chain - didn't know this!", 
            "mon ami gabi is a wonderful bistro/steak house located in the paris hotel and we do not leave vegas until we dine here. sit outside and dine al fresco, you will have a wonderful view of the bellagio fountains and it's fun to people watch. it's a bistro, you can dress casual and no one will judge you.\n\nthere is an excellent wine list, of course! the st. aubyn pinot is lovely. the service is courteous and prompt to see to your needs and you will not feel at all rushed. there are great cocktails on the menu, i tend to go straight for the wine, though.\n\ni like to start with the <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>, the 'french onion soup', you can taste so many layers of flavor and the cheese is melted on top, just starting to get that golden crust. yum. i will have to make a point of trying other things on the menu, i can't seem to get past the steak bordelaise with it's lovely wine sauce and the soft, sweet, caramelized onions, or the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, always with frites, bien sur. excellent steaks, i'm almost speechless...but not quite, there's still dessert! (and no, i'm not sharing, get your own!).\n\nthe creme brulee is excruciatingly delicious, it hurts so bad...the bananas foster crepes are tender and delicious and absolutely decadent. the chocolate mousse is pure decadence!\n\ni can't wait until our next trip, hopefully i can update this review...and add another dish to my list. sigh...lovely...", 
            "yeah, i know it's owned by a mega-restaurant group. hell, i used to work for lettuce entertain you. and, yeah, there are 4 of these restaurants spread out across the country. but, dammit, as much as i wanted to have a problem with this place, i just don't.\n\nmy meal was fantastic. i went with a classic steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, and it was absolutely delicious. now, yeah, there is a better one out there, but for the price (expensive but reasonably so), this one is hard to beat.\n\nplus, when you include the surroundings, this is a real winner.\n\ndefinitely call ahead for reservations, or you'll be hungry for longer than you'd like to be.\n\ngenerally, i'm pretty hard to please when it comes to chains, but mon ami gabi is definitely a winner.", 
            "i used to live a few blocks from the original mon ami gabi on lincoln park west in chicago, but i never went, only because it looked overly expensive.  however, leave it to me to dine there for the first time in vegas.  the prices are actually very reasonable.  i had the french onion soup to start, which is almost a meal in itself.  i recommend it.  i had the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> with brandy peppercorn sauce which was decent but if i go back, i'll have to try the filet mignon with merlot butter, which is supposed to be their signature steak.  the sides were good, i recommend the garlic spinach.  they also have a pretty expansive wine list, which is a must for a french steakhouse.  the only downside was that they were out of a lot of dishes, including the dessert that we wanted!  we had an 8:15 reservation, so they shouldn't be running out of things that early on.", 
            "i decided to go to mon ami gabi for my birthday with a party of 13.  i chose it was because it is moderately priced and i love french food.  i have to say i was quite pleased, there were a few snags but overall it was a good experience. \n\nthe food was fantastic.  the escargot was great, very garlicky but i love garlic so i was fine with it!  my filet was cooked to medium rare perfection and was one of the best steaks i've had in a long time.  (much better than the steak i had at n9ne) the wine we selected was fantastic, so good we ordered a second bottle.  the bananas fosters crepe was huge and my husband and i could not finish it.....it was that big! \n\noverall i think it's a great dining experience on the strip if you want a good meal for your money.  w did have a large party and i found mag to be as accommodating as possible, even seating us even though the whole party wasn't present.  while our server was attentive however, my husband received his steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, not what he ordered, but still great all the same.",

'nuff said.\n\nif you even have room for desert after all this gastric-orgasmic experience, try the creme brulee.  or better yet, the banana foster crepe.  oh.  my.  god.  \n\n\nentrees do not come with sides, everything is ala carte.  order one or two sides for the table to share.  it's worth it.  trust me.\n\nthis place was one of my first \"anything goes\" experiences in vegas.  loved that i was eating in high-class french restaurant in shorts and sandals (their only dress code requirements are no swimwear, and no sleeveless t-shirts).\n\nand by god sakes people.  it is vegas, after all, so i cannot stress enough... call ahead for a reservation.  you cannot reserve a table on the patio, but if you get by the windows in the atrium, it's just as good (if not better, since we were there in august with 110 degree heat!).\n\ndefinitely would go back.  probably am the next trip.", 
            "huge disappointment - after reading all the great reviews on yelp, i decided to have my family's christmas dinner at mon ami gabi.  perhaps it was christmas and the chef wasn't around or there was no delivery of fresh steak on christmas day or whatever, but the steaks were the worst we've ever had at a restaurant that claimed to be a steakhouse of any sort.        \n\nwe had the following: \n\n- french onion soup - standard, decent, not spectacular\n- frisee & <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> - tasty\n- steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>\n- steak roquefort\n- filet mignon with merlot butter  and red wine reduction\n\ni think the problem is with quality of the steaks, the sauces were fine, but my mom's steak roquefort had the texture of cotton, my sister's steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> had the texture of cotton with lots of veins and fat lumps, my filet mignon had a stringy texture like a inferior cut of meat and was not at all firm.  it was so bad that we left much of the entree untouched and left right after the main course, we didn't even have dessert on christmas!!  this was a very disappointing meal and ruined our christmas.  \n\non the other hand, the service was fine and the  prices were definitely cheaper than traditional steakhouses, $31 for the filet and $23 for the regular steaks, but the quality is not anywhere near ruth chris, morton or fleming's.", 
            "first time visit last weekend. we were a party of 18. i had the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>. oh soo yummy! the sauce was to die for. the fries.. you have never had fries like this.. and they went so well with the sauce. someone ordered the muscles and the sauce and the muscles were also delicious!\nthe french baguettes they serve with your meal was great. we had different sides and all were good. we ordered a few desserts and also all were devoured..\ni conducted a survey of our party of 18 and everyone loved the place!\nthe service was great too.\nplace is a bit noisy, though i am sure our party added to the noise!\nyou can sit outside and have a beautiful view of the bellagio fountains!\nbon appetit!",

            "french steakhouse at paris hotel with a view of the bellagio water show? sounded like a perfect dinner date! unfortunately the only appeal to this place is the location, which is absolutely amazing being able to sit through the water shows every 15 min during dinner. the food? not so much.\n\nwe received french bread and butter to start, just standard hard bread, not warm at all. \nas an appetizer we had the escargot, pretty good but only because it was heavily drenched in butter and a pesto that made eating snails tolerable.\nwe also shared a french onion soup -- served in a nice deep \"pot\" of a bowl, good for 2 people. looked tasty, but was somewhat bland. the broth had no bite to it whatsoever, no hint of sherry, just tasted like normal beef broth with plain onions.. note: onions were not caramelized. very subpar as far as french onion soups are concerned.\nthe main course sounded so delish. i ordered the steak bordelaise (caramelized onions and red wine sauce) while the bf had the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> (brandy peppercorn sauce). i ended up liking the flavor of the bordelaise much better, although both steaks were quite large and thin.. i don't know if french steaks are usually like this but it wasn't enjoyable whatsoever. even a mcdonald's burger patty is thicker than these steaks.. no joke. the pommes frites served with them are very reminiscent of potato chips.. not sure if all pommes frites are like this but they were just okay. $24 per plate? please.\n\nthe bill came out to $82.. without drinks. i think their strategy is to have their guests mesmerized watching the water show and not care so much about the quality of food. sorry, but, we noticed.\n\noverall:\nlocation - 5 stars\nfood - 2 stars\n= 3 stars\nand prices are a rip, even though this is vegas, an $80 dinner can buy you way better stuff than this.", 
            "my first time eating here was in '07, even though we have two mon ami gabi outposts in bethesda and reston back home. however, for some reason mon ami gabi in my area doesn't get half the kudos that the vegas location does.\n\nin any case, our first night in vegas lead us back to paris. we were here on october 29th and were able to secure a table without reservations. there is outdoor seating available, which is great for people watching, but as it was kind of nippy, we opted to eat inside. our server, according to my receipt, was dia, who was cute, knowledgeable, and provided excellent service. i ordered the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> with brandy peppercorn sauce, and my friend ordered the filet mignon with merlot butter and red wine reduction. now this is where i should really listen to my friend and heed her suggestions, as she is from oklahoma and girl knows her beef. while my steak was good, the steaks here are cut real thin. i ordered mine to be cooked medium and truth be told, when it's a thin slice of meat, you are better off asking for medium rare. her filet mignon, of course, tasted better than mine since hers is a better cut. the generous portion of fries are hand cut and also sliced thin, fried very crisp, and are reminiscent of the won ton crispy noodles you get when you order soup at chinese restaurants. this is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you want your fries to have some taste of potato, then you are best off ordering one of the side dishes. \n\nwe had also ordered a carafe of sangria (billed here as \"frangria\"), and we both agreed that it is one of the better sangrias that we have ever tried, and one of us has been to spain. at under $16, it was enough to provide a nice buzz and was cheaper than getting multiple cocktails or ordering a full bottle of wine. they do have wine by the glass, and if you are here in the fall, you can't go wrong with beaujolais nouveau. we didn't even have to pour it ourselves, as dia was always on the mark and filled our glasses when it got half full.\n\nfor dessert, my friend ordered the warm chocolate tarte tatin with caramel sauce and whipped cream. i got the pear parfait with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. with tax, my portion of the meal was $34.48, excluding gratuity. i can definitely recommend this place, as it was fairly inexpensive, but the amount of food, plus the service, makes for a great value. if you're not in the mood for dinner, try having dessert out on the patio with sangria, wine, or cocktails. it's a good way to start (or end) your vegas adventure.", 
            "it's a decent, casual place on vegas strip to chill, have some great food, and to get away from the blistering heat outside for a bit.\n\nthe service is great. i asked for seats that is close as possible to patio but not actually out in the sun and they got us a perfect table. \n\nwe ordered escargot baked in herb butter, scallops baked in more butter (this was really yummy), steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, and a entree salad to share between two. everything was delicious and in good portion size.", 
            "i really liked this restaurant. i went here for dinner and right from the beginning the experience was great. we didn't arrive in time for the first-come-first-serve patio seating, but since we had made reservations, we were seated bordering the glass window and the deck. this means that we got a full view of what everyone else sees from the deck, which is the beautiful bellagio fountain/water show and all the people walking by. \n\nwe ordered the scallops with the whipped cauliflower and spinach and we ordered the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> - brandy peppercorn sauce with fritas. the scallops were very flavorful, but a bit overcooked (still great). the steak was a bit too thin and the fries a little too salty, but also both were good. we also tried the french onion soup, which was delicious. it's one of the best that i've ever had.\n\nthe service was great and the prices were reasonable. i would definitely recommend this place to anyone going to vegas. make a reservation though so that you can get a better \"outside\" seating seat. it's one of the only places with an outdoor seating area next to cabo wabo.", 
            "came here based on yelp reviews during a short weekend in vegas.. and was not disappointed.\n\ndisclaimer- do not come here if you are looking for a long leisurely dinner.  we were in and out in 45 minutes having eaten bread, appetizers, and our main courses, and a whole carafe of frangria.  service was great though, but it seemed as soon as we ordered our food and our waitress put it in the computer, it was on our tables!  \n\nstarted with the petite salad- olive vinagrette had great flavor and just enough olive to be good, without being overbearing.  friend had the onion soup- he loved it so much he did not share!  the soup was more the size of a super tall crock with cheese dripping down the sides, just crisp enough (the best part!)\n\nmain course- steak classique.  huge piece of steak, and lots of butter flavor.  i was worried the steak may be lower quality based on the price, but it was actually very good, not tough, and easy to eat!   friend had the <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, and liked his flavor, though he had a bit more fat on his steak than me (lucky me!)\n\ndefinitly get the frangria (it is just like sangria)!  it was cheapish for vegas, and a hugh carafe of yummy wine mixed with fresh fruits.\n\nmon ami gabi is a good lv stand by- nice steak meal without paying an arm and a leg.  one point of advice- maybe order your appetizer and wait to order your main course if you do not want the meal to fly by too fast!", 
            "someone recommended mon ami gabi for dinner during my 24 hour trip to vegas, and to be honest, i was a bit skeptical of going to a chain (especially one a couple metro stops away from my home) during my glamorous vacay. still, after narrowing down what we wanted to eat, here we ended up. \n\nservice was fine, though i almost felt bad leaving the tip for the waiter when i felt like we saw the bus boy more. we were seated quickly (tuesday night), and there was a 45 minute wait for the patio. though it was one of the reasons i got the recommendation, we were way too hungry to wait (and we only had 24 hours in vegas people!!), but lucky to get a table right away just inside the patio. \n\nfood was good, and the portions were very generous. we were brought bread with butter and a little dish of carrot slaw--deeee-licious! we both ordered the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> which was a potato leek vichyssoise, also outstanding. i was a little surprised at the cut of my steak (i was expecting more of a sirloin type piece, but got what looked like hangar or skirt), but it was cooked well and the <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> sauce was flavorful. the frites were very thin and crispy to the point of not really tasting like potatoes anymore.\n\nback to the aforementioned patio: mon ami gabi is located in the paris casino, directly across the strip from the bellagio fountains, which makes it's patio so popular. since we had a window seat, though we couldn't hear the music, we could still see the fountains which made the dining experience very memorable. if you can't wait for the patio, definitely ask for a table inside it.",

            "mon ami gabi is a great choice for lunch or dinner on the strip. the service is very good, and it's not as expensive as a lot of other places further up the strip in the venetian or palazzo. in addition, the scene outside is unmatched, and being on the patio across from the bellagio fountains is a romantic setting. everything i've had here was well above average, the tomato salad, escargot, steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> were good, but the frites and profiteroles were amazing.",

            "everytime i come to vegas, this places is always busy - i knew we had to try it out. i made reservations, requested an outdoor seat and when i got there i had to wait 30 minutes. i understand that all of the outdoor seating is first come first serve so this wasn't too big of an issue. so for reference - if you want to sit outside with the view don't even bother making a rezzie, you'll be put on a wait list either way. we had cocktails at the bar right behind the outdoor patio, and the french martini was fabulous! we were sat down by a manager who was very friendly and the view was outrageous - directly in front of the bellagio and their fountains. i ordered the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> which was very good, and my boyfriend ordered the filet with the lobter tail which he loved as well. we also ordered a very good bottle of bourgogne, which was only 50 bucks! such a great deal for vegas - not the best steak but it was such a steal for a view, good wine, good food, and good service. definitely reccommend mon ami gabi!!!",

            "had a great time here. i ordered the french onion soup because i heard it was great. normally i don't like french onion soup and while i didn't love it i liked it more than any other i'd ever had before. for dinner i had steak frites <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> with a glass of beaujolais. the pairing worked well and the food was tasty. the steak was cooked just as i had ordered it, and despite being pounded very thin (something i usually don't like) it was actually very well done (medium rare but prepared like i want it). the frites were quite good as well and there were a ton of them. the coolest part is that you can sit out on the patio and watch the bellagio fountains. cool atmosphere. good food. if you can get on the patio do it.",

            "solid 5 stars for me, i love everything about this place, the food, the location, the service, i always make sure to stop here at least once every time i visit vegas...steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> and fish of the day never fails :) eating french food, and drinking french wine while looking at the bellagio fountains, and the strip...yes ! yes! yes! or should i say oui oui oui!", 
            "i'm not a huge fan of french food, but mon ami gabi was a pleasant surprise. maybe it's because i was starving from dancing all day at encore beach club, or maybe it's because i was too broke to spend much else on food all weekend. either way, mon ami gabi hit the spot at 4 pm on a saturday in vegas.\n\ni got the onion soup and the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>. the onion soup was a little bland but tasty, especially with all of that melted cheese. the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> was delicious -- the garlic pesto (?) bread it came with was sooooo good, and it was really hearty and filling dipped in the cheese and marinara sauce. i also tried some of my friends' food, which was all great. i think my favourite of everything i tasted was my friend's steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> -- hardly surprising. the steak had so much flavour, and the frites were perfectly fried.\n\nservice was pretty awful, unfortunately. luckily we weren't in a rush; otherwise the two hours it took for us to get in and get out with a reservation would've been a huge issue.", 
            "one of the best options for a steak on the strip that won't bust your budget, and bar none the best people watching in all of vegas, which by extension means we're talking about the best people watching in the world from the patio that overlooks the center of the las vegas strip and the bellagio fountains.\n\ntheir onion soup is a little different than most, with a touch of cream giving it a lighter color. the aroma is rich, beefy and intoxicating and the taste delivers.\n\nthis is a great lunch spot with sandwiches like an authentic croque-monsieur, ham and gruyere with bechamel, the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> served chilled with caramelized onions and mustard mayo with whole seeds, and a <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> that melts in your mouth.\n\nbut i mentioned steak earlier. let me come back to that. for $25 you get a plate of steak frites - i recommend the steak classique with maitre d'hotel butter or the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> with a delicious brandy peppercorn sauce.\n\nthe steaks and sandwiches are all served with frites, fried potatoes cut like the crunchy wonton strips you'd throw into a bowl of soup. these are among the best fries in town, simultaneously crispy and something you can really, literally, sink your teeth into.\n\ngreat view, great food, reasonable prices for center strip.", 
            "**summary**\n       - patio - the number one reason i'd come back is for the outside seating. you sit literally on the strip across from the bellagio water show that plays every half hour. it's the the best outdoor style cafe experience in vegas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=ntpchpgwpnfier56x1dz1q#ntpchpgwpnfier56x1dz1q).\n       - weather - i'd never come to mon ami gabi to sit inside; so, i'd recommend checking the weather and reserve the day of. you wouldn't want a wind, rain, heat, or cold to ruin your dining experience. unfortunately since this is vegas, there aren't many temperate days.\n       - steak - the steaks were thin and not from a good cut. i cut into a couple tendons throughout my dinner. they cooked them well, but it still didn't makeup for the poor piece of meat.\n       - price to quality - i'd say the price to quality of the steaks is pretty low. they cook them flavor-fully and well, but bad steak is still bad steak.\n       - frites - all the steaks are served with these chip-like french fries. it was a nice change, but i think i'd still prefer mash if i could have it.\n**ordered**\n       - $10.95 escargots (in garlic-herb butter) - 6 delicious snails that were of decent size (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=ex6zpq9ver6sipr-2sq0hq#ex6zpq9ver6sipr-2sq0hq).\n       - $25.95 steak bordelaise (caramelized onion, red wine sauce) - i liked this better than the other sauce. it definitely brought out the sweetness of the onions (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=bp-adb6a359t2vzjyzukfa#bp-adb6a359t2vzjyzukfa).\n       - $25.95 steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> (brandy peppercorn sauce) - i like peppercorn, but i think pepper in this was a little overpowering (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=3xipeljcotmrounjyi2rhg#3xipeljcotmrounjyi2rhg).\n**recommendations**\n       - i'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice date place and the weather is nice outside. sitting outside, across from the bellagio fountains definitely a unique experience. if you're not planning to sit inside, i'd say there are many other better places for this price.", 
            "we, a party of five dined here. reservations were made ahead of time so we had a table ready as we arrived (it seemed very busy, people waiting and all). the ambiance was casual and nice and the cafe was bustling with energy and life. the service and food were excellent (hitherto i had not eaten french cuisine much, but this place has made me a believer). i had the soup of the day (peas and ham), steak bordelaise with frites (done medium rare, it was great). the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> (peppercorn in brandy sauce) that my brother ordered was divine. for dessert we split three items among us, the chocolate mousse was my favorite, the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e and profiteroles were good too. all this washed down with some pinot noir made for a great culinary experience. a little on the expensive side but reasonable considering the location. from the patio one could see the bellagio fountains.", 
            "vegas tradition for boyfriend and i to eat here every vegas trip! :)\n\nthey have never disappointed me with food. ever. \n\nhowever the last time i went with my boyfriend, i got a horrible waiter who was obnoxiously rude and just didn't seem like he really enjoyed his job. although i love the food and i'm never scared to throw down the bills here because i'm always satisfied, the servers need to keep in mind that a lot of people going are expecting top service. c'mon your a restaurant right in front of the bellagio show, on the strip with patio seating. show customers a little decency here.... be nice or at least come when we obviously want to order or need something... \n\nanyways enough about him...\n\nescargot- yum\nsalmon- yum\nsteak- yum\nall the desserts - delicious\n<mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>- yum\n<mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>- yum\n\ni can go on forever... if your in vegas, stop by and give this place a try! u won't regret it!",

            "i think this has become my new favourite spot to eat in vegas. from start to finish, the whole experience was 5 stars!\n\ni had made a reservation for 9pm, and we were advised that if we wanted a table outside (which we did) that there may be a wait. so we headed to the paris about 40 minutes before our reservation time. i spoke to hostess and requested a table on the patio, and asked if we could try to get a table fairly up front and centered, so we'd have a good view of the bellagio and the fountains. she said she would do her best. half an hour later, we were being shown to our table by an incredibly friendly hostess who made conversation, and didn't just take us to our table like sheep. \n\nour table was perfect! right up front and dead center. we were able to people watch, and the fountains at the bellagio really helped set the scene for a romantic dinner on our last night in vegas. \n\nour server was attentive, but not overly so. knew the menu, knew the specials, and was able to make recommendations. friendly but not in your face. efficient but not cold. \n\nthe food was perfect. we started with the onion soup and warm brie, both were gone within minutes. be forewarned, however... the onion soup is not the onion soup you find at your average american restaurant. a nice big crouton, plenty of melted cheese, and that slight sweetness that you should have in a good onion soup. the brie was ridiculously good. melted and gooey, drizzled with a peppered honey, and whole cloves of roasted garlic. the baguette they bring you to start is warm, crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, and the butter is soft and spreadable (huge brownie points for that!). \n\nwe both went for the steak frittes: my partner getting the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, with the peppered sauce, and i ended up getting the bourdelaise and the bernaise sauce on the side, because i couldn't decide which i wanted. both were amazing, but i ended up pouring the light, slightly lemony bernaise on to my steak, which was perfectly rare and melt-in-your-mouth tender. the frittes were thin and cooked perfectly. we shared a side of ratatouille, that had incredible flavour and complemented the steaks perfectly. \n\na perfect end to our trip.", 
            "this place is really cute and all, but i did not leave dinner feeling impressed. the steak was talked up before we came here and reviews said it wasn't bad either. i've had my share of amazing steaks and this was so disappointing. it was $35 for the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> and i would much rather have spent my money elsewhere. i could have paid ten more dollars and gotten myself a fantastic steak elsewhere.\n\ni ordered my steak medium rare and it was cooked okay. my biggest gripe: it was covered in sauce. all it said on the menu was that it came with creme fraiche (which it did) but it was swimming in sauce. it was so overpowering that it ruined the meal. another girl at the table got the same thing and had the same feelings. sauce was so overpowering. good steaks don't really need anything other than a decent rub on the outside. i felt the meat was a bit low on flavor otherwise. you can sub the fries for mashed potatoes or another side for $1.95 more. \n\nthe sangria was good. they say it can serve 4, but really, it can serve 5. we also tried the chicken liver mousse. it was okay, but nothing to write home about. \n\noverall, it was a cute place, but that's pretty much it for me. it is on the cheaper side for vegas considering the atmosphere, but if you are in the mood for steak, look elsewhere. that extra $10 will really get you something 100  times better. we also initially had reservations for 6, but had a last minute cancellation, and they still automatically added in the 18% gratuity that is for parties of 6 or more? not cool.\n\nnote: patio seating is on a first come, first serve basis. reservations are only good for inside seating and your whole party must be present to be seated.", 
            "great food and atmosphere at a great price.  right on the strip.  this is a great place to eat in vegas.  i almost wanted to spluge on one of those ultra nice restaurants, but decided to be modest, and glad i did.\n\nthe steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, medium rare, was excellent.  we got the duck confit appetizer, and that was very good.  the frites are a nice side.\n\nthe waiter was one of the nicest, informative, and mindful i've ever had.\n\ni wish i had a bigger stomach, but i couldn't even down the steak and frites.  that meant no dessert unfortunately.  but why complain that the portions are too big?", 
            "10.22.12 mon ami gabi (las vegas, nv)\n\nthis is one of my favorite places to go to breakfast, lunch or dinner on the strip! mon ami gabi is located in the paris hotel on the las vegas strip. this restaurant has both indoor dinning and outside dinning. i highly recommend sitting outside so that you can see the lovely bellagio hotel water shows. not to mention the people watching. never know what you will see on the strip! mon ami gabi is very busy so we decided to go late (around 9:30pm) for dinner. when ordering drinks, our waiter informed us that they were out of disaronno. we ordered the warm brie cheese appetizer and steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> (brandy peppercorn sauce). the appetizer came out and it was unusually small. as i was looking around i noticed a table next to us had ordered it as well and it was equally small. i also caught the waiter telling the customer they were out of whatever it was that he had ordered. i must say that this is very unusual and i most definitely will not be going again on a monday night. our steaks were wonderful and i will go there again for not just the food but the atmosphere. dinner and a show!\n\n \n\n \n\nimpressed",

            "a little bit of paris, smack dab in the middle of the strip.  it's a perfect lunch spot with a grand view of the bellagio fountains.  unfortunately, the fountains don't start running until 3 p.m., so i guess if you're here in the summer, come for an early dinner (and avoid the lunch time heat if you're on the patio), if you're here in the winter, just come for lunch, minus the active fountains.  don't be scared, they have heat lamps everywhere.  \n\nfor seating, try to request either the open air patio or the enclosed glass ceiling bistro area (does remind me of bistro floors in paris, only cleaner and brighter).  the formal seating area inside is dark and gives off that reddish brown light of a stuffy steakhouse.  if the restaurant isn't packed full, then you're safe, because they default to seating people outside or in the bright covered area.  \n\ni started with a frangria, which i'm sure is not french.  it's red sangria that had good fruity/sweet balance and was inexpensive.  \n\nheavily recommended by my server was the french onion soup (which i normally love), but i didn't order it because i would've been too stuffed.  next time.  our server was very attentive.  \n\ni had the steak frites/steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> (brandy peppercorn sauce, $25.95) medium rare.  the steak is big flat piece, smothered with peppercorn sauce.  it was tender, juicy, and flavorful.  the steak frites are definitely worth getting, just pick your preferred sauce (butter, caramelized onion with red wine reduction, peppercorn, blue cheese).  \n\nthe frites/fries that accompany the steak are thinnish potato shavings that curl a bit after frying.  have you ever tried pik-nik ketchup fries from your grocery store?  their cut reminded me of that, except they have more give on the inside from fresh frying.  unique, yes.  i can see how some people would love these fries while others might hate them.  \n\nshe had the grilled salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> with avocados, blueberries, walnuts and citrus dressing ($17.95).  the salad was a solid choice, the citrus salmon played well with the avocados and blueberries.  \n\nwe were here for lunch.  if you come for dinner, you get more choices on the steak cuts.  added choices include filet mignon, hanger, new york strip and bone-in rib eye.  \n\nthis is a very relaxing place to have a meal with one of the grandest views in all of vegas, i can't wait to come back!",

            "i had dinner here with my two girlfriends and were serendipitously given a table with a view of the bellagio fountain show. atmosphere was absolute perfection and very romantic. there is quite a bit of a wait (approx 20 mins) even with a reservation so it can be a bit frustrating at first. however, once you are seated, the staff is wonderfully efficient and serve you freshly baked french bread (very tasty) and butter with shredded carrot appetizer (on the house) before you can bat an eyelash. our entrees were served to us within 5-10 minutes of ordering. amazing! \n\ni ordered the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, which is with the black peppercorn sauce. it was cooked to a perfect medium and tasted delicious. entrees typically come with a mound of thin french fries. we shared a bread pudding, which i cannot remember due to the overconsumption of sangria that night. but i remember that it was tasty and served a la mode. my most salient memory of this place---they have strong sangrias. order them if you want a nice glow during dinner. \n\noverall, i really liked this little cafe. it's a bit different from my usual, which is just your average mom and pop hole-in-the-wall shop. but i found it to be nice without being overly pretentious. \n\ntips: make a reservation because this place is veryyy popular and packed with people on the weekend.", 
            "had lunch there today.\nseemed like an assembly line when i showed up at the front desk - although there were at least 5 staff standing there and 1 guest in front of me, i wasn't greeted until the woman in front of me was seated. i was told they would give me a window seat, though i did not end up next to a window... ? i was in the patio. the temperature was perfect.\nas my server asked for my drink order, i picked up the drink menu but was immediately blocked by a pitcher of water. an assistant had reached over me to fill my water glass. i think he could've waited a few min!\nwhen i'm finally able to look at the menu i hear a \"thunk.\" oh, a loaf of bread has just landed on my table!\n\ni had a frangria, which was good.\ni had the french onion soup which everyone raves about - it was very good. a large quantity! i actually did not finish it.\nand i had the <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> burger, which was cooked to my preference, but a little too salty (they sprinkled large grain salt on the slice of tomato and, it seems, the rest of the plate).\ni barely touched the fries that came with my burger - they were mostly chewey! and a few were hard as rocks! not sure what all the raves about there.\n\noverall, the food was alright, but it was such an odd dining experience. many of the staff looked upset/grumpy (like the people who delivered my food). wasn't what i expected from reading all the yelp reviews.", 
            "we had a beautiful early dinner here on a saturday night during our girls' trip to vegas.  the other ladies had previously been here, and while i have dined at the eiffel tower restaurant, i had never been to mon ami gabi.  who knew you could get such a good view of the bellagio fountains without actually being at the bellagio!\n\nobviously you want to eat on the patio.  we made reservations through opentable for 4:45 and requested the patio, but then read that the patio is seated in a first come first serve basis, so you can't actually request it ahead of time.  well luckily for us, they had a table for six, perfectly shaded by an umbrella and seated us just in time for a fountain show.  this place was packed!  even so early on a saturday!  \n\nwe ordered a carafe of sangria for the table (lovely) and a st. germain's cocktail carafe (also lovely, but good in smaller portions, so thank goodness there were six of us).  we also shared a <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> appetizer.  not enough garlic bread comes with the order to sop up all the extra tomato sauce, but luckily their baguettes for the table are just as delicious and will be replenished if you ask.  the most impressive thing was the one of us was on a gluten-free diet, so not only did she get a special gluten-free menu, but they brought her gluten free bread!  not bad.  the rest of us enjoyed our gluten-packed alternatives and the pickled carrots that came with it were something i'd never think to serve with bread and butter, but strangely worked.  \n\nfor the entrees 2 of us got steak, 2 got fish, one got veggies, and one got chicken.  the portions are very plentiful, the sauces well-balanced, and the food was all fresh and warm.  i opted for the filet <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>.  we were informed the filets were so tender we could cut them with a butter knife...which may explain why we didn't get steak knives.  while i do love fork-tender meat, i also sometimes appreciate a steak knife, even if i \"don't need it\".  i hit a little gristle at one point that was very hard to work through with just my regular table knife, but at that point it wasn't worth it to ask for the steak knife.  other than that, the steak tasted wonderful, and it was cooked perfectly rare for my tastes.  my second gripe, though, was with the \"fries\" that came with it.  i love that they're innovative and these aren't just typical steak fries, but unfortunately they didn't float my boat.  they were very much a cross between fries and chips.  i'm not a fan of potato chips unless they're flavored or i have dip for them.  but when i'm eating a nice filet, i especially am not in the mood for potato chips.  le sigh.  they weren't committed enough to either the fry or the chip lineage, so i was left disappointed.  now i imagine for the rest of the dining public, they'd probably love a chip/fry hybrid.  sadly, even a side of mayo to dip my fries in (it's so good!  and very belgian) didn't help much.  \n\nwe were too stuffed for dessert, sadly, but in all the dining experience was lovely, and the food really was delicious (minus my personal vendetta against the \"fries\").  i would gladly go back, because you get a nice meal for a much more reasonable price than at many of the other fancy vegas gourmet restaurants with an unbeatable view.", 
            "i arrived early (5 pm) in the hopes of beating the rush, and it worked. i waited about 15 minutes for an outside table (even at 5 pm!). when i left, a crowd had formed.\n\nthe waitress was very nice. i was overlooking the bellagio fountains, which was nice; otherwise, i people- and traffic-watched, which was kind of fun.\n\ni ordered pate, steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, and chocolate mousse. to drink, i had a house merlot and a cup of coffee.\n\ni think they brought me the wrong pate, as there are two--a <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> and a <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark>. the former comes with pickles, and the latter is a liver-and-wine pate. what i ate was good, so no complaints, but be aware that there are two pate appetizers, so mix-ups are possible. \n\nthe steak was good--i'd asked for rare, but in hindsight, they really couldn't cook a steak that thin rare, so that was more on me than them that it was closer to medium. i don't fault them for that. the fries were an interesting almost hybrid of a fry and a chip (or if you're english, a chip and a crisp!). the mousse came with little chocolate crispy things on top and was quite nice. i'm not a wine drinker, so i won't even attempt to judge the wine. the coffee was fine.", 
            "my dear, dear sweet friend gabi you never disappoint!  we typically visit mon ami at least once during any given trip las vegas but this time we were drawn in four times in three days.  yup...twice in one day.  do your hear me?  out of maybe seven meals, four were consumed in this great establishment.  \n\nit's located in paris and we were staying there so the convenience factor played in a little bit but we truly love it.  the mussels are phenomenal.  escargot is out of this world...get extra bread to sop up all that parsley garlic butter.  the breakfast cheeseburger did not disappoint.  salmon platter was just right.  <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> also a winner.  <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> were oysters...not the biggest fan but fine.  steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> was, again, just right.  \n\nservers are extremely professional and courteous.  they are well versed about wine selections.  \n\nplease, do yourself a favor...visit mon ami next time you're in \"paris\"!", 
            "excellent food!!\n\nthe steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> is amazing - but there is not a bad thing on the menu. the service is friendly and prompt, and the food is to die for.  i'll definitely be back next time i am in vegas.", 
            "great place for steak without spending an arm and a leg like ruth chris or morton's.  we request to be seated outside in front of the restaurant so we can see the bellagio water show. waited was less than 15mins on a monday around 7pm. this place gets super jammed packed but i guess we just happen to beat the crowd and got seated very fast.  very friendly staff and noticed each server had its own assigned duty, from being a waiter, to a busier to bread & water guy.  service is very fast yet still able to maintain that upscale class.  i swear i saw around 30 servers just in the outside patio area. \n\nnow comes down to the food:\n\ncomplementary fresh bagget with homemade slivers of beets.  bread and butter is great and the beets are awesome which complements the bread very well. i hate beets in the first place but they tasted like apples. \n\ni tried the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> with the brandy peppercorn sauce which is awesome and very tasty. also tried the hanger steak with the merlot butter which was to die for.  hands down on the sauce as it complements the steak very well.  classic bearnaise sauce pretty good too but i'd prefer the merlot butter sauce instead. in my opinion,  mash potatoes were delicious and i would substitute it instead of the frites because they go a little over board on it.  reminds of a over cooked shredded hash brown. \n\nthere is no dress code, but people that are dressed up are usually placed inside while the casual wear customers were placed outside. \n\ni'd definitely my make rounds back her for a nice dinner out in the patio watching the bellagio water show.", 
            "7/4/13  dinner\n\nmy third time dining at mon ami gabi doesn't disappoint. for a french steak restaurant on the strip, this place offers great food at a great value. my party of 4 arrived promptly for 6:30pm reservation. surprisingly we were offered the option of indoor dining or the patio outside overlooking bellagio fountain across the street. patio is usually first come-first serve but on a 108f day we just didn't feel like eating outside. plus all the hustle-and-bustle on the street.\n\nserver was friendly, ready to make cocktail suggestion. despite being very busy for 4th of july, service was not pushy at all. we spent almost a cocktail's time looking over the big menu, which features grain-fed mid-west beef.\n\n*paris romance ($12): a rum base cocktail with a tinge of lemoncello. \n*grey goose cosmopolitan ($14): just the way i like it, a slightly more vodka compared to cranberry juice, fresh lime (there's pulp) a beautiful pink\n\nour table goes for beef since this is a classic french bistro specializes in meat.\n\n*<mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> ($10.95): the tangy red wine mustard goes really well with the very creamy liver spread on warm toast. it really set the mood of dinner for the evening.\n\n*<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> ($34.95): very tender, almost like wagyu, beef seared to a medium-rare pink, with a butter/red wine reduction. i've had harris's filet mignon and loved it. but mon ami gabi is just as juicy, and every bite of meat is \"even.\" this is one of the best filet mignon i have had. the handcut frites are warm crispy, with the texture of sliced potato chips. they give you so many that i couldn't finish.\n\n*steak classique ($24.95): a slimmer cut sirloin steak served with house-special herb butter. my bf also had it medium rare and it was pink like mine. he did better with the frites and licked the plate clean.\n\n*steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> ($25.95): probably the strongest tasting steak on our table, served with a brandy peppercorn sauce. our dining companion also opted her sirloin medium rare. i was very impressed at the overall consistency in how their meat was prepared here. \n\n*prime cheeseburger ($12.95): with blue cheese. this is a mon ami gabi's classic and they charge the same price as for lunch. medium cooked beef patty served on a brioche bun. instead of fries, my dining companion got french green beans on the side. \n\nwe concluded the meal with warm chocolate torte and assorted sorbet. the whole experience---food, service, drinks, and decor, is top-notch but you pay decent prices for it. it's one of the best value on the strip. make sure you have a reservation. i always have dinner here when i'm in vegas.", 
            "what a great restaurant! inside and out has great ambiance! we made a reservation for dinner and were seated inside but were just at the big open doors for the patio with a view of the strip and bellagio, great spot!!! our table enjoyed the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> (brandy peppercorn sauce), <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> (butter, red wine reduction) and steak bearnaise. everything was delicious but my personal fav was the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, delicious and highly recommend!!!! we substituted our side for the whipped cauliflower and the sauteed mushrooms, both excellent choices!!!!", 
            "went to gabi's last tuesday before leaving las vegas and fellow yelpers did not steer me wrong.  excellent food and excellent service and, and and... (very important for vegas-on the strip restaurants... the prices were extremely fair for the quality of the food.  (hey, gabi management.... don't start raising prices cause i said this!!! )  all i am saying is that if you go to some of the dumpy restaurants in some of the hotels, you pay through the nose for food that belongs inside a septic tank before its time.  for example, there is a restaurant in the rio that wants 28 for a chicken pot pie.. really rio? \nhad the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, trout, and <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>.  one of my guests who had the steak told me it was soooooo delicious that if she were home she would be licking the plate until it no longer needed washing... (a beautiful image). the guest who had the trout said it was the best trout he ever had... and the croque monsiuer was excellent but a little on the greasy side because of all the butter and cheese.  i think gabi's can cut back a little on the butter since the delicious gruyere cheese that it is made with provides most of the fat this sandwich needs.  i must share with you that i am a french onion soup aficionado.  i eat it here and in my favorite city in the whole wide world---paris.  well, i ordered the french onion soup at gabi's and it looked amazingly beautiful-- a tall crock of soup with melted gruyere cheese perfectly broiled on top resulting in gorgeous spots of darkened gruyere--yum.  however, then i tasted it.  it was reeking with sugar.  yes sugar.  so sweet i couldn't eat it.  when i beckoned the waiter to discuss it, he told me the onions caused the sweetness because they were sweet onions.  in response to the waiter's answer, i am going to put on the voice of an irate waiter in paris. (now use your imagination and think of a balding, older gentleman who has been on his feet for at least 7 hours dealing with american tourists)  they go deep into their throats before saying : 'noh! (that would be an american \"no\".)  i too say no to the theory that the onions caused the sweetness.  do you know why?  because i cook  that's why!  i believe that this soup has been americanized to address the palettes of some americans (i said some so don't write back insulting me!).  they added sugar, lots of it and because of the color of the soup,  i believe they added some marsala wine which also provides some sweetness.  the ending of the french onion soup saga is that they graciously took it back.  they are a class act.  and did i forget about the service????   amazing.  one of my guests had their water glass filled 7 times.  i'm not kidding.  and, and, and, did i forget to tell you about the baguette????  yes,  a complete baguette in a bakery bag--- delivered still warm from the oven presented with a generous portion of spreadable butter.  yes spreadable --not those hard little bricks most restaurants serve.  and did i tell you we sat on the patio overlooking the strip?  with misters to keep us cool???  why did i leave thist to the end?.....  because the food was the star of the show.   i am sooooooo sorry that i went to gabi's on my last day in vegas.... if i had been there the first day, i would have chained my leg to one of the tables on the patio and eaten there every day breakfast, lunch and dinner... i would allow someone to take me to the bathroom every few hours only if they promise to give me back my table upon my return.  otherwise, i'll skip the bathroom breaks.     thanks gabi management and staff for a wonderful experience and having a really great restaurant!", 
            "started out great. excellent waitress. very friendly and explained menu. the french bread was hot and fresh and delicious. escargot for an appetizer was hot and tasty as can be. petite salad was very earthy and seasoned to perfection. main course was a bit of a disappointment though :( hubby had filet mignon wrapped in bacon (3 pieces) each one being a worst to better cut of meat with unchewable tendons and he ordered it medium and it was pretty raw. i couldn't decide between steak bearnaise or steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> so waitress suggested both sauces on the side. sauces were tasty but steak was more like a smashed flank steak, but tasty. so as i said it started out great but didn't end on a good note. i heard the place had better steaks a few years ago, unfortunately", 
            "a weekend jaunt to vegas with friends to celebrate a birthday weekend ended up with dinner at mon ami gabi. i love this place. we had a reservation, as there were about 12 of us. they would not seat us til all of the party was there. we opted to wait in the crowded bar and have frenchy little drinks til we could be seated. the waitress was awesome! i have multiple food allergies and she first took down, patiently, what they were, so that no cross contamination would occur in the kitchen process. this was a saturday night and it was packed! she gave me pointers on what to order and there was also a gluten free menu. the menu actually had more than just a few items too and gluten free bread was served with olives just like the other gluten lad bread. gotta say, i was impressed. i had the filet <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> ; so good and tender. we had mussels for an app, duck confit and cheeses, as well. everything was amazing. the creme brulee was a bit boring. all in all its a great place with a great view of the fountains if you get the right seat in the dining room, as we did or out on the patio. there are warmers, in case of chilly nights. make a reservation! this place gets busy!", 
            "booked a reservation here for 7:30 on a thursday night and was surprised we still had to wait in line... nonetheless - it moved fairly quickly and we were seated with a cozy table on the inside corner of the main dining room.  \n\nmy date and i ordered the warm brie for an appetizer and though he bit into a large (sexy) piece of garlic on first bite, we both agreed that the flavor was incredible.  i greedily slurped down the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> - a carrot/ginger combination that went down like baby food - and ordered the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> for my main course.  to die for.  the meat was cooked to order and i was only saddened that i couldn't finish because i was so full!  he had the ny strip prepared with carmelized onion and red wine sauce - and it too was amazing.  both meats were served with the best hand-cut frites i've ever tasted... both crunchy and soft, flavored and oh so yummy... i'd go back just for those.  \n\nwe shared a bottle of cotes du rhone and skipped dessert because we'd made reservations upstairs for pistachio souffle at the eiffel. \n\nexcellent meal.  romantic night setting.  could have been the company, but i'd definitely return.", 
            "i came here last year for dinner with gardenia h. and keri w. and i loved it. we were seated on the patio so we had a perfect view of the bellagio fountains (which were doing their water show) and had this lovely breeze coming through. it was so nice and relaxing to be out there, not to mention enjoying great company and delicious food! we were started off with complimentary bruschetta, which was delicious, although a little hard to eat since we had to cut the bread outselves (they gave us a full loaf).\n\nfor our steaks, gardenia got the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> (creme fraiche) and keri got the bone-in ribeye (22 oz with bearnaise sauce). i no longer remember what their steaks were like, but we unanimously agreed that mine was best. so what did i get? i listened to all the yelpers on here and got the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> (butter, red wine reduction). i got it medium rare and it was delicious. so tender and flavourful. i still think it was one of the best steaks i have ever had. and all their steaks come with their signature hand-cut fries, which are also really good. keri also got whipped cauliflower as a side. it was just fine to me (i'm not a fan of cauliflower), but i think keri liked it. and for dessert, we got their bananas foster crepe (warm bananas, foster sauce, vanilla ice cream). such a perfect (and delicious) way to end the meal :)\n\nthe patio was a little crowded, but it was still a great experience. they do not seem to have a bathroom inside the restaurant, i was told to go inside the casino and use their bathroom (it was a 30-second walk from the front of the restaurant). our server was nice and friendly and i had a great time here. this place probably deserves more like 4.5 stars but i'm leaving it at 4.", 
            "got the steak classique which didnt seem like anything special. the quality of the steak was average and felt like i could make it at home, but the maitre d'hotel butter that was on top was pretty good. i think i was deciding between this and my usual choice of steak which is the filet, but it was lunch time so it seemed more proper to get this dish. should've been safe and went with the filet. their fries were interesting but not amazing, got kind of oily near the end.\n\nthe item i remember most would probably be the french onion soup, or the \n<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> which was baked with gruyere cheese. that was full of cheesy deliciousness, one of the best french onion soups i've had in awhile.\n\ni also tried my friend's steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> (brandy peppercorn) and steak bordelaise (caramelized onion & red wine sauce), and ultimately their sauces were satisfying, but i just didnt enjoy the steak itself.\n\nalso, the two guys i was with were both wearing tanks and had to wear a huge white t over because apparently a tall t is so much better.\n\noverall, not bad but maybe i should give it another shot before jumping to conclusions. if you do come here definitely try the french onion soup because that was what made a lasting impression.", 
            "i think this may be one of the only restaurants on the strip that we went to that didn't feel like a strip restaurant (unless you sat outside in front of the fountains).  the service was prompt and the food was cooked to perfection.  my steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> wasn't prepared how i am used to seeing this dish, but it was fantastic nonetheless.  quality food and reasonable prices.", 
            "oh em ge!!! no wait for brunch at this place on a sunday made me super happy especially since i was pretty hungry and ready for some coffee. we were given the option to decide if we wanted outdoor or indoor seating. we opted for outdoor being that it was a beautiful morning after a rainy weekend in las vegas. mon ami gabi is located inside the paris resort and casino. \n\nwe were seated by the edge of the patio with view to the bellagio fountain. our waitress came over and introduced herself. she also gave us a few recommendations being that it was our first time and specials that were not on the menu. before i knew it i had my cup of coffee in front of me and was watching one of the few fountain shows from across the street. \n\ni ordered the french toast. i noticed that it said it was served with blueberries and warm blueberry syrup, topped with whipped cream.. well i was a bit scared. i am not a fan of blueberries being that i was always fooled as a child (blueberry pancakes are not the same as chocolate chips, mom!) i decided to go for it and face my fears especially since i knew already that it was going to be full of blueberries. lemme tell you this, it was the most perfect french toast ever that i have had in a very long time. the sweetness was done to perfection, the blueberries themselves were perfect, everything about this meal was just magical and out of this world. the french toast was cooked just right. it makes me want to cry of happiness. i could eat this all day, errday and be a happy person forever! i would highly recommend this dish. i would skip out on waiting for the buffet line any day for this dish here in vegas. yes, yes i am in love with this french toast. \n\nit was a pleasant experience and it became one of my favorite places to be at. the atmosphere, super good food and the great view made me feel like i was not in sin city. \n\nthey also serve lunch and dinner. i would love to come back and have a glass of wine and also try out their steak bordelaise, steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, creme brulee, duck confit & fingerling potato and their <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> cause sure whyyyy not.. i love this place!!", 
            "if you're going to eat at mon ami gabi, make sure you get seated outside...especially if you go at night. even as las vegas locals, we had a lot of fun sitting outside watching the fountains. they've also got a really good heating system outside making it comfortable on colder nights.\n\nas far as food goes...it was okay. i had the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> which came out overcooked for my taste and pretty dang tough. for whatever reason, the brandy peppercorn sauce was all over half my fries and not the steak so i didn't think the flavor was all that great either. my wife ordered the filet bordelaise which blew mine away. her steak was tender and topped with just the right amount of onions and a really tasty red wine sauce. we enjoyed the frites too and they give you a huge portion!\n\nthe service was ok but i felt extremely rushed. our waiter seemed annoyed that our table took a bit of time to decide on what to eat and spend some time chatting after dinner. with drinks and tip, our bill was $400 which may be small to them but doesn't mean we should get subpar service. maybe it was just a bad night but nothing blew me away and i wouldn't go out of my way to come back.", 
            "food: delicious! definitely get one of the steak frites. my boyfriend got the fish & chips, and they weren't as amazing as what the rest of the family got. i personally loved my steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, my boyfriend's brother loved his steak bordelaise, and my boyfriend's dad got the ribeye. the portions and quality of food are worth the price. definitely try one of the desserts - the warm chocolate cake was fabulous.\n\nservice: the service was good, but if you need to be on time for a show (like the o at the bellagio across the street), make sure to tell your server asap! i told the hostess as she walked us to the door, but i really should have also spoken with the server immediately. she took her time at first before we spoke to her about our tickets, but after that was absolutely perfect, getting the food out to us quickly, etc. our water glasses were always full, and we got everything we wanted.\n\nlocation/seating: we got a perfect table right at the edge of the patio. unless it's super cold, definitely sit on the patio. there are heat lamps, you can people-watch, and you have front-row seating for the bellagio fountain show.\n\ngetting a table:\nokay, here's the info i really need you to know: just try everything. try to get a reservation (indoors only), then show up 45-60 minutes before you actually want to eat and ask for an outdoor patio seat. you can also ask for an indoors table, but the ambiance wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary for a fancy restaurant.\n\nthe reason why this place is 4 stars instead of 5 is because of their ridiculous approach to tables. i wanted to eat at 5:30 to get to our 7:30 show at the bellagio. no reservations except for 4:30 and 9:30 - i went with neither. so my boyfriend and i showed up an hour early and went to separate lines (???) for an indoor table vs. an outdoor table. he could get an outdoor table that could be ready around 5:30 (perfect) and i couldn't get anything until 9. i just got mad when we were escorted to our patio table and we passed by several empty tables that could have accommodated our party. that was frustrating and i could see how that wouldn't be great if the weather was terrible (unlikely) or if someone really needed to sit inside. i dunno, that just didn't make any sense.", 
            "yelps 365 review challenge 2014 - los angeles #24 - #365\n\nif you want to experience french cuisine in a romantic or casual setting, than, \"mon ami gabi\" is the perfect choice for you. this restaurant is located across from the eiffel tower ride in the casino and along the vegas strip where you can watch the bellagio fountains from the outdoor patio. everything here was exquisite, from the staff, restaurant decor and of course the french food!\n\ni came here on a variety of occasions; wedding receptions, birthdays, family and friends. every time i dine at mon ami gabi, it always works out to perfection and it's hard to fault on anything except for the wait, but that's minor. \n\nsome of the items i've ordered in mon ami gabi:\n\n+<mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> - $15.95\n+<mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> - $13.95\n+<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> - $9.95\n+<mark>Caesar Salad</mark> - $11.95\n+filet mignon - $35.95\n+<mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> burger - $13.95\n\neverything here was delicious and the service was 5 stars all the way. if any of my friends of family were visiting las vegas for the first time, than mon ami gabi would be on my, \"must do list!\" especially the patio seating because it offers some of the best views of the center strip and it can be hard to get a table there. \n\ntip: book a table in advance!\n\nbon appetite!!", 
            "excellent outdoor dining and top service! love the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> and the delicious greens. this is now my favorite restaurant on the strip!", 
            "une brasserie vraiment fran\\u00e7ais, on the las vegas strip? mais, bien sur! having been to france many times, mon ami gabi reminded me so much of a real parisian brasserie (casual restaurant and drinking establishment).  especially the open-air tables on the patio facing the strip, if you are lucky enough to get a table there. unfortunately, even with reservations (very much needed) you are not guaranteed a table on the patio during meal times. \nother than our obstructed view of the bellagio fountains, though, this was a pretty nice experience. it had all the bustle of a real brasserie, and briskly efficient (and even a bit snooty) service from an older french waiter. the special entree of the night, 2 gorgeous lamb chops, was really a standout. steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> was also very good. i was surprised the duck leg that i ordered was listed as an \"appetizer\"! it was the biggest, most delicious chunk-o-duck i've ever eaten (a bargain at $12.95)! i added the whipped cauliflower as a side, and not only had to share that around the table; but ultimately had to learn to make it at home b/c my husband liked it so much! \nfor dessert, the creme brulee was excellent--in this city, they better be on their a-game with a dessert that every restaurant here offers! (i'm making it my personal mission to try every creme brulee in this town :-) the only thing that was a little weird were the pommes frites: they weren't the hot, salty, shoestring french fries i had in the classic \"steak frites\" in france; but more like those dry potato sticks one gets in canisters. some of us liked them, some did not.\nnot as expensive as we feared it might be (then again, only one of us had an alcoholic drink).this is not the experimental, uber-upscale french; this is casual french, with a lot of \"brasserie\" standards. \nagain, get reservations! then decide whether you want to eat inside and have a conversation, or sit outside and absorb the overwhelming experience that is the strip in the evening; because you won't be able to do both.", 
            "i hope i just came here on an off night, or over 3000 yelp reviewers have messed-up taste buds.\n\ni trotted over here for dinner and had a reservation, so i was seated promptly near the big window with a very pretty view of the bellagio fountains and the cosmopolitan. the place was pretty busy and loud, which i liked!\n\nokay. the food here was so underwhelming.. and just plain bad. i am sorry to say. i guess this is better for brunch/lunch and not dinner?\n\nservice: maria was nice and attentive.\n\nthe bread: cold, chewy, a bad sign.\n\nthe wine: we got the pinot noir. which was a bad decision for me because i just don't like alcoholic drinks. my mom was okay with it. it was alcohol-y. undertohnes of alcohol and ohvertones of ick. but i am just immature.\n\nthe appetizer:\n\nescargot: very meh and unspecial. where was the flavor?? i felt like i was eating tenderized, flavor-less snails in a soup of sat fats.. which is what that was.\n\nthe entrees:\n\nseared scallops: whaaaat?? the heck?? the scallops were sandy to the bite and had this disgusting bitter aftertaste. so disappointing. we had to slice off the tops and bottoms to try to avoid the bitter flavor. the sweet pumpkin cream and mushrooms under the scallops were tasty, though.\n\nsteak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>: long, thin steak served next to a bunch of cut fries. i liked it, but it wasn't anything special! i could have made this meal, maybe even a tastier version of it, with some steaks and potatoes from costco!\n\ntoo bad. i was hyped up for this place for reasons that have everything to do with yelp, but this isn't the first time i have been disappointed by fake french food.\n\nalso, i got really sick after eating here and took some cvs antacids. it was not a nice night afterwards. i think this place has a great location and view and potential, but the dinner choices disappointed me! it was so below basic.\n\ni recommend looking elsewhere for a dining experience with focus on good food, because this isn't it. eat somewhere else, even if it takes an extra cab ride.", 
            "you must order steak frites when you come here. ignore the rest of the menu and focus in on the steak. it's their specialty for a reason. both versions of the filet mignon and the new york strip steak with bordelaise sauce were incredible. the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> had more of a kick to it, but was cooked to perfection and delicious like the rest of the steaks we tried. our knives slid through our juicy cuts of meat like butter and each bite was rich with flavor and spice. i also ordered a glass of the pinot noir, which was light and fruity. for dessert we tried the cr\\u00e8me brulee, which was decadently rich and caramelized.\n \nreservations at mon ami gabi are a necessity. i reserved through my yelp app via opentable, which was easy and convenient. the patio is prime for people watching; the interior recalls a parisian bistro. the service was excellent and our food came quickly.", 
            "tucked into paris casino, mon ami gabi serves delicious french-style food in an surprisingly elegant atmosphere. it certainly adds significantly to the french atmosphere of the casino. we were in town for my stepson's wedding & his uncle jay hosted a lovely family dinner at this charming restaurant.\nwe started with escargot all around the table. tender & beautifully prepared with butter & garlic, the likes of these snails are rarely found & everyone seemed to enjoy them very much. delicious bread & butter was also served with our appetizer & replenished throughout our meal. our host's wine choice this evening was cotes du rhone, an excellent offering & the perfect choice to accompany our appetizer & steaks.\nas a fan of pepper, i could not resist steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, which turned out to be the most popular order in our group. a few of our people ordered steak roquefort & steak classique, and every one of us was pleased with our choices. our steaks were served with classic pommes frites, belgian-style french fries.\nenjoying my steak cooked rare-medium rare, i'm always afraid that it will be overcooked, but these fine chefs delivered a perfectly rare steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> - exactly as i ordered. very delicious, worthy of savoring slowly, and the total effect of atmosphere, the wine, and high quality food was akin to a mystical experience, like a brief sojourn into a lovely dreamworld!\nwe shared creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e & creme puffs for dessert. both finely done & perfect postludes to the entire show.\nour only glitches were quite minor.  the street-view dining room was quite chilly, which made our ladies a bit uncomfortable. if this concerns you, i suggest trying another area of the restaurant on your visit. otherwise, our waiter was not certain which guest was to get each dish, a typical problem that should be expected in a large dining party that orders very similar items. these are not enough to keep us from returning - in fact, we look forward to it!", 
            "i made reservations here out of convenience since i was staying at the paris hotel, and it definitely did not disappoint. \n\nwait - \nabout 5 minutes on a saturday night with reservations. there's a separate line that you wait in if you have reservations, but it moves very quickly. i made the reservations only 2 hours before.\n\nservice - (4/5)\npretty good. nothing particularly memorable. \n\nfood - (5/5)\nexcellent! their freshly made baguette was excellent, and a great starter (not to mention free)! i had their filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> steak frite, which was cooked to perfection at medium rare. at $31.95, it was definitely a good quality steak that was tender all throughout the meat. we also had the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> and the special salmon salad. my only qualm about the scallops is that it was small in portion, and definitely not filling as an entree in itself.\n\nprice - $$$ (including wine)\nfairly affordable considering the meal was less than $150 for 4 including three entrees and two glasses of wine.", 
            "mmmm, sizzlin'!\n\ni don't know how we scored an outside table with a perfect view of the bellagio fountain and the strip, but the view and weather were fantastic! our server (think his name was scott) had worked there 10 years and was a pro. great service and solid advice on a wine pairing. \n\ni has the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> and my wife had the bearnaise. their frites are crazy thin and unlike anything i've seen before. food was delicious, though i was less impressed by their trademark onion soup, to be honest. \n\na little pricey but hey, it's vegas!",

(it may be too dark for some since i saw a few people use their flashlights on their phone to look at the menu....lol)\n\nmy boyfriend and i ordered the \"salmon, spinach and baby kale\" to share. the salad consist of avocados, blueberries, walnuts and citrus dressing. big enough portion to count as an entr\\u00e9e. everything on that plate was fresh.\n\nmy boyfriend ordered the <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> steak with brandy peppercorn sauce. he's a steak connoisseur so of course he would think this was \"okay, i've had better.\" well of course he would think it tasted ok because he eats at delmonico's and carnevino regularly but that's besides the point. (sorry hun....i had to throw that out there! don't get mad! =) )\n\nfor my entr\\u00e9e, i ordered one of their specials of the day. it was seared trout (i asked to make sure it cooked well done) with a few roasted potatoes and carrots in the mix. it also included a portion of shell pasta with a light pesto sauce. (see pic attached.) hands down i would order this again.", 
            "this was a gorgeous restaurant in the paris casino. it had a wonderful patio that was great for people watching and the food was second to none. the service was excellent as well. my wife and i both ordered steak frites prepared slightly differently. i had the <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>. i thought this was better than the straight up steak. a little too much garlic on that one for my liking. nice beer and wine selection. really enjoyed the experience.", 
            "my family and i have lived here since 1989. i absolutely love going to mon ami gabi. every time we go there we always request to get seated outside to get a great view of the bellagio fountains. during the spring and fall is the perfect time to sit outside. i would only sit out there at night if you are here in the summer. i highly recommend you make reservations as well through opentable or calling to request this seating in advance. \n\nthe bread is buttery with a smooth butter spread. the last time we went my boyfriend ordered the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> and i had the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>. i personally enjoyed the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> more because of the rich tomato sauce. the pate was also delicious especially on that warm toast. \n\nwe shared the french onion soup, which was tasty. it was not too salty and the cheese was melted well over the bread. probably one of the best french onion soups i have had in vegas. \n\nfor the main course, i had the steak frites <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> and my boyfriend had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>. if you enjoy a creamy peppercorn sauce then get the <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>. i recommend the filet mignon as a must for first-timers. the steak was so soft and juicy. the merlot sauce pushed the experience to the next level. my taste buds were ecstatic to enjoy something so decadent. the filet mignon here is the best for those who do enjoy tender meat. we both got ours medium. \n\nour sides were the frites (fries) and the brussel sprouts. enjoyed them both as well! however, we did see the whipped cauliflower and the sauteed mushrooms pass by our table, which also looked delicious so i would recommend trying those if you want lighter sides. \n\nfor dessert, we shared the creme brulee. it was a decent size. the top was crisp and the custard was excellent. i highly recommend this dish as well. the ambiance was perfect for a beautiful date night, birthday celebration, or anytime you are feeling fancy for great steak. service was excellent! i love how authentic it was to have someone from france wait on us. it really brought the experience together.",

            "quite simply my favorite place to get a steak while in las vegas. it always blows my mind how savory tender and perfect they get it every time.  the <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> sauce is a must with whichever cut you decide.\n\nunder $30 gets you an incredible sirloin and around $40 gets you the ribeye or ny cut.  ambiance is always perfect and the help is always on point.  \n\nmon ami gabi i will never quit you.", 
            "steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> is to die for. so are the pom frittes. and the friss\\u00e8 salad. can't go wrong with anything on the menu. the staff is always nice and they have a great view of the bellagio fountains. one of my favorites for sure."

            "mmm the bread came with this carrot spread - so delicious; that was probably one of the highlights. we got great seating (a four person table all to my boyfriend and i) with a lovely view of the bellagio fountains. \n\nwe were craving french onion soup (<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark>) and this hit the spot! there's a generous amount of gruyere cheese in the soup; so ooey-gooey delicious. \n\nmy boyfriend and i shared the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, it was nice but nothing super special. \n\none complaint is that our server didn't seem to know much about wine recommendations...other than that the food came quickly and was above average quality.", 
            "i rarely give 5 stars...and i'm really picky about my steak. i was in vegas with the bf, decided i'd turn to yelp for some good dinner recommendations. yelpers, you didn't let us down. we came here for dinner our first night in vegas.\n\nwe had escargots as appetizer. my first time having snail so i had nothing to compare it to, and i tend to get hesitant about unusual/exotic foods...but bf said it was really good so we'll go with that.\n\nfor dinner, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> steak, medium-well, came with their fries. it was amazing, cooked to perfection, full of flavor. i like my meat to be juicy and tender but not very red. at a lot of places, if you request your meat to be well done, the meat comes out to dry, and if you want it juicy, you have to go with medium or rare. but this place did an amazing job at making it perfect - cooked well enough for my taste but still juicy and flavorful. bf had the steak bordelaise, which he was very happy with as well.\n\ngreat experience, will definitely be back when in vegas again!", 
            "amazing! i am not usually a meat and potatoes person, but this place may have changed my mind. the crusty baguette with butter was a great starter, the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> was mind blowingly good, the service was fast and very friendly despite the place being packed, and the ambiance was great. also very reasonably priced for a las vegas steakhouse. will be returning for sure next year.", 
            "had the best steak everrrrr... fillet <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> was great!!! and the view of the bellagio fountain was also nice. try to sit outdoor though, i think it's part of the experience. it's a bit pricey but if you think of the food quality and ambience, it's really pretty reasonable :)", 
            "so far this is my boyfriend & i's favorite dinner place in las vegas. we were given bread & spread as we were seated, with the spread being absolutely delicious. it was sweet & tart, which went perfect with the fresh bread. we also ordered seared ahi tuna salad & mac & cheese on the side; the tuna was perfectly seared and was seasoned to go with the salad dressing, but it was a bit pricey while the mac & cheese was just okay, nothing special. \n\nwe both ordered the steak & fries. my boyfriend ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> & i ordered the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>. his was more sweet while mine had a peppercorn taste to it. they were both delicious, but i will admit the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> was better. \n\nservice is a big deal for me and this place had great service. everyone was friendly. \n\nyou should probably make reservations for dinner since it's usually busy. there's a great view of the bellagio fountains out on the patio, but seats there are first come, first serve. we got lucky and got a seat inside right next to the window, which allowed us to be warm inside and still get a great view hehe :d", 
            "went here for a romantic dinner with my boyfriend, and the great reviews didn't fail us. thank you yelpers. \n\none thing that i absolutely loved about this restaurant was the ambiance....made dinner reservations for 2 and requested a seat on the patio and luckily we got it. \n(make reservations! this place was packed friday night!) \nit was beautiful....perfect date spot with a view of the bellagio fountains, so romantique!\n\nsecond thing i loved....it was a french restaurant, with a french hostess, and a french server... legit! - plus service was really good.\n\nthe best thing that i loved was the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, i can still the taste the juiciness, the awesome flavor and the melt in your mouth goodness. goodness!! this steak was soo yum i kept on referring back to it throughout our evening.\nbf went with the ribeye, huge steak, was cooked just right but i'd still go with the filet mignon, duh. \nthe prices were understandably reasonable. for 2 people our bill was a little over $100. \n\nthe not so lovable..\n- escargots or how my boyfriend calls it escar-no's - good.... not mindblowing. \n- restrooms - none in the restaurant, so you'd have to walk out into the casino to pamper yourselves, but then again it's in a casino so figures..\n- our table, i don't mean to be a debbie downer but our table was freaking small! \n\noverall love love loved this place, it's not like those restaurants on the strip that'll leave holes in your pocket. \n\nbon appetit!", 
            "came here for dinner on our last night..i wished it was better but it was just ok to me..\n\nordered:\n-oysters-i haven't had oysters in a while so i thought these were good\n-<mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>-i didn't get the chance to try it but everyone liked this\n-<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>-my order..i thought it was ok.. over the half the plate were frites! \n-prime rib-good not great\n-<mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>-this was good too\ni don't remember what else we ordered.. but what i do remember is the apple slaw they served with the bread.. i liked that a lot! \n\ni wouldn't come back for dinner but i wouldn't mind trying this place again for brunch/lunch on the patio so i could have a view of the bellagio water show..", 
            "got a reservation for 815 pm on a monday night for inside sitting since thats all you can reserve for. patio is first come serve. i'm my opinion the hostesses  were a bit rude with people. the waiter was not so friendly neither, and forgot our hors d'oeuvre/ hor devours. their bread and red onion mix is good. we tried the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> (to die for) also the steak classic and bordelaise. along with a ceasers salad. a meal for four came out for $140, reasonable i think for vegas and paris hotel. we would like to go back for brunch.", 
            "after a few nights of 4 am, post-drinking room service meals, my boyfriend and i decided we wanted to go somewhere good for dinner. we chose mon ami gabi and we were sooooo glad we did! we had reservations on a tuesday night at 10. we were seated right away in the front room and had an amazing view of the bellagio fountains. \n\nour waitress was great and gave us some great suggestions.  for appetizers, we had pate, escargot and scallops. all three were amazing. escargot has always been a little scary to me, but i sucked it up and tried one and it was so delicious. the scallops were perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. i'm not a huge fan of pate but i had a little and i had to admit it was pretty tasty. for entrees we both had filets-- merlot for me, roquefort for him. mine was awesome. perfectly cooked and drenched in butter and a red wine reduction--how can you go wrong with that??? the filet roquefort was also good but i'd definitely pick the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> again. the frites were more like potato chips than i was expecting but i enjoyed them nonetheless. after all that food, we were pretty stuffed but the butterscotch pot de creme was screaming our names, so we gave in and ordered it. i think that might be my new favorite dessert. it was rich but not too heavy, like butterscotch pudding only a gajillion times better. \n\nthe prices are very reasonable, especially for what you get. it was very busy the night we were there (and i'm assuming it's like that pretty much every night) but our food still came out very quickly. other than feeling like elephants when we were done, it was one of the best meals either of us has had in a long time and definitely the best one we had in vegas!", 
            "me and cousin were deciding on a place to eat. there are so many fine restaurants in vegas and in the end we decided last minute to go here on the 2nd night i was in vegas. it was a great choice!!  i called in earlier that evening around 830pm and made reservations for two. i was very surprised that they still accepted reservations the night of! it was definitely a good idea since there were people waiting when we got there at 10pm. one of the asian hostesses was a bit rude towards me since she asked me to get in the back of the line when i was obviously there before other guests. but i just let that go. \n\nwhen we walked into the restaurant it was very crowded. most, if not all of the tables were occupied. i was under the impression that it was casual atire, but people were dressed rather nice. we sat indoors. the ambiance is rather romantic with slightly dim lights. the atmosphere seemed lively yet relaxed at the same time with people conversing and having a merry time. our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. he gave us advice on what to order which worked out wonderfully!!\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark>(oven-roasted snails, garlic-herb butter) and <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>(steak with butter and red wine reduction, served with their signature hand-cut frites). both were very good. i've had snails before but never cooked this way. we ate it with the fresh warm bread! the steak was soooo tender!!! by far the best steak i have eaten! seasoned perfectly and it is like butter when you cut into it. the frites were also very good and a different spin on fries. i actually like it better than fries because they are thinner and crispier. i am sad that i decided not to order dessert here because i wanted to try serendipity(no bueno). the total came out to be only $50. what a great deal for such delicious food! i will be coming back no doubt when i am in vegas :)", 
            "very very pricey for what you get. but it's all about sitting outside and watching the bellagio water works and the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> butter dish! excellent service too.", 
            "mon ami gabi is the kind of french bistro friend we all wish we knew back in our own hometowns.\n\nfor me, the number one draw was the view ... not the view of the paris hotel & casino, but the view from the outdoor patio of the bellagio fountains across the las vegas strip. there are two dining options at mon ami gabi: indoor or patio. indoors is going to be a \"finer dining experience\" and much shorter wait. even though we had reservations, it took about 20 minutes to get seated on the patio. the wait was worth it. we lucked into a table right in the middle directly across from the bellagio. if you come after 6:00 p.m. the fountain show is every 15 minutes, so, plan accordingly.\n\nour meal was $195 for my wife and me. it was a bit over-priced, but still a rewarding couple steaks, drinks, and sides. and did i mention the view? olivia had the 22 oz bone-in rib eye steak with bearnaise sauce ($40) while i got the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> with butter & wine reduction sauce ($35). both steaks were 4-star cuts of meat with the filet tender and the rib eye juicy. they came with the house frites and we added sides of asparagus (3-stars) and mushrooms (3-stars).\n\ni stuck with the house pinot noir (mon ami gabi 09 $8 each) before/during dinner while she went with 3 rounds of the le fleur cocktail ($13)  which was super sweet thanks to st. germain and bacardi limon. for dessert, we split a creme brulee ($8 - 4 stars) and had a latte. we were in no rush to leave thanks to the fountains of bellagio view and relaxed pace of our meal.\n\nour server was especially bland. i'm sure his job must suck serving tourists all day, every day, but a little enthusiasm or acting like you cared about our experience would of been nice. oh, who cares. just bring us another round of drinks.\n\nanyhoo, come for the view. enjoy some steaks. dream of being in paris. you're on vacation at mon ami gabi.", 
            "this was the first trip i took to vegas in which i was celebrating a birthday for someone who means a whole lot to me (my boyfriend) and \"going ham\" wasn't exactly the entire itinerary... since i know very little about vegas eateries because all i do is party when i go to vegas, i did the only thing i know to do in such situations...i yelp'd... and found this lovely place in paris. it was perhaps one of our top 5 most romantic dinners we have ever had, the place was so intimate and warm. we even got fancy and sipped on wine haha. started off with the onion soup...it was rich and flavorful, the cheese melted in your mouth and the full flavor of onion in every bite would scare all the vampires away, or is that garlic? whatever...i got the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> and boyfriend got the hangar steak. first bite of meat and i died...soooo soft and tender, i felt like there was no need for the knife. it was a beautifully crafted piece of meat. that night, vegas showed me its sensual side, and presented me with this masterpiece at mon ami...yes...i cheated on my boyfriend right in front of him and had no shame...  i love yelp...", 
            "the food was pretty good; service unfortunately was not as satisfactory.  we arrived at 8:28 pm for an 8:30 reservation.  the hostess snottily told us that she would seat us closer to our reservation time and handed us a beeper.  two minutes later it went off, and we were seated.  we were a bit taken aback by this, and there were several other similar incidents.  i'm not sure where the haughty attitude comes from.\n\nthe restaurant has an extensive gluten-free menu, which was a real plus for my friend.  the entire table shared the gluten free <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> appetizer, and it was quite good, including the bread.\n\ni had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> with a side of mashed potatoes.  the steak was cooked perfectly, and the sauce is really exceptional.  i kept eating the potatoes even after feeling full just to finish the sauce.\n\noverall, a decent experience due to the food.", 
            "had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>. was so good it tasted like candy. only downside was the fancy fries they put with the steak, keep it classy mon ami gabi and get rid of that.", 
            "this was one of my favorite dinners of all time. of all time! \n\nit wasn't lavish (spent a little over $150 for quality entrees, sides, and wine for 2), but i don't remember the last time i enjoyed dinner this much. \n\nfirst of all, we were seated on the edge of the outside patio, right on - but elevated - above the sidewalk of the strip. we had a view of the bellagio when the water show was happening, and we people watched to our hearts' content (i am so glad we weren't seated inside, which was by contrast extremely dim - i despise eating in dim rooms). the temperature outside was comfortable. we had a long, mellow dinner and it was perfect.\n\nthe <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> with butter and red wine reduction and hand cut frites was outstanding. if someone knows of frites in sf like the ones here, can you let a homie know? the frites were beyond delicious...they were flat (!) (i don't know how they made them so flat and perfect). crispy and browned on the outside and soft on the inside...they soaked up the red wine reduction from the filet mignon...words cannot describe how good i thought they were. the red wine reduction was intense and tangy. the filet mignon was super tender. did i mention dinner was perfect?\n\ni have since then been waiting for the day i find steak frites like i had at mon ami gabi. i have made a few futile efforts but overall i'm not trying very hard...i want it to just happen one day like mon ami gabi happened.\n\ni love when places unexpectedly sweep me off my feet with amazing food and wine, and an excellent environment!", 
            "while i was back in vegas for a conference a small group of us decided to drop by and grab a meal.  it was about 8 pm and it was packed and a long line of people waiting to get in.  the hostess told us it would be 1.5 to 2 hrs....wow!  we could get seated right away if we sat outside....but it was raining off/on, so we'd have to take a chance.  i walked outside and they have umbrellas, so we took a chance and chose to get seated immediately.\n\nluckily for us it didn't rain while we dined...ha!  i ordered:\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> - (w/butter, red wine reduction) $34.95\n<mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> - $6.95\n\n....to wash it down, we ordered a bottle of malbec for $58.\n\nwhile we waited for our food, it rained a little bit.  however, with the umbrellas and patio space heaters, we were comfortable and dry.  it was actually kind of cool to sit outside on the las vegas strip and watch the clouds pass overhead and rain on the city.  in the 20+ yrs i lived in vegas, i never had an experience like that.  having wine during the rainfall was even better.\n\nthe food came out after a while and my filet was cooked perfectly.  i ordered it medium-well with just a little \"pink\".  the red wine reduction was heavenly and smooth on the palate.  the mac gratin was rich and complimented the filet very well.\n\noverall, it was an awesome dining experience.  don't know if i can replicate the ambiance and scenario.  the waiter was super cool and handled the weather/packed restaurant situation very well.\n\nreturn factor - 100%", 
            "i'm gonna have to make my first yelp review on this place...\n\nwhat can i say?!  i'm really impressed by the food and portions mon ami gabi offers considering that it's a french restaurant with very reasonable prices.  i've been to vegas 7 times since the time i've turned 21, and have only tried out this place out earlier this month, but thank goodness i've finally taken the time to try it out.  i'm gonna have to make it a point that from every vegas trip on, i'm going to make every effort to come back here!\n\nwe had made a reservation via opentable for 8:15 and was slightly late, but they were accommodating and almost seated us immediately anyways.  server was attentive, and had recommended us the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> since it's the most popular so that was my dinner choice.  the other girls in our party had the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, steak bordelaise, and chicken grandmere, and we all shared the whipped cauliflower and <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> sides.\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> and filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> were both on point!  medium rare for the two of us and i could not get over how tender the meat was and how effortless it was to cut into it.  both were served with frites, which i obviously could not stop myself from also devouring considering how much i love potatoes/fries.  haha.\n\nsteak bordelaise on the other hand wasn't as impressive... comparatively to the filet mignons, but not bad for it's meat cut.\n\nchicken grandmere was also to die for.  i haven't had a chicken this good since beatrice inn in ny!!!  seriously so tender and juicy, was not dry at all.  would be my second choice if i wasn't much of a steak eater.\n\nwhipped cauliflower was the first i've had of it's kind, and was super nomsy!  was pretty much like mashed potatoes ... but more like super creamy mashed cauliflower.\n\n<mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> was also a meh... nothing spectacular to rave about.\n\nbut overall, i had a very pleasant time.  the decor and ambiance is quite romantic and perfect if you're looking to have a nice, classy dinner away from the rest of the crazy vegas life.  i'd love to eat here again and try eating outdoors with the beautiful view of the bellagio fountains!", 
            "we try to stop by here whenever we are in vegas.  the restaurant is located in the paris paris, just off the main casino floor.  if the weather is nice, try to get a table on the patio, or the windows near the patio, as they overlook the beautiful bellagio fountains.  the patio is raised above the busy las vegas boulevard sidewalk, so all those inebriated tourist don't get in the way of the view.\n\nin my opinion, the food at most of the restaurants on the strip is overhyped and overpriced; this is not the case at mon ami gabi.  the food here is excellent for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and appropriately priced.  my personal favorites are the <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark>, the warm chicken & <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, and the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> steak frites.", 
            "i really wanted to love this place.  it has great ambiance and a wonderful location.  they also have a good wine list filled with french wines.  we ordered the warmed brie for an app and it was good, but came with 3 toasted slices of baguette.  3 slices for two people?  is it really going to break the bank to add one more piece so a party of 2 could share the brie with 2 pieces of bread?\n\ni ordered the steak roquefort and my friend ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>.  we both ordered our meat medium.  we also ordered a side of green beans to share.  we were halfway through our bottle of wine (and we aren't fast drinkers) before our meals arrived. the \"roquefort\" was actually a blob of butter with some roquefort mixed in.  there was so little roquefort in it that i asked the waitress what was on my steak.  \n\nin addition, my steak came barely warm and totally raw on the inside.  fortunately, my friend enjoyed the filet mignon.  by the time the waitress came back, returning the steak was no longer an option since i figured we would have to wait another 30 minutes for a replacement.\n\nsince i was still hungry, i decided to order the bananas foster crepe thinking that there was no way they could do a dessert wrong.  i am not a bananas foster pro, but i believe it is supposed to be served warm (as the description states warm bananas).  it was served cold with the sauce being more crystallized sugar rather than a warmed flambe.  basically they pre make these, barely warm them and pass them off as \"gourmet.\"  \n\ni came to the restaurant looking forward to a wonderful meal and evening, instead i was disappointed at every turn and the $150 bill was very hard to swallow.", 
            "j'adore mon ami gabi. i've eaten here a few times and whether it's been sitting on the patio, or inside near the windows it's been excellent. awesome location on the strip with a front row seat of the bellagio fountains. the french onion soup is very well done and the steak frites are magic! my favorites are the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> with butter and a red wine reduction, and the hanger steak with merlot butter. the restaurant is huge, but the service is always great. a consistent favorite over the years (and through the hangovers!)", 
            "if you want a nice restaurant that won't leave your wallet crying and your stomach still starving, this is not a bad place to go. just be sure to make reservations or the wait can be quite long. reservations only guarantee the indoor dining area, which is dim, romantic, and not conducive to instagram pictures. if you can, though, i'd recommend the patio area so you can people-watch from a heated and equally romantic vantage point.\n\nthe boyfriend and i ordered the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> appetizer, which was served with 4 large pieces of the creamiest salmon i've ever had and (maybe just a tad too much) red onions and capers atop brioche. the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> was definitely on the small side and probably could have done with a little less cooking, but the merlot reduction tasted amazing. what i should have gotten was the boyfriend's ribeye, which was bigger, fattier, juicier, and overall just more tasty. i was not, however, impressed with the steak frites that came with our entrees--they were paper-thin (like eating a deep fried potato peel) while i like more substance to my fries. \n\nthough the food was a little hit or miss, the ambiance and the attentive server who kept up with my water-guzzling boyfriend's refill needs upped my rating for this place to a 4.", 
            "i was a bit hesitant to try this place at first because of my awful experiences over at sugar factory (also in the paris), however i'm glad i decided to come here!  \n\nmy first visit i got:\n-<mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark>: snails seasoned with a tasty green garlic sauce, served on a sizzling plate\n-<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> : steak was about 8-10 oz. and had a delicious sauce with it\n-frites: side that comes with the steak, they are basically thinly sliced french fries which complimented my steak quite well!\n-frangria: their take of sangria and each glass only costs about $5.50...just get it\n\nmy second visit i got:\n-<mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> again\n-bacon wrapped pork tenderloin (special): comes with mashed potatoes and an apple and fennel salad, the entire plate was delicious \n-steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>:  (boyfriend's dish) very generous serving of a flattened steak seasoned with peppercorn, also very good\n-frangria again\n\nthe service was excellent and everyone was friendly.  if you decide to come here just make sure you book a reservation because the wait here can be long (patio seating is first come first serve).", 
            "nice location, great ambiance. my partner and i ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, both medium-well. server suggests to get them \"butterflied\" so it cooks all the way through. that didn't work out so well. my steak was well done and my partner's was well done on one side and the other medium-well. my teeth hurt after attempting to chew the steak. so disappointing. frites were only \"okay\", however, the side of garlic spinach we ordered were pretty good. \n\nour server only came back once to ask if i wanted more iced tea. didn't ask how the food was or anything. he also took a long time to give us our check. we literally just sat there for 10 minutes waiting to pay for our overcooked dinner. \n\nthis place is overrated in my opinion. will never come back again. staff wasn't too friendly either. should've made a reservation at gordon ramsay steak instead.", 
            "i wish it was my anniversary everyday. \n\nmy boyfriend and i visited mon ami gabi to celebrate our two year anniversary. his sister-in-law used to continually rave about this place and after months of waiting, we decided that our anniversary would the perfect date. \n\ni don't know why but for some reason, we decided not to make reservations. foolish, foolish idea. you most definitely should make a reservation. we waited for about 40 minutes and finally got seated in a table made for two. seeing that my boyfriend is a 6'2\", 200lb man, let's just say that the table was just a bit on the tiny side.\n\nwe were greeted by a curly haired waitress-- she was terrific! she first started us off with some bread and butter to accompany my glass of merlot and my boyfriend's glass of cotes du rhone. i know that he enjoyed his wine but it definitely didn't compare to the most smooth and soft bodied merlot i have ever tasted. mmmm, soooo good!\n\nwe went on to order the warm brie cheese as our appetizer. oh this is so very, very good. i'm not a huge cheese fan but i decided to order this for my cheese-loving man. good thing because i couldn't stop my hands from reaching for the platter! the croutons gave such a nice crunch and the slightest bit of saltiness to contrast the soft and gooey, sweet honey-covered cheese. i swear i think this is the only appetizer we'll ever order here!\n\nfor the main, my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> and i ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>. both of our steaks were cooked to perfection, juicy and well seasoned. however, we both agreed that t the end of the day, mine was much more flavorful due to the merlot reduction. either way, we definitely enjoyed our steaks. we also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms and it went well with our steak, although it had too much black pepper for our taste.\n\nwith the help of many hours of masterchef australia, i became familiar with different types of french desserts and was extremely excited to order profiteroles... until i saw the chocolate fudge cake with homemade caramel ice cream, that is. we ended up ordering the chocolate cake which was beyond incredible. then, our kick ass waitress sensed much hesitation from me and brought out some profiteroles--on the house! score! :d needless to say, it was phenomenal. \n\nobviously, my overall experience was absolutely superb, and i definitely recommend this place for people who are celebrating a wonderful occasion. just brace yourself- you're gonna want some more real soon!", 
            "my favorite spot for any meal (the brunch is awesome, the dinner is amazing, and so is everything in between) is mon ami gabi! it truly is my favorite restaurant in vegas, and that says a lot considering there are so many. i came here for a birthday dinner (and then back repeatedly) and was blown away every time- the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> is melt in your mouth tender, and the merlot butter sauce was perfect with it! \n\na few other things i have tried and loved:\n-the <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> with the poached egg on top- amazing!\n-fresh oysters\n-<mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>\n-corned beef hash-yum\n\nand that is just to name a few. this is the best place for people watching while enjoying great, reasonably priced wine/food and having a fantastic meal. i will be back!", 
            "mon ami gabi is a beautiful restaurant, and there is certainly no shortage of people. if you don't make a reservation, it'll be very hard to get a table in a reasonable amount of time. the restaurant itself is decorated beautifully, and the outdoor dining overlooks the bellagio fountains, which is an added bonus.\n\ni started with the escargots, which were very mediocre. escargots are quite literally my favorite food, so i'm quite the connoisseur when it comes to them. they tasted fine, but they didn't have much flavor. they were definitely forgettable. 5.5/10.\n\nfor my entre, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>. it was very flavorful and the red wine reduction was delicious. the frites were tasty, and very different. i thoroughly enjoyed this, and it was excellent quality. 9/10.\n\nservice was excellent throughout the night, and everyone was very polite. the entire waitstaff was very helpful and they clearly cared about their customers.", 
            "7/4/13  dinner\n\nmy third time dining at mon ami gabi doesn't disappoint. for a french steak restaurant on the strip, this place offers great food at a great value. my party of 4 arrived promptly for 6:30pm reservation. surprisingly we were offered the option of indoor dining or the patio outside overlooking bellagio fountain across the street. patio is usually first come-first serve but on a 108f day we just didn't feel like eating outside. plus all the hustle-and-bustle on the street.\n\nserver was friendly, ready to make cocktail suggestion. despite being very busy for 4th of july, service was not pushy at all. we spent almost a cocktail's time looking over the big menu, which features grain-fed mid-west beef.\n\n*paris romance ($12): a rum base cocktail with a tinge of lemoncello. \n*grey goose cosmopolitan ($14): just the way i like it, a slightly more vodka compared to cranberry juice, fresh lime (there's pulp) a beautiful pink\n\nour table goes for beef since this is a classic french bistro specializes in meat.\n\n*<mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> ($10.95): the tangy red wine mustard goes really well with the very creamy liver spread on warm toast. it really set the mood of dinner for the evening.\n\n*<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> ($34.95): very tender, almost like wagyu, beef seared to a medium-rare pink, with a butter/red wine reduction. i've had harris's filet mignon and loved it. but mon ami gabi is just as juicy, and every bite of meat is \"even.\" this is one of the best filet mignon i have had. the handcut frites are warm crispy, with the texture of sliced potato chips. they give you so many that i couldn't finish.\n\n*steak classique ($24.95): a slimmer cut sirloin steak served with house-special herb butter. my bf also had it medium rare and it was pink like mine. he did better with the frites and licked the plate clean.\n\n*steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> ($25.95): probably the strongest tasting steak on our table, served with a brandy peppercorn sauce. our dining companion also opted her sirloin medium rare. i was very impressed at the overall consistency in how their meat was prepared here. \n\n*prime cheeseburger ($12.95): with blue cheese. this is a mon ami gabi's classic and they charge the same price as for lunch. medium cooked beef patty served on a brioche bun. instead of fries, my dining companion got french green beans on the side. \n\nwe concluded the meal with warm chocolate torte and assorted sorbet. the whole experience---food, service, drinks, and decor, is top-notch but you pay decent prices for it. it's one of the best value on the strip. make sure you have a reservation. i always have dinner here when i'm in vegas.", 
            "what a great restaurant! inside and out has great ambiance! we made a reservation for dinner and were seated inside but were just at the big open doors for the patio with a view of the strip and bellagio, great spot!!! our table enjoyed the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> (brandy peppercorn sauce), <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> (butter, red wine reduction) and steak bearnaise. everything was delicious but my personal fav was the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, delicious and highly recommend!!!! we substituted our side for the whipped cauliflower and the sauteed mushrooms, both excellent choices!!!!", 
            "what can i say that 2800 people haven't already said in their reviews? christy g. and i always try to dine at mon ami gabi when we're in vegas, and every visit has been spectacular. for one, the service is always impeccable. the location can't be beat, with an amazing view of the bellagio fountains and truly top notch people watching. i particularly like watching the drunk bambi-legged girls (\"weenie wobbles\") trying not to fall in their too-high heels :) or even worse, the ones holding their heels and walking down las vegas blvd in their blackened bare feet *shudder*\n\nthe <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> ($9.95) is a definite must-have. the broth is rich and savory, packed with perfectly soaked baguette slices and caramelized onions, and topped with about a pound of melted gruyere. i crave this soup even when it's triple digits outside; it's that good. \n\nanother staple is the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> ($34.95), which comes with a merlot infused butter and a red wine reduction. the filet (medium rare for me) is always perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth. i don't personally care for the frites that everyone raves about, but they've always been super accommodating about switching it out for another side at a small upcharge. i've had the pommes puree, garlic spinach, sauteed mushrooms, and the macaroni <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> - all amazing. \n\ni'm always way too stuffed for dessert, so i won't comment on those. they also have a pretty substantial wine list, and about two dozen wines by the glass. and if you stop by for brunch, the build your own bloody mary cart is a godsend! \n\nbottom line: don't miss out; this place is amazing! ask for a table on the patio and come hungry!", 
            "\"style, class, and a patio to make me come back.\"\n\nmaybe it's cause i'm always on vacation. maybe the memories, maybe its the weather  or the good company that i've shared my time here.  on top of this, it's on one of the premier patio spots outside paris in the dead centre of the strip. these are some reasons why this is my favorite restaurant in vegas. then there's the food...let's move on to that.\n\nlet me set the tone: it's a classic french bistro.  white table clothes, fancy setup, however the vibe is casual so even if you're out there in shorts, you're not totally out of place.  \n\nthere are 3 dining areas: indoors, indoors with view of patio, and patio.  trust me, you want to sit on the patio and experience some pinnacle views which include the bellagio, pretty people, and the rest of the strip.  call in for a reso if you can, otherwise you may be waiting 1-2 hours on a busy day. again, for me its worth the wait.  scared of the heat, well don't' worry, there is appropriate shade and air-conditioning and misters outside!  even in 40 degrees they managed to keep me cool.\n\neach table is given fresh baguette and butter to start.  one thing i've noticed is that the bread hasn't always come out hot.  a small annoyance, but something that could be easily remedied with a warmer of sorts.  save some bread cause you'll need it for something else, stay tuned.\n\nif you are a professional meatitarian like myself, you will have no problem quenching your thirst.  first off the bat get a steak.  i don't even care which one, just do it.  all three steaks that i've had were beautiful cuts of meat, cooked exactly how i wanted it, and could be cut with a butter knife.  myself i struggle between the fillet <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> and (if i'm feeling hungry) the 22oz bone in ribeye.  \n\naren't a suffer of meatabetes like me, then why not try some of the mussels?   a light white wine and herb broth dips very well with the bread you remembered to save.  the mussels aren't as fat and juicy as we're accustomed to in the west coast, so this one dish won't fill you up. regardless, i love mussels and i loved this dish. \n\nneed something to wash it down? their wine list is extensive.  however if you want a refreshing treat on a hot day then i'd try their sangria. \n\ngive gabi a try.  you won't be disappointed.", 
            "absolutely amazing!!\n\nwe had 9pm reservations with a request to be seated near the patio, since the patio is first come first serve only.  unfortunately we were late by about 15 or 20 minutes.  not a problem.  we waited maybe 5 minutes and were seated in a great location next to the patio so we could also enjoy the bellagio water show.  \n\nthe service was great and the food was even better.  my wife and i split the duck confit & fingerling potato as our appetizer and both ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> (steak lovers:) as the main course.  the duck was a great way to start.  the meat was just falling off the bone it was so tender.  very impressed, we were anxiously waiting for our steaks and we were not disappoint.  probably one of the best steaks i've had.\n\nthere's really nothing more to say.  wonderful service.  great location.  amazing food.", 
            "warm brie. mac & cheese. <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>. all excellent.", 
            "i would def go back. i got the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> with mashed potatoes and the fiance got the new york strip with mashed potatoes. my filet was one of the best i've had (literally cleaned the plate!)....couldn't tell you what my fiance's steak tasted like because he wouldn't let me eat any of it. i guess that's a good sign. creme brulee was for dessert.\n\nonly reason why it isn't 5 stars is because our server wasn't exactly nice. it felt like he was judging us...for what, i'm not sure. any question we had, he looked at us like we were dummies. can i have something other than fries? **\"are you stupid?\" look** what kind of wine do you recommend? **\"are you stupid?\" look** ugh!", 
            "i came here last year for dinner with gardenia h. and keri w. and i loved it. we were seated on the patio so we had a perfect view of the bellagio fountains (which were doing their water show) and had this lovely breeze coming through. it was so nice and relaxing to be out there, not to mention enjoying great company and delicious food! we were started off with complimentary bruschetta, which was delicious, although a little hard to eat since we had to cut the bread outselves (they gave us a full loaf).\n\nfor our steaks, gardenia got the filet mignon <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> (creme fraiche) and keri got the bone-in ribeye (22 oz with bearnaise sauce). i no longer remember what their steaks were like, but we unanimously agreed that mine was best. so what did i get? i listened to all the yelpers on here and got the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> (butter, red wine reduction). i got it medium rare and it was delicious. so tender and flavourful. i still think it was one of the best steaks i have ever had. and all their steaks come with their signature hand-cut fries, which are also really good. keri also got whipped cauliflower as a side. it was just fine to me (i'm not a fan of cauliflower), but i think keri liked it. and for dessert, we got their bananas foster crepe (warm bananas, foster sauce, vanilla ice cream). such a perfect (and delicious) way to end the meal :)\n\nthe patio was a little crowded, but it was still a great experience. they do not seem to have a bathroom inside the restaurant, i was told to go inside the casino and use their bathroom (it was a 30-second walk from the front of the restaurant). our server was nice and friendly and i had a great time here. this place probably deserves more like 4.5 stars but i'm leaving it at 4.", 
            "oh my gosh........ :)))))) yum!\n\nevery time i visit las vegas (at least once a year) i have to eat at mon ami gabi or i'll get extremely grumpy and upset.  the taste and price for the courses are unbeatable!  if you get a good seat on the patio you could watch the water show at caesar's palace - really romantic!  i've been here for anniversaries, birthdays, new years, and well... any time i can actually.  \n\nmy two favorite must-have dishes are:\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>\nfor steak, you must order this particular entree.  it is the only one i love to eat and only $35.   compared to the other steak restaurants in vegas this is a fantastic deal and the red wine reduction sauce is savory and not too heavy.  all steak dishes come with some crunchy thin steak frites that were kind of weird at first but i eventually learned to love.  please order this!  i've tried almost all of them and the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> is the best!\n\n<mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>\ni recently had this dish and for something so simple i was blown away.  all it is is delicious <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> in a warm tomato soup served with fresh garlic bread.  i was so heartbroken when i couldn't eat this again because i was short on time my last trip :(.  this is an amazing starter/appetizer  i am determined to order it on my next visits to lv.\n\nthe free bread and dip they serve at the beginning of the meal is delicious as well.  almost everything i've tried here was made to perfection and i was never disappointed.  \n\nchef terry lynch... thank you thank you thank you for your expertise and wonderful talent.  you are truly a culinary genius and it's no wonder this place got such rave reviews.  the truth is.... i freaking love you!  there, i said it.", 
            "this is one of my favorite restaurants to go to when i am in las vegas, nevada. great for a date, family or friends. the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> steak is excellent. it melts in your mouth (got mines done medium rare). very tasty. for appetizer, the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> is also an excellent choice.  i recommend that you use the baguette bread that you get as starter as it tastes better with it. the french onion soup is alright. you can't rsvp to sit outside in the patio area. this is first come, first serve. it has a great view of the bellagio fountain show. you can however, rsvp for inside through open table.", 
            "i had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, medium-rare paired with a glass of their malbec. \n\nthe restaurant had a great ambience, and the wait staff was able to handle the crowds effectively. i was surprised they were able to handle our party of approximately 20 people. outstanding!\n\nthe only reason i didn't give this 5 stars is because the quality of steak. i have had greater filets in the heart of cattle country back home in oklahoma. overall, the restaurant was very good.", 
            "such a nice place to sit outside for lunch. the waiters provide such good service and are there to please you! i had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> and it was super tender! i tried escargot for the first time here and i loved it! the bread and butter they come out with is soo fresh! definitely a place ill return to", 
            "service here is awesome. i had originally made reservations for 8:15 after being told 7:30 was unavailable. we got hungry so i got there at 7 and asked them what the wait time was. the response was 45 minutes to one hour for a party of two. i let them know that that was fine and i had reservations at 8:15, so i would take whichever availability came first. the hostess then said that since i had reservations, they would take me right away because it would be unfair for me to wait. i told her we would be staying at paris anyway so it really was fine, but she insisted and we didn't wait at all! the waitstaff is also courteous and well-spoken. food came promptly and warm. i couldn't have asked for better service.\n\nbreakfast: \n\nspecial eggs benedict: consisted of bacon, spinach, and tomatoes with a side of hash browns. i didn't think it was all that special. it was good/okay, but nothing outstanding. the english muffins were very... toasted and a bit difficult to bite into. there was very little spinach and only a small piece of bacon. i think it was one bacon slice for the entire plate. the hollandaise sauce was bland and seemed watered down. the hash browns were good, however it was salted unevenly so we got little pockets of salt here and there.\n\nmushroom omelette with egg whites instead - consisted of mushrooms and brie cheese with hash browns and a slice of toast. omelettes don't usually wow me since it's such an easy breakfast item to make. they didn't skimp on the brie although the brie wasn't a strong one. it was okay. i did like their bread though.\n\ndinner:\n\ndinner starts out with a warm baguette served with butter and a small pickled shredded root vegetable \"salad\".  last year it was carrots, this year it was jicama.\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> - the filet came out really fast this time. i would say our food came out within 15 - 20 minutes of ordering. the filets were ordered medium well and they were cooked perfectly with a nice seared crust. the potatoes came warm and perfectly salted and crisp.\n\nvegetable farcis (last year) - it was so flavorful and bursting with flavors i didn't feel i was missing out on anything. i hadn't been that excited about vegetables for awhile. i was very impressed with a steakhouse creating such a unique vegetarian dish. it consisted of herbed quinoa on a bed of sauteed tomato/sauce and topped with grilled zucchini, squash, and eggplant. some of the vegetables had a creamy stuffing that was pretty decadent.\n\nbananas foster crepe - the caramel sauce is sweet and nutty with the bananas perfectly sauteed to remain firm, yet have that nice cooked banana flavor. one mistake i find many places make when making bananas foster is overcooking the bananas to mush. i don't think i detected any rum; the caramel is very strong so if there was any rum, maybe it brought out the caramel flavors. the crepe batter they use yields a nice thin, slightly chewy crepe. i'm not one to favor the crispy type crepes so this was perfect. inside the crepe is vanilla ice cream and on top is a dollop of whipped cream.\n\nstar items - <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, bananas foster crepe.", 
            "i had an amazing experience here and would absolutely recommend it to anyone!\n\ni made reservations for 7:45 and arrived around 8:00 due to strip traffic. the host joked around about me being late (which i appreciated), but was able to seat me within five minutes despite the long line at the hostess desk!  the person who escorted us to our table was warm, welcoming, and hilarious to talk to!\n\nwhen making our reservation, we were advised that it would be for inside the restaurant and that outside seating would be first-come, first-serve (about a 90 minute wait at that time). however, we were seated on a deck area that was between the indoor seating and balcony seating. we loved this area because we still had a beautiful view of the bellagio fountains without the wait (nor the drunks roaming the strip). \n\nas for the food, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, as well as escargot, saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms, and a glass of sauvignon blanc. the filet was scrumptious!  one of the best filets i've ever had and reasonably priced. it was so tender and flavorful, and i loved the merlot sauce!  it was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. additionally, the frites were delicious (albeit salty), especially when you dipped it in the merlot sauce.  i would not recommend the saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms, and the escargot was just mediocre. i was surprised they did not provide toast or pastry puffs with the escargot, but they did serve complimentary bread so it worked out. \n\nthe service at mon ami gabi was great!  everyone was extremely friendly and comfortable cracking jokes - which i liked. however, they were also efficient and accurate, which is equally important.  the view of the bellagio fountains was the cherry on top!  the restaurant was not too noisy, especially compared to sugar factory. \n\nif you are looking for a high-quality restaurant (especially a steakhouse) with a view of the bellagio fountains, but cannot afford bellagio's high-end restaurants, mon ami gabi is the perfect place!  i will definitely return!", 
            "my guest and i both ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> and at $37, we were anticipating a delightfully juicy cut of prime beef. oh the disappointment when the first bite was dry, tough and full of tendons. we sent them back hoping for better. sadly the next steak was just as poor in quality despite being seasoned, well seared and cooked to the right temperature. the manager eventually appeared and apologized as you would expect. surprisingly he then admitted knowing about a problem with their meat provider's product quality. the biggest disappointment was that they still chose to serve these steaks in the first place. perhaps the $$ should be $$$ and the current 4-star rating needs updating.", 
            "reservations wouldn't be a bad idea.  though, it's not a definite requirement.\n\norder the carafe of st. germain spritzer!  it's good with your starters.  the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> is excellent while you wait for your entrees.  and you can't go wrong with the french onion soup (which accommodates two); it's one of the few places that gets the soup right for me.\n\nthe duck a l'orange, <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, short ribs, bone-in ribeye and <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> have all been high hitters.  and all things considered, the prices aren't bad at all for what you're getting.  there's even a convenient view of the bellagio water show!  as well, the waitstaff is knowledgeable and generally helpful.  haven't had a bad experience to date.  if i'm in vegas, it's always a pitstop.",

            "such a cute restaurant on the strip!\n\na friend recommended that i visit this place, and i'm glad i did. if you're not picky about where you sit (patio vs inside), i highly suggest making a reservation. my boyfriend and i had reservations at 6pm on a friday night, and it was already pretty busy. there was a couple in front of us without reservations, and they had to wait 30-45 minutes for a table. \n\nmy boyfriend and i got lucky, and we were seated by the window that looks out to the bellagio fountains. it was a very romantic, intimate setting with only candlelights lighting the restaurant. \n\nwe both ordered steak frites: the bordelaise (carmelized onion & red wine sauce), and the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> (butter, red wine reduction). both were very good, but <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> was our favorite. the frites were more like crispy potato chips than fries, but they were very good. \n\nfor dessert we ordered the profiteroles. the portion was huge. between two people we could only eat about 2/3 of it. the pastry was a bit dry to me, so i wouldn't recommend this particular dessert. \n\noverall, great food and service in a romantic setting. worth the visit here if you want to wine and dine in las vegas.", 
            "a perfect setting to enjoy bellagio fountain show and people watching. i ordered a <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, cooked perfectly and tender. but i feel that it needed a bit more seasonings. my husband's beef bourguignon was also okay. i was excited to taste the app escargot, but somehow the herb butter sauce tasted weird or \"off\". they forgot my escargot order, so i don't know if they cooked it in a hurry or what. anyway, the chef was very nice to give us a complimentary prifiterole (to make up the forgotten escargot order) which was delish.",

            "i took my boyfriend here last night for our first night in vegas and for a little birthday dinner. i give this place five stars for several reasons. first, the location/layout/decor is brilliant. it's located right next to the bellagio (where we stayed) fountains at the paris hotel. it's indoor seating looked beautiful, which what i had originally made 7:30 reservations for , but we opted for the first come first serve patio seating so we could catch the fountain shows. plus, vegas around sunset is perfect in terms of temperature and lighting.\nthe other reason i give it four stars is because the service from jump street was impeccable. the hostesses were kind and attentive. they clearly remembered to tell our waiter later on about my request for a surprise birthday dessert with a candle at the end. the bar tenders at the bar where we got a drink and an appetizer were also very attentive and fast. our waiter later on, ibrahim, was beyond friendly, eager to please and professional (but not overwhelmingly in our faces). \nthe other reason on give this place four stars is the food and wine. i love a french menu. the food is always fresh and made the way you expect it to be and then some. i swear, french chefs have a cooking gene that i don't think others do! all the food we had here was exquisite.  appetizer: wild escargot that was oven roasted in some garlic herb (and pesto i think) sauce. salad: fris\\u00e9e, kale and <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>. dinner: a rare <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> (a butter and red wine reduction) with a side a saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms and hand cut fries. now, let me pause and comment on this dinner dish. first, the steak was o m f g amazing. perfect cut of steak and cooked just to our liking: rare. second, the red wine reduction and butter sauce we ordered on the side bc normally we would never spoil a filet mignon with any sauce, but again, !!!o m f g!!! this sauce blew us away. i could eat it with a spoon. you must must must order this dish of you enjoy filet. the mushrooms and fries were also very fresh and complimented the steak very nicely. oh and, the portion sizes were fair. not small. not huge. fair. filling. perfect amount. \nlast but not least, we ordered a bottle of their house red (a suggestion from our waiter), and i could not have been happier with it. i'm kind of a picky wine lady, but i really liked our waiter so i trusted his suggestion and i'm glad i did. also, i really appreciated our waiter refilling our days wine glasses for us as we dined throughout the evening. \nlast but not least, the last reason i give this place four stars is the fair pricing for the quality of food. our bill was only $111. that's about a third of what most fine dining places would cost in vegas. for instance, the filet mignon was only $37, as opposed to $60 plus it would be at most other steak houses in vegas. for a wonderful experience and exemplary food, $111 felt like a steal. \nmy boyfriend and i definitely plan on dining here again before we leave. if you find yourself in vegas and want an amazing dinner with every bank for a your buck, go here!!", 
            "my most recent visit to mon ami gabi had a little bit of a disappointment which was really my fault for coming in at the wrong time.  currently, their sunday dinner special is beef wellington which i've been really looking forward to try.  the only beef wellington i've had is the one over at gordon ramsay steak, so i was looking to try one from another restaurant to compare.  well, i finally came in on a sunday night for a late dinner and by the time i got seated, my waiter told me that they had just ran out of beef wellington.  nooooooooo!!!\n\nwell, as an alternative, my waiter suggested ordering their <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>.  it's actually been a few years since i last ordered steak at mag, so he enlightened me.  plus, because it's a different cut of beef than the hangar and ribeye i've had before, it still continues my steak of ordering something new on their menu.  and to add to that, i ordered their wild escargot <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> appetizer.  i've never had escargot served this way so i was really intrigued.\n\n<mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1btorxp\noven roasted snails, garlic-herb butter\noh man.  butter and garlic galore!!  the snails were chewy just like i expected and they were drowned in so much butter and garlic that i couldn't really tell if they were actually snails.  they could've been mushrooms and i probably wouldn't know the difference.  they were was good though.  and with the complimentary baguette, it was the perfect bread to dunk into the garlic-herb butter wells.\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> -- http://bit.ly/1qhygp5\nbutter, red wine reduction\ni understand that mon ami gabi is more of a budget friendly steakhouse that's part of  the middle tier of steakhouses on the strip, but i have to say that this filet mignon was awesome!  cooked to a perfect medium rare and it literally cut like butter! (http://bit.ly/1n0fjpx)  and the red wine reduction sauce just added a more robust flavor to the filet.  i'm so glad that i ordered this!  kudos to my waiter for the recommendation!\n\nmon ami gabi delivers once again even when there's disappointment with an item being sold out.  i love how there's plenty of 'plan b' entrees and based on my past visits, i really couldn't have gone wrong with any of them, but i'm glad that i got to try their <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>.  that's something that i wouldn't mind ordering again if i ever go back for to mon ami gabi for steak.  hopefully next time i'll make better judgement with coming in for an earlier dinner so i can finally try their beef wellington.  til next time mon ami gabi....", 
            "overall this place is really good. \n\nwe started off with the escargots. it was nothing special, and we've had better. the baguette was fresh, which was nice. \n\ni ordered the hangar steak which was delicious. the steak was nice and thick and served with frites which were a cross between french fries and potato chips. \nmy sister had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> which was also good. my mom throughly enjoyed her bernaise steak.\n\n\noverall we will probably come back.", 
            "our friends took us to this location for dinner because they live in town and know the good places to eat. this restaurant is located in the paris complex and i thought it was very good. i had the onion soup, the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, and a glass of the house pinot noir. we were too full for dessert. we sat outside right at where the indoors and patio meet and were able to see the bellagio water show, which was cool.\n\ni never give a restaurant 5 stars because there is always something to be proved upon. but this restaurant is as close to the real thing in paris as you will get when you are in las vegas.", 
            "went for my birthday. the indoor patio had the ac so high i was shivering (it was 8:00 pm on a day where it had been in the 110's outside)... it also made our food cold pretty quickly.  i had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>.  the sauce was great, but the filet mignon did not make the cut.  it was more like a piece of round roast... i'm pretty sure that's what i got, or it felt like that's the kind of cut i received.  i'm being honest here.\n\nour waitress was also judgmental.  and not the best servant. perhaps because we didn't go for an expensive wine.  also we had our cameras with us... so we probably looked like tourists... nonetheless service was dismal!  i am upset about that.\n\nmy grilled had the new york strip steak... it was tender and juicy, the bordelaise sauce was good.\n\nthe indoor patio view evened things out because of the beautiful view out to the bellagio fountains!", 
            "this is a really cute french restaurant at paris hotel & casino.  it sits outside of the hotel facing the bellagio fountains.  we made a reservation and needed to add an additional person at the last minute and actually wanted to eat earlier, and not only were the hosts able to accommodate to our group size, but we also got sat 15 minutes before our reservation time.  we were sat in the inside with the air-conditioning, but right next to the patio where we were able to view the bellagio fountain show from our seats.  it was spectacular.  \n\nwe were a group of 7 and brought our own wine bottles.  corkage fee is $30 per bottle, which is a bit steep, even for vegas.  they served us complimentary baguettes with butter and some carrot dish,  our server was very friendly and explained the menu to us in detail.  \n\nwe ended up ordering a few appetizers:\n-oysters: unfortunately i didn't get to try these.  i love oysters too.\n-some <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> app with toasted garlic bread: this was delicious!  whatever the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> was mixed with was very good, not too salty, and had the right amount of <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>\n-escargots: this was drench in some olive oil and basil sauce that was very good.  i ate the whole snail and i used the same sauce to dip the complimentary baguettes.\n\nmain dish:\n-hangar steak ($23): so tender!!!  this came with some merlot butter sauce that really went well with the steak.  it was very rich in flavor and was like a dream in my mouth.  i had my steak with haricots verts instead of fries since i ate like a pig at lunch.  \n-<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>: i had a bite of this.  it's an 8 oz steak, which is their smallest size, and it was the most tender filet ever!  it was soft like butter.  you could probably cut it with a fork. this meat was also rich in flavor and their most popular steak frites dish. \n-bison rib-eye (special of the day about $40): i had a taste of this also.  it was very good, lean-tasting, and not gamey at all.\n\ndessert:\n-banana fosters crepe ($10.95): i probably could have devoured this by myself despite being super full.  this was not too sweet and had all the right flavors combined, plus a scoop of vanilla ice cream wrapped in the middle.\n-caramel creme brulee: though not as good as the banana fosters crepe, this was also really tasty.  crepe brulee with a hint of caramel.  the carmelized sugar was perfectly burnt and not too hard to break through.      \n\noverall, this was a very hearty and delicious meal.  i left feeling super stuffed.  everything on the menu tasted very good and the service was impeccable.  highly recommended, especially if you're staying close by!", 
            "mon ami gabi, i hyped you up way too much in my head. i almost feel guilty giving you three stars as fellow yelpers below seemed to have had an amazing experience here. \n\nfirst off, our waiter was super rude! i guess since we came as a party of 6 and gratuity was included in the bill maybe he felt he didn't need to provide top notch service to us. our water was refilled once, he seemed upset having to make two separate trips back for napkins and extra bread and he even gave us the bill before we looked at the dessert menu...in fact, if it wasn't for the service we received, i probably would have bumped it up to 4 stars...\n\nnow onto the meal, i ended up ordering the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> $37, a seafood starter platter $55 which included a lobster, <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark>, <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> (4) and fresh oysters (4) as well as two orders of escargot. now the escargot wasn't bad, however it seemed we had more olive oil than actual pesto in it. the filet mignon was cooked almost perfectly but the fries it came with i could've done without. the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> was the winner, the lobster and oysters were very fresh, the shrimp was good but the <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark> needed something more. i guess it's hard to compare when i've only had <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark> in portugal. \n\nfor dessert, our table shared a caramel creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e which was amazing. the dessert was 5 star worthy! if you tell them it's your birthday they also bring out a small ice cream dessert. \n\noverall, this place wasn't bad. perhaps i came on an off day. i don't think i'd come back to the same waiter if i dined here again but other than the service, everything else was pretty good!", 
            "we went here for my birthday dinner during december last year and the filet mignon was so good we had to come back for more for my bf's birthday dinner this time around. two of our friends ordered the classique and we ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>. both dishes were delicious. our server was even so nice to give us double birthday dinner (because my friends birthday is coming up next week!!) we had a fantastic time and will definitely come back again!!", 
            "my family and i have lived here since 1989. i absolutely love going to mon ami gabi. every time we go there we always request to get seated outside to get a great view of the bellagio fountains. during the spring and fall is the perfect time to sit outside. i would only sit out there at night if you are here in the summer. i highly recommend you make reservations as well through opentable or calling to request this seating in advance. \n\nthe bread is buttery with a smooth butter spread. the last time we went my boyfriend ordered the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> and i had the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>. i personally enjoyed the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> more because of the rich tomato sauce. the pate was also delicious especially on that warm toast. \n\nwe shared the french onion soup, which was tasty. it was not too salty and the cheese was melted well over the bread. probably one of the best french onion soups i have had in vegas. \n\nfor the main course, i had the steak frites <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark> and my boyfriend had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>. if you enjoy a creamy peppercorn sauce then get the <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>. i recommend the filet mignon as a must for first-timers. the steak was so soft and juicy. the merlot sauce pushed the experience to the next level. my taste buds were ecstatic to enjoy something so decadent. the filet mignon here is the best for those who do enjoy tender meat. we both got ours medium. \n\nour sides were the frites (fries) and the brussel sprouts. enjoyed them both as well! however, we did see the whipped cauliflower and the sauteed mushrooms pass by our table, which also looked delicious so i would recommend trying those if you want lighter sides. \n\nfor dessert, we shared the creme brulee. it was a decent size. the top was crisp and the custard was excellent. i highly recommend this dish as well. the ambiance was perfect for a beautiful date night, birthday celebration, or anytime you are feeling fancy for great steak. service was excellent! i love how authentic it was to have someone from france wait on us. it really brought the experience together.", 
            "5400+ reviews on yelp?  i had to go here!\n\ni got a last minute reservation for my girlfriends & i on a saturday afternoon.  there are 3 locations to sit in this restaurant: in door, half in door/half outdoor, & patio.  we were seated in the half indoor/half outdoor area which was perfect because it was a sunny, but chilly afternoon.  i was so excited because our table had the perfect view of the bellagio fountains!  excellent customer service!\n\ncomplimentary bread & butter - they give you whole baguettes which were warm & fluffy in the inside.\n<mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark>, served with fries - this is what our server recommended & although i am more of a blue cheese type of girl, i could not resist trying their most popular steak.  the steak was juicy, tender, & flavorful!  unfortunately, i was not a fan of the merlot sauce & instantly wished i had ordered the steak with blue cheese.  nonetheless, the steak itself was good.  their fries are not your typical fries but are very thinly sliced.  good!", 
            "when i flew in on monday night, i fear that i may miss my reservation getting here via the shuttle bus, but i did manage to get there on time.  now for starters, everyone keeps mentioning to go out and eat outside and enjoy the view of bellagio's water show.  no i wouldn't recommend it.  it was freezing cold and literally everyone who was sitting outside scrambled to find the last remaining seats inside.  luckily the evening wasn't so packed, and managed to find an open seating inside that is rich with rustic feel. my opinion is to stick around inside the room away from the bar.\n\nto start off with, i had the pumpkin soup that had a light cream base and crusted almonds.  unfortunately with all the craze the hostess and waiters and waitresses were scrambling to find seats for people, the soup came after my main course which was a little harder to finish, but i insisted on tasting and finding what made this the place to eat! the soup was by far delicious and flavorful and it immediately warmed you up after this craze weather!\n\nonto the main course, i had the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> with a glass of merlot. when it came out, the meat was shimmering glazed and a stack of frites. i ordered a side of brussel sprouts on the side to balance the sweetness of the filet mignon. by making that first cut into the filet, you can feel the tenderness of the cut fall slowly to the plate glistened in the glaze.  taking that first bite of the filet mignon was just explosion happening and enjoying the moment! food was just amazing!\n\noverall the meal was by far amazing minus the crazy hiccup of the weather, but the staff and team managed to get everyone in and everyone enjoyed the night.  this is definitely worth going again.", 
            "got the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> cause why not: steak was cooked really well..but who comes here for the steak anyway??? \n\nthis place has a 5/5 view with ac blasting to enjoy the bellagio fountain show...which has the magical power to make the food taste exponentially better.\n\nservice is fine. price is decent for the view you get. nom noms.", 
            "this is my second time here, gotta love their patio seats, you get to enjoy the views while having good foods. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> to share, their seafoods are just sooo fresh. i'm a seafood lover so trust me on this. my medium rare <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> was cooked to perfection. my friends ordered the trout and ragu, they said the trout was just alright but the ragu was very tender. \n\ni would come back again soon."

            "ehhh......\na group of friends and i came here on our last morning before leaving vegas.  i got the gabi chopped salad with chicken and it really wasnt that good, especially for $15.  it sounded delish but ehh...  3 of my friends were in the mood for a really good crepe so they ordered the mushroom and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>.  they all hated it.  i took a bite and it was pretty nasty.  someone else got the ham and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> and it was supposidly better than the <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>.  another person got a burger but threw a fit because they didn't have american cheese.  the fit was stopped when he ordered a virgin pina colada and about died it was so good.  the last person ordered one of the steaks and frites and he really liked it.  they all said the frites were kind of weird though.\n\ni would give this place 2 stars but the 3rd star is from the build-your-own bloody mary. mmm it was delicious!!  you could add celery, pepper, bell peppers, onions, carrots..i forget what else but the bloody mary was great.   the veggies were actually pretty wilted and not very fresh though, but whatever.",

(unlike my experience at les halle in washington dc, where i had excellent food and an asshole for a waiter)  i can easily say that mon ami did not disappoint.\n\nafter about a 20 minute wait, we were sat outside.  immediately, fresh bread was brought to our table and our drink and food orders were placed (when in france, order kronenbourg).  our food arrived promptly. i had the mushroom quiche which i thoroughly enjoyed an my wife had the chicken and gruyere <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark>, which was tasty as well.   \n\nthe restaurant is also across the street from the bellagio, so we were treated to two fountain shows (one of which was frank sinatra...it doesn't get better than that). \n\nin all, a great place to enjoy an outdoor lunch on a nice, sunny day.",

            "a wonderful little restaurant with an unassuming facade, you could literally just walk by it and not even realize what you're missing.\n\nwe came to the paris in hopes of hitting up the famous buffet at le village but when we walked all the way there, we saw that the line to get in was even longer than to ride on space mountain.\n\npass.\n\nand after a night of binge drinking, my boyfriend and i decided that we didn't really want to do the buffet thing anyway. we were way too hungry and lazy and to be honest, just wanted to sit our asses down and be served. so we walked around looking for other places to dine that weren't so packed when we discovered this cute little restaurant hiding in the corner. \n\nwe got an amazing table outside on the patio on the most gorgeous vegas day. it was already a fantastic start to a delicious meal. the service was great too. our waitress was very cute and so friendly, she made us feel right at home. \n\nwe started with their fruit bouquet, which i had seen on several other tables. it was a beautifully carved cantaloupe filled with melon, grapes and pineapple that came with sides of creme fraiche, mint syrup and brown sugar. yum. a perfect way to start breakfast. the fruit was so fresh and the little accompaniments paired perfectly. i personally loved the pineapple with the mint syrup and the cantaloupe with the creme fraiche. \n\nfor our entrees my bf chose the egg, bacon & <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> with some added avocado on top. i chose the special benedict of the day which came with spinach, tomato and bacon on a toasted sourdough muffin with a chive hollandaise. we also had to get a side order of the frites, they just looked so good!\n\neverything was absolutely delicious. the crepe was perfectly cooked, really melted in your mouth. the cheese was chewy while the crepe was delicate, and the egg and bacon rounded all the flavors out very nicely. the avocado that my bf added also was a nice touch!\nmy benedict was very good, the eggs were cooked perfectly which is a huge plus. almost every benedict i get at a restaurant has over-cooked poached eggs, but these were nice and runny. mmm! they weren't kidding about the 'toasted' muffin though. mine was definitely a little more well-done than i would have liked but it was still yummy. i loved the muffin because it had a really distinct sourdough taste that went well with the rest of the benedict flavors. \n\nthe frites were also tasty. we could barely finish just one order because it was so big. don't be fooled, it looks all cute and small in that little paper cone but it seems practically bottomless. keep in mind though these are not typical fries, they are very thinly cut and fried until crispy then topped with a good amount of salt. if you like really crispy potatoes then you will love these. otherwise, if you want regular french fries don't bother. \n\ndefinitely a great experience for both of us and we were both so lucky to come on such a beautiful day. will definitely try to come back next time i'm in town!",

(this was a big hit with my girlfriend!) our server was friendly and attentive, and we loved the open-air, non-smoky environment. we all seriously felt like we could be back in paris, sitting at an outdoor cafe. it was kinda perfect!\n\nwe all loved our meals- i ordered the chicken, broccoli, and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark>. it was a delightful meal, and i wouldn't hesitate to go back on my next trip!",

            "the service was amazing, the decor was great as well as the view on the patio but the food did not meet my expectations. i was in a party of 7, and we came here for a late lunch. we did not have any reservations, but they were able to seat us within 5 minutes. \n\nour server offered us bread and whipped butter. the bread was really hard, but hot and the butter made everything taste better! my friend and i split a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> along with steak bordelaise and i was pretty much in disbelief when the salad came out. it's a very, very, very small serving for $10. it tasted fine, you can't go wrong with <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. when i got the steak bordelaise i was also disappointed. there was barely any color on the plate besides brown, and branch of some leaf they put on the plate. it did not look appetizing, nor was the steak good. it was hard and the only thing good about the dish was the caramelized onions. the fries weren't that amazing either. i really wish they would pair their steak frites up with veggies instead of just an enormous serving of fries. \n\nother people in our party ordered the natural <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark>, chicken broccoli and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark>, grilled salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>, a cheeseburger and chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>. the best dishes out of those would be the chicken, broccoli and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> along with the grilled salmon salad. \n\nnot sure if i would be back, i expected it the food to be a little better considering that it is a french restaurant with prices on the higher end, but it was a good experience.",

            "i had dinner at this restaurant years ago when it first opened and had a splendid steak with a merlot butter.  i returned this past weekend for breakfast as i had been doing some research and this was highly recommended for breakfast.  we did not wait at all, but were there relatively early @ 9-10am for breakfast.  i am a foodie who studied to be a pastry chef years ago and love nothing more than a great meal where every bite brings simple and complex flavors to perfection... not to mention that french food is my utmost favorite ! the decor is very much a french bistro/cafe style which is somewhat elegant, yet comfortable and not stuffy.  you could dine here and get a good feel for what dining in france would be.  if you wish to people-watch then ask to sit on the patio, but i found it very loud with the traffic & music playing and opted the next day to sit on the inside patio, which was much quieter and more intimate.  everything on the menu looked delicious.  i had the eggs benedict special, which included mushrooms and watercress, along with a delicate croissant (served warm) & french coffee.  my friend had the ham & gouda omelet with hash browns that were like no other i've ever had and i'd swear they were cooked in duck fat b/c they were so rich and flavorful.  the next day i returned to have the ham & <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> and it was every bit as good as the prior day, if not better.  the croissant melts in your mouth and smothered with the raspberry preserves it was perfection. i was almost embarrassed to enjoy the meal as much as i did.  if you love french food, or simply delicious food, every bite will leave you waning more and you'll go home looking forward to the day you can go back again.  next stop:  fleur",

(4/5)\n\n*steak frites - apparently it's what some were raving about so overall, it was pretty delicious!  well marinated and savory.  (5/5)\n\n*sea <mark>Scallops Gratinees</mark> - it's mixed with caramelized fennel, onion marmalade, and mussel cream.  sounds yummy?  yes indeed!  well-seasoned flavors to go with the <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark>. (5/5)\n\n*endive & roquefort <mark>Warm Goat <mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark></mark> - fresh ingredients..you can definitely taste the freshness!  the roasted barlette pears they added into the salad makes it even yummier!

(not the vegas kind of ooh la la...)!  \n\ni recommend making reservations.  there was quite a line when we arrived and i was very glad we had made reservations in advance. keep in mind that they do not accept reservations for the outside patio though.  that is strictly first come, first serve.  when you do arrive, make sure you're with your complete party.  they won't seat you unless everyone is there.  \n\nthe coffee was good... the bellini was better.  ;)  they have a bloody mary bar that i will probably try next time.  \n\nthe quiche was just okay... i've had much better elsewhere.  my husband got the blueberry french toast, and that was absolutely magnificent!!!!!  another in our party got the ham and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> and apparently they were very good, because he wouldn't even let me have a bite.  \n\nall in all a great brunch experience that i'd totally do again.",

            "we were walking along the street and it was a beautiful spring day in vegas. passed by this place and reminded me of summertime in paris. we stopped here for lunch and wow, i felt transported back to europe! the menu contained very authentic french cafe-type of food. we ordered the escargot to share and each got a crepe. i like my <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> although it was a bit on the heavier side and it was a bit too creamy...and my friend's ham and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> was a bit too salty in my opinion. nevertheless, the atmosphere was really relaxing and nice. i would definitely return here!", 
            "i came here on sunday with my sisters and well lets just say if i think french, i think really good savory crepes. well to my surprise it wasn't that great. there wasn't much of a selection to begin with. so i settled with the chicken, broccoli, and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark>. first bite i thought it was me thinking it was so salty. comes to find out it was just the broccoli that is seasoned to salty. we also order the tuna melt sandwich. i don't know about you but when i order a tuna sandwich anything i expect it not to be fishy. i'm sorry i have to say was way too fishy for my liking. it was so bad the waiter notice we were not fond of it and took it off our bill. so she made up for the lack of not being so attentive with refilling our drinking or bring out more bread. but the thing that was good was the hand cut fries. very thin and crispy just like potato chips  also the one thing that i did love besides the fries was there special! the shaved beef and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> with sun-dried tomato aioli. this was to die for! it was the perfect amount to have so you can last until dinner time. it doesn't sit heavy when you are done either which is a plus on my book. i would come back to mon ami gabi just for that. if we didn't order that i would never step foot back here.\n\nalso a little side note, for some reason the hosts are not so friendly. waiters inside are a little better. when the host took us inside to get seated i had on high boots so i have to walk slow cause of the tile floors they have are a little slippery. one of the waiter push be faster to walk cause she forgot someone order making me almost trip... just saying don't wear heels here ladies.",

            "i saw all the wonderful reviews and really wanted to come here for lunch, after we had settled in.  i ordered the ham & <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark>, which was bleh.  it wasn't as good as i had thought, and after seeing what my friends ordered, i wished i had ordered something else instead. my friends got the salmon and another ordered the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark>, which both are really good.  service was pretty bad.  it took forever to get our check, but again, it was pretty busy at the restaurant.  we wanted to sit outdoors, but it was at least a half hour wait, and at that time, we were starving as we had just came to vegas, so we opted to sit inside instead.  i may come again, but for either brunch or dinner because the pictures looked good and i was not able to try any of those items.", 
            "four stars for the food, but minus one whole star for the service.\n\ni've had mon ami gabi bookmarked for a while now, so i was extremely excited when we finally made plans to dine here on my latest and greatest trip. \n\nwe were looking forward to the famous diy bloody mary bar, but were unsure about how to put a bloody mary together. when we asked our server if he had a recipe for us or any recommendations on what to put in the bloody mary, he was extremely sassy and unhelpful. when the food arrived, we noticed that there was an extra order that wasn't for our table. again, he was extremely sassy and kept insisting that someone in our party ordered it. if someone did order it, i'm not sure why we would be refusing it! \n\nluckily, their delicious food kept this experience mostly positive. i had the ham and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> and the orange chocolate chip muffin. both were absolutely delish and i even took half of my muffin to-go for the plane ride home.", 
            "today we ate a late lunch at mon ami gabi, translated as \"my friend gabino\". we made a reservation for 2:15 pm, and due to traffic and backed up valet getting into paris hotel, we were running late. the resturant was very understanding and did seat us right away. while i would've preferred an outdoor seating area, it would've been a 35-45 minute wait. the resturant did seat us window side so we could still see the beautiful view of the bellagio fountains. i enjoyed our enthusiastic server, and food was delicious. i usually don't finish my food, but instead i licked the plate clean! my boyfriend had the ham and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> while i had the <mark>Skate Wing</mark> and french onion soup. everything was so flavorful and combination of food and ingredients went great together. my birthday ice cream cream puff was decadent! i should've saved room for the chocolate/ candy store, hexx next door, but our meal was worth it! i highly recommend this place and i look forward to coming back for brunch!", 
            "i have been interested in dining at mon ami gabe for a very long time and found it a perfect opportunity on my hubby's day off. \n\nthe wait list for the patio is a very efficient process and doesn't take long at all. we came at 1030 am on a sunday.\n\nwe were seated in a perfect little spot, staring out towards the bellagio fountains. the sun was warm and the air was chilly. just perfect. the service was just awesome. our servers came to chat us up, and all our requests were tended to quickly.\n\ni got a bacon, egg and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark>. needed more bacon but it had the most delectable cream sauce.  hubby had a croissant breakfast sammy to which he added bacon. now that was a huge, delicious sammy!! the bacon was thick cut and tasty. we also got a side of potatoes which were yummy as well.\n\noverall, we had a very pleasant experience here and would definitely return.."

            "we arrived for brunch on a windy, chilly september morning, but stuck it out on the patio.  the brunch menu is just the lunch menu, so don't juggle your plans to be here at brunch.  go somewhere else.  enjoy mon ami gabi any other time!  \n\nthe waiter brought out a baguette with soft butter and yummy raspberry jam.  i usually do not eat jam but this was so good with the butter and soft, crusty bread.  i had a bloody mary, (or two!) it was good.  i heard raves about the bloody mary bar on here, but it is nothing special unless you are sitting right by it.  i would rather the waiter just bring out my drink.\n\nwe were warmed up by the tomato soup (yum) and french onion soup (yummier).  also got the appetizer of baked tomato and cheese with toasts.  i thought it would be literally sliced tomato with melted sliced cheese on top.  it was actually a tomato puree with <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>.  very good, but not expected, as we already had the tomato soup.\n\nthe <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> was horrible.  there was an ingredient in there i couldn't stand, and my mom disliked it, too.  that is not to say someone else would not like it, just not for me.  i got the chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, very good, as were the frites that came with it.  the best was the creamy chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>.  that also came with a salad with frisee and i think baby arugula with a tantalizing dressing... i wasn't sure what it was and forgot to ask our server.  champagne vinegar, perhaps?\n\ni would definitely go back, though, and get the soup and the crepe.  i would also like to try the salad with pear & walnuts and the chocolate mousse.", 
            "ehhh......\na group of friends and i came here on our last morning before leaving vegas.  i got the gabi chopped salad with chicken and it really wasnt that good, especially for $15.  it sounded delish but ehh...  3 of my friends were in the mood for a really good crepe so they ordered the mushroom and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>.  they all hated it.  i took a bite and it was pretty nasty.  someone else got the ham and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> and it was supposidly better than the <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>.  another person got a burger but threw a fit because they didn't have american cheese.  the fit was stopped when he ordered a virgin pina colada and about died it was so good.  the last person ordered one of the steaks and frites and he really liked it.  they all said the frites were kind of weird though.\n\ni would give this place 2 stars but the 3rd star is from the build-your-own bloody mary. mmm it was delicious!!  you could add celery, pepper, bell peppers, onions, carrots..i forget what else but the bloody mary was great.   the veggies were actually pretty wilted and not very fresh though, but whatever.", 
            "i had a great brunch with some girlfriends at mon ami gabi last weekend. the <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> was amazing, but the \"salad\" they mention in the menu is actually less than a normal place's plate dressing.  honestly, not a salad.  the french sangria (frangria) was good enough i got a carafe and finished most of it myself (although that could have just been the mood we were in).  we were seated outside with shade so weren't too hot or too cold and until some jerk started smoking towards the end of our experience it was perfect.  the waitress was clearly a pro and very friendly.", 
            "i came here for lunch with my family.  i must say i really enjoyed this place.  i didn't expect to wait for seating midday saturday, but there was about a 20 minute wait.  we ended up getting a table on the outside patio with a straightshot view to the bellagio water fountain.  there were trees in our view, but we still got to experience 3 or 4 water shows.  \n\nbeyond the location and environment, the food was quite good.  the first thing to note is the bread.  fresh baguettes from the oven, properly made and served with a crisp crust and soft inside (baguettes aren't supposed to be rock hard).  we started with a dozen oysters (blue points, i think).  my parents have never had \"real\" raw oysters, having most of their experiences from ayce asian buffets.  they were very impressed at the freshness and quality of these oysters.  objectively, they were very fresh and tasty.  i couldn't figure out how a restaurant in the middle of the desert could have such a ready supply of fresh oysters, but nothing about the flavor or odor suggested that they weren't top notch quality.  for our main dish, our table had the <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>, <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>, roast beef sandwich, and the halibut.  just about everything was good, but i especially liked the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>.  large <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> adorned on a shrimp and fish crepe.\n\nall in all, it wasn't super pricey, the food was great, and the environment was fun and refreshing.  i would definitely return.", 
            "the place was excellent just like i expected it to be. we didn't get patio seating unfortunately, so i will use that as my excuse next time to come here again! but then, this place really needs no excuse for me to dine...\n\nthe staff here are super friendly and courteous, and very efficient. our waitress was easy to chat with, very knowledgeable about the menu, and answered even our silly questions about the humongous wine bottles decorating the restaurant. she was very on top of everything, checking periodically to make sure everything was to our liking while my friends and i dined.\n\nbetween all 4 of us, we ordered the blt sandwich, <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>, <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>, and the sandwich of the day - lamb burger stuffed with roquefort cheese. the 2 sandwiches came with waffle fries and regular fries respectively. however, their fries are very different, as they are cut super super thin, so it's like eating potato chips instead of french fries. i loved this, but my friend was not quite as fond of it. we all liked our main dish though, so that was alright =). my lamb burger was juicy and oh-so-delish. the roquefort was just such yummy goodness and a perfect complement to the lamb, which was cook to a perfect medium-rare just as i requested. i can't tell you how happy that makes me when a restaurant can fulfill such a simple request such as this. you would think the request is simple but you will be amazed how many places always get it wrong.\n\nthe ambiance is very relaxing and chic, posh without being pretentious. it was a lovely experience and i can't wait to go back again!", 
            "this place was recommended to us by a frequent visitor to vegas. we went for brunch one day, and this was the perfect place to nurse a hangover and to have a relaxing meal. we arrived relatively early (before noon on a week day) and so there weren't that many people. i got the onion soup and the brie <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>, and my friend got a sandwich that also had brie in it. the sandwich came with fries. the onion soup was flavorful and sweet, and i enjoyed it a lot. i also liked my crepe, the flavor was light but it definitely filled me up. the portions were rather large so i couldn't even finish everything. i had a bite of my friend's sandwich and that was yummy also.", 
            "we've been here for a decade and finally made it over to mon ami gabi today! we're vegetarian and our server was very helpful with regards to choices. my husband ended up ordering a spinach/<mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>, which the kitchen made for him without any hassle. i had the mushroom quiche. we would say that the food was probably an 8/10, with the desserts both being highlights. the service was wonderful - brisk and friendly, but not overly intrusive. solid ambiance - darker woods and a lovely sun room that lets in a lot of natural light during lunch.", 
            "great breakfast. there was a bit of waiting when we got there around 11am. once we were seated, the waiter greeted us and gave us a brief recommendations from the menu. he was polite and nice. \nwe had french toast, <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>, <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> and three eggs. they all turned out to be outstanding. my <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> with melted brie and apple, it tasted like heaven! \nalso i heard their dinner is pretty good too. i wil have to try their famous steak with french fries next time. :)", 
            "stopped by for brunch. beautiful view of the strip. perfect place to people watch. there's always a long wait, so try to grab a reservation before you arrive. i'm not a huge fan of bloody marys, but they have a cute bloody mary bar. i enjoyed their mimosa though! :)\n\ni'm not the usual to adventure out and too many exotic foods at once, but we had some escargot and liver. they were delicious but not exactly my cup of tea. the quiche was good. the sauce they used to pair with their <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> is creamy and very soothing.", 
            "we were lucky enough to get a table on the patio. the rest of the restaurant is quite dark, but the sunroom is also really nice if there's no space on the patio.\n\nwe were here for brunch/lunch, so i ordered the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>. my friends shared the escargot, and had the <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>, <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>, and chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>.\n\neverything tasted great, but didn't wow us. like most french food, everything was quite rich, so it was a pretty heavy lunch. i loved the fries; they were thin and crunchy.\n\nwe also shared a pitcher of frangria, which was quite strong (we're not huge red wine drinkers), but with some added lime juice it tasted much better.\n\nwould love to come back to try their steak.", 
            "i wish there were more stars to give.  the food is amazing.  i visited the vegas location this past weekend and was highly impressed with the delicious food, from their orange juice to something as simple as bread.  i went two days in a row :-) i highly recomed the <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>. i wish a mon ami restaurant will open in ny/nj.", 
            "location is the real selling point here (center strip) and if you can get a seat outside or on the patio, you'll get a nice view of the bellagio fountains. the inside is a bit dark and dingy looking but overall the food is pretty solid. went for brunch and i had the chicken & <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> (pretty good) and the girlfriend had the egg salad sandwich (delicious). bread to start the meal was also great, however the french fries and chips they served on the side were a bit disappointing. \n\ni was really excited to hear that they had a diy bloody mary bar but this was also a bit of a letdown. they have a few toppings but nothing extravagant which is what i was expecting from the waiter's sales pitch. maybe my standards are too high when it comes to bloody mary's but i wouldn't pay extra for this particular bar.\n\nservice was friendly but slow and i had to flag down the waiter numerous times to order, ask for refills of water, etc. i think brunch is the best time to go here and i would go back but not if there was a wait.", 
            "excellent gazpacho, warm brie and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> and spinach, asparagus, brie quiche. delicious food and nice ambience. service was attentive but a little slow. a little over an hour. i guess we're just used to eating and running!", 
            "why 5 starrs?\n\nit's actually kind of difficult to find a nice restaurant with a patio on the strip, and this place is your answer. great food, great prices, and plenty of patio seating. \n\ni had the scallop appetizer ($13) with 3 scallops in lemon butter sauce with melted cheese. i'll pay that price for scallops all day. also had the french onion soup and was delicious. other had the <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> and it was a winner. the food itself is probably not worth 5 stars, but the overall experience was.", 
            "went here with friends for lunch on monday afternoon. the patios is nice to sit at. the food was average at best. i had the <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> which was ok but was lacking in flavor.  also had the profiteroles for desert, and they were disappointing. the puffs were chewy and stale. was expecting more. disappointing.", 
            "a friend raved about this place so we came here on our most recent trip to give it a try. i give it to them that they have the best location! from the outside seating you can get a perfect view of the strip and bellagio's fountain show. however, the food was quite disappointing. what stood out was their <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> and water. yes, i said water. which means the other food really isn't that good.\n\none of my friends ordered the french onion soup. he said there was waaay too much cheese and not enough onions. the broth was not beefy enough. my other friend ordered the steak burger and the meat also lacked flavor. the dijon mustard they gave didn't even taste like dijon. i ordered the chicken & <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> and i too was disappointed. the chicken was soooooo dry! i'm surprised because isn't french food supposed to be packed with flavors? here everything is lacking!\n\nthe 2 dishes that i did like was the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> appetizer and the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> & egg tartine salad. surprisingly, i am normally not a big fan of smoke salmon but it was quite good here. fresh & light! finally, something right. oh yeah, and the water was good. either that or i was just dehydrating.\n\nservice was okay. we had to flag the servers down a few times.", 
            "what an adorable place for a lunch or brunch! if your timing is good or if you're willing to wait, the patio is the perfect place to enjoy your meal. unfortunately, the patio was closed for a private event when i was there. \n\nmy family and i stopped by for a sunday lunch/brunch. their menu has a good variety of items so everyone should be able to find something they want. that morning, the warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> was calling my name and i had to answer. i loved my sandwich! it was warm and creamy from the brie, sweet from the caramelized onions, and a bit tart from the green apples. i think i may have to re-create this combination at home! accompanying my sandwich was a cone full of their fries. i'm not sure if i'd call them fries though. they were flat and wider than other fries which made them crispy in some places. it was more of a cross between a fry and a chip, a \"frip\" if you will. \n\ni also sampled the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> and the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> from my family members. both were tasty as well! my one complaint is that the butter that came with our demi baguette was cold. why was it cold? the bread wasn't warm so the cold butter didn't make sense. \n\nfor a nice restaurant on the vegas strip, the prices seemed pretty reasonable. the space was a bit cramped though. be prepared to potentially bump elbows with the person at the next table.", 
            "the reviews pretty much say it all. the food here was very very good. i ordered the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>. it was hard to make a decision on the menu because all the food sounded so delicious. the crepe was the best i've ever had. the presentation on the plate was amazing and the flavor didn't disappoint. the service here was very good and the servers knew who ordered what without asking. the restaurant is very busy so expect to wait at least 30 minutes for a table. i would have given this place five stars but they had accidentally seated another party at our table which caused quite a bit of confusion and frustration. the food and service after that made up for it and my group had all forgotten the drama after enjoying the delicious food and wonderful ambiance.", 
            "i've eaten here twice and both times were good. not fantastic though, which makes me think i need to return for the steak frites! the patio is definitely one of the best on the strip. it has some shaded areas but can still get extremely hot.. my butter melted completely just from sitting in the sun! great people watching.. it's too bad you can't request to be seated there when you make a reservation. i think my favorite item that i've tried is the <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>. the bread and butter is very good.. the little bag makes it feel like a true french baguette!", 
            "great food, love the <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>.  the inside restaurant has a lovely atmosphere.  dining outside is a perfect people watching experience as you are directly on las vegas blvd, the only problem is in the summer it is so hot outside.", 
            "we had a fabulous lunch here a couple of weeks ago on the 4th of july.  i had the <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> and hubby had the burger. both were perfect. the service was top notch and the prices were terrific for the quantity and quality of the food.  the ambiance is very nice, i'll bet it's even better at night, and we will be back to see for ourselves on our next vegas trip, for sure!", 
            "overall a really nice experience. if you sit outside on the patio, it's a great view of the strip and bellagio fountains. you get more of a \"parisian vibe\" if you sit inside though, so honestly it's a win-win no matter where you sit. \n\nthe free bread appetizer is literally a huge loaf of bread. doesn't seem very hygienic with everyone digging in on the same piece of bread, but maybe that's how they do it in authentic parisian cafes? no idea lol. \n\nordered the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>. delicious. everything on the menu looked good and i would love to go back :)", 
            "our first stop after landing in vegas and checking into our hotel was to find some lunch.  we had no particular plans where to eat, just knew we needed something asap.  the paris was relatively close to our hotel, saw the strip-side seating of the mon ami gabi and thought it looked about as good as any other place.\n\nservice started out a little slow.  we were seated, and then waited a bit longer than expected for the server to come by.  however, our meal made up for this minor issue, as everything we both ate was very delicious.\n\nthe free crusty bread was amazing.  could possibly have something to do with the fact we were starving, but the bread, quite literally, was the best thing we'd ever eaten.  okay, maybe not the best, but it was pretty dang good.\n\ni decided to order the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> topped with kale and brie.  a very hearty portion, and super satisfying.  the flavor was reminiscent of the very best comfort food you can imagine.  a pure pleasure to eat.  everything went well together, and all ingredients had a perfect balance.\n\nmy husband got the classique steak frites with maitre d' butter.  his hangar steak was cooked perfectly, and the frites were something special.  we've seen many frites entrees that looked like they opened up a bag of frozen french fries and threw in the deep fryer.  but these were like a chip/fry hybrid.  crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  definitely homemade, or if not, they chose a wonderfully unique product.\n\ni recommend mon ami gabi with two thumbs up.  i'd have no reservations about eating here again one day.  was a great start to our last vegas trip, for sure.", 
            "the food and service were good.\n\ni'd recommend the french onion soup, <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark>, and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>.\n\nalso, the view seating outside is nice because you get a good look at the bellagio water fountain show.\n\neverything on the las vegas strip is priced relatively on the higher end, that being said, this place gives a good bang for buck.", 
            "other than being right across the fountains of bellagio, i'm not quite sure what the hype is about this place. we came here for brunch during peak hour, but luckily had a reservation so ended up waiting only a few minutes. \n\nour table ordered bordelaise steak frites (with caramelized onion and red wine sauce); chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> (with kale and brie); <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> (with scallops, shrimp, peas and cream); onion soup; and eggs benedict (with canadian bacon and hollandaise sauce). \n\nthe steak frites and onion soup were the best things we ordered. steak frites came with a huge chunk of juicy steak and a side of crispy, salted fries. onion soup was also a nice, big portion, but i can't say it stood out from other onion soups i've had. can't speak for the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> since i didn't get to try it, but everything else truthfully fell short of expectations. the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> not only lacked flavor, but also was too creamy and heavy for my taste. the large pieces of shrimp and scallops saved the dish, but overall, the crepe was just okay. eggs benedict here is definitely not a stand-out dish, either. the muffin was too hard and i've definitely had better hollandaise sauce.", 
            "so i really wanted to have breakfast here. we made a reservation at 12pm on sunday but little did i know they serve breakfast here till 11am :(. their brunch menu is limited and they only have a few dishes. we ended up having food from their regular menu and i must say, we were not disappointed. we had the <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> and its aaaamazing! i think that would have to be the best thing we had. it came with a little sauce which pairs with it well. we also had chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> and a lobster roll. the crepe was perfection, the chicken just right, the sauce rich and creamy. it was a little heavy but that is kind of expected for french food. the lobster roll was good, the lobster was really fresh. highly recommend making a reservation, we got seated right away and we got a seat near the patio. got a glimpse of the bellagio fountains.", 
            "easter brunch -  the brie chicken & <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> was amazingly delicious! must try if you're craving something savory! we also ordered the eggs benedict & blueberry french toast! the benedict wasn't all that special the english muffin was so hard we couldn't cut through it with a knife. despite being busy the service was great! one of my favorite spots on the strip for brunch. great view of the bellagio fountains.", 
            "this place is located inside the paris casino.  its another great place to eat delicious food.  after you order your meal, they bring out a warm baguette.  the baguette tasted fresh.\n\n i ordered the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>.  i loved how there was a lot of mushrooms on top and inside the crepe.  the chicken was tender, too.  \n\n for dessert, we ordered the proliferates.  this is basically a cream puff filled with vanila ice cream.  i really enjoyed this dessert.\n\n overall, service was very good here.  the prices are fairly reasonable.  i would definitely come back.", 
            "located right on the strip at paris casino, this french-style bistro offers a great street view if sitting outside or in the greenhouse (as where we were seated), or a more intimate bistro feel if seated inside. \n\nour server was extremely friendly, helpful, and efficient. our meal started with a complimentary wrapped baguette for the table. all our choices were perfect: the <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>, served with a salad, was light - but hearty and delicious . next time, i would ask them to skip the chicken and add extra mushrooms. the fries were the best i've ever tasted. had a taste of the <mark>Pulled Pork Brisket Banh Mi</mark> - and was like nothing i've ever had before. our accommodating server offered artichokes to replace canadian bacon in order to make the brunch eggs benedict vegetarian for one in our party.\n\nfor simple, casual food, mon ami gabi gets my 5 stars.", 
            "loved it so much that we ate there twice in one weekend in vegas. service is excellent, food, wine, drinks very good, and the atmosphere is great. loved sitting on the patio and people-watching, as well as dining in the \"cafe\" room. chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> are the best i've ever had!", 
            "this is one of the best restaurants in vegas. the boyfriend and i came here and loved everything we ate. we ordered: \n\n<mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> medium - probably the best <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> i've ever had. i had no idea a <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> could taste so good. and it went with the dip so well. the bread is soft enough to be chewed on, but hard enough to not get all soggy once dipped. \nchicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> - delicious flavors in this crepe. it had brie cheese, which made it all the much better. \n<mark>Salmon Tartare</mark> - the <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark> was delicious and fresh, with nice crunchy chips and avocado. \nfrench onion soup - delicious french onion soup with the beautiful layer of cheese on top. i think the only good memories i have of great french onion soup has been in vegas. \n\nthe seating was perfect. we asked to be seated outdoors, but we weren't placed literally outside. instead, we were still under an air conditioned glass room, where we had an outdoor view of the poor passerbys suffering the hot sun. we got the best of both worlds. \n\nour server wasn't the best. she was rude and inattentive, but the food was so good i couldn't care less. \n\ni'd come back.", 
            "i love this place! this is the first restaurant that we visited in vegas and it was a great start to our blessed weekend. we visited during the lunch time but they were already very busy. we didn't have the reservation but they sat us down quickly. it was a big restaurant with traditional european decorations. we started out with drinks. i enjoyed my frangria while my friend was served with their bloody mary bar. our first plate was the mussels, which was cooked in a creamy and rich sauce. it was perfect! definitely one of the best mussels that i have had. it was followed by my main entree, chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>. the crepe was also excellent. the filling of mushroom and chicken was well balanced with the light creamy sauce. the crepe was thin but flavorful. overall, we all enjoyed our plates and were ready for our vegas trip. the location of this place is also a selling point. it is right across from the fountain of bellagio. if you come during the late afternoon or evening, you can enjoy their famous fountain show right from the restaurant.", 
            "came here for brunch and enjoyed every minute. even though it was hot outside, we sat outside. the umbrellas gave plenty of shade and the water mist along the railings made it comfortable. the service was excellent. they were very attentive. there was never a moment when we needed to ask for refills on our drinks. everything on the menu sounded delicious. we started out with the chocolate croissants....warm and crispy! we wanted more but we refrained because we wanted to enjoy our brunch entr\\u00e9. we ordered the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>....i really liked the kale in it. delish and we ordered the eggs benedict special with the famous yummy hash browns. omg! yummy for the tummy! sitting outside was entertaining because you can enjoy your meal and people watch. if you are lucky, you can even enjoy some music played by the street vendors. loved my first visit here..definitely be back again to dine!!", 
            "i came here for a super late lunch and wasn't that impressed. i was there during thanksgiving day and it was packed. luckily we made reservations so we had no issues with getting a table. \n\nordered: chicken & <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> ($14.95), <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> ($14.95), and the <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> ($10.95). \n\nnote in my point of view, that all three choices are enough to share with another person. my favorite out of all the three was the chicken & <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>. the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> wasn't that great (i've had better & overpriced). the <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> was definitely overpriced for the overall taste. \n\nall in all, it wasn't as impressive as it was all hyped up to be -_-... oh, and the french baguette they give, meh. you can go to a grocery store and get better :d", 
            "my friends and i were very excited to try this place and surprises that on opentable, we were able to make a lunch reservation the day of! \nwe ordered the soup of the day (cream of potato) and onion soup to start off with. i loved the cream of potato soup!! if you want something creamy and savory, i definitely recommend it! i also enjoyed the onion soup, but i was not a huge fan of the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> on top. \ni ordered the eggs benedict which came with canadian bacon and a side of hash browns. i found the hash brown to be really cold when it came out, and the english muffin was extremely hard- i couldn't cut it so i just ended up eating the top part. it was just too burnt. \nmy friends orders were delicious though! especially the <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>- i will definitely order that if i were to come here again! it also comes with a side of fries, which were crispy and perfectly seasoned. \ni also tried the grilled cheese and mushroom and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>. they were delicious and perfectly cooked.\none downside is that after placing our order, we decided we wanted to try the fries and ordered it from our waiter. he failed to mention that the two of our dishes came with fries and we had no idea, so we had 3 fries for 4 people and it was way too much. \nwe tried the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e for dessert and it was good! creamy in the middle and crispy on top. \n\ntry to sit on the patio for a wonderful view of the strip and the fountains of bellagio!"

            "one of my go-to spots when i'm in vegas.  not too fancy, good food, nice outdoor patio right across from the bellagio fountains.  the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> are awesome.  they technically are not on the menu for some reason, but they'll still make them for you if you ask.  my only complaint to the staff would be: please turn off your gas-lit lights when it's 100 degrees outside and sunny.  i literally thought my face was going to melt into my delicious beer.  but i still love you.", 
            "i came here for lunch with my family.  i must say i really enjoyed this place.  i didn't expect to wait for seating midday saturday, but there was about a 20 minute wait.  we ended up getting a table on the outside patio with a straightshot view to the bellagio water fountain.  there were trees in our view, but we still got to experience 3 or 4 water shows.  \n\nbeyond the location and environment, the food was quite good.  the first thing to note is the bread.  fresh baguettes from the oven, properly made and served with a crisp crust and soft inside (baguettes aren't supposed to be rock hard).  we started with a dozen oysters (blue points, i think).  my parents have never had \"real\" raw oysters, having most of their experiences from ayce asian buffets.  they were very impressed at the freshness and quality of these oysters.  objectively, they were very fresh and tasty.  i couldn't figure out how a restaurant in the middle of the desert could have such a ready supply of fresh oysters, but nothing about the flavor or odor suggested that they weren't top notch quality.  for our main dish, our table had the <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>, <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>, roast beef sandwich, and the halibut.  just about everything was good, but i especially liked the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>.  large <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> adorned on a shrimp and fish crepe.\n\nall in all, it wasn't super pricey, the food was great, and the environment was fun and refreshing.  i would definitely return.", 
            "this place is a gem in vegas especially for lunch time dining.  we got the steak frites and also the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> .  most things are a rip-off in vegas but i thought this establishment was very fair and well-done.", 
            "i do love the view here. i am a people watcher and can view the whole strip and watch the bellagio fountains. plus, it's rare that i get my \"perfect weather day\" in vegas so i bask outside whenever i can. \n\ni get very simple things here and they are good. i am a pate person- their <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>  and chicken liver mousse are happy pleasure of mine. (me= bread and charcuterie whore). i usually just snack and dont commit to serious eats while watching people so thats my usual. \n\nbreakfast i've had the butterscotch waffles with poached pears and it was a nice topping...sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. \n\ni have not had dinner here yet. \n\ni've gone off trying most breakfast/lunch items, but i just keep it to those simple three usually...not that the other items are bad. ive gotten a short rib cheese sammy, escargot, <mark>Scallops Gratinees</mark>, <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> and enjoyed each. \n\ni just like french simplicity to go for the view.", 
            "yum, yum, yum. \n\nit was a gorgeous day last monday when i was on the strip, so my friend and i decided to look for a place to have lunch outside. mon ami gabi looked happening, so we popped into the paris and added our name to the list. our wait was supposed to be 35 minutes for a patio seat, but really it turned out to be more like 15. \n\nthe hostess told me she didn't want to be at work as she was walking us to our table, which i thought was a little odd, but i couldn't blame her. it was a beautiful day. our waiter was on-point. he was attentive but not over-bearing. \n\nthe french bread came out hot and delicious. and the butter was room temperature - something that is key and that most places don't do. split the loaf with my friend and had a happy start to the meal.\n\nthe menu had lots of delicious-sounding options, but i settled on the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> while my friend ordered the open-face shrimp salad sandwich with avocado. when our food came out, my friend and i switched. she hates celery and there was a lot of it in this shrimp salad. there was also a lot of shrimp and red pepper. yum. and it wasn't too mayonnaise-y. i thought the bread under the salad was a little useless, since it got soggy, and the giant lettuce pieces were a little difficult to eat. i also didn't quite see how the avocado fit in, but i was happy to eat it. overall, i found it yummy. the fries it came with were more like potato crisps (like the chips in the grocery store). so-so, but nothing i'd munch on regularly.\n\nwhat was even yummier, though, was that <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>. holy moly. the scallops were perfect - buttery, charred on one side, and just yum. the shrimp were also grilled yumminess. there was a fair portion of seafood on the crepe. the sauce really made the dish, though. i can't even describe it other than yum, heaven, something i'd like to drink from a glass. it was thick-ish and buttery. and the peas were a perfect touch. the only complaint: the menu said the crepe came with a salad. it was more like 3 pieces of lettuce tucked on the side of the plate.\n\nmy friend is huge on dessert, so she ordered the profiterole trio. the caramel ice cream was delicious. the vanilla and chocolate were also good. the fudge sauce drizzled over the dish was heaven. and the profiteroles/pastries were airy, crisp and yummy.\n\ni thought the lunch prices were really reasonable for vegas. $12 for the shrimp salad and $15-17 for the crepe. \n\nthe view of the bellagio water show made this lunch even better.", 
            "this place is a must on a nice, sunny vegas afternoon - patio seating right on lv blvd! and the scallops sauteed in caramelized onion sauce is def. a must!! sooo good!! their <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>, chic <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> and sandwiches are good too, along with their real potato fries!", 
            "for our monday brunch i give mon ami gabi 5 stars for their complimentary bread, 4 stars for ambiance and service, and 2 stars to the food. the location is obviously a great plus, with its view of the bellagio fountain and people watching. though the vegas heat was at an oppressive 100+ degrees, the misters and umbrellas did a decent job keeping us from overheating. the bread is phenomenal. our appetizers were great. but the dishes we paid the most for ended up being the most underwhelming. \n\nthe appetizers that were a hit were the oysters, which were plump, fresh, and super refreshing, and the moules frites, though, i give more credit to the bread for that as it was the main vehicle in which we enjoyed the moules frites since the fries were just so-so. \n\nthe seared tuna salad is definitely one to avoid. the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> had great scallops on the plate, but the shrimp tough and extremely overcooked. the best of the entrees was the open faced crab salad sandwich which was great for such a hot day, and unlike the seared tuna salad, seasoned well. i got sweetness from the crab, creaminess from the avocado, and bite from the thousand island dressing that boasted some really delicious chopped cornichons. \n\n$50 per person and we had drinks (iced tea and french 75s).", 
            "made reservation through opentable & came here for lunch last friday. staff were very attentive. our server made sure we didn't pour our carafe of frangria (reallliee good) ourselves :d  great view, service, price, & food!!!\n\non to the foodies we had:\n\n*mussels marini\\u00e8re* --  absolutely deee-lishcious!!!  best mussels dish i've yet had in vegas. to savor it all (down to the last few drips of sauce) we dipped the remaining of our fresh baguette into their white wine & herb sauce. yuumm!! \n\n*<mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>* -- excellent dish! nice sized scallops & shrimps - perfectly cooked. best eaten when served fresh out from the kitchen.\n\n*grilled salmon & <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>* -- the blueberries & walnuts went so well with this salad! big portion salmon - flavorful, not dry & grilled just right on a semi warm bed of spinich.\n\n\nhellsya i'll be returning to dine at this place again... well the next time i'm out here for vegas~!  ^^;", 
            "the place was excellent just like i expected it to be. we didn't get patio seating unfortunately, so i will use that as my excuse next time to come here again! but then, this place really needs no excuse for me to dine...\n\nthe staff here are super friendly and courteous, and very efficient. our waitress was easy to chat with, very knowledgeable about the menu, and answered even our silly questions about the humongous wine bottles decorating the restaurant. she was very on top of everything, checking periodically to make sure everything was to our liking while my friends and i dined.\n\nbetween all 4 of us, we ordered the blt sandwich, <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>, <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>, and the sandwich of the day - lamb burger stuffed with roquefort cheese. the 2 sandwiches came with waffle fries and regular fries respectively. however, their fries are very different, as they are cut super super thin, so it's like eating potato chips instead of french fries. i loved this, but my friend was not quite as fond of it. we all liked our main dish though, so that was alright =). my lamb burger was juicy and oh-so-delish. the roquefort was just such yummy goodness and a perfect complement to the lamb, which was cook to a perfect medium-rare just as i requested. i can't tell you how happy that makes me when a restaurant can fulfill such a simple request such as this. you would think the request is simple but you will be amazed how many places always get it wrong.\n\nthe ambiance is very relaxing and chic, posh without being pretentious. it was a lovely experience and i can't wait to go back again!", 
            "as a huge fan of all things breakfast and brunch, i turned to yelp for a recommendation and again yelp came to the rescue!  my husband and i were seated in the sunny (but still cool, which is very important in vegas) sun room of mon ami gabi for brunch and started off with their crab cakes (well, 1 crab cake actually) which was delicious and unlike other crab cakes we've had, this one did not seem to have much filler and had huge chunks of crab!  i enjoyed my fresh blueberry french toast and my husband devoured his <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> which had scallops and shrimp as big as my ear!  service was friendly and overall it was a wonderful meal and experience.  we'll definitely be back!", 
            "i was a little dubious at going from chicago to las vegas and ending up at yet another lettuce entertain you restaurant, but i was staying at the paris and the location right along las vegas boulevard and looking at the bellagio fountains was very nice.  \n\nmy friend and i went for a late lunch.  i had an okay glass of pouilly fuisse at $12, a $15 cheese flight of okay but grocery-store quality cheese and then we got the oysters.\n\nmy friend very much wanted to treat me to something special and ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell.  they came to the table and we both looked at each other and hesitated because they smelled really fishy.  however, we both tried one and both had the same reaction: there was no way we were eating more.  \n\ni called the waiter over, let him know that we found the oysters fishy but that it might just be us and there was no need to take them off the bill.  his response? \"whatever.  they're milky and people love them but if you don't like them i'll take them away.\"  and he did.  we ordered the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> and my friend got a <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> that she liked.  the pate was okay, but the service was crap from that point on, of course.\n\noh, and the french bread sucked.  i should have known after so many lettuce entertain you disappointments here in chicago that this would be no better.  i felt really bad that my friend shelled out $75 for such a mediocre lunch.", 
            "this is one of my favorite places to eat on the strip...actually in the entire valley (it's a toss up between eiffel tower and here).  the wait can be longer for a seat on the patio, but it's soooo worth it. the view of the bellagio fountains and the people watching can't be beat.  my favorite dish is the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>...scallops, shrimp, peas and cream.  pair that with a glass of their pinot noir or merlot and the french bread they bring to the table....pure heaven.  i've had their pan-seared cod special and it was light, flavorful and i wish it were a staple on the menu.  really, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!", 
            "mon ami gabi is a quaint french restaurant, located in paris resort and casino. it was a bit far from the center of the strip ~10 minutes walking. the decorum of the restaurant was very cute and resembles a modern cafe in france. casual and delicious! \n\nservice was ok in that there seemed to be no designated waiter per table so you had to flag one down to ask for the check. however, they did refill our glasses multiple times, so i can't complain. bottled or sparkling water are complimentary. \n\ni recommend coming for brunch, which is only offered on weekends. their lunch menu is very limiting but it is still possible to pick out some interesting and tasty dishes. if you have never had escargot, i would recommend trying it at mon ami gabi because it is not as slimy (which may seem revolting).\n\ni came here on weekday afternoon. we started with the <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> which is oven roasted snails cooked in garlic herb butter. i believe this is true, butter makes everything tastes good. ;) i like escargot and this dish made me like it more. if i had a larger group and a bigger appetite, i would have tried more dishes from their hors d'oeuvres because it truly gives you a taste of authentic french cuisine. i would recommend country style p\\u00e2t\\u00e9, chicken liver mousse, <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> gratin\\u00e9es  and <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> if you're feeling adventurous.\n\nfor lunch, their offerings are predominantly, sandwiches, crepes, salads and steak frites (which is essentially steak with thinly cut fries).\nfor brunch, i have heard good things about their french toast, pancakes, crepes and eggs benedicts. \n\nthe two of us ordered the croque madame and <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> for entrees. croque madame was fine but the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> was show-stopper. first of all, the crepe was buttery and thin, strewn over with a b\\u00e9chamel cream sauce. the shrimps and scallops were fresh, tender and sweet. and the combination of textures and flavors satiated my palate. definitely recommended!\n\noverall, i enjoyed mon ami gabi and will come back next time for their brunch. our check came out for ~$17 pp, which was reasonable compared to how much we ate. also, they provide complimentary, fresh-baked french baguettes. love!", 
            "yumyumyum! my first french restaurant. it was really classy inside & a nice place to take a date, and i guess sitting outside is the business cause it was packed outside, but pretty empty inside. i had the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> for about $14, which was filled with peas & cream & topped with jumbo shrimp & giant delishhh scallops. i shared with a friend, and was satisfied. we originally planned to go to the bellagio buffet around 3, but stopped by here for a quick bite since we were starving...but were too full by the time we finished & had to postpone our buffet plans. bon appetit!",

            "what i ordered: it was lunch, but i was feeling like eating brunch food so i ordered the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>. it consisted of a crepe with large, grilled shrimp and scallops with a cream sauce. the crepe contained peas and a cream filling. the dish was topped off with fresh raw spinach. \n\nwhat i thought: the crepe was light and tasted great with the peas and cream sauce. the shrimp was seasoned well and tasted good, but a little overcooked. the scallops were my favorite part. it was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and had a nice crust on it. \n\noverall: i thought the dish was good, but seemed to lack that oomph. really this dish should be 3.5 stars if yelp would let me. the restaurant itself is situated in a cool spot overlooking the strip across from the bellagio fountains.",

            "when the weather is nice and i have guests from out of town, this is tops on my list for a quintessential way to start or end a weekend on the strip.  although there is an option for online reservations on the yelp page, please note this is for indoor seating only.  if you want the outdoor patio seating, probably best to come in at least 30-60min prior to the desired time to get on the list (maybe earlier during peak brunch hours on the weekend).  \n\nhaving dined for lunch inside and outside, the patio seating wins hands down by all accounts.  the lighting inside is great for a romantic evening dinner, but a bit too drab if you're trying to catch up with friends.  none of the lunch items blew me away, but the breakfast items were fairly solid and beautifully plated.  i would recommend any of the following best enjoyed with cup of coffee while facing the bellagio fountains and observing the parade of characters lining las vegas blvd.  \n\n1.  blueberry waffles:  with a crisp exterior and pillowy soft interior, the belgian waffle is topped with fresh blueberries along with warm blueberry sauce and freshly whipped cream.\n\n2. lemon pancakes: served with fresh strawberries and whipped cream over what is essentially a large french-style crepe with perfectly crisped edges and light as a feather, be sure to add a squeeze of fresh lemon before digging in.\n\n3. <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>: if you're lucky enough to be there on a day featuring this special, do not pass it up.  large jumbo shrimp and scallops served atop a warm crispy crepe and topped with a creamy buttery white wine sauce served alongside fresh frisee and herbs.\n\nservers were attentive and very hospitable in snapping photos, which your visiting friends will be sure to request!", 
            "there are so many reviews already, i'll jut put in my 2 cents on this one. \n\neverything my husband and i had here for lunch is executed well.  from the bread that comes in a mini baguette form, hot from the oven in a paper sleeve, to the <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>, and eggs benedict and <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>. flavorful, portions sized just right. \n\nseating on the patio is a must for people watching and enjoying the weather.  it's just something you gotta do when you come to vegas and dine on the strip. \n\non the flip side, while it was a great experience, nothing stood out on the menu.  it's classic french food, it's done well, came away feeling satisfied.", 
            "mon ami is really the only decent restaurant to dine in vegas.  the irony is that it is in the paris hotel across from the bellagio fountains.  every time i am in vegas, i make sure to have lunch and/or dinner here because the food is very well prepared at reasonable rates.   \n\ni really enjoy the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>.  it filled with scallops, shrimp, veggies, and a cream sauce.  it is very tasty and only $14.  you cannot do wrong with their steak frites.  a 14 ouce steak that would out-compete most steak-houses i know.  for $25 bucks, can't beat the price for a quality meal.  \n\ni highly recommend grabbing a table in the patio and enjoy the people watching.  on a sunny day, the setting reminds me of sitting in a cafe on saint michel in actual paris....", 
            "favorite dishes: escargot, <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>, mussels, salmon salad, and crab cakes.\ni always come here whenever i go to vegas just to eat their escargots. best escargot!!!", 
            "we went here because of the mass reviews on yelp. let me just say that the reasons why this place is getting a one star is because the bad service we got from our server efrain m. he made us feel comfortable at all! there was no hello, how are you, just grumpy what do you want kind of attitude. i used to waiter but even on my bad day, i would leave all that at the door. we ordered the <mark>Freshly Ground Ahi Tuna Burger</mark> and the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> (which was pretty much the only thing that cheer me up) the scallops felt like it was a couple days old, and the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> was not very apetizing. seafood tasted smelly and old! the chicken bri sandwich looks like they pilled a bunch of s on it. but worst of all, this place is so overated! don't go here unless you want to eat mostly sh***y food and crappy service. stay away!!!", 
            "we were looking for a nice birthday lunch for my sister that wasn't $$$$, had good reviews on yelp, and was suitable for a 2 and 8 year old. most of the well-rated restaurants were way out of our budget in las vegas, or were a little too fancy to bring kids.  luckily, we found mon ami gabi!\n\neveryone's meals were tasty.  i had the mushroom soup, the butter lettuce, <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> and apple salad, and the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>.  the peas in the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> were so nice and sweet and fresh.  for the kids, they had the mac and cheese which came with thinly sliced apples and skinny green beans.  it was so delicious!  i found myself picking at their plates quite often too!\n\nbottom line:\nthe meals were reasonable priced, especially compared to all of the other restaurants in the area. our waitress was nice and helpful (she suggested the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>).  and the restaurant wasn't too fancy that bringing kids would be frowned upon.  great place!", 
            "solid french food in a touristy area.  \n\nwe walked in for saturday brunch and were seated within a few minutes since we asked for indoors.  feels disarmingly like paris (i guess that's the point).  actually, a little *too* much like paris... it was difficult to wave down servers for tableware, sugar, another drink order, etc.  not too difficult, just like i was in france rather than the tourist capitol of america.\n\nwhen you sit they give you warm bread.  win.  wonderful, delicious warm bread plopped right on the table with some butter. \n\ndecent onion soup, with a rich beef broth and melting caramelized onions- a little bit salty for me, but that's just me.  melted cheese and a crouton on top.  standardly solidly good, which is to say great since it's hard to get some standardly solidly good soupe a l'oignon in the us.\n\nincredible frisee and <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> with poached egg and a citrus vinaigrette- we spent awhile trying to guess what made the dressing so good and we still have no idea.  the warm thick hunks of bacon went great with the light orange-y dressing.  we asked for extra bread to mop up the goodness.  only wished there was a bit more frisee to balance out the heavy toppings.\n\n<mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>: meh.  scallops and shrimp were good, but i'd pass on this.\n\nthere are four stars here for that salad.  it's that good to bring a three star restaurant up to a four.  yum.",

            "another vegas trip, another visit to mon ami gabi.  it's probably not surprising if you've read my past reviews that a visit to mag is always on my must-list.  and once again like my last trip, i visited them twice.  once for a late mid-week lunch, and then for saturday brunch.\n\nthis was actually my first time eating at mag for lunch.  it's actually a different atmosphere compared to breakfast and dinner.  in fact, i think it was the most mellowest.  then again it was a late lunch at around 2pm.  so a good tip would be if you want try mag for lunch and not have to wait a long time for a table on the patio, go for a late lunch.  i ordered the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> which i've actually have had my sights on for a long time because the pics on yelp looked amazing!\n\n<mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> with scallops, shrimp, peas & cream\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=r7_bvu2opbursoyt8rle9a)\nthis was so delicious!  huge pieces of shrimp and scallops to go with the crepe.  i'm a big eater, but this surprisingly filled me up.  and that's such a good thing!\n\nonce again, my last meal in before leaving vegas was breakfast at mag.  and being it national burger month and i've yet to try it, i ordered their cheeseburger with gruyere, bacon, and fried egg.  it's the breakfast of champions!\n\ncheeseburger with fried egg, bacon, and frites\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=h4epdpyrl1bml0z4amcdqw)\nhere's a closeup of the burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=h4epdpyrl1bml0z4amcdqw#0i7mnft4jkygazw10jsjvg)\nthe burger was cooked a perfect medium rare and of course paired with their flat handcut frites made for a very satisfying breakfast!\n\ni love how consistent their food and service has always been for me.  and the surprising part is how i've never had ordered the same thing twice here, yet everything i've had has been spot on!", 
            "needed to find a place for a weekend lunch with the bachelorette group and we ended up here.  perhaps it was just my luck...but they sat us at a table where a large amount of spilled ketchup was all over the floor underneath the table.  they reseated us at a different table, but did not offer any apology....for the mess that attacked our feet.\n\nonto the food...i ordered the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>...the seafood was fresh and delicious and well flavored but i felt the crepe was rather unremarkable.  i've definitely had better crepes.  the fries that come with their sandwiches and burgers are delicious...really they aren't fries...they seem more like kettle chips in the shape of a fry.  and they are very addicting!!\n\nthe food took over an hour before it arrived at our table....and our waiter when we were trying to pay for the check was no where to be found....for a establishment on the strip...overall the service here is horrible and the food is at best slightly above mediocre.", 
            "great outdoor patio on the strip to people watch and just relax!  went for lunch.  had the salmon and egg salad tartine and the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>.", 
            "good food, great service, outstanding views! \n\ni've come here every time i've been to vegas and have tried every possible meal from breakfast to a late dinner. the best time to enjoy gabi's is at nighttime: the bellagio fountains will be going off every 20 or so minutes, the strip will be packed, and the patio cool and pleasant even in the summer months. however it can get crowded in the evening so if you want to sit outside be prepared to wait for 20 or so minutes and get a reservation in advance. i've come here with a friend once without reservations and was told there would be more than an hour wait to get a seat anywhere on a saturday night. since the restaurant is so versatile it's hard to recommend 1 or 2 dishes in particular so it's probably best to list the highlights by meal:\nbreakfast: croque madame or the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>. help yourself to some champagne too, it's vegas\nlunch: chilled zapacho, <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>, and the trout amandine are all great. on friday they serve an australian cod which is brilliant\nbrunch: do yourself a favor and order a french 75. it's no longer on the menu but they make the best in town. add in the eggs benedict and it'll rival bouchon for the best french-themed brunch in vegas.\ndinner: the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> is the best deal for an appetizer. 50 dollars for a whole lobster, oysters, tuna tartare, shrimp and even more. follow that up with the steak bearnaise or roquefort and finish up with profiteroles accompanied by cognac. be careful: the calories will add up but it will have been well worth it.", 
            "we dined here on father's day as a recommendation by the concierge, and i must say, it was good advice.  situated directly across from the bellagio fountains, this restaurant offered a pleasant experience on a beautiful day, and we sat comfortably on the semi-outdoor patio despite the summer heat.\n\nthe <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> & egg salad tartine was excellent.  the buttery taste of the salmon and egg contrasted very nicely with the capers.  never before have i actually enjoyed eating the capers, so i would say that this was a good sign.\n\nthe most notable dish ordered was the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>.  the seafood was amazingly fresh, a great feat for an inland barren desert, and it was all served in a rich, savory cream sauce which brought it all together.\n\nto top it off, we had a strawberry and lemon sorbet, made from scratch.  the sweet berry naturally went well with the citrus, and it was a wonderful way to finish our lunch.\n\nmoreover, our waitress was attending culinary school to become a chef, so she really knew her stuff, not to mention the service was great.", 
            "mon ami gabi perhaps won't win an award for some of the best food you'll ever have and half the menu items can be a bit pricey.  however, it is an overall solid restaurant on the vegas strip that will get you good food for a relatively good price with a great view.  \n\nwe made a reservation beforehand easily on opentable and seated pretty quickly.  service was relatively friendly (note you're going to need a shirt and shoes i believe) although it took a while for the food to come out interestingly enough.  \n\nmake sure to try to either get a patio seat or if it's too hot, the room right by the patio that will still give you an open view of the bellagio across the street.  this room not only will keep you very cool but you'll get a great sight of the awesome bellagio fountains while you're eating without having to stand and watch.  \n\nfood-wise, they have a brunch menu that is relatively cheap along with a regular menu filled with a lot of different items from crepes to steaks (it can get pricey depending on what you get).  i had the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> for about $16 and although it wasn't the best crepe i've ever had, the sauce and the fresh-tasting shrimps/scallops were solid along with a cranberry juice (they had a full drink bar/menu of a lot of items).  \n\nso again, if you're in vegas and want a solid, consistent place with a great view, you can't really go too wrong with mon ami gabi.", 
            "i've heard so many good things about this place that i had to come see what all the jazz was about. i'm so happy to say that everyone was absolutely right! this place is amazing! i don't have many comments on the restaurant itself other than it's nice to sit outside with the light water spray (?) to keep you cool. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>. if you like seafood, you can't go wrong with this dish!! so delicious. probably the best crepe i've ever had. the crepe is filled with a white seafood wine cream (i made that up, but that's what it tasted like to me!) with green peas and topped with jumbo shrimp and scallop. you might find it a little salty, but i like salty so no problems there! it's so filling! but i finished it because my mouth just couldn't stop..\n\ni also ordered the frites since everyone kept raving about them. if you know me, then you know i have this unhealthy (really unhealthy) relationship with fries. i love fries. and i didn't like theres. i'm usually the one to say i always like the crappy ends of the fries, like the fries you find at the bottom of the basket, but this was a literally a basket full of it. it was like thin potato skins really. meh, i like thin but i still need some potato! \n\nstill, i cannot wait to go back to try the rest of the menu!!", 
            "mon ami gabi? oui oui!!!\n\nthis place is a solid 4 stars in my book.  i'd definitely recommend and come back for the location, reasonable price, savory food, and excellent service.  \n\nif you are not in a rush, waiting for the outside seating, or near outside seating next to the bar, is well worth the experience.  the bellagio water show is nothing new to me but if you're new to vegas, definitely sit outside.  you'll get a host of envyous onlookers as they walk by and also see the water show across the street.\n\nattached are some pictures of:\n1. <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> - the scallops and prawns were amazingly delicious and generous in size.  i personally think the crepe robbed the seafood of the flavor, ha.\n\n2. eggs benedict - the english mufffin was a bit tough to cut through, but overall, the excellently poached egg (and i do mean excellent), ham, muffin and sauce were a symphony in my mouth.  the hash browns were well seasoned and delish...i only wish they had served the dish with more!!!  potato is cheap, come on gabi!  \n\ni noticed many people dining on the french soup.  i didn't get to try it, but that is on my list for my next visit back to this restaurant.  \n\njust say oui oui to my friend gabi!!", 
            "i'm a little sad to say this, but mon ami gabi was better than anything i had in the real paris. sigh.\n\nactually, i shouldn't be sighing. i should be cheering, because mon ami gabi made for a wildly successful birthday brunch. \n\nmr. birthday had eggs benedict ($14.95). i had a stunning <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>, which featured two perfect shrimp and two perfect scallops for $13.95. and perhaps best of all was a $20.00 pitcher of that day's special cocktail, a delicious combination of red wine and a little fruit and something sparkling and a few sprigs of rosemary. yuuuuumm.\n\nthe service was impeccable, the decor charming and decently authentic, and even though we were seated in 100 degree weather in an indoor/outdoor space, we were plenty cool. \n\ntre awesome!",

            "(edited on 11/17/12)\n\ni have been there about 7 times. i like to sit outside - to watch bellagio fountain show. \n\nfood quality wise, you can't compare to robuchon or bouchon - mon ami gabi is a french version of denny's. that's for sure. or maybe worse... \n\ni've had <mark>Freshly Ground Ahi Tuna Burger</mark> and bacon cheese burger - nothing special, nothing better than burgers at hard rock cafe.\n\ni've had <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> - it is ok. seafood is not fresh. could be using frozen seafood.\n\ngratin - greasy - heavy - rich - if you like to gain fat, this should be fine. i am worried if someone get heart attack. \n\ntrout - i remembered it was no good. \n\nfish and chips - very thin sliced fish make it pretty greasy. kinda same as one at todd english at aria. (it was my fault to get fish&chips at french bistro, yo know)\n\n(newly edited) \n\ni used to like all their mousse and pate - along with oysters to pair with wine - with a great fountain view. however, i went back and it was a huge disappointment.\n\njumbo <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> - when the server put the dish on our table, something was wrong - shrimps looked kinda brown - we thought it was some sort of spices,,, then as soon as we ate it, we realized that it was an unfresh, oxidized shrimp! it tasted like dirt. horrible! i'm sure they use the same old shrimps for other dishes. gross!\n\nliver mousse and pate - i guess no one orders these items here - i could tell because all the edges were all dried out - pretty disgusting. \n\n<mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark> - it is not a great experience to have green leaves turn brown and wilt. \n\nmussels - bad,,,,, they didn't break my expectation. not fresh! at this point, i was concerned about food poisoning. so, i asked to get a check. it was enough...\n\nwhen the food, especially seafood, gets old, they should throw them away - because you know, there is a risk of spreading food poisoning! don't give me these stained shrimps, dude.\n\nbtw, frites are better than lay's potato chips. complimentary baguette is pretty terrible. you can get better baguettes cheaper at albertson's.\n\nmy suggestion - never get seafood here if you know what decent seafood tastes like. just get burgers - cheap and simple. i guess those people who are giving 5 stars just eat burgers and steaks, not seafood. \n\nservice - not that great - too busy all the time - my server wasn't nice at all - she didn't stop at our table. no refills. i saw she was chatting for a while at another table, tho. \n\nyou will see all the men in black here - they indeed look professional in a funny way - but imagine if they change it to denny's uniforms - surly enough, they would fit really well.\n\nalso, when i made a reservation today (sat. nov 10 2012 around lunch time), the hostess was really rude over the phone.  this is karma on yelp, haha.\n\ni have been going there to see bellagio, not to enjoy food and service, but it was way too terrible.... i will never go back again.\n\n1 star is for bellagio's fountain show.", 
            "i felt just like i was back in paris.\n\nmon ami gabi is just across the street from the bellagio fountains, in (you guessed it!) the paris las vegas hotel and casino.  as you walk in, you get the sense that there are multiple layers of this bistro.  first, wooden booths and a truly \"inside\" feel, and then you step into the atrium, which has lots of light and round cafe tables.  or, you could continue outside to the patio with a great view of the strip and the fountain show (or in my case, protestors).  depends on your mood and the weather!\n\nwe started with a mini carafe of the st. germaine cocktail - so refreshing and it filled both of our glasses, twice.  then we ordered the duck confit, which was tasty but maybe a little under-seasoned.  i did enjoy my open-faced tuna melt with artichokes and olives, and my man's <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> were excellent.  the presentation was also worthy of an instagram photo posted to facebook.  nothing like a little food porn to liven up the scene!\n\nand the service:  our waiter jose was good enough to warrant a compliment to his boss.   he had this way of just making everything perfect, and we had the sense that he genuinely wanted to meet all of our needs.  when he told us he'd see us at breakfast (slick ploy for repeat business) i truly wanted to be there the next day - i just couldn't wake up in time!",

            "the food here was delicious! i went here with a large party for a bachelorette brunch. service was good and prompt even though we had to wait for the rest of our party to arrive. got the mushroom, chicken, and brie crepe as well as the mussels to share. the half portion of mussels was actually very large with a lot of mussels for only $11.95. also sampled my friend's butternut squash quiche which was yummy as well. the french onion soup had a very strong onion flavor and was loaded with cheese on top so that is a good item to order if you like french onion soup. their fries are good too - kind of flat but wavy. my other friends ordered the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> which looked great as well with large pieces of succulent shrimp. other girls had the steak which is the same cut but comes covered with different sauces depending on what you feel like. didn't get to try a bloody mary but they had this awesome bloody mary bar where you can deck out your drink with whatever you please!", 
            "i've never really been a fan of french food, but this is hands down my favorite french restaurant. i make sure to come here every time i'm in vegas.\n\ni've tried the beef wellington, <mark>Skate Wing</mark>, garlic spinach, bread pudding, lobster roll, cauliflower soup, <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>, and french toast. the complimentary bread and butter are so good, i can eat it for days. i thoroughly enjoyed most of the things i tried besides the beef wellington, <mark>Skate Wing</mark>, and french toast. the beef wellington and <mark>Skate Wing</mark> didn't suit my taste. i'm not a fan of the texture of <mark>Skate Wing</mark> and discovered i hate capers after trying this dish. as for the french toast, i felt like it was missing something.\n\nservice is very friendly and nice. this place is great for a romantic date or for a casual brunch. i'll be coming back very soon :d\n\np.s., the bread pudding is very heavy......so try sharing it with at least 3 people. the bf and i almost died trying to finish it.", 
            "i want to give 5 stars alone for the restaurant being so accomodating when i tried booking a large party lunch reservation for my birthday weekend. drew, their group event planner, was very helpful with the reservation process, willingly changing our reservation time and at the last minute, changing it from a large party (12 people) to only 4 people for lunch.\n\nhowever the food was ok for the price and ambiance. we were seated at a table next to another 2 top table literally inches away from us (\"rubbing elbows\" is an understatement.\" the servers were nice, attentive and well informed of the specials. i went with the lobster roll, which was stuffed with lobster but was too creamy for my taste (i favor traditional new england lobster rolls that highlight the lobster with basic butter.) my chips started out crispy but were bland and tough to chew by meals end. i liked the idea of my boyfriends open faced tuna melt sandwich, but preferred eating his fries which were crispy and seasoned well. my girlfriend got the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>, and she said the scallops were cooked to perfection, but very pricey ($19) for what you got. her husband scarfed down his corned beef hash and eggs, but the portion was so small, he finished my lobster roll for me.\n\ni might have given another star if we were sat on the patio but it was a 45 minute wait! overall, it wasn't bad but i would check out bouchon for a bigger brunch menu next time.",

            "other than being right across the fountains of bellagio, i'm not quite sure what the hype is about this place. we came here for brunch during peak hour, but luckily had a reservation so ended up waiting only a few minutes. \n\nour table ordered bordelaise steak frites (with caramelized onion and red wine sauce); chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> (with kale and brie); <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> (with scallops, shrimp, peas and cream); onion soup; and eggs benedict (with canadian bacon and hollandaise sauce). \n\nthe steak frites and onion soup were the best things we ordered. steak frites came with a huge chunk of juicy steak and a side of crispy, salted fries. onion soup was also a nice, big portion, but i can't say it stood out from other onion soups i've had. can't speak for the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> since i didn't get to try it, but everything else truthfully fell short of expectations. the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> not only lacked flavor, but also was too creamy and heavy for my taste. the large pieces of shrimp and scallops saved the dish, but overall, the crepe was just okay. eggs benedict here is definitely not a stand-out dish, either. the muffin was too hard and i've definitely had better hollandaise sauce.", 
            "we had the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> and a salmon salad. the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> was really good. the salmon salad was also good, but i felt like i overpaid for something so ordinary. of course you pay a little extra for the environment (popular place on the strip with patio seating). i would go again. tip: the line is usually long for patio seating. we had no line for dining inside. there are two different lines.", 
            "came for lunch with my husband, we sat outside and the weather was beautiful. we ordered the fris\\u00e9e <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> and onion soup to start, the salad was fantastic, the soup ok. i had the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> and my husband ordered the seal and fritters. my crepe was alright, the best part was the scallops but i wouldn't order it again. my husband's steak was tender he said, the saut\\u00e9ed onion and red wine sauce was good. espresso to finish, overall a good lunch.",

            "it is important to be aware of the fact that this restaurant does have a different menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. i personally find their lunch menu to be far more diverse and impressive than their dinner menu, which is exactly why i made it a point to venture here during the lunch hours versus later on in the evening. making a decision on what to eat here was honestly the hardest decision that i had to make all week while being on vacation; i wanted to order one of everything, but i opted for the ever so popular <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> paired with a glass of sancerre, and there are no words that could possibly express the enjoyment that i experienced from eating this entr\\u00e9e.\n\nthe <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> consisted of shrimp, scallops, peas and cream. it was incredibly savory and comforting at the same time. the shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly, not overdone, and were extremely flavorful as well. the cream sauce was not overwhelming, the touch of white wine and shallots were both pleasantly detectable, and the addition of a few peas throughout the crepe also added texture to the cream sauce.the actual crepe certainly complimented the cream sauce, but was also plenty tasty on its own. it was soft, but not too thick or thin and not overly salty or egg tasting. although the entr\\u00e9e appeared to be modest in size initially, it was filling, and ultimately the perfect amount of food. \n\noverall, mon ami gabi is a phenomenal restaurant on the strip that serves relatively inexpensive french cuisine, which is astonishing for any restaurant that is located in such a prime location of las vegas, never mind one that serves affordable french cuisine. i have visited las vegas three times in the past year, and my deepest regret is not that i did not gamble, drink or party enough, but that i did not come here for lunch sooner. it's clich\\u00e9 of me, but words cannot express the affection that i possess for mon ami gabi. i seriously yearn for this restaurant, to one day, thrust open its doors to new york city's french foodies.", 
            "went in for lunch on a sunday good thing we has reservations because it was a 1 hour wait.\nambience was casual. we sat in the back patio where a bar is and it was lovely.\ni had the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> (delightful to the palate and oh so fresh) and the french onion soup (oh mah gawd)..sooooo yummy!\nthe food was presented beautifully and the service was above par- i did not have to ask for anything.\ni also had their sangria which is so crisp and fresh.\n\nhad zero complaints",

            "lunch - mon ami gabi has pretty tasty food accompanied by a relaxing atmosphere. if you sit outside, you can spy on the streams of tourists passing by and watch (but not hear) the fountains of the bellagio hotel across the street. inside are darker rooms as well as a brightly lit atrium type room which lets in light but not so much the weather. \n\nonion soup - very deep flavor; not a very thick broth, but not light. there is plenty of delicious gruyre cheese on top and some onions in the soup. \n\nlobster bisque w/ orzo - a waiter brings a bowl with a few tiny chunks of lobster and 1/5 cup of orzo rice. then he pours the lobster bisque out of a little pitcher. the lobster bisque has a slight seafood-y taste but i found it bearable. the bisque is also a little spicy which i really liked! \n\nsauted spinach & brie crpe - a pretty large crepe with lots of brie and very fresh spinach. the crepe skin was a little dry and bland, but the brie and spinach made it better. the crepe also comes with a small side salad on the plate. \n\n<mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>,  with bacon - the best quiche i've had anywhere. it's creamy and eggy and the crust is tender and buttery. the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> also comes with sweet, caramelized onions scattered throughout the quiche and lends a nice contrast to the salty elements. \n\nvegetable quiche - same delicious eggy center and tender crust and contains spinach and mushrooms rather than bacon and onions. liked the textures, but thought it wasn't as flavorful as the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>. \n\nchicken & <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, caramelized onion and apple - this sandwich came on a soft ciabatta roll. the flavors were light but complemented each other well. the brie was mild and was delicious with the onions and the apples. the sweetness of the apples and onions paired well with the relatively tender chicken breast. also came with a huge side order of mon ami's thin, crispy frites. i still personally prefer my steak fries, but fans of crispy fries should like the frites. only problem was that some seemed to have been sitting around for a while.", 
            "we arrived for brunch on a windy, chilly september morning, but stuck it out on the patio.  the brunch menu is just the lunch menu, so don't juggle your plans to be here at brunch.  go somewhere else.  enjoy mon ami gabi any other time!  \n\nthe waiter brought out a baguette with soft butter and yummy raspberry jam.  i usually do not eat jam but this was so good with the butter and soft, crusty bread.  i had a bloody mary, (or two!) it was good.  i heard raves about the bloody mary bar on here, but it is nothing special unless you are sitting right by it.  i would rather the waiter just bring out my drink.\n\nwe were warmed up by the tomato soup (yum) and french onion soup (yummier).  also got the appetizer of baked tomato and cheese with toasts.  i thought it would be literally sliced tomato with melted sliced cheese on top.  it was actually a tomato puree with <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>.  very good, but not expected, as we already had the tomato soup.\n\nthe <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> was horrible.  there was an ingredient in there i couldn't stand, and my mom disliked it, too.  that is not to say someone else would not like it, just not for me.  i got the chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, very good, as were the frites that came with it.  the best was the creamy chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>.  that also came with a salad with frisee and i think baby arugula with a tantalizing dressing... i wasn't sure what it was and forgot to ask our server.  champagne vinegar, perhaps?\n\ni would definitely go back, though, and get the soup and the crepe.  i would also like to try the salad with pear & walnuts and the chocolate mousse.", 
            "make reservations to sit outside near the front of the restaurant so you have a clear view of the bellagio water fountain show. order the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and blackberry currant ice tea. the pear salad is yummy too.", 
            "first time visit-we had a reservation for mon ami gabi on christmas eve at paris hotel and casino. the restaurant is very easy to find within paris and in the front of the casino. we were late for our reservation and they were pretty much dead and seated us right away. we sat on the patio since they had spots available. for anyone that was out there that week knows it was cold and we still sat out on the patio. they had a lot of heaters that made it a very pleasant experience still to be outside. first off the view from the patio is great and for me is the reason you come here you have a great but not uninstructed view of the bellagio fountains and great to people watch. very good date place to impress your special someone. second, the waiter and everyone working at mon ami gabi was great. the waiter noticed my atlanta falcons hat that i had taken off and put on the chair and started talking that he was from atlanta and that he had family in kennesaw, ga. impressed that he noticed this and struck up a conversation that was personal to the people at his table. they had a great selection of food and prices were not bad compared to other locations i've been to and seen in las vegas. i'm by no means an expert on french food and this was the first time i've tried it. my family makes quiche a lot and i hate it. but, figured i would try it here and i have to say i loved it. so much i've got all the ingredients to try and make at home. food was great for myself and my friend. we ordered the chicken & gruyere crepe, <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>, and a diet pepsi and the total without tip was 30.06. not too bad in vegas standards. i did not try any wine but they had a great wine selection from what i looked at. i really liked this place and will keep this on my list to go back as i continue to plan on going to vegas every year. this place gets big thumbs up from me. the atmosphere inside and out of the restaurant was great, food was great, and service was awesome. a great christmas eve lunch i'll never forget. i suggest it to anyone thinking about this place.\n__________________", 
            "great oysters? check. good bread? check. i got the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and it was done perfectly. throw in a guinness and i'm a happy camper. tasted my friend's <mark>Freshly Ground Ahi Tuna Burger</mark>, which was also very good. service was a little slow, but our waiter was training somebody, so... we sat on the patio and the weather was great; we were right on the border of the air conditioning inside and the heat outside. i'm sure that later at night it's fun too watch all the insanity of humanity in vegas walk past.", 
            "i am a vegas regular and i always make sure to include a stop at mon ami's every trip. my favorite is for their brunch - mmmmm so good! their frangria (the french take on sangria, i guess) is my personal favorite for morning after aches. i've had the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>, their grilled cheese and short rib sandwich, waffles, gabi salad and all have been absolutely delicious. oh, and don't get me started on the fresh baguette they bring to your table. man, that stuff is good! \n\nthe service is always wonderfully attentive and they sit you promptly for a saturday/sunday brunch. i've also been here for dinner and the steaks are amazing, especially with the sauces they offer. ooohh and don't forget, whatever you order, make sure to try their pomme frites - some of the best i've ever had!", 
            "i've never dined in paris before, but from what i would picture, this would be pretty close. mon ami gabi is such a cute french restaurant, and if you can get patio seating, it's pretty cool outside! i went for brunch with my family, so i'm not sure what dinner is like (hence 4 stars), but their service was excellent and the food was terrific.\n\nwe actually got patio seating at first, but then the day was so windy that we asked to be seated inside again. they still gave us a seat right next to the window, so the view was almost the exact same. =) \n\nwe ordered a cream of oyster soup with a hint of saffron and something else. it was really cute how they brought it out. the waitress carried out a huge shallow bowl and a kettle and poured the soup into the bowl from the kettle! what a unique way of keeping soup warm...at least that's the first time i've seen it like that! she also brought out 4 spoons for us to share the soup. and it's sharable, believe me. it was really yummy too, and i'm not an oyster fan. but the color of the soup was almost like it wasn't cream, but butternut squash puree or something. the consistency wasn't as chunky though, but it was light and filling. their french bread with the soup was a good pairing as well.\n\nmy mom got the chicken, spinach, and brie crepe and that thing was enormous! it was good too, but maybe could have been more savory. perhaps because brie isn't very salty as a cheese. my dad got the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>, which the server recommended over the leek and butternut squash quiche, and i'm glad she did because it really was good. it wasn't too dense, but of course i'm sure if my dad didn't share, it would have been overwhelming. and it wasn't just a slice either; it was an entire mini-quiche. i think this was my favorite. the cream + cheese and bacon and onions were amazing!\n\nmy sister got a chicken blt sandwich and it came with these waffle fries, which my mom and dad loved. i wasn't such a big fan because they were a little too oily for my liking, but they had a good crisp to them . her sandwich was really good though! and it was actually really filling too. i ordered a salmon...something with salad. haha and it was good, but i mean, how hard is it to mess up on salmon? the salad had a good dressing to it and it wasn't too overpowering.\n\noverall, it was a delightful and refreshing brunch with very nice servers! it also wasn't terribly overpriced. i think our total bill came to be a little less than $85. =)", 
            "mmmm...just looking at the pictures of the food we ordered still makes my tongue wag!\n\nfirst and foremost, i have got to thank all of the fellow yelpers for such an awesome find.  everything was absolutely delish!\n\nreservations is a must for this place regardless when you eat here because it's always crowded and the wait is super duper long.  i made my reservation 2 weeks prior to my trip to vegas for lunch at 12:30.  i have also requested outdoor patio seating but there's no guarantees with reservations, you would still have to wait.  the atrium room seating isn't bad at all.  on the afternoon that we went, it was crazy windy so trash was flying all over the place and onto people's food and into their cups. the atrium room is small but right up against the window behind the patio which if weather is permitting, you can definitely enjoy your food with the bellagio water show without the wind or trash blowing all over the place.\n\nthe service was impeccable.  our waitress was charming and had a great sense of humor.  she was super patient with us and accommodated us to the best that she can.  if we had questions, she answered honestly and didn't pressure us into ordering bad or pricey.\n\nfor our lunch, we ordered the french onion soup, soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> (parsnip and roasted garlic), porcini mushroom soup, sea <mark>Scallops Gratinees</mark>, steak frites with brandy peppercorn, sandwich <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> (open faced sandwich with sliced roast beef with micro greens and poached egg), and <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>.  all of the food we ordered was absolutely yumm.  there is no complaint here!  we also ordered from the wine cart they have.  it's a cart filled with a selection of red and whites and you can have a mini tasting from which ever wine is being offered.  our waitress was very generous with the pouring and for $8 per glass depending on the wine is well worth it.\n\nthis has definitely becoming a must for us everytime we play in vegas!", 
            "where else in las vegas can you sit outside and feel the ac while the people on the street are walking in 115 degree weather. \n\nstarted out greeted by a great waitress. i forgot her name but she was very kind the whole time. water was always refilled, she was very personable and went above and beyond just asking us how our day was. she actually wanted to get to know us! \n\nwe had the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>. omg! this was one of the best quiches i have ever had! it wasn't a slice but it was the whole pie! it was very good sized and the crust was so flaky. the egg wasn't overpowering and had great flavor. the good thing i like about this was that the bacon was thick cut! *drools* around $12.00\n\nthe crab salad was allright. it was served open faced or with one piece of bread. it tasted fresh but wasn't anything super duper special. real crab thou. around $14.00\n\nthe bread they give you in the beginning is really cute. it comes wrapped in mon ami gabi paper and is a delicious fresh baked french baguette. \n\ngreat view of the bellagio and you can people watch! around $30 for 2 people for lunch not too bad at all.", 
            "another trip to vegas mean another stop at mon ami gabi. i just can't get enough of this place. the food was just as good as before, but the service was ehh this time around. i missed the waitress from before. our waiter this time around was here and there but no connection. \n\nas always, we had the french onion soup, a small salad, and the liver platter. the french onion soup was just how i remember it to be. hot and gooey from the melted cheese and warming with caramelized onions and the broth. the starter salad was just mixed greens with a light vinaigrette. simple yet tasty. the liver platter was a first and it did not disappoint. you get a generous slice of <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark>. it comes with sliced crusty french baguette and pickled mini onions and gherkins. it doesn't taste like <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark> at all. it's very soft and creamy in texture. \n\nfor our group's entrees, we had the mussels that was steamed in white wine, burger <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>: open face duck burger stuffed with cheese, open faced ham and cheese sandwich, chicken and apple crepe, the ever so <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>, and scallops. the mussels was fresh and delicious. it was great with the baguettes to soak up all the sauce. the burger <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> was not up to par as before. it was really gamey and needed something to counter balance that taste. but it was good nonetheless, if you like gamey duck. the opened faced ham and cheese was just good. you get a lot of the gooey cheese if you love cheese. it had a comfort food feeling attached to it. the scallops was not as big as the previous visit and it seemed a little bit overcooked this time around. the apple crepe was gigantic. it's a mix of savory and sweet. the chicken the the sliced granny smith apples goes really well together along with the white alfredo sauce. it's definitely bigger than the normal crepes you can get at the crepe stand inside paris. the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> was just like the previous time, wonderfully eggy. \n\neverything was just soo yummy. i think we came in with high expectations from last time so we were a little bummed. it's still nice to see the water show from bellagio across the street every 15 minutes tho!  see you in a few months...", 
            "i have been wanting to eat at mag rest ever since i drove by it back in the days, finally we decide to eat here for valentine's weekend since we were in town. we are seated in the pavilion which was really nice and fun (very romantic too), reminds me of dubai restaurants. i ordered the french onion soup which i am dying to try; it was very good, but i honestly don't think it was the best i have had, maybe it was my cup, but there was really a lot of cheese, i mean do not get me wrong, i love cheese, but there was almost more cheese than onion broth!!!! i swear i could feel my thighs expand with each spoon of cheesy soup!!! for lunch entree i had the warm chicken & bree sandwich which was ok!! nothing out of the ordinary. my husband ordered the cream of mushroom (i think thats the name) which was delicious. and for lunch he had the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> which was really really really buttery. my husband is not a difficult man to please when it comes to food. he never leaves a plate with food on it.  today was the first time seeing him barely touch his plate! i am not sure if it was the eggs or the butter or the crust being even triple buttered as well, it just was not good! you can say that i am a harsh critic, but my god my husband didn't finish it!!! i could not even swallow the bite i tried!!!! i had high hopes after reading all the yelp reviews! i wish it was better, maybe the steak would have been a safer order which was his original thought but poor thing he figured he would try something different!!! love the bread stick though and the atmosphere.", 
            "my friends & i came to vegas to reunite & celebrate our five years of friendship that began in france.  well, what better place to celebrate than a french cafe.  we went for lunch and enjoyed our <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>, french bread, and waters.  the spinach on the side was to die for.  service was great.  we were a bit dehydrated from our flights & going out the night before and were chugging the water.  our waiter must have filled each of our glasses 5-6 times.", 
            "what i loved about this place is that, when i had breakfast at street side, we were able to escape the smoke-filled casino and the bustling pace of the city.  we were just able to calm down and enjoy a nice breakfast.\n\ni ordered a green omelette with spinach and gruyere cheese.  my friends ordered <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and eggs benedict.  the eggs benedict was the best dish of the three.  the other two items were kind of lacking in flavor.  cost of entrees for breakfast runs between $8 and $15.  definitely not bad!\n\nquality of the food was merely okay...everything was good, but nothing was impressive.  regardless, the location was great and our server was pretty sweet.   but because nothing really impressed me, i don't know if i'd come back to put down more money for lunch and dinner entrees.  but it's a cool place to come for breakfast....and to escape the strip without leaving it.", 
            "on a perfectly mild sunny day in vegas, it was a great choice to eat on the patio at mon ami gabi overlooking las vegas blvd. as soon as we entered the restaurant from the casino entrance, from the dark interior, it was like stepping into a whole different world once we got seated on the patio. \nusually when servers rattle off the specials of the day, it goes out the other ear for me. but after looking over the menu and half heartedly deciding on the spinach and gruyere omlette, i heard the server mention bacon and spinach eggs benedict and i was sold! <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> with bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=4ua39hrezlvlybef3ep_ew for the dude and my friend got the dish i was thinking of originally http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=5luau0skumjsvfxbalxsmq. we all agreed that my dish ended up being the best: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=t3jpsme56xcetgtqjegttw.\nthe quiche had a nice crust, but was kind of monotonous. (i love breakfast sides and this had none). the spinach omelette was ok- i enjoyed my omelette at max brenner much more. \ni've only had eggs benedict a few times elsewhere and i have to say this one was very yummy- the eggs were perfectly runny and the bacon (i believe it was applewood) was nice and crispy. \nwe were too sweets wasted this time to order the pancakes, french toast etc, so next time i would like to try those or the steak dishes with a side of their onion soup!", 
            "brunch here was great! a little bit pricey, but portions are huge so it's worth the money.\n\nyum: \n<mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> - light and fluffy with a perfectly thin and buttery crust.\n\ncrab cake eggs florentine- good amount of crab, egg cooked perfectly, overall very yummy.\n\nhashbrowns- crispy and brown on the outside, soft and potato-ey inside...perfect!\n\nbread- exactly how french bread should be.\n\nbloody mary bar! build your own with as many olives/pickled veggies as you want! fyi: all vodka is the same price and they have 4 or 5 options.\n\nmeh: \ncroque madame with an over-easy egg-- more over than easy. but the bread was to die for!\n\nwe also had a great view of the bellagio from the patio.  the wait can take a while, but it's worth it. can't wait to come back!", 
            "after walking the strip for quite some time in the mid-morning hours, i was damn hungry. mon ami gabi looked pretty cute - all french and proper - but they didn't seem to mind when hubs and i rolled up in our workout gear hoping to get a table and some breakfast. \n\nthe patio was a considerable wait, so we elected sit indoors (which ended up being only 2 feet from the open doors/patio. hey - we could still see some street performers and a few walks of shame. fine by me.\n\nthe service was most excellent and efficient to boot. i went with the lemon pancakes - a giant, but very thin, lemony crepe like pancake with strawberries and a hefty side of fresh whipped cream. hell. yeah. the pancake was delicious yet light and the strawberries were uber fresh. i also nabbed a few bites of hubs' <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> - also a delightful, rich and tasty choice. the one food item i wasn't crazy about was the chicken sausage. normally i'd down that in 30 seconds flat, but these particular links had an odd spice combo to them...paprika? i don't know, but i didn't dig it. \n\nprice wise, mon ami gabi is quite fair - especially for the high quality and portions. next time i'm in vegas, i'll definitely head back here for breakfast!", 
            "best restaurant in las vegas.  period.  \n\nthe service is amazing.  the food is wonderful.  \"<mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>\" is a french dish with simple ingredients, eggs, bacon & onion, but i have to say \"it's the best thing i ate in vegas\".  \n\ndont forget to make reservation.  anyway, if you live or visit vegas, you don't want to miss this awesome restaurant.", 
            "review is for breakfast.\n\ni wanted quiche for breakfast and we just happened to be near this restaurant.  since it was french i figured they'd serve decent quiche.  decent?  hell yeah!  it was the best <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> i have ever had!  creamy, flavorful, and a crust to die for!  i've been around a few years so i know my quiche.  my husband had the ham & cheese omelette - holy cow - another creamy winner!  the white toast is really their amazing rustic french bread - wow.. deelish!  we were seated within 5 minutes at 10:30am on a sunday with a view of the bellagio fountains to entertain us while we dined.  the menu says the oj is \"fresh squeezed\" but it's really not squeezed from an orange just before you get it.  it's tropicana-like \"fresh squeezed\" ... clearly a difference.  \n\nwe liked our breakfast so much that we went back two days later.  i had the spinach & green vegetable omelette (fab!) and my husband had the corned beef hash w poached eggs (very flavorful!).  i got the hashed browns that time and was pleasantly surprised to discover beautiful caramelized onions mixed in.  oh so flavorful.\n\ncoffee - some of the best my husband's had.\nservice - outstanding\nambiance - terrific\nstrip location - on the strip, facing the bellagio fountains at paris.\nprice - incredibly reasonable!  no different than what you'd pay at a decent breakfast chain (not denny's, but more like a mimi's cafe).\n\nwe will be back!",

            "kalani's birthday weekend was coming to an end.  we shared our last meal in vegas at mon ami gabi.  breakfast in paris, lunch back home in hawaii.  why not?\n\nwe started at the \"make your own bloody mary bar\".  funny how our outings usually begin and end at a bar, but i digress...   for 10 bucks you choose your vodka, they bring a generous pour in a tall glass and over to the \"bar\" you go.  there are mixers both spicy and mild, olives of all kinds, celery, beef sticks, pickled veggies, and horseradish to name a few options.  don't like your drink, blame the bartender...\n\nfor breakfast we had slow roasted beef eggs benedict, loved the creamy hollandaise sauce over the braised short ribs.  <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> with bacon cheese and onions.  corned beef hash with poached eggs and a roasted red pepper sauce completed our meal,  we all enjoyed the entrees, but liked the bloody marys more.\n\nall in all a good breakfast.  we arrived just in time and got to sit on the patio by the windows.  pretty funny watching the stragglers from the night before head back to their hotels early in the morning...  the view was priceless and made us remember days gone by.  au revior, mes amis!...thanks for sharing your birthday weekend, it was a blast!", 
            "while it could be a challenge to be an early riser in vegas, breakfast here (7 a.m. to 11 a.m.) was well worth the trade on sleeping in. so much, in fact, i started my day here twice on my last visit to vegas.\n\npart un: a rather large croissant sandwich with egg, tomato, avocado, turkey and just the right amount of mayo. though i barely had room left, i also tried the fruit salad--delicious with mango, pineapple and grape, and yogurt and brown sugar on the side. while it set me back another $10 or so, it was hard not to indulge in a mimosa while enjoying the bellagio fountain view and the bustling strip just off the patio (they also offered bloody marys and a rolling wine cart among other morning libations).\n\npart deux: <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>, light and savory with bacon, cheese and chive. (it was hard to say no to the mimosa this time.)\n\nin both cases, service was prompt, friendly and seemed effortless.\n\nit looks like dinner here would be a hit as well, and the ambience offered in the evening is lure enough next time i'm in town.",

            "i've always passed by mon ami gabi, thinking it was one of the more tourist-trappy restaurants on the strip.  i assumed they were serving sub-par food for astronomical prices just because you had a front patio view of the strip.\n\nlet me say it here and now: i stand corrected.  at mon ami gabi, i had the best <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> of my life.  the worst part?  i hadn't even ordered it.  it was my aunt's order and i had to just hope and pray that her tiny appetite would perform as normal and there would be lots left over for me to devour. \n\nstrangely enough, even the red cabbage-frisee-<mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> with the house dressing that came with the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> was outstanding as well, to the point that i asked the staff if i could have the recipe for the house vinaigrette (and i don't even normally go for kale).\n\ni ordered the eggs benedict and, truthfully, they weren't the best i've ever had, but they weren't bad by any standard.  what can i say?  i had that quiche on the brain and nothing compared.\n\nthe atmosphere is as you would expect facing the strip, however if you happen to have your back to the strip, you might--just might--forget you're in vegas and think you're sitting in a paris bistro.  until you see the hungover frat boys plop down at the table next to you and an overweight couple in visors and fanny-packs plop down at the table on the other side of you.\n\nthe staff is friendly and helpful for the most part, and when i asked for the recipe for the vinaigrette, they came back from the kitchen with a little form asking for my name, email address, and what recipe i wanted (i threw in a request for the quiche while i was at it) and the chef would email me soon.\n\noverall, i can't wait to go back, maybe for something else (the blueberry waffles looked amazing), but probably for the quiche!", 
            "i've been wanting to try out this place for awhile, and finally did during my last trip to vegas. maybe we just didn't order the right things, but my bf and i weren't that impressed.\n\nwe came for brunch and ordered the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and the corned beef hash. the quiche was cooked well, but it was too much of one thing and i couldn't finish it. i was expecting several small pieces of crispy bacon, but ended up with some big chunks of fat. i didn't try the corned beef hash, but my bf said it didn't taste the way he expected.\n\nservice was okay. our waiter didn't check on us quite enough, but did his job. i expected a nicer atmosphere, but for some reason it didn't seem that nice. the place seemed too cramped and busy. maybe it would've been different if we sat outside with a view of the bellagio fountain.\n\noverall, i wasn't that impressed by this place, but i'm willing to come back again to try out other dishes.", 
            "hands down the best quiche i have ever had .. and i've eaten alot of quiche. it melts in  your mouth. <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> mmm. \n\nthe restaurant is beautiful. although certain spots were a little cramped.", 
            "good food, great service, outstanding views! \n\ni've come here every time i've been to vegas and have tried every possible meal from breakfast to a late dinner. the best time to enjoy gabi's is at nighttime: the bellagio fountains will be going off every 20 or so minutes, the strip will be packed, and the patio cool and pleasant even in the summer months. however it can get crowded in the evening so if you want to sit outside be prepared to wait for 20 or so minutes and get a reservation in advance. i've come here with a friend once without reservations and was told there would be more than an hour wait to get a seat anywhere on a saturday night. since the restaurant is so versatile it's hard to recommend 1 or 2 dishes in particular so it's probably best to list the highlights by meal:\nbreakfast: croque madame or the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>. help yourself to some champagne too, it's vegas\nlunch: chilled zapacho, <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>, and the trout amandine are all great. on friday they serve an australian cod which is brilliant\nbrunch: do yourself a favor and order a french 75. it's no longer on the menu but they make the best in town. add in the eggs benedict and it'll rival bouchon for the best french-themed brunch in vegas.\ndinner: the <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> is the best deal for an appetizer. 50 dollars for a whole lobster, oysters, tuna tartare, shrimp and even more. follow that up with the steak bearnaise or roquefort and finish up with profiteroles accompanied by cognac. be careful: the calories will add up but it will have been well worth it.", 
            "reasonable prices for outstanding french food! \n\nstopped by here for lunch before we headed out for the drive home. everything on the menu sounds so good and you will not be disappointed with whatever you decide to order. we were seated outside and even though it was over 90 degrees outside we didn't mind because they gave us such a good view. our table was right across from the bellagio fountains so we were able to enjoy the show while we ate lunch. \n\ni couldn't decide between a quiche and a burger. since the restaurant is a french steakhouse i wanted to try something french, but at the same time i imagined that their burgers would be delicious as well, being a steakhouse and all. after a lot of pondering, my friend and i decided to share a cheeseburger and their <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>. \n\nthe food was so amazingly delicious i would drive to vegas right now to eat there if i could. first of all, they provide you with fresh french baguettes as you wait for your food. they are still soft and warm when they bring it out to you and it's so yummy with their whipped butter. the cheeseburger was very juicy and flavorful, not greasy at all! their hand-cut frites were pretty interesting too. it was like a cross between a fry and a potato chip but it was good. the quiche was a lot bigger than i expected it to be and i don't think i would've been able to finish the whole thing by myself. it's the size of a small plate but the quiche is so light and fluffy that you'll finish half of it before you know it. i really liked the bacon that the used in it too since the bacon chunks were big enough where you can taste the smokiness and have some of the texture too. \n\nour waitress was super nice and gave my friend a free cocktail on the house along with an ice cream puff dessert for us to share. the cocktail was so yummy that i decided to get one for myself! it was their special cocktail for season? day? not sure, but it was very fruity and light. it was a mix of some type of champagne and st. germain which tasted amazing together!!", 
            "the strawberry waffle was buttery.  the eggs benedict was also great.  i had the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> which was light and delicious.  great view of the fountains at bellagio.", 
            "every time i've been in vegas, i've always eyed this cute little cafe that's right outside of the paris hotel & casino. this time, i had the time to stop by and made reservations on open table in advance! :)\n\nfyi, if you want to sit outside in the patio area, there's a separate waiting list (even if you've already made reservations) and that can take about 10-15 more min.\n\nambiance:\n-very intimate, cozy\n\nservice:\n-waiters/waitresses very great, very friendly and polite.. but it did take a while for me to get my coffee refills\n\nfood:\n-<mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>: really good! it's not just a slice of quiche, like most restaurants, but you get your whole mini-pie! definitely filled me up.. and i loved the cheese and the bacon pieces. \n\nvery cute place to grab some yummy brunch with some friends! :)", 
            "get the steak frites! \n\nit was the best thing i ate along with the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> which i thought was very bland. the steak frites was the perfect hearty meal for breakfast. go early and get a table outside so you can watch the people walking down the strip being drunk or take the walk of shame!", 
            "we arrived around 11 am for a leisurely saturday brunch on a sunny morning.  we were secretly hoping we could sit out on the beautiful open patio to soak up some vitamin d, but the 45-minute wait almost put the ravenous d and e over the edge.  thankfully, the patio waiting list is separate from the rest of the restaurant, and we walked right in and were seated immediately.\n\nthe front part of the restaurant near the host stand is quite dim, which could be intimate and romantic in the evening but was a bit of a downer for the morning.  which is why we were thrilled when were seated close to the glass window-ed atrium, adjacent to the patio.  our server was courteous and kind, bringing us extra brunch menus and then rounding up breakfast menus when we admitted we were hoping to get a late breakfast.  by the time we ordered, he had no qualms about all of us getting breakfast at 11:30, even though the kitchen technically stopped serving breakfast at 11.\n\nour table enjoyed beef hash (with poached eggs!), <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>, <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> eggs benedict and a mushroom omelette.  the hash brown potatoes served with the egg dishes were crispy, light and simply one of the best we've had.  i was surprised by the light custard texture of my <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and enjoyed the chewy chunks of bacon.  however, 3/4 of the way through, i found the rich flavors a bit overwhelming.  the fresh and lightly dressed frisee was an excellent side to my quiche.  maybe the quiche was just too big of a portion for me?\n\nd and e would not stop talking about their beef hash.  they were clearly in love with their dishes.  the coffee was tasty, and the warm crusty baguette they served us while we waited for our dishes was such a relief for our growling bellies.  they amply refilled our bread supply and included a great jam to spread on top.  i tucked the rest of the baguette in my purse as a snack, since they bring the baguette to your table in a paper sleeve, as if it came straight from the farmers market! \n\nthough the interior is quite upscale and nice, there were a good number of families with kids and casual diners to keep the atmosphere from feeling too stuffy. :p", 
            "we were lucky enough to get a table on the patio. the rest of the restaurant is quite dark, but the sunroom is also really nice if there's no space on the patio.\n\nwe were here for brunch/lunch, so i ordered the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>. my friends shared the escargot, and had the <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>, <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>, and chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>.\n\neverything tasted great, but didn't wow us. like most french food, everything was quite rich, so it was a pretty heavy lunch. i loved the fries; they were thin and crunchy.\n\nwe also shared a pitcher of frangria, which was quite strong (we're not huge red wine drinkers), but with some added lime juice it tasted much better.\n\nwould love to come back to try their steak.", 
            "i've been wanting to try this place for years now ever since the cute name (and exterior) caught my attention. and i was able to this year after my mom finally agreed that we could have breakfast/brunch there before we left vegas and headed back home to la. i am so glad we were able to squeeze it in! i called the night before at 11:59 pm (a minute before closing time) to make reservations for 11:30, and the lady was friendly.\n\nwe arrived early, but were quickly seated with no hassle. i asked for a seat outside and to my surprise, that was easy enough although the place was very crowded already. we were seated at the edge of the outside patio by the sidewalk. but after about 15 minutes or so, the direct sunlight became unbearable for some of our party of four. so when another outside table by us that had more shade opened up, we asked if we could move and the service was prompt. we noticed that a few minutes afterward, several tables also wanted to move because the sunlight started shining directly on many of the seats. \n\nwe each got different dishes, and they were all so delicious and tasty. my dad, who was paying for the bill, thought that the prices were reasonable for the portions. i was delightfully surprised by his comment because he typically doesn't feel portions are big enough for him to be satisfied. haha. he had an omelette and pointed out that the pieces of turkey were uniform throughout his omelette (as in there were pieces in every bite) -- even the thinner parts, which he said is a detail that is typically not the case at diner omelettes. hah. the omelette was as long as the plate and came with hash browns and slices of bread. \n\nmy mom (and i as well) loved the complimentary baguette that was provided a bit after we sat down. so fresh and just perfect texture! it came with jam and butter too. i tried a few bites of my sister's <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and it was so light and fluffy as quiche should be! it came with a small side of salad, which she said as simple as it was, tasted really good. i got the holiday special of eggs benedict with braised beef instead of ham after the waiter recommended it. delicious! quite possibly the best eggs benedict i've had. the homemade muffin was perfect -- crispy edges and softer center, and melt-in-your-mouth eggs. i could have had more beef, but it wasn't so little that i would complain out loud about the amount. still very fulfilling, especially with the side of hash browns that the egg dishes come with.\n\nthe juice and tea was quite pricey to me at ~$4 each for a pretty small glass. but they're freshly squeezed and thus, refreshing as well. i was satisfied with my grapefruit juice while my dad ordered orange juice and my mom got hot tea (it was organic and came with lemon). \n\ni would love to come back for another visit. their scallops and steak seem amazing. yum.", 
            "ahhhh a little it of heaven during our trip to vegas!\n\nfood was delicious, service was amazing, and ambiance was soooo relaxing. \n\nsat outdoors during a cool day and wanted a great meal. mon ami gabi delivered for sure. our server was one of those ladies that looked like she spread sunshine when she walked. she was a little older and her smile was infectious. i wish i remembered her name because she really made the dining experience as fantastic as it was.\n\nwe began our meal with a fresh warm baguette and soft butter. fresh warm bread really is the way to start out a meal.\n\nordered the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and the classic burger. the quiche was huge! i was expecting a tiny sized quiche but it was delicious and satisfying. the classic burger was cooked just to my liking. they even put some of their handcut fries in the burger. yum. \n\nambiance - sit outdoors if you can. the music from the bellagio fountain show can be heard across the street and even though it was a bit chilly outside - the heat lamps kept us warm.\n\ni will definitely come eat here again next time i'm in vegas.",

            "we had an amazing breakfast at mon ami gabi....so good that there was no question we would return for breakfast again the next morning! i used the open table app on my phone to make reservations and it was easy to alter them if we woke up earlier or later in the morning. i do recommend reservations or going before 9am to avoid a wait. sitting outside is great, but there are also lots of seats on the patio where you are still basically outside. the inside decor is a little dark so it would be fine for evening dining, but not ideal for breakfast. there is no wait for breakfast inside though so if i was hungry, i'd go for it!\n\ni had the scrambled egg platter both mornings. eggs cooked perfectly, shredded hash browns, and toasted thick bread. one morning i had bacon, which was the thickest cut bacon ever and was delicious. the other day i opted for sausage, which was great too. my husband had the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and an omelet on our second trip and was very happy with his meals too. \n\nservice was excellent from the hostess to the manager, servers, etc. everyone was incredibly friendly. the coffee mugs were tiny, which concerned me, but our mugs were literally refilled every few minutes....it was amazing! i felt the prices were reasonable for vegas and for the two of us we paid $30-$40 total. if we had been in vegas longer, i would have loved to try their lunch or dinner.", 
            "i forgot something: mon ami gabi has some pretty mighty portions. the dishes are pretty hard to finish on your own, so either share or bring a mighty appetite or prepare to take food back to your hotel. \n\nlast time we didn't dine in, so we didn't know that they gave a loaf of warm, crusty baguette. it was very good. i wish we had dined in last time because i really like warm crusty bread.\n\nfriend got the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and she only finished half of it. i tried a bit and it was delicious. i got a <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> and it was huge and came with a mountain of ridiculously addicting fries. the only reason i ate those fries was because they tasted like potato chips. boyfriend got the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> and then i instantly regretted putting in my own order because his was ridiculously good and it was hard for him to finish anyways. \n\nnext time i'm sharing.", 
            "gatsby-esque dining by the pavilion area. hmm, chocolate-hazelnut waffle, eggs florentine, lemon pancakes or <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>? options like these, it had my foodie mojo pumped. but the high wore off into a malaise as i got into the second hour. but is it the restaurant's fault, or my wife's?\n\nwe finished our breakfast, but as implied, my wife wanted more. could the brioche be better at the \"paris las vegas\" than it is back home? verdict: brioche really not that good, really didn't melt in my mouth like really fluffy versions of it do. not nearly good as good as los angeles or san francisco standards. plus, because of my wife, i had to wait 40 extra minutes for order, eat and exit. drove me nuts. is there a wisdom to be gained here? such as: don't let wife order extra meal. i dunno, i'm so over \"paris.\" but put on \"funny face\" (1957) with audrey hepburn on my dvd and i'm enchanted with life all over again. #crabbywhiteguy", 
            "first off the food was delicious, but secondly our service was phenomenal.\n\nmy friends and i dined at mon ami on a tuesday morning (about 11 am). we were seated in an area that was kind of outside, but also inside (because they had all the glass windows open to the outside dining area). i was quite pleased with out seating because it afforded us a view of the outside, but kept us from the literal \"street-view\" of the strip. \n\nour server was a congenial lovely woman who definetely has a knack for serving and making her guests feel at ease. throughout the entire meal she refilled coffees, brought diet pepsis out without us having to ask, and truly made an effort to romanticize our lovely french dining experience.\n\nwe started our meal with the escargot, which were swimming in a potent pesto and garlic sauce. the snails' texture was spot-on, not chewy, simply a good mouth-feel, and the garlic, while very prevalent, added to the escargot, it did not distract.\n\nmy onion soup was served with the appetizer and i was fairly happy with the soup. i thought though it had a bit too much of a sweet taste for my liking. the crouton and cheese ratio was a bit off, with there being a just a *tad* too much cheese. i almost felt bad leaving some of it in my cup, but i had really had enough of it as i got toward the end of the cup.\n\nas for my main dish i stuck with a classic - <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>. the flavors were mixed well - not too much of any ingredient, and the crust was classic - flaky, but not too crunchy or over-baked. perfect for a quiche. the quiche around the outside was a bit dry, but as you moved inward it became a much better mix of eggs and cheese. \n\ni ended with the chocolate mousse - a refreshingly light dessert, yet it is chocolate so it has that little bit of decadence you want with a dessert. it has little crunchy kit-kat like chocolate balls on top of it and is served with some amazing whipped cream on the side. i also sampled my friend's chocolate tart and believe me, that dessert is absolutely worth every penny. i sampled the bananas foster from my other friend's plate that too was absolutely delicious.\n\noverall i must say mon ami had good food with just a few minor flaws, but the pristine service made up for it. 5 stars indeed.", 
            "came back, because i have fallen in love with this place, and will come every time i am in vegas.  i had the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> this time, and wow!!!!!!  ohhhh so amazing!! the hubby had the blue berry waffle/pancake (can't remember) but i do remember it being amazing!! soooooo blueberry -eeeee and made well.  they offered to send us with coffee to go!! they are the best!!", 
            "boyfriend had specifically requested that we go \"somewhere breakfasty\" thursday morning when we were in vegas, so i hopped onto yelp and came up with mon ami gabi.\n\nwhen we walked up to the hostess, we were informed that there was a 15 minute wait to be seated outside, but that there was no wait to be seated indoors. naturally, both of us feeling starved, we decided to sit indoors. it was starting to get hot outside anyway. so i'm a little surprised when i'm handed the blue electronic seating buzzer thing and told that i can't walk past the indoor bridge with it because of the range. what? i thought there wasn't a wait! but whatever. boyfriend and i explored for about 10 minutes before our buzzer went off.\n\nour hostess then promptly led us to our seats... on the outdoor patio. i'm so confused at this point, but the heat really isn't as bad as we thought it would be, and we have a beautiful view of the bellagio fountains, so i can't exactly complain. i ordered the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and i'm pretty sure boyfriend ordered the warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>.\n\nthe quiche was the size of my face! and boyfriend's sandwich looked very yummy. we each also got a beer. i think my favorite part of the meal, though, were the hand-cut fries. sliced so thin so as to almost be chips, each fry was like that super-special, extra-crispy fry from mcdonald's everyone fought for. you know what i'm talking about.\n\nit was a tad pricey (~$50 for lunch for both of us after tip), but i think it was worth it to try such a highly-rated restaurant on the strip.", 
            "since we were staying at paris, we decided to try this always crowded restaurant for brunch. we were able to make reservations on open table just in case, and walked in 15 minutes before our reservation as we were starving. i would have liked to wait for the outdoor seating, but my friend prefers indoors so we had a nice table near the outdoor dining area. much brighter than the area when you first walk into. the restaurant is much larger than i had expected, and we were seated at a nice table that sat 4 for the 2 of us.\n\nthey gave us a fresh baguette with butter, very delicious, and didn't tear up the roof of my mouth. we decided to get a butter lettuce/argula salad as we needed some veggies from our fatty weekend. all the sandwiches looked tempting, but i had been on an earls binge, so i opted for the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>, and my friend had the chicken and brie crepe.\n\nour server was very attentive and offered a refill on our mimosas, but sadly we declined. could get 10 of those for the same price at the casino! :) mimosa was great though, would definitley recommend. salad was light and refreshing, and their chickpea croutons were superb. my quiche was perfect, a very good size (medium pizza size) and the egg was creamy and delicious. the crepe was a bit too healthy for me, a wheat type of concoction, but my friend thoroughly enjoyed it. the best part had to be the addition of the french fries. i had read they were like potato chips and they really were. so thin and crispy, anyone who loves crispy fries would love it. they also gave me a lemon aoili and stone ground mustard since i don't eat ketchup.\n\nthere was an annoying fly that wouldn't let us enjoy our meal as much as we would have liked to as we had to keep swatting it away. for the price, everything was fantastic, and i would dine here again as their prices of their steak are very fair as well.", 
            "this was our first meal after landing in vegas.  we had a 7:10 am flight, got up stupid early, parked, battled the sleepy crowds at sfo, got on a flight full of cranky flight attendants who insisted that we sat where we were ticketed (despite an empty row in front and behind our packed, 3 seated row).  arrived in vegas all sleepy-eyed, throbbing headache, and slightly confused.\n\nafter wandering down the strip in the rain, in the cold, i realized we were close to this place, and i convinced the fiance that we needed to eat here.  i made a reservation on my phone using opentable (yay for having a less-dumb phone now), and we trekked it over here.\n\ni am so glad that most of the restaurants in the casinos understand that cigarette smoke + fine dinning = piece of poop, in experience, taste, texture, and consistency.  that is why this place has one door that opens into the casino, it's small, and lets in as little cigarette smoke as possible.\n\nthe first meal here was a croque madame, <mark>Chicken Liver Mousse Pate</mark>, and <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>.  reading the reviews on yelp, i was expecting european portions.  it was not.  it was full on middle america portions.  \n\nmy croque madame had a fried egg on top of two thick slices of smooth white bread, topped with at least 6 slices of salty, flavorful ham, and caressed with cheese.  the fried egg was delicious.  as i cut into the runny yolk, the golden butter-like consistency flowed over the already scrumptious ham and cheese and bread stack and encased the whole thing in a put-me-in-your-mouth, stop thinking and just chew!\n\nthe fiance's quiche was home made.  the crust was light.  the filling had identifiable chunks of onion, ham, and whatever else is suppose to go in there.  the fries were kind of poo though.  too thin, like shoe laces.  wide, but thin.  it was like eating chips.  \n\nthe second meal was the filet mignon.....but i'll save that for my follow up review because i gotta shower and get to work now.", 
            "i'm waffling on this one (ha! get it?...it's 'cause...it's 'cause they serve waffles here...).  my fiancee and i went here twice in the same weekend, and the two visits could not have polarized me more on this place.\n\nthe first time was for breakfast with a large group.  we were seated on the patio, but not at a table with a good view of the bellagio fountain (which is fine by me, because i really have no interest watching water squirt in the air while i'm eating).  it was either due to the promise of 18% gratuity or in spite of that fact that throughout the entire meal we got excellent service.  the food did take a while to come out, but i chalked that up to the large group.\n\nthat meal i got the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>...and oh dear was that a surprise.  i don't typically like quiche, as my fiancee can attest to (she was surprised i ordered it to begin with), but there was something special about this one.  the flavor was just amazing, and it was nice and soft and moist on the inside, despite looking burnt on the outside.  my better half got a croissant breakfast sandwich, which wasn't bad but i didn't really think it was anything special.\n\nso naturally after a good experience we came back a second morning...and we should have just left well enough alone.  the food was good: she got a repeat of the quiche which she said wasn't as good though i thought the quality didn't dip that much; i got the steak classique and french onion soup, both of which i enjoyed (although it wasn't my favorite cut of steak, but i realize that cut could be standard for french cuisine, i don't really know).\n\nthe problem was the service...or lack thereof.  our server was inattentive at best, and most of the time it felt like he considered us a bother more than a customer (we aren't annoying, finger-snapping snobs, i swear).  whenever we asked for a refill on water or iced tea his response was a curt \"sure\"...not a friendly \"sure\", a \"sure\" that made it sound like we interrupted his day.  i know i'm coming across as snooty and paranoid, but it really was quite bad.  half the time he spent standing directly behind our table, chatting up another server, ignoring us and the table next to us in the process.  and again, he wasn't busy with other guests, we knew where he was, which was neglecting his job.\n\nthe four stars is for the first visit, because i will give this place the benefit of the doubt.  don't let one bad apple spoil the bunch, as they say...people say that, right?  i may come back one day, though it will be with a wary disposition, which is not a light any restaurant should cast over itself.", 
            "we ate here for lunch based on yelp reviews-- we wanted somewhere unique to the area, inexpensive, and yummy-- and this fit the bill!! \nwe both ordered frangria- it was a great, inexpensive fruity option that paired well with lunch. we also ordered the tapenade appetizer because i am a sucker for olives- it was great, but so is the crusty french bread that you get complimentary, so an appetizer isn't a must.\ni had the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>, which was delicious and a giant portion. my husband had the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>, which he also really liked, and those little crispy fries it comes with are fantastic. \nit was a lot of food- so much that we only had an appetizer and dessert later on in lieu of dinner. price was good, there wasn't a wait, no complaints here! we will definitely back next time we're in vegas.", 
            "loved it! we came twice.\n\nbreakfast: good <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>, fluffy egg omelet & nice view if you sit in the indoor patio. \n\ndinner: awesome!!! we sat inside, it was very cozy with dim lighting.\n\nthey serve a warm baguette with creamed butter. for starters, we had the escargot. it was very good. my hubby had the soup special which was an oyster soup. it was amazing. it was creamy.. but not too much.. more like velvety. i had the duck leg confit & a side of fries for my meal. that was the best duck confit i've ever had in the u.s. the meat would just fall off the bone. my hubby had the <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark> & the <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark> which he said were very good. the waitress recommended a white chocolate bread pudding. it was served warm with ice cream.. very good too. \n\nthis place has great food, great service, nice atmosphere and a reasonable price. our dinner bill with a glass of bordeaux was $95. \n\ndefinitely make a reservation (i used open table).",

            "admittedly, have only eaten here for breakfast/brunch.  but we've had that meal here many, many times (this is one of the \"mandatory\" stops every time we're in lv).   staff has always been excellent, the place is very cute (we always try and eat on the patio) and the food delicious.   i *looooove* the skinny pancakes (cinnamon of course) and the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>.",

            "the food i had here was absolutely delicious. lemon skinny pancake and <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>. i expected the quiche to be either a slice or a small whole quiche but it was quite large and came with a lovely little green salad. \n\nwe sat on the indoor patio and didn't have to wait at all on sunday at 10:30. the service was nice (though a bit slow) and so was the view.", 
            "this place is a great location with a nice patio. the food is great quality for a good price. we went there for lunch and had the mushroom soup and baked brie for starters that were both outstanding. \n\ni had the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> as my main course. it wasn't my favorite but still good quality. if i were to go again i would likely order a crepe as that looked very good, especially the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> my dad ordered had a large portion of seafood with it and looked great.", 
            "some long-time friends brought us here for brunch after having raved about it for months, so we certainly had high expectations, and they were definitely met.\n\naside from the fact that you have to walk into the paris to get there, the restaurant is delightfully french-y and the service is excellent. the restaurant was super busy that saturday brunch, but our waitress was on top of everything and very friendly.\n\ni had a wonderful <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>, which was the whole quiche (!) and clearly cooked to order, which was a nice surprise. a tablemate had a burger, which he said was fantastic, and the wine list was shockingly reasonably priced.\n\nthe only downside was the overall price of the menu. i get that it's las vegas and it's on the strip, but we had just come le diplomate in washington, dc, which we also think is pricey, and even that seemed comparatively tame in comparison with lv's strip prices. but hey, it's still cheaper than the flight to france!", 
            "excellent french breakfast on the strip. i had the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> with a side of the best strips of bacon i have ever had in my life! my beautiful girlfriend had the waffles and a side of eggs. we paired all this up with coffee and macchiato. delicious and a great price for the quality and atmosphere. well done!", 
            "mon ami gabi, you do not make your food with love. your crusty baguette, in its tres cool paper sleeve, is obviously kept under a lamp, not freshly baked. your food is delivered to the table quickly & without any pageantry. perhaps your steaks are spectacular (as i've been told) but i'll never know because your french onion soup is mediocre & your <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> is overpowered by chewy bacon & lacks a buttery crust.\n\nyour patio is 5-stars wonderful, but can i get some quality eats to go along with my spectacular view of las vegas blvd, si vous plait?", 
            "we had lunch here with friends who were visiting. first, it was pricy...but expected, due to the strip location. the reason they get two stars is because the ambiance was lovely, service was just ok but the food quality was fairly lousy. the sangria was good as was the baguette they brought for appetizer. i ordered <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> (french restaurant, right? should be good). it was about 30 seconds from being burnt. it was so \"well-done\" the eggs were dried out. portion was very small considering it came with about six potato chips on the side for $14 or $15. my husband ordered <mark>Macaroni Gratin</mark>. it was also dry and flavorless. he sent it back and ordered a hamburger, specified no raw onions! it was cooked to order but raw onion on it and no condiments! the waiter dropped it and ran. never came back to check on us. finally had to grab another employee to get new lettuce and tomatoes that were contaminated by the onion and some condiments. not in any hurry to go back.", 
            "before hitting the road to return home, my family and i decided to have our final vegas meal here at mon ami gabi.  it was an adorable french style restaruant with an outside dining area that was identical to the parisian sidewalk cafes.  it was packed so we ended up sitting inside, which worked out well since we were hungry and had no time to waste waiting on an outdoor table.  the menu had a couple of different items that looked appetizing, such as salads and sandwiches, but i decided to order the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>.  when the food came out, my quiche looked fluffy and delicious. it tasted great and i had no complaints, but my sister was a different story.\n\nmy sister ordered the same thing as me, only her quiche was flat and over cooked.  when she cut it open the inside looked nothing like my fluffy, yellow, perfectly cooked pie.  she ended up sending it back and ordering another one, which was much better but still not quite on par with mine.  aside from the quiche issue and the fact that it took a while tor our food to be delivered, we enjoyed our time there.", 
            "went for lunch and we had the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and lobster roll. food was very good, and prompt. service was a bit slow, but tell yourself you are in europe and savor the longer experience. if weather is good, try to get the outside patio. you will get a view of the bellagio water show and lots of people watching on the strip. heads up that they not take reservations for the outside seating, indoor only, it is first come first serve.  also of note, they were offering a gluten free menu for those with allergies or sensitivity.  not sure what was on it, forgot to ask to see it, but it was listed on regular menu.", 
            "my husband and i went for lunch on a sunday.  had a beautiful table and the food was delicious!  we shared a carafe of their sangria;  i had the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and my husband had the steak classique.  would definitely go back!", 
            "i am so happy i had the chance to eat at mon ami gabi during my 1st trip to vegas. we arrived for brunch on a wednesday and waited only 15 mins for an outside table...perfect for people watching :) i ordered the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and it was delectable. super flaky crust and perfectly baked egg-custard inside. my tummy misses this dish! i'm excited to try dinner during my next trip.",

            "finding a place to eat at vegas can be such a pain sometimes. sure, there are lots of options everywhere. but how many of them actually serve a reasonable portion size at a reasonable price w/o hours of wait time? well, mon ami gabi is one of them.\n\nwe dropped by on a weekday afternoon as we were looking for some quick bites for a late lunch. we're glad we found this place! we were seated in their glass pavilion looking out to the strip. great location since we get the view w/o the smoke.\n\nwe ordered the maine lobster roll and the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and both came out above expectation. the lobster roll looks a little small but it's actually quite filling. the lobster was buttery and complemented well with the salad and the vinaigrette. there's nothing special about the fries and a little more lobster meat would have been nice. my wife loves quiche and this is one of the best she's ever had. that's high compliments from her.\n\noverall, this was a nice pit stop for us to refuel before continuing with our planned activities for the rest of the afternoon. still expensive but for vegas standard, it's pretty good.", 
            "mon ami gabi (literally \"my friend gabi\") is french enough to have a charming, inviting interior and some great food, but not so french that it pisses you right off.  this place hits the mark and the prices, even for vegas, are shockingly in the same zip code as \"reasonable.\"\n\nthe inside has dark paneling, flowers in vases, thoroughly-appointed place settings, and some rather corny overly-french signage (like \"au revoir\" over the exit haha).  the staff are hit and miss, but they do give it a good ole' college try.\n\nthe food is quite respectable, even if the menu offers a lot of items that just seem french-ish to most people rather than what you'd find in a parisian restaurant.  the crepes are excellent across the board, the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> is fluffy and decadent, and the breakfast dishes are delicious and filling.  on saturdays and sundays they offer a ridiculously-stocked bloody mary bar that is the perfect antidote to the ubiquitous vegas hangover.\n\nthere are some obviously vegas-like departures from french dining of course; our waiter for instance had badly chapped lips, stammered a lot while trying to remember the specials, and at one point wiped his nose with the back of his hand; all three of which are offenses that would get him fired on the spot from any decent eatery on the champs-\\u00c9lys\\u00e9es.  none of this was offensive to us, we're americans with perennially low expectations for vegas, and as i implied at the start: departure from 100% authentic french is not necessarily a bad thing.",

            "i think i've praised this place before.  this is the place to get brunch in vegas.  patio dining so you can people watch in the sun, an atrium for dining, then the dining room if you wanna sit in the shade. \n\ni love coming here for brunch for their varied menu: waffles, omelets, burgers, soups, etc.  the service here is quick and the food comes out pretty quickly.  \n\ni got the lobster bisque to start.  although it wasn't as creamy as i imagine bisques to be, it was definitely creamy and tasty. \n\nfor my meal i got the <mark>Freshly Ground Ahi Tuna Burger</mark>.  tons of avocado on top and the pomme frites were so crispy!  \n\nfor my dessert i shared the red velvet cake.  a drizzle of chocolate coated it and sour cream icecream topped it off.  delicious.  it was so rich it tasted almost savory. \n\nonce again, a treat to eat here.  you might want to make reservations though.  got here on saturday morning and they gave us a 20 minute wait time (2 people), it ended up being only 10 minutes though but you never know!", 
            "loved it! \n\n\n\nthe atmosphere was awesome - just sunlight and people talking. i felt like i was on vacation (i live in vegas) and it was just really really nice. michelle our server was beautiful and kind, attentive just one of those sorts that makes you feel comfortable and welcome. (ninety percent of anywhere on the strip fails at this with flying colors - or maybe i need a black card.) \n\nsuits were cool and got us seated too. bar tender was surprisingly nice to me even though i sat at his bar and didn't order a drink (only for five minutes, but still.)\n\nthe food was marvelous!!!! the food was excellent. my friend had the <mark>Freshly Ground Ahi Tuna Burger</mark> (win) and i had the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> salad (also a win.) the rest of our party ordered plenty of appetizers - which were all perfect. the duck (pardon me, i'm french food illiterate) with cherires was amazing, brie cheese, pat tae, oysters, etc. sadly my friend and i had to split early before everything else came out. \n\ni didn't feel all gross like i totally stuffed myself and we left talking with each other saying \"why don't we do this more often?!\" \n\ni will so be back!!! super relaxing and fun, great food and not terribly expensive.", 
            "love this place!!!! perfect location on the strip to enjoy the day/ night meal with a view. \n\n<mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> -big portion. a little bit dry and creamy for my taste. overall it was good.\n\n<mark>Freshly Ground Ahi Tuna Burger</mark> - this was really good. big burger. love the wasabi mayo on it. tuna was cooked medium rare. perfecto!!!!! \n\ndeduct 1 star for service. it seemed like the host hate her job.... the waiter was way too busy but he tried....", 
            "(edited on 11/17/12)\n\ni have been there about 7 times. i like to sit outside - to watch bellagio fountain show. \n\nfood quality wise, you can't compare to robuchon or bouchon - mon ami gabi is a french version of denny's. that's for sure. or maybe worse... \n\ni've had <mark>Freshly Ground Ahi Tuna Burger</mark> and bacon cheese burger - nothing special, nothing better than burgers at hard rock cafe.\n\ni've had <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> - it is ok. seafood is not fresh. could be using frozen seafood.\n\ngratin - greasy - heavy - rich - if you like to gain fat, this should be fine. i am worried if someone get heart attack. \n\ntrout - i remembered it was no good. \n\nfish and chips - very thin sliced fish make it pretty greasy. kinda same as one at todd english at aria. (it was my fault to get fish&chips at french bistro, yo know)\n\n(newly edited) \n\ni used to like all their mousse and pate - along with oysters to pair with wine - with a great fountain view. however, i went back and it was a huge disappointment.\n\njumbo <mark>Shrimp Cocktail</mark> - when the server put the dish on our table, something was wrong - shrimps looked kinda brown - we thought it was some sort of spices,,, then as soon as we ate it, we realized that it was an unfresh, oxidized shrimp! it tasted like dirt. horrible! i'm sure they use the same old shrimps for other dishes. gross!\n\nliver mousse and pate - i guess no one orders these items here - i could tell because all the edges were all dried out - pretty disgusting. \n\n<mark>Endive & Blue Cheese Salad</mark> - it is not a great experience to have green leaves turn brown and wilt. \n\nmussels - bad,,,,, they didn't break my expectation. not fresh! at this point, i was concerned about food poisoning. so, i asked to get a check. it was enough...\n\nwhen the food, especially seafood, gets old, they should throw them away - because you know, there is a risk of spreading food poisoning! don't give me these stained shrimps, dude.\n\nbtw, frites are better than lay's potato chips. complimentary baguette is pretty terrible. you can get better baguettes cheaper at albertson's.\n\nmy suggestion - never get seafood here if you know what decent seafood tastes like. just get burgers - cheap and simple. i guess those people who are giving 5 stars just eat burgers and steaks, not seafood. \n\nservice - not that great - too busy all the time - my server wasn't nice at all - she didn't stop at our table. no refills. i saw she was chatting for a while at another table, tho. \n\nyou will see all the men in black here - they indeed look professional in a funny way - but imagine if they change it to denny's uniforms - surly enough, they would fit really well.\n\nalso, when i made a reservation today (sat. nov 10 2012 around lunch time), the hostess was really rude over the phone.  this is karma on yelp, haha.\n\ni have been going there to see bellagio, not to enjoy food and service, but it was way too terrible.... i will never go back again.\n\n1 star is for bellagio's fountain show.",

            "we went there on tuesday afternoon around 1 and waited about 30 minutes for a table outside, which was no problem except the hostess walked us right past a great table set for two and gave us maybe the worst table on the patio. that's the only reason i'm docking one star. \nthe food was amazing though. mark, our server who was great, recommended the ahi tuna salad. it was absolutely delicious. the salad was very refreshing and the ahi tuna was perfect! my brother had the <mark>Freshly Ground Ahi Tuna Burger</mark> and practically inhaled it he liked it so much. then for dessert he got the white chocolate bread pudding and he loved that, while i got the lemon-lime sorbet. \nthe service was great as well. mark was very helpful and charming and we'll probably ask for him the next time we go. \nall in all, great service, great food! thanks mark!", 
            "i made the reservation and noted it's for the 7 star player's birthday.\nbut the whole service was poor and fell below my fair experiences here in the past and upset my first-timer guest. \nthe hostess is new and never wore a smile on her face, no greetings and no conversations on the way to our table. i asked her the information about the seats, and she told me she is new, so she doesn't know. not helpful staff at all.\nthe server was slow that we had to ask for refills every time for the coffee and beverage. the <mark>Freshly Ground Ahi Tuna Burger</mark> was dry and very fishy.\nmost people come here to enjoy the strip view and bellagio water show. the tourists next to our tables asked the sever the time of water show, and his answer is he doesn't know. not helpful staff again. \nand there was neither surprise nor a simple \"happy birthday\" from the staff.\ni doubt i will come back here again.",

            "really cool location at the paris las vegas hotel...right on the sidewalk so you can check out the array of people types who visit las vegas.  i suggest you avoid the patio seating when it gets warm out.  the tabletops heat up, and the umbrellas do not help.\n\nat around 2:30pm on a wednesday afternoon, the hostess said there'd be a 30 minute wait.  it was probably more like 20, and my boyfriend thinks it's a scam to get their patrons to gamble while they wait.  haha.  they are so smart!  my boyfriend blew a dollar on the wheel-of-fortune machine, but gained $15 playing poker at the poker room bar.\n\nthe baguette and butter we were first served was delicous.  quite possibly the most delicous bread and butter i've ever consumed.  i ordered the brie burger, but took it apart because i asked for medium well, and it was more like medium and i prefer my hamburger meat cooked.  the bun looked delicious, but i wasn't in the mood to carboload.  the fries were pretty yummy.  my boyfriend had the chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> and that was pretty phenomenal.  it made me feel bad that i ordered a burger.\n\nit was just too bad we were sitting outside on the patio in 90+ degree heat.  i couldn't properly enjoy my food under those conditions.", 
            "lunch - mon ami gabi has pretty tasty food accompanied by a relaxing atmosphere. if you sit outside, you can spy on the streams of tourists passing by and watch (but not hear) the fountains of the bellagio hotel across the street. inside are darker rooms as well as a brightly lit atrium type room which lets in light but not so much the weather. \n\nonion soup - very deep flavor; not a very thick broth, but not light. there is plenty of delicious gruyre cheese on top and some onions in the soup. \n\nlobster bisque w/ orzo - a waiter brings a bowl with a few tiny chunks of lobster and 1/5 cup of orzo rice. then he pours the lobster bisque out of a little pitcher. the lobster bisque has a slight seafood-y taste but i found it bearable. the bisque is also a little spicy which i really liked! \n\nsauted spinach & brie crpe - a pretty large crepe with lots of brie and very fresh spinach. the crepe skin was a little dry and bland, but the brie and spinach made it better. the crepe also comes with a small side salad on the plate. \n\n<mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>,  with bacon - the best quiche i've had anywhere. it's creamy and eggy and the crust is tender and buttery. the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> also comes with sweet, caramelized onions scattered throughout the quiche and lends a nice contrast to the salty elements. \n\nvegetable quiche - same delicious eggy center and tender crust and contains spinach and mushrooms rather than bacon and onions. liked the textures, but thought it wasn't as flavorful as the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>. \n\nchicken & <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, caramelized onion and apple - this sandwich came on a soft ciabatta roll. the flavors were light but complemented each other well. the brie was mild and was delicious with the onions and the apples. the sweetness of the apples and onions paired well with the relatively tender chicken breast. also came with a huge side order of mon ami's thin, crispy frites. i still personally prefer my steak fries, but fans of crispy fries should like the frites. only problem was that some seemed to have been sitting around for a while.", 
            "we arrived for brunch on a windy, chilly september morning, but stuck it out on the patio.  the brunch menu is just the lunch menu, so don't juggle your plans to be here at brunch.  go somewhere else.  enjoy mon ami gabi any other time!  \n\nthe waiter brought out a baguette with soft butter and yummy raspberry jam.  i usually do not eat jam but this was so good with the butter and soft, crusty bread.  i had a bloody mary, (or two!) it was good.  i heard raves about the bloody mary bar on here, but it is nothing special unless you are sitting right by it.  i would rather the waiter just bring out my drink.\n\nwe were warmed up by the tomato soup (yum) and french onion soup (yummier).  also got the appetizer of baked tomato and cheese with toasts.  i thought it would be literally sliced tomato with melted sliced cheese on top.  it was actually a tomato puree with <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>.  very good, but not expected, as we already had the tomato soup.\n\nthe <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> was horrible.  there was an ingredient in there i couldn't stand, and my mom disliked it, too.  that is not to say someone else would not like it, just not for me.  i got the chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, very good, as were the frites that came with it.  the best was the creamy chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>.  that also came with a salad with frisee and i think baby arugula with a tantalizing dressing... i wasn't sure what it was and forgot to ask our server.  champagne vinegar, perhaps?\n\ni would definitely go back, though, and get the soup and the crepe.  i would also like to try the salad with pear & walnuts and the chocolate mousse.", 
            "on our trip to vegas my bf and i were looking for a place to have lunch and we were walking around paris' casino floor and starving so we decided to check out the menu outside mon ami gabi. i was sold on their lunch selection so we proceeded to get a table on the patio.  the hostess may have lacked some common sense because she seated us at the table that was away from the fans that sprayed cool mists, umbrellas, and in direct sunlight in 105 degrees of heat. wth!? after burning our elbows on the scorching hot tables, the servers brought out iced cold water which melted within a few seconds due to where we were seated. my bf asked for a table change closer to where everyone else was being seated (under umbrellas and fans). \nour server was really sweet and moved us to a table towards the side of the patio and it felt nice to have that section to ourselves.  \n\nanyway we started off with the yogurt gazpacho that was part of their daily specials menu and it was so refreshing and tart for a hot day. the soup was served extremely chilled so it was perfect. for lunch, we got the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> with caramelized onions and a chicken blt sandwich. the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> and the fresh potato chips were definitely on point. as for the <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, it was an ordinary <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> but the portion was pretty good.  service was great here as well; our drinks were constantly refilled before they ever reached the half way point. the patio is definitely fun  to sit in to people watch and enjoy the view of the bellagio fountain across the street.", 
            "i chose mon ami gabi, because of its yelp rating and proximity to my hotel. i was not disappointed, and neither were any of my friends.\n\nthe food was excellent, though a little pricey considering it was lunch fare. i had a <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> with brie, and apple slices. my mouth is watering just thinking about it. i was actually hoping for brunch, which unfortunately they only serve on sundays, but i left completely satisfied with my second choice. my only culinary complaint is with their 'french fries' which are super thin cut and crispy like chips. they totally suck.\n\nthe service was great, the bloody marries were excellent, and the atmosphere was inviting and unique.", 
            "i love random trips to las vegas and this is probably my 3rd one???\nanyways....came here with a friend for a late lunch since we were out the entire night before. we walked from the monte carlo to paris and i have to state that it was one of the best walks ever. :) i haven't really cavorted the strip like that and i felt i was young again...what am i saying, i'm not even that old!\nwe were seated within 3-5 minutes of getting into the restaurant. everyone has to wait in the bar area for a table. finally, our host took us to our table outdoors. the view is spectacular. just as we sat down, the fountain show at the bellagio commenced. it would've been the most ideal late lunch ever,  but it ended up raining and we has to take a booth inside. boo hiss argh.\nthe booths are comfy and it's dim inside, which makes the setting very romantic. there's the more lit area where i'd hang with my friends, then the outdoor patio if i wanted some air.\ni ordered the brie, green apple and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> which was not what i expected. i consider myself a huge brie and apple fanatic...but this one was bland...barely any chicken in my sandwich and it was dry! the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>, which was a cream mash potato mussel soup was delicious! i almost ate it all with the baguette they give you. the baguette was a little burnt at the bottom, but did not taste bad. i also ordered a bloody mary with extra horseradish...it was ok. best bloody mary i have had was at bear mountains hands down, but i'll try anything once.\nmy friend ordered the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> but instead they gave him a croque madame, which we didn't realize until the bill came out. at that moment he exclaimed why his meal didn't look right. it was missing the creamy sauce on top.\nall in all, i mayyy come back here to try their make your own bloody marys. as for the food, i was not impressed. we will see how the make your own bloody marys fare in feb 2011!", 
            "masayuki threw up after eating at this place. the waitress recommended an \"light\" dish that was really cheesy (the warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>). it was too much and too rich for him and he threw up! but he really liked the onion soup! i had the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>. i can tell the shrimp was really fresh because i had allergic reaction after eating it (allergy to fresh shrimp).\nit was good though; especially the sauce and there were peas inside the crepe. i thought the shrimp and scallop would be inside the crepe but it was actually outside.",

(good service is about doing right by your customers) \n\nscenery - 5 stars\none of the best spots to eat outside in vegas. outdoors patio is cooled with a refreshing water mist. it's located right across from the bellagio fountains and right in the heart of the strip. so plenty to see and discuss in a cool (in temperature) atmosphere.",

            "pardon my french, but this place is the shizzz. there isn't a better restaurant on the strip that blends quality of food, service, scenery and ambiance. just ate lunch here a little while ago. \n\ni ordered the steak frites. a staple dish of the restaurant that every other table had someone eating. its a thin steak rich in flavor alone, but amplified by one of their 4 signature sauces. the waiter recommended the bordelaise sauce, caramelized onions in a red wine sauce. great pick, it was amazing. next time i will try the brandy peppercorn sauce! other dishes at my table were the warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> and the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. both looked delicious, particularly the chicken and brie.\n\nthe cool thing about this restaurant is that it is in the paris hotel overlooking the bellagio across the street. you can eat outside on the elevated patio away from all the foot traffic. so while you are eating a beautiful meal, you are at the same time in the middle of the strip possibly watching the bellagio water fountain show. \n\nthe food, service and scenery causes sensory overload. bring your date here if you want to seal the deal.", 
            "yum! definitely order the chicken & <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>...rich but so delicious with the brie & apple combo (they do this a lot for appetizers, so i was pleasantly surprised for this combination on an entree)\n\nalso the trout is yums, fries are a bit oily/thin and i personally didn't like it that much. overall really good place to eat, not too expensive either!", 
            "read good reviews for mon ami - inexpensive (for vegas), good food, etc. - and it totally lived up to it's expectations! \n\ngreat seating area outside with a fantastic view of the bellagio fountains. loved this! the space heaters are clutch, too.\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> in tomato sauce and wolfed it down. i'm pretty sure we went through 3 baguettes just eating this! the main meals we ordered (chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> and ham and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark>) were just fine, but the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> stole the show.\n\ntried gluten free beer too - not bad at all! my only complaint is that the service was a bit slow. everything else was a great experience. definitely order the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>!!", 
            "this is a review of mon ami gabi for lunch.  we wanted a lite lunch and it was perfect. i had the tuna melt tartine and it came with french fries that were sliced potato chip thin.  my dining partner had the chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> and that was just as good.  the wait staff was great and my water glass was never empty.\n\nthe complimentary baguette hit the spot until our lunch was served,", 
            "well, with 1800+ reviews, i'm not sure if mine will make too much of an impact, but here goes! \n\nmy 4-star rating is in regards to their lunch-- i've never dined here for dinner, but i have heard good things about that as well.\n\nno matter the day, try to make reservations if at all possible, especially if you're planning on eating around 11:30-1:00. they have beautiful seating on the patio and in the \"bubble\" -- like an atrium, this area is covered by glass with great views of the strip. this is our favorite location to eat in the restaurant as i personally feel that service can suffer farther out on the patio.\n\ninto the food:\nappetizers: \ntheir <mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> gratin\\u00e9es is a completely flawless dish-- tender scallops served in a sort of seashell presentation, topped with a carmelized onion marmalade, mussel cream, and carmelized fennel(?). while this normally would not appeal to me in the slightest, this is probably the dish i look forward to most when coming to mon ami gabi! these are downright delicious and should definitely not be passed up. i believe there are 3 in an order. \nfrench onion soup: my favorite of all time. nowhere else have i dined at has surpassed mag's french onion. i can't even describe it anymore without my mouth watering...a ton of sweet onions throughout is what i love most about this. i can't explain anymore without saying to just get this!!\n\nmain dish:\nwarm chicken & <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>: this is quite the item. the chicken is pounded flat and is incredibly tender. the brie is smooth and is a great mix with the green apple slices (also thin) and the spread of carmelized onions (notice the trend with the onions...ha! i love them.) i forget the bread it is on, but it's extremely soft and a perfect match. however, i could pass on their fries. they're so thin, they become crunchy, almost like chips. but, to each their own!\ni've had a few others, but this has been my favorite by far. \n\ndessert: \nwarm apple tatin: extremely french taste, presentation, etc...i was transported back to france just tasting this. it's difficult to explain this item, but it is a round crust (bottom and sides) and it has baked, carmelized apples in the middle. served with amaaaaazing whipped cream. worth every calorie!\n\nbottom line: one of the best places on the strip for lunch that is decently priced. give it a shot-- i bet you'll love it!", 
            "a nice spacious restaurant! this hotspot is located at the base of paris hotel and is alongside the sidewalk of the lively las vegas blvd.  my visit to mon ami gabi evoked flashbacks of my time in paris mid-summer. to my surprise, the decor and food accurately captures the essence of a french restaurant.\n\nmy favorite aspect of this exquisite eatery is the affordable pricing and the wide selections on the menu. for less than $20, you can already have a good amount of food. i enjoyed my <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>, which had tender and succulent meat between two soft freshly-baked bread.  when i took a bite the warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, my mouth rejoiced after tasting the flavorful yet delicate combination of the ingredients put together.  the marriage of brie cheese and chicken provides a high enjoyable level of savoriness.  mon ami gabi was able to bring sandwiches above and beyond the expectations i normally have. \nevery sandwich (and many dishes) comes with a small basket of crispy potatoes.  they are similar to french fries as well as potato chips and compliment the entrees wonderfully with their lightly salted crispiness.\n\nthe service is wonderful as the workers are knowledgeable about everything on the food and wine menu.  one of the important things to anticipate upon arrival to mon ami gabi is the shirt policy.  male customers must wear a shirt with sleeves (essentially no tank tops).  one of the people in my party unknowingly did not wear a shirt with sleeves to this restaurant.  however, the workers were nice enough to provide him with a complementary paris hotel t-shirt.  is the service great or what?", 
            "the plan was to have them for breakfast since we were told they were one of the best breakfast spots closest to the cosmopolitan where we had been staying for the night. but after a night in vegas, we started off a tad bit late and wound up giving mon ami gabi a go for lunch. \n\nso, the drinking never stops in vegas right? okay, maybe those are words spoken by a borderline alcohol connoisseur, my group order a cask of sangria, super yummy i might add and perfect pairing to the lunch that followed.\n\nmy order consisted of the warm chicken & <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> that comes with hand-cut frites. i absolutely love caramelized onions so that was the first thing about this sandwich entree that caught my eye and my taste buds. i had been leery of the idea of there also being green apple on it as well, but to my surprise it paired well (i am obviously not well versed in pairing of foods, but i sure do love to eat them when they jive and put a smile on my face and a flutter in my belly).\n\nthe service was excellent, our waiter always paid close attention to our table and was always right on queue when we were just about to pour our own refill of sangria, quickly rushing over to take care of the small task for us. \n\ni thoroughly enjoyed my experience here, and hope to come back and visit them for breakfast next time i'm in town.", 
            "came here for lunch with my girlfriends and it was such a great experience! the service is spectacular! our waiter was such a joy to have! extremely helpful and friendly.  we ordered the frites, brie & <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, french onion soup, burgers, pate, <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark>, lobster roll, mussels... everything was delicious!", 
            "this was one of my two favorite meals in my 10 day stay in vegas.  the service was awesome, very attentive, but not imposing.  the food was very good.  right amount of time.  we sat outside so we were able to watch the bellagio fountains.  we had the french toast and the chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>.  i really like the french toast.  it wasn't too sweet or too bland.  it wasn't too soft or too hard.  it just melted in my mouth.  just right.", 
            "the service was amazing, the decor was great as well as the view on the patio but the food did not meet my expectations. i was in a party of 7, and we came here for a late lunch. we did not have any reservations, but they were able to seat us within 5 minutes. \n\nour server offered us bread and whipped butter. the bread was really hard, but hot and the butter made everything taste better! my friend and i split a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> along with steak bordelaise and i was pretty much in disbelief when the salad came out. it's a very, very, very small serving for $10. it tasted fine, you can't go wrong with <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. when i got the steak bordelaise i was also disappointed. there was barely any color on the plate besides brown, and branch of some leaf they put on the plate. it did not look appetizing, nor was the steak good. it was hard and the only thing good about the dish was the caramelized onions. the fries weren't that amazing either. i really wish they would pair their steak frites up with veggies instead of just an enormous serving of fries. \n\nother people in our party ordered the natural <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark>, chicken broccoli and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark>, grilled salmon <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark>, a cheeseburger and chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>. the best dishes out of those would be the chicken, broccoli and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark> along with the grilled salmon salad. \n\nnot sure if i would be back, i expected it the food to be a little better considering that it is a french restaurant with prices on the higher end, but it was a good experience.", 
            "absolutely wonderful!  service was brilliant and kept our glasses full on this hot day!  i had the chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> with carmelized onions!  very wonderful along with their fries!  hubby thought the fries were a little too salty (but ate every one!) for me they were perfect.  he had a bacon burger cooked medium!  again perfect!  i would totally recommend gabis!", 
            "came here for dinner and brunch at two separate occasions.  i love their service, they are attentive and helpful when you don't know what to get. \n\nfor dinner we had the steak, which was delicious, but it's really heavy. i couldn't finish the whole thing, and if i were to order it again, i would split it. their french onion soup is one of the best i've had. \n\nfor brunch i had the <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> with brie and apples. it was very good, and again heavily buttered.  a couple of people in our group got the lobster roll and that looked really good. \n\nit is french food, so expect a lot of butter. i have to say, my favorite part of the meal, by far, was the fresh bread they bring out in the beginning.", 
            "i've ventured to mon ami gabi a handful of times- one of the few places that, as a local, i enjoy going to on the strip- & truly feel it's a place everyone should treat themselves to, at least once. when i go somewhere like, say, pf chang's, it's generally the same experience every time. each experience at mon ami has been a different vibe but all equally enjoyable. over the years, my g.f.'s & i have joked about playing hooky & meeting there for the afternoon. i'd recommend reservations, if possible; otherwise, depending on the day/time, anticipate a bit of a wait. i've never been disappointed by the fare. leading up to today's celebratory work lunch, i had my tastebuds set on the <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark> but made a last minute switch to the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. upon my 2nd or 3rd bite, i enthusiastically declared \"i don't even like meat but if it all tasted like this, i'd love it!\" there's a misconception that mon ami is \\u00fcber pricey but it's really not that much different than going to places like outback, cheesecake factory, (the previously mentioned) pf chang's, etc. the ambiance is spot-on, even when it's a packed saturday nite, & the service is consistent. a few items to take into consideration: warm brie cheese appetizer, mussels, <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark>, onion soup, quiche, warm chicken & <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> & flourless chocolate cake. go. eat. take in the moment. enjoy.", 
            "very popular restaurant, we had to wait about 1/2 hour to get seated for lunch. the most popular place to sit is outside on the patio, because you can watch the people walking by and feel like you're in a french cafe. i had the french onion soup, my friends had the lobster roll sandwich and chicken-<mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>. all were very good. the service was also good, we didn't have to wait very long for our drinks and food. las vegas has so many fantastic restaurants and i will definitely return to mon ami gabi.", 
            "we were lucky enough to get a table on the patio. the rest of the restaurant is quite dark, but the sunroom is also really nice if there's no space on the patio.\n\nwe were here for brunch/lunch, so i ordered the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark>. my friends shared the escargot, and had the <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>, <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>, and chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>.\n\neverything tasted great, but didn't wow us. like most french food, everything was quite rich, so it was a pretty heavy lunch. i loved the fries; they were thin and crunchy.\n\nwe also shared a pitcher of frangria, which was quite strong (we're not huge red wine drinkers), but with some added lime juice it tasted much better.\n\nwould love to come back to try their steak.", 
            "this place is so underwhelming. just so incredibly underwhelming.\n\ni made reservation for 12:30, not sure how busy it would be on a saturday in early december. turns out it's pretty damn crowded, but they're seating every party with no problems. they tell us to stand by the side until they flag down a waitress to seat us. we can a little earlier around 12:15, so i expected to wait a few minutes but i waited much longer. fast forward 20 minutes and we're still standing there while they seat parties of 10. apparently they forgot about us. -1 star.\n\nwe finally sit down and our waitress comes to us and she was lovely. we ordered the duck confit to start. i ordered a warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> while my friend ordered a medium rare steak. it takes a while for our appetizer to come out, in which time the staff breaks about 3 wine glasses throughout the restaurant and the shattered glass is everywhere. okay, promising.\n\nduck confit is dry. so dry. has ok flavor, but just so damn dry. \n\nmy warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> was clearly sitting under a heat lamp for a while because all the brie had melted off the sandwich and the chicken was dry.\n\nsteak was cooked very medium instead of medium rare.\n\neverything but our waitress was so underwhelming. i wouldn't recommend this place to my friends.", 
            "we try to stop by here whenever we are in vegas.  the restaurant is located in the paris paris, just off the main casino floor.  if the weather is nice, try to get a table on the patio, or the windows near the patio, as they overlook the beautiful bellagio fountains.  the patio is raised above the busy las vegas boulevard sidewalk, so all those inebriated tourist don't get in the way of the view.\n\nin my opinion, the food at most of the restaurants on the strip is overhyped and overpriced; this is not the case at mon ami gabi.  the food here is excellent for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and appropriately priced.  my personal favorites are the <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark>, the warm chicken & <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, and the <mark>Filet Mignon Merlot</mark> steak frites.", 
            "i had not been back to mon ami since dec. 2004, but it was as great as i remembered it to be. the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> is a deal at $16, and my friend got a chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> for $14, i believe - both were delicious. we sat on the patio and you have a great view of the bellagio fountains (minus the palm trees on the strip in between) and it's a great way to people-watch as well. they also gave us warm, freshly baked bread (at least it tasted like that) and it was delicious. i will definitely be back to mon ami next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "the line to get a table, was a bit confusing.  after i realized i didn't need to sit outside, we got a romantic corner booth in the bar.  fantastic attentive service, the waiter and busser worked as a team.  hot bread out of the oven.  nice bucket of champange, that the waiter kept refilling.\nfrench onion soup, warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>, croque madame, each dish fantastic.", 
            "i came here on sunday with my sisters and well lets just say if i think french, i think really good savory crepes. well to my surprise it wasn't that great. there wasn't much of a selection to begin with. so i settled with the chicken, broccoli, and <mark>Ham & Cheese Crepe</mark>. first bite i thought it was me thinking it was so salty. comes to find out it was just the broccoli that is seasoned to salty. we also order the tuna melt sandwich. i don't know about you but when i order a tuna sandwich anything i expect it not to be fishy. i'm sorry i have to say was way too fishy for my liking. it was so bad the waiter notice we were not fond of it and took it off our bill. so she made up for the lack of not being so attentive with refilling our drinking or bring out more bread. but the thing that was good was the hand cut fries. very thin and crispy just like potato chips  also the one thing that i did love besides the fries was there special! the shaved beef and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> with sun-dried tomato aioli. this was to die for! it was the perfect amount to have so you can last until dinner time. it doesn't sit heavy when you are done either which is a plus on my book. i would come back to mon ami gabi just for that. if we didn't order that i would never step foot back here.\n\nalso a little side note, for some reason the hosts are not so friendly. waiters inside are a little better. when the host took us inside to get seated i had on high boots so i have to walk slow cause of the tile floors they have are a little slippery. one of the waiter push be faster to walk cause she forgot someone order making me almost trip... just saying don't wear heels here ladies.", 
            "great service, great views, and great food.  we had a carafe of the frangria, which was delicious husband had the <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> that was delicious, and i had the pate <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> which were both great. highly recommend it.", 
            "one of the better restaurants in vegas. i go specifically for the chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> which is amazing, with caramelized onions. the service is always great, servers are friendly and prompt. i recommend patio seating if it's not too hot or too cold, for a view of the strip and people watching.", 
            "decent food we went for breakfast but i was told i could order off the lunch menu. i tried the <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> with sliced apples the sandwich was good bread was fresh. the service was good we sat outside. lots of reviews for this place i guess worth trying out for breakfast/lunch. nothing out of this world i have to say but goof to grab a quick salad, or sandwich and sit outside to people watch. also ordered escargot was ok nothing special came out with no bread. had to wait 7 minutes the guy said they were baking the baguettes. the bread was actually excellent !", 
            "boyfriend had specifically requested that we go \"somewhere breakfasty\" thursday morning when we were in vegas, so i hopped onto yelp and came up with mon ami gabi.\n\nwhen we walked up to the hostess, we were informed that there was a 15 minute wait to be seated outside, but that there was no wait to be seated indoors. naturally, both of us feeling starved, we decided to sit indoors. it was starting to get hot outside anyway. so i'm a little surprised when i'm handed the blue electronic seating buzzer thing and told that i can't walk past the indoor bridge with it because of the range. what? i thought there wasn't a wait! but whatever. boyfriend and i explored for about 10 minutes before our buzzer went off.\n\nour hostess then promptly led us to our seats... on the outdoor patio. i'm so confused at this point, but the heat really isn't as bad as we thought it would be, and we have a beautiful view of the bellagio fountains, so i can't exactly complain. i ordered the <mark>Classic Quiche Lorraine</mark> and i'm pretty sure boyfriend ordered the warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>.\n\nthe quiche was the size of my face! and boyfriend's sandwich looked very yummy. we each also got a beer. i think my favorite part of the meal, though, were the hand-cut fries. sliced so thin so as to almost be chips, each fry was like that super-special, extra-crispy fry from mcdonald's everyone fought for. you know what i'm talking about.\n\nit was a tad pricey (~$50 for lunch for both of us after tip), but i think it was worth it to try such a highly-rated restaurant on the strip.", 
            "the food was above average and the service was decent. most of the restaurants at paris seem more like tourist attractions than restaurants, but the inside dining area here was a bit nicer and not so crowded.\n\nthe patty melt was quite good and the <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> was not bad. the fries, a cross between french fries and chips, were actually very tasty.\n\nlike most casino restaurants, the sodas were flat and too syrupy.", 
            "the main reason we selected this restaurant was to dine on the patio and watch the lovely fountain show across the street at the bellagio so our expectations on food and service weren't terribly high. in the end, we left quite pleased with our  brunch experience.\n\nwe started the meal with  a carafe of their version of sangria which was delicious and not too sweet as well as the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>. i was a bit surprised by the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> as it was served at the center of an interesting tomato sauce and i had never seen that before. it came with crispy garlic bread which was good but i preferred it with the  baguette that was served at the on set of the meal. \n\nfor our entrees, we opted for a <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> with caramelized onions and sliced apples and a <mark>Cobb Salad</mark>. the sandwich was really a let down. the ciabatta roll it was served on drowned out all of the potentially good flavors and overall the flavors were on the sweet side. the salad however was delicious with fresh avocado, turkey, crispy bacon. the house dressing was a great compliment. \n\nfor the location on the strip, the prices were very reasonable and we left happy. all in all a very decent place to grab a bite and take in the sights of vegas.", 
            "came here on a thursday afternoon, my party of two waited about 15 min for a patio seat. the patio seats are highly coveted since they are great for people watching, but terrible for sun burns and flies.  located on the strip at paris, across from the bellagio fountains, this restaurant features a fancy decor inside/more lax on the patio, moderately priced items, and delicious food. \n\n-chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>: with caramelized onions and green apple slices, came with their flat salty fries and a mini salad, this sandwich was very very good. not heavy at all. the combination was divine. \n-grilled cheese duck confit: also came with their flat salty fries, mini salad, a berry/ginger fruit compote. this was very heavy and greasy. the sweet compote is a must add to the salty duck. overall good, but definitely share this dish as a whole sandwich would be too much, unless of course you plan on just lazying around for an hour or two after. \n-free birthday dessert: puff roll with a hefty scoop of vanilla ice cream inside, drizzled with chocolate sauce. good. can't complain about free. \n-marquis de la tour champagne: light, bubbly, fun. \n\ni'd come back for the breakfast and their french onion soup, just to see what all the fuss is about. til next time.", 
            "the wife and i were invited to join another couple for sunday brunch at mon ami gabi.  it was late morning on a beautiful, clear, sunny january day.  it was so nice on this particular day; we knew it would be a shame to not eat outside on mon ami gabi's patio overlooking the strip across from the bellagio.  we didn't have reservations, not that it would've helped, since outside dining was first come, first served.  as luck would have it, a table was available immediately for our party and we were treated to a four top up against the rail with an unobstructed strip-side view of passersby.  needless to say, it's one of the best people watching spots on the strip.  \n\nwe started off by sharing orders of the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> ($10.95) and the trio of artisan cheeses ($15.95).  the portion of pate was surprisingly generous and a great starter.  the cheeses, while delicious, were nothing terribly special or unique and probably a bit overpriced compared to the seeming value of the pate and what we received for the rest of our meal.  the wife and i split orders of the warm chicken & <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> ($12.95) and the butternut squash & brie quiche ($13.95).  the grilled chicken and brie was topped with caramelized onions and thin slices of green apple.  it was a nice-looking and tasting sandwich and an overall winner.  the quiche was tasty, as well, possessing a nice and buttery, flaky crust.  the amount of food was plentiful for the price.   \n\nfor a national chain restaurant, mon ami gabi impressed me enough to want to check out its location much closer to our home in northern virginia.  mon ami gabi served up a solid meal made all the more special by its singular al fresco dining experience.  if you go, go on a good weather day, and sit outside!",

            "located inside the paris hotel.  lovely ambiance, great service and awesome food.  \n\nlove their french toast with blueberry sauce and fresh blueberries even though the first time was so much more amazing than the second time.  they unfortunately cooked it way too much and it was quite burned the second time around but i was so hungry i didn't send it back.  :(. \n\ntheir <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> is actually super tasty. the slices of meat are very tender and juicy.  love their dipping sauce.  my mouth is watering as i am talking about it. also their <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> is very yummy.  good portions too so you could share.  \n\nunfortunately haven't had a chance to sit and dine outside with the lovely views of the bellagio fountain because the few times i went were extremely hot outside but i will once it starts to cool down.  \n\nthey have such amazing bread & it's complimentary.  be sure to have some but control yourself from eating the whole batch so you will have room for your meal.  ;)\n\nvery enjoyable experience!!!", 
            "we had lunch at mon ami gabi and it was a very nice experience. we made reservations for 12pm and we were seated promptly. we sat outside and enjoyed the view. the complimentary bread is nice and fresh. i had the frangria which was delicious and refreshing. i ordered the small and got 2 glasses out of it. i ordered the shrimp and scallop crepe and my husband ordered the chicken, apple and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>. both were excellent and the pomme frittes were delicious and perfectly seasoned. we will certainly go back again next time we are in vegas.", 
            "i'm sure my rating won't contribute much to the huge pool of reviews this fancy pants french bistro has amassed over the years...but i don't give a french. \n\ni came for lunch, although i intended to drop by in the evening because everyone raves about the spectacular views of the bellagio fountains show across the street. however, time did not permit so i decided that i would come for the food, not the views. don't get me wrong, if you sit in the patio during the daytime, there is still plenty of pretty scenery for you. it's just easy to imagine how much better the views are during the night. \n\nanyway, onto the food! my partner and i opted for two sandwiches: maine lobster roll and the sandwich <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> (sandwich of the day). quick tip: <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> are served with mon ami gabi's renowned hand-cut frites, while cold sandwiches are served with gaufrette potato chips (aka waffle fries). these are less acclaimed but still great.\n\nthe maine lobster roll is served on a toasted brioche roll, accompanied with a side of red cabbage salad. if y'all did your research, you would know that maine (and northern new england) generally serves their lobster meat cold. thus, our lobster roll was served with the gaufrette potato chips. i was expecting the hand-cut frites. it's no biggie though because i'm an equal opportunity fried potatoes consumer. these waffle fries were crisp and tasty. i didn't like the lobster roll because it was too buttery and rich for me but my boyfriend had no trouble devouring it. the roll was also smaller than i expected--hence, less lobster meat than what i anticipated. \n\nour sandwich <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>, on the other hand, was sensational! it was a seared ahi tuna sandwich served on a baguette with hand-cut frites. the ahi tuna was delicately seared on the outside, and left rare in the middle. it had a velvety texture. the mayo sauce contained a bit of zest and a lot of flavor. the baguette was hard but also packed a crunch. now to the famous frites! i understand why they're famous: perfectly thin-cut slivers of potatoes and lightly seasoned with salt. these babies were fried to a beautiful golden brown. \n\nthe patio seats are highly touted so the restaurant doesn't accept reservations for outdoor seating; they're on a first-come, first-served basis. yes, the views are lovely but don't forget about the dishes! it's definitely one of the best meals i've had in vegas. service was all right. prices are on the higher end but totally worth it--whether you're there for the view or the food.", 
            "best place on the strip to people watch sitting on a outside table on a sunny afternoon . i had <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> and capucinno . the sandwich came with french style fries. it was very tasty , though i would have preferred a healthier wheat bread in place of the ciabatta bread.",

            "a few days ago, i was in vegas staying at the paris hotel and my friend and i decided to try this restaurant as i had heard good things. we went for breakfast and i got a chicken, brie, and apple crepe. the crepe was excellent and we decided we would return for lunch. \n\nunfortunately, my lunch wasn't as satisfying. i ordered the chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> with the escargot appetizer. as for the escargot, i felt there was way too much pesto and i felt as if i was eating grass with my escargot. my sandwich was good but it had a lot of juice that made me feel it was a little soggy. \n\ni would definitely return for breakfast but i'd skip lunch and opt for somewhere else on the strip.", 
            "the view from the patio, great customer service and delicious french inspired food combine for an all around amazing experience! \n\nhighly recommend the warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>. it's filled with grilled chicken, granny smith apples, carmelized onions and brie. coming back again before my trip ends for another lunch with mimosa :)", 
            "we decided to wrap up our trip with brunch on the patio at mon ami. we were a bit annoyed to be informed that it was \"company policy\" that out of state drivers licenses did not qualify as adequate form of id, i decided not to get a mimosa (your loss, not mine). i had the brie and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, which was good but nothing too amazing. \n\nwe've been here for dinner, and the dining experience (food and service) are literally night and day. with so many options on the strip, you'd think restaurants would up their game to keep customers happy. i think i'd pass if the opportunity came up to come back to mon ami.", 
            "3.5 stars \n\ni came for a bridal shower. we had a party of 16 and they were kind enough to seat us with 10. the waitress brought our table baguette and butter. the waitress brought us more when we asked! hooray! the ones brought later were warmer. i couldn't stop filling up on the delicious carbs. \n\ni got the warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>. it had green apples, caramelized onions and an aioli. the bottom of the sandwich got soggy really quickly. it was alright. it came with some french fries which i didn't even try to finish. they were okay. \n\nmy friend ordered a banana muffin. after one taste, i knew that i had to order one to go. the banana muffin ($3.99) was really good. it was a big muffin, but sort of flat on top. don't expect very much muffin top, if that's what you're in to. the muffin was moist and the edges were nice and crispy. it did not have any nuts, which is a bummer. there were big chunks of banana in the batter. i would come back just to order the muffin to go.", 
            "nice place, with lots of room and very attentive.  we came on thanksgiving mid afternoon hoping for breakfast/brunch but because of the holiday they weren't serving it; understandable.\n\nordered a simple <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> with fries and a <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>.  both were very good, but the complimentary bread is straight up addictive!  we also saw some of the other dishes that came out of the kitchen, like the french onion soup that looked tasty.  had a very good server who checked in often, even on such a busy day.  it's decently price, would recommend to anyone visiting here, but please stay away from the hotel in general. i would say that's the only negative of the restaurant, and only positive of the hotel.", 
            "our friends from back east recommended this place and also to have stephanie as our server. well when we came to vegas last week we had a fabulous lunch and terrific service from stephane, who has a french accent that is real! she helped us with menu choices and was so warm and welcoming. we even got a hug upon leaving. the <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> is delicious, as was the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> and <mark>Skate Wing</mark>. ask for your fries well done and they are superb. great atmosphere and on our next trip to vegas, we will visit our new french friend stephanie! well done.", 
            "my friends and i were very excited to try this place and surprises that on opentable, we were able to make a lunch reservation the day of! \nwe ordered the soup of the day (cream of potato) and onion soup to start off with. i loved the cream of potato soup!! if you want something creamy and savory, i definitely recommend it! i also enjoyed the onion soup, but i was not a huge fan of the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> on top. \ni ordered the eggs benedict which came with canadian bacon and a side of hash browns. i found the hash brown to be really cold when it came out, and the english muffin was extremely hard- i couldn't cut it so i just ended up eating the top part. it was just too burnt. \nmy friends orders were delicious though! especially the <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>- i will definitely order that if i were to come here again! it also comes with a side of fries, which were crispy and perfectly seasoned. \ni also tried the grilled cheese and mushroom and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark>. they were delicious and perfectly cooked.\none downside is that after placing our order, we decided we wanted to try the fries and ordered it from our waiter. he failed to mention that the two of our dishes came with fries and we had no idea, so we had 3 fries for 4 people and it was way too much. \nwe tried the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e for dessert and it was good! creamy in the middle and crispy on top. \n\ntry to sit on the patio for a wonderful view of the strip and the fountains of bellagio!", 
            "it is my tradition to end every vegas trip with brunch at mon ami gabi.  this restaurant provides for a classy ambiance and and unbeatable view of the strip and the belliago water fountains, if you can get a table in the front area.  their fresh baguettes are also quite a treat and my last visit was no exception.  \n\nit is also my tradition to order the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>.  $18 for a sandwich is not cheap but it was always justified here -- until this past visit.  i will say i was quite disappointed.  they were not the juicy, medium rare, fresh off the grill steak strips i got in the past.  it tasted like a warm beef sandwich you could order at any hot deli.  certainly not $18 worth and not what i expect from mon ami gabi.  on the other hand, my wife got the warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> was was surprisingly tasty.  the spread was just off the hook.  an entirely disappointing experience was luckily spared by my wife selflessly trading half her sandwich for mine.  i may still keep my mon ami gabi tradition but try something different on the menu next time."

            "we sought out a lunch place for after our vegas arrival so we thought the view and food of mon ami gabi would be a nice way to start the weekend. for the most part it was. we were told that if we wanted to get started now we could sit we could sit inside or wait 30 mins and sit outside. we were hungry so screw it we'll sit inside...we walked..and walked...and walked and found ourselves outside much to our surprise! so we were in the covered patio. perfect - just barely under the awning, avoiding the scorching sun. \n\nthis is definitely a place to be seen...especially if your penchant for attention-whoredom is working on whatever day you're there.\n\nthe service here is pretty good - despite forgetting a beer that got hidden behind several other drinks, our waitress was very knowledgeable about the wine selections and even let me taste before deciding. i think that deserves some merit. their wine of the week was a layercake cotes-du-rhone. apparently the wine maker came from barossa valley in australia but started a vineyard in france. very good with the food.\n\non to the food! started with the butter lettuce salad with citrus vinaigrette. there is something that feels sophisticated about cutting your lettuce up rather than just constantly stabbing at veggies. my girl thought the dressing was too oily. i liked it and thought it was pretty good but nothing that would blow you away. it was a bit too warm for soup but the french onion soup looked as good as the yelp reviews made it sound from looking at what others were ordering. for our main courses we shared sandwiches - they had a special which was a turkey sandwich with brie and orange marmalade. sounded great so we got that. everything was pretty good except the turkey. i thought it was a bit of a step up from butterball. it wasn't bad, but i thought they should put a bit more effort into that turkey.\n\nthe <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> here is amazing. holy crap - i've had these several times before...maybe at 4-5 different restaurants but this was far and away the best. the cheese gratinee on top was great - the ham was very flavorful. if you're in the mood for a sandwich you need to try this sandwich. they'll do it \"madame\" style if you prefer as well.\n\ngreat lunch spot - comparing it to something more local to me, like left bank, i'd say this appears to have much of the same appeal - (what is supposed) standard french fare with the to-be-expected american concessions. definitely a relaxing, memorable experience.", 
            "a nice french restaurant at the paris resort.  my friends and i went there for brunch during our weekend in vegas and were completely satisfied with everything.\n\nwhat initially peaked our interest was the bloody mary bar.  two of my friends partook and went and created their own bloody maries.  when you arrive, they provide baguettes in the paper bags you would receive if you bought them at a boulangerie in france.  \n\ni had a <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> with fries and a mimosa.  the sandwich was good and so was the mimosa.  the fries were unique.  they were cut very thin.  my friends ordered other sandwiches <mark>Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad</mark> and everyone was very happy with their meal.  \n\nwe sat outside b/c it was a beautiful, sunny afternoon.  the staff let us linger at the table for two hours as we ate, drank and laughed.  since paris is across the street from the bellagio, we were able to witness the musical fountain shows every 1/2 an hour.  it made us laugh to watch the fountains soar into the sky to the voice of celine dion.  \n\ngreat food, friendly staff, good drinks.  would return when in the mood for french food.", 
            "we had a great departing lunch at mon ami gabi this last sunday. mon ami is one of my faves in town for lunch.  not so much at night, but almost always for lunch. i love to sit in the atrium and people watch.\n\nwe ate and drank some truly fine french bistro food.\n\nt and i started with a dozen oysters. the waistress said they were most like fanny bays, but i thought these were smaller and sweeter.  delish. lots of lemon, mignonette with tons of shallots and fresh grated horseradish.\n\nd started with the frisee au lardon (frisee and <mark>Frisee Kale & Warm Bacon Salad</mark> here in the us where they are probably afraid of the word lardons.)  because i had this for my entree i can comment upon it. it was delicious. poached egg, slightly warm frisee, lots of chunks of bacon. light vinaigrette.  v good.\n\nfor an entree c had the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>, which was a little unorthodix because it was not open face. however, it had tons of cheese and ham. it was really a lovely tasty sandie.  \n\nt and i both drank glasses of a french vouvray that was enormously delicious.   it had an ever so slight effervescence.  and the price was right, 9.50 on the wine list.\n\ni took off one star because their fries suck azz. they anger me.", 
            "a trip to vegas is not the same for me without a visit to mon ami gabi at paris las vegas hotel and casino. love this place. \n\nthe pommes frites - love them. i get them every time i come here. and that crusty bread they serve prior to the meal with the real butter...just give me champagne and i'm on cloud 9! \n\nlove the steak, mac and cheese side dish, lox and toast points, <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> and madame...wine...just love this place! \n\ni usually ask to sit in the dining room that faces the bellagio fountains (adjacent to the outdoor patio), so i can enjoy the view while staying in the air-conditioned room (i'm from san diego...i don't need any more sun). \n\ni am missing those pommes frites already....going back in september (yay) - can't wait!", 
            "was just there for saturday lunch in december 2009. started with a fresh hot baguette for the table..which was delicious. crunchy and soft in all the right places. \n\ni got the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> ..that was divine! ham and cheese and a fried egg.. on great bread. so so good!! my friend got the special of the day, which was a duck and fig open faced sandwich, which was spectacular as well. someone else at the table got the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>..which was plain compared to our two dishes. it wasn't bad, it was just bland and boring. he ended up eating some of my sammy. \nmy other friend had the eggs & beef bourguignon and said it was mediocre at best.. \n\nbecareful of the mimosas. we got a couple..and when the bill came it was $10 a pop!! so not worth it, since you can get unlimted mimosas at all the brunch buffets for like $5. and they tasted the same.", 
            "this review pertains to the lunch menu.\n\nthe skinny: gabi is not your friend - while the view est magnifique,  the food n'est pas tres bien (2.5), service: efficient but tries too hard with the \"mon-sir\" and \"bon-jouer\" (3), value: not that great considering the level of cuisine (2).\n\nwe've been to mon ami gabi for lunch a couple of times mostly because of the spectacular view of the bellagio. accordingly, the food is a bit overpriced for what it is. \n\nwe subscribe to the \"lettuce entertain you\" rewards so i got a $15 gift card on my birthday. we ventured here for lunch (with an opentable reservation).\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark>, the butter lettuce salad (with asparagus, beets, and <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark>), and the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>. we've previously tasted their lovely skate dish and their great burgers but we decided to try something different this time. \n\nbad move.\n\nthe butter lettuce salad was meager for a $10 dish. a small dish of butter lettuce with some scatterings of asparagus and beets underneath. an overly large slice of <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> (closer to a feta cheese than a chevre) made the salad overly salty. the dressing, a creamy concoction reminescent of ranch, just doesn't work with the texture of the lettuces (it's too heavy) nor the flavours.\n\nthe <mark>Housemade Country Pate</mark> is yet again, overly large portion of meat with only 4 thin slices of bread. the pate is not quite what we expected. there's too much meat, not enough fat which made the pate hard to spread and not nearly as decadent as it ought to be (it might be unfair but i had a great pate at fleur de lys a day ago).\n\nfinally, the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>. at a place like this, a <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> ought to be better. first of all, no bechamel sauce - you can't have a high end croque without a nice bechamel sauce. 'nuff said. bread sliced too thinly (making it too hard when toasted), with very little in the way of ham or cheese, it was hard to justify the $12 pricetag. the bread was also a trifle greasy for my tastes. the accompanying frites were okay - more like chips than fries.\n\ndespite her really laboured/butchered french , the waitress herself was efficient, prompt and kind. she checked on us frequently enough and ensured our beverages were always filled.\n\noverall, it was an okay experience but i have definitely eaten more authentic french cuisine at a better value. (fyi -the above three items plus a diet coke would have cost well over $30 if we didn't have the giftcard.)", 
            "one of the best places for a casual outdoor lunch for the vegas visitor.  why?  good food, good wine, excellent service, and entertainment provided by the fountains of bellagio (right across the street).\n\nthe country style pate is excellent and perfect for a light lunch.  the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> is also worth a try.  simple and authentic.  it transports you right back to a caf\\u00e9 on the streets of paris epically if you enjoy it with a glass of wine.\n\nthe restaurant offers over two dozen french wines by the glass. all very well chosen although the prices are high.  wines by the bottle offer a better deal.  all french.  all food friendly (no first growth bordeaux or grand cru burgundies).  the wine program truly supports the caf\\u00e9 feel of the restaurant.\n\nkill a few hours and people watch.  so it's a french bistro at a themed hotel.  sometimes you just gotta be a tourist.", 
            "i love random trips to las vegas and this is probably my 3rd one???\nanyways....came here with a friend for a late lunch since we were out the entire night before. we walked from the monte carlo to paris and i have to state that it was one of the best walks ever. :) i haven't really cavorted the strip like that and i felt i was young again...what am i saying, i'm not even that old!\nwe were seated within 3-5 minutes of getting into the restaurant. everyone has to wait in the bar area for a table. finally, our host took us to our table outdoors. the view is spectacular. just as we sat down, the fountain show at the bellagio commenced. it would've been the most ideal late lunch ever,  but it ended up raining and we has to take a booth inside. boo hiss argh.\nthe booths are comfy and it's dim inside, which makes the setting very romantic. there's the more lit area where i'd hang with my friends, then the outdoor patio if i wanted some air.\ni ordered the brie, green apple and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> which was not what i expected. i consider myself a huge brie and apple fanatic...but this one was bland...barely any chicken in my sandwich and it was dry! the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark>, which was a cream mash potato mussel soup was delicious! i almost ate it all with the baguette they give you. the baguette was a little burnt at the bottom, but did not taste bad. i also ordered a bloody mary with extra horseradish...it was ok. best bloody mary i have had was at bear mountains hands down, but i'll try anything once.\nmy friend ordered the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> but instead they gave him a croque madame, which we didn't realize until the bill came out. at that moment he exclaimed why his meal didn't look right. it was missing the creamy sauce on top.\nall in all, i mayyy come back here to try their make your own bloody marys. as for the food, i was not impressed. we will see how the make your own bloody marys fare in feb 2011!", 
            "every time i'm in vegas i end up spending the afternoon on the patio here resolving my hangover... you can't beat the view - the bellagio fountains are immediately across the street.   \n\neverything i've ever eaten here has been fabulous, from the atypical fish and chips to the mussels to the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> to the french onion soup. full bar, wine, beer, etc. great frangria (their version of sangria) - buy a carafe to get a better deal... excellent people watching on the strip. the atrium room is also a very nice place to sit, but i'd avoid the rest of the place as it is very dark. they've just added a bunch of gas heaters on the patio, so there are no excuses not to enjoy the patio, even on the cooler nights.", 
            "sat out on the patio to eat al fresco style. it was a great lunch we had, sipping rose champagne while eating our food. i ordered the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>. the bread was perfectly buttered and grilled with the ham/bechamel sauce/gruyere cheese. i've wanted to try one of these sandwiches for a while and had to take the opportunity to order one. the french fry/potato chip hybrid potatoes were yummy! it was perfectly crispy and thin all at the same time. too bad more places don't offer this on their menu. i just wish the staff would have opened up the umbrellas, but supposedly it was a little too breezy. it had been several years since i'd eaten here and it was just as good as i remembered it. can't wait to come back the next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "whenever i come to vegas i make sure to block out at least one day during lunch time to head to mon ami. their <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> is to die for and their french fries...yum! for dessert, i would pretty much select anything off of the menu. everything is delicious. the ambiance just can't be beat either. i've been to paris before and even though this is smack dab in the middle of the vegas strip, i still feel like i'm back in france when i come here.\n\n i prefer to sit out on the patio (yes, even during the blazing summer) but you have to get there early and line up if you want your pick of seats (or make a reservation for later on in the day) but trust me, it's worth it. \n\nthe staff is always incredibly nice and attentive too. definitely \"as good as it gets!\"",

            "hands down one of my favorite restaurants in vegas. i mean we eat here at least 2-3 times each trip to vegas. the service tends to be very attentive and the prices are not wallet busting unlike some of the other places around town. i would be hard pressed to say what may favorite meal is here- breakfast ,lunch or dinner. so i will include my favorites from each- for breakfast i like the breakfast specials- they usually have at least two -one sweet and one savory -a crepe with fruit or some sort of eggs benedict <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> for example. for lunch i love the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>- a french version of a grilled  ham and cheese sandwich but don't let the simplicity fool you it is tasty. dinner favorite is the roast chicken and frites. nice view of the fountains at the bellagio across the street if you get a seat on the patio, but unless you come at an off hour the waits can be long for seating anywhere in this place.", 
            "we were staying at paris las vegas and decided to try this adorable restaurant in the hotel (out front, you can sit on the strip and watch people walk by and have the bellagio fountains as your view, it's pretty awesome).\n\nwhen i checked in around 1:00 or 1:30, i was told there was a 45-60 minute wait.  no problem, you get a beeper and it works anywhere in the casino/vicinity, so we could gamble or hang at a bar in the hotel.  after 10 minutes of waiting, i needed to run to the room to grab something, thinking we still had at least 30 minutes.  while i was gone, the beeper went off and my husband went to get our table.  they were really difficult wtih him, saying that he couldn't sit down until i was there, too.  my husband essentially said, \"she'll be right back, i'll wait for her at our table\", and didn't take no for an answer, so they sat him.  i was back in 10 minutes, but my husband was going to go ahead and order a bottle of wine for us, but the server never stopped at the table until i got there!  not sure if he was just that busy, or if they were trying to prove a point about our entire party not being there, but at any rate, it kind of sucked.  \n\nwe had a great bottle of french chardonnay and a loaf of their hot french bread.  the bread was awesome but sitting outside, it was so hot that the pot of butter completely melted!  most of the tables had umbrellas and were shaded, but were sitting right in the sun and we were burning up.  i had a salad and my husband had the mushroom soup to start, the soup was amazing.\n\nfor entrees, i had a cold crab and shrimp salad sandwich, served with homemade chips.  it was wonderful, nice and cool and refreshing when sitting in the hot sun!  delicious.  \n\nmy husband had the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> with fries.  the fries were tiny strips of potatoes, fried until crispy, and really good.  his sandwich was good, but a little boring.  there is normally more bechamel sauce on a <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>, this was pretty dry with very little sauce, but it did have nice flavors.\n\noverall, great lunch.  it was hot, so if you get stuck sitting in the sun, you might be miserable (i have no clue how people eat here in the middle of summer!), the view is amazing! i really want to come back for dinner, when it's cooler, and the bellagio fountains are all lit up.",

            "what a perfect place to have lunch in vegas.  i really couldn't imagine anything more perfect than sitting outside on the vegas strip enjoying lunch and a drink.  that's exactly what the hubs and i did this past week thanks to all the amazing reviews for this spot at paris las vegas.\n\nsince we were staying at paris, it was easy to make a lunch reservation and wonder downstairs to partake in some good food.  we asked to sit outside, which was accommodated.  it was cold and windy out, but the heaters were on and it was worth it to be able to people watch and enjoy the sunshine.  the atmosphere alone is reason enough to come to this restaurant, but when you add on fantastic food, your have a sure bet (please don't mind the vegas pun- lol).  \n\nso, as far as the food is considered... we shared the baked brie, french onion soup, and the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>.  though this was a cheese filled meal, it was sooo... good!  the baked brie was absolutely to die for.  it was served with toasted/salt and peppered bread, honey, roasted garlic, and toasted hazelnuts.  wow- i just started salivating thinking about it again.... the french onion soup was also great, but maybe a bit too much cheese (if there is such a thing).  the sandwich was awesome paired with crispy fries.  simple, but done well.  oh, the bread, a whole baguette, was warm and gone in 5 minutes.\n\nhaving stayed at paris before, i am disappointed i never ate here previously.  i can't say that mistake will ever happen again because i will surely eat here every time i am in vegas- that's a promise!", 
            "i should probably point out that my trip to mon ami gabi was a bit atypical.  a lot of reviews noted how long the wait was to get a table, but the five of us were fortunate enough to get seated outside immediately.  while that might have been luck, i'm sure when we were there had something to do with it too - a monday morning in early february.  had we been there on a weekend during the summer or spring break instead, it would have been a very different story...and possibly a very different review.\n\nalthough nothing we had really amazed (except the baguettes...so good!), i thought the food was pretty solid overall (four stars is about right).  since my friend and i both wanted to try the sea scallop gratin\\u00e9es, we decided to share an order while i went with the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> for myself.\n\n- sea scallop gratin\\u00e9es (<mark>Caramelized Sea Scallops</mark> with caramelized fennel, onion marmalade, and mussel cream) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=mawqupejv5obmfbvs95eba) - the scallops were pretty standard, but i really liked the mussel cream, onion, and fennel.  despite how good it was, i'm not sure i would get it again since i feel like i can find something comparable in sf.\n- <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=uhua_eshqrfwewm6xz-kuq) - pretty damn tasty.  unlike others i've tried, there was a nice balance between the gruyere and cr\\u00e8me fraiche.  the corners of the bread were a little hard and dry, but it's a pretty minor quibble.  and the fries?  delicious.\n\nwhat made me give them five stars though were their baguettes (yes, that good...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jnxuyy8wbaadmk3bpzlww?select=noliktr7ihc8b3ekajbwiq) and the service.  our waitress was terrific - accommodating, friendly, and checked on our table quite often.  what stood out though was how honest she was.  when i asked her about the soup <mark>Oysters <mark>Poisson Du Jour</mark></mark> (soup of the day - cream of garlic), she actually recommended i skip it since she thought it was pretty salty.  i passed as she suggested, but she was nice enough to bring out a espresso cup of the soup anyways so i could see for myself...and she was right.  not sure if many other servers would have done the same thing.\n\nconsidering it's the strip, the lunch prices seemed relatively fair, but i can't say if the same is true for their dinner menu.  still, the view alone might be worth the money.  with the bellagio right across the street, i imagine it's pretty awesome to watch their water shows while you eat.  that is, assuming it's on while you're there.  it wasn't for us...", 
            "since my fiancee and i stayed at paris.. i got to dine here quite often.. mostly for breakfast while she slept.. i will say.. they have plenty awesome items on the menu.. but the corn beef has was excellent.. they do occasionally burn the toast and give you soggy hash browns.. but they will replace it.. overall.. it's a pretty great place to hang out and grab breakfast or lunch.. their <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> is also very good..", 
            "after visiting a few times, the verdict is..this restaurant is definitely mon ami!\n\nthe first time i went was for brunch. i made a reservation in advance so i was able to request a table on the patio. it was wonderful to dine outside with the sun shining, a front row seat to the bellagio fountain show, and a great view for people watching. \n\nnow for the food..they served baguettes as the free bread! they were all warm and toasty in cute paper bags, like something you'd get from a bakery. i ordered the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>, which was pretty good. what i really enjoyed was the french fries that came on the side. they had an interesting flat shape which made them super crispy on the outside but still soft and chewy on the inside.\n\nthe next time i went was for dinner. i had the steak frites which was perfectly cooked and it was a very generous portion for the price of $25.95. the best part was, they let me have multiple sauces on the side at no extra cost. i tried the peppercorn sauce and the caramelized onion, red wine sauce; both were delicious. the baguettes were still free, unlimited, and just as good as i remembered.\n\nthe third time i went was for happy hour. i had 2 glasses of sangria, pate, and yes i had me some free baguettes. then, i ended my very happy two hours with a warm chocolate pudding with salted caramel cream. it was absolutely decadent.\n\nau revoir mon ami, until next time!",

            "one of my favorite restaurants in vegas because the quality and type of food they serve is comparable to what i ate when i went to paris. i like their escargot - garlicky and simple, cooked the correct way as the french would.  great steak frites - i like mine cooked medium rare.  it is a thin piece of steak and it's buttery and comes with frites which are very crispy (please don't ask for steak sauce!!!).  warm brie cheese - creamy and is perfect with their warm baguette. <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> - the presentation is a bit different.  instead of egg or melted cheese on top, theirs is cheese on top but it's not melted and the whole sandwich itself is lacking creaminess and it comes with frites as well but it's quite alright. \n\nyou can't go to a french restaurant without having chocolate mousse and profiteroles.  the chocolate mousse is semi-sweet so it's bitter and a bit sweet - the perfect chocolate!  it's smooth as silk and melts in your mouth.  you have to trust this chocoholic!  the profiteroles are cream puffs with vanilla ice cream drizzled in chocolate fudge sauce.  that's a pretty graphic description so i don't think an explanation is necessary.\n\nthey're always and i mean always busy.  be smart and reserve a table at least 24 hours ahead.  their patio has an excellent view of bellagio's fountain show.  think date night.\n\nservice has been consistently good no matter how busy they are.  i always leave mon ami happy.",

            "went to gabi's last tuesday before leaving las vegas and fellow yelpers did not steer me wrong.  excellent food and excellent service and, and and... (very important for vegas-on the strip restaurants... the prices were extremely fair for the quality of the food.  (hey, gabi management.... don't start raising prices cause i said this!!! )  all i am saying is that if you go to some of the dumpy restaurants in some of the hotels, you pay through the nose for food that belongs inside a septic tank before its time.  for example, there is a restaurant in the rio that wants 28 for a chicken pot pie.. really rio? \nhad the steak <mark>Salmon <mark>Au Poivre</mark></mark>, trout, and <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>.  one of my guests who had the steak told me it was soooooo delicious that if she were home she would be licking the plate until it no longer needed washing... (a beautiful image). the guest who had the trout said it was the best trout he ever had... and the croque monsiuer was excellent but a little on the greasy side because of all the butter and cheese.  i think gabi's can cut back a little on the butter since the delicious gruyere cheese that it is made with provides most of the fat this sandwich needs.  i must share with you that i am a french onion soup aficionado.  i eat it here and in my favorite city in the whole wide world---paris.  well, i ordered the french onion soup at gabi's and it looked amazingly beautiful-- a tall crock of soup with melted gruyere cheese perfectly broiled on top resulting in gorgeous spots of darkened gruyere--yum.  however, then i tasted it.  it was reeking with sugar.  yes sugar.  so sweet i couldn't eat it.  when i beckoned the waiter to discuss it, he told me the onions caused the sweetness because they were sweet onions.  in response to the waiter's answer, i am going to put on the voice of an irate waiter in paris. (now use your imagination and think of a balding, older gentleman who has been on his feet for at least 7 hours dealing with american tourists)  they go deep into their throats before saying : 'noh! (that would be an american \"no\".)  i too say no to the theory that the onions caused the sweetness.  do you know why?  because i cook  that's why!  i believe that this soup has been americanized to address the palettes of some americans (i said some so don't write back insulting me!).  they added sugar, lots of it and because of the color of the soup,  i believe they added some marsala wine which also provides some sweetness.  the ending of the french onion soup saga is that they graciously took it back.  they are a class act.  and did i forget about the service????   amazing.  one of my guests had their water glass filled 7 times.  i'm not kidding.  and, and, and, did i forget to tell you about the baguette????  yes,  a complete baguette in a bakery bag--- delivered still warm from the oven presented with a generous portion of spreadable butter.  yes spreadable --not those hard little bricks most restaurants serve.  and did i tell you we sat on the patio overlooking the strip?  with misters to keep us cool???  why did i leave thist to the end?.....  because the food was the star of the show.   i am sooooooo sorry that i went to gabi's on my last day in vegas.... if i had been there the first day, i would have chained my leg to one of the tables on the patio and eaten there every day breakfast, lunch and dinner... i would allow someone to take me to the bathroom every few hours only if they promise to give me back my table upon my return.  otherwise, i'll skip the bathroom breaks.     thanks gabi management and staff for a wonderful experience and having a really great restaurant!", 
            "and the best gluten free menu award goes too.... da ta da daaaa! mon ami knows how to cater to us ciliacs. with gluten free option bread to start and an entire gf menu you really cant go wrong here. every time i come here i always start with the warm brie cheese. accompanied with black pepper honey and my gf bread you will fall in love. they also have very reasonable martinis here. a ciroc martini is only $12. by far one of the best prices on the strip.\ni also never miss the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> sandwich. gf bread with ham, gruyere cheese, creme fraiche and it comes with their infamous frites. talk about cheese heaven... they also use a separate fryer for the fries, so there is no flour contamination. \nyou also cant beat the view. sitting on the patio (everyones favorite) it over looks the bellagio water show. \nfinish any meal you have here with their creme brulee. holy wow it is yummy. a great dining experience. throw in a few drinks and its only around $60ish a person.",

            "what an adorable place for a lunch or brunch! if your timing is good or if you're willing to wait, the patio is the perfect place to enjoy your meal. unfortunately, the patio was closed for a private event when i was there. \n\nmy family and i stopped by for a sunday lunch/brunch. their menu has a good variety of items so everyone should be able to find something they want. that morning, the warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> was calling my name and i had to answer. i loved my sandwich! it was warm and creamy from the brie, sweet from the caramelized onions, and a bit tart from the green apples. i think i may have to re-create this combination at home! accompanying my sandwich was a cone full of their fries. i'm not sure if i'd call them fries though. they were flat and wider than other fries which made them crispy in some places. it was more of a cross between a fry and a chip, a \"frip\" if you will. \n\ni also sampled the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> and the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> from my family members. both were tasty as well! my one complaint is that the butter that came with our demi baguette was cold. why was it cold? the bread wasn't warm so the cold butter didn't make sense. \n\nfor a nice restaurant on the vegas strip, the prices seemed pretty reasonable. the space was a bit cramped though. be prepared to potentially bump elbows with the person at the next table.", 
            "this is a must stop brunch spot for every trip i take to las vegas! the service is always wonderful, the food is impeccable, and the gorgeous patio views of the strip is an added perk. it's one of the gems on the strip where the quality of the food far outweighs the price that you pay for it. \n\ni always order the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> (around $13 and a couple of people could split the plate). frankly, it's so delicious that i never have the desire to stray from it. it's wonderfully toasted and the combination of cheese and ham are present in the perfect ratio so either flavor isn't too over-whelming. the hand-cut fries that are included with the plate are seasoned and fried to perfection! \n\nmy most recent visit was particularly memorable. mark z. was our server and he was extremely attentive, pleasant, and actually cared about having a conversation with us (quite refreshing considering we are in our early 20's). we showed up around 9am on a sunday and were able to be seated right away on the patio which had a direct view of the bellagio fountains. \n\nwe started our meal with the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> (about $12) and i can definitely say that i will never skip ordering this delicious plate from this point on. the tomato sauce was perfectly thick and creamy, the <mark>Baked Goat Cheese</mark> was some of the best i have ever tasted, and the generous serving of garlic bread was perfectly buttery and crispy. my mouth is literally watering just thinking about it! \n\nmy boyfriend said the coffee that he ordered was some of the best he has ever tasted... so that's highly recommended! \n\nall in all, this place is absolutely incredible and i recommend it to every single person that i know that is taking a vegas vacation! kudos, mon ami, gabi!", 
            "i have been to mon ami gabi on a number of occasions over the years, but hadn't been in about a year or so.\n\ni came here for lunch recently and the food and service were not what i remember. the plates and cups on the table were dusty and a little grimey. the food was not as tasty as previous visits. i have never been totally in love with the food, but it was always decent and the location and price point made it that much better. \n\nthe lobster roll was overly creamy and mayonnaise-y and the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> was ok and probably the best dish of the meal. our dining companion found a hair in their salad and it took a long time to get our server's attention to get that fixed. after that her replacement dish was slow to arrive. \n\nit was a busy sunday, so i understand that they were slower than usual but that didn't explain the dusty plates and glasses. \n\nit's still a decent restaurant to visit to enoy the patio and view of the fountains, the food just isn't as good as it used to be.",

            "after deciding to punish myself for being exceedingly hungover we walked about a mile to this highly reviewed place looking forward to a late breakfast. we were sol though at noon on a weekday. server said it wasn't \"fair\" to the cooks to have to serve a breakfast menu along with the lunch menu. ok, whatever.\n\ndh ordered a burger medium rare with fruit and i ordered a <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>. burger was served with fries instead. got the fruit after bringing to server's attention. burger came medium and was really dry. my sandwich was horrid. bread was stale, not crisp and fries were meh. only thing really impressed with was the baguette and sangria.\n\nserver was pretty nice though. sat inside and wasn't crowed at all on a tuesday. view on the patio is nice and great place to watch the fountains at the bellagio.\n\nmight try once more for brunch but not holding my breath."

            "being located right in front of the bellagio fountain really boosts up the ambiance.   my friends and i went for a bachelorette brunch on a saturday afternoon.  there was no wait and were seated right away in the patio area with reservations... although they don't take reservations for that area.  yay.  \n\nwe started off with the mussels in white wine sauce which was bomb.  it wasn't as heavy and creamy as i expected it to be.  the sauce and mussels were cooked perfectly. \n\nbrunch:\n\nthe corn beef hash with poached eggs was just okay.  although my friend wasn't a fan, i thought it was okay.  eggs benedict was good but the muffin was extremely hard.  my friend's muffin was almost burnt.  wonder if this is how it's usually served here.. hashbrown was yummy but you can tell that they used a ton of butter..\n\nthe menu was reasonably priced (esp the brunch menu).  i don't understand all the \"overpriced\" complaints here. the <mark>Pulled Pork Brisket Banh Mi</mark> sandwhich was yummy and baguette used was surprisingly soft.   frites were also good and you can taste that it was made from fresh potatoes.. but it was more on the harder & crispier side.  are frites supposed to be served crispy??  i guess that's what i get for expecting french fries.   for some reason i thought it was the same thing.  \n\nservice was a bit on the slow side as it was pretty packed in the restaurant.  but overall everything was great and i would definitely go back for brunch!",

(feel free to ask for the other places)\n\nin closing i would just like to say...\n\ni work in a casino and when people ask my advice for a good place to go eat. mon ami gabi is usually one of the first places i would suggest. \n\ngreat place to feel that \"las vegas experience\".\n\ngreat view for the bellagio fontains, people watching, or maybe even that significant other sitting on the other side of the table from you.\n\ngreat selections on the menu. decent prices that won't empty your wallet or purses.\n\ni would suggest, when taking a trip to las vegas, put mon ami gabi on you bucket list for places to go eat. read less",

            "my friend gabi or mon ami gabi (in case you didn't know what it meant in english, gabi is short for gabino the owner/chef) is probably my favorite local steakhouse. i bring all my closest friends here, whether they're local or visiting.  my boyfriend hosted my surprise bday party here too, so they do great with groups.  mag is always a sure fire hit and it's the kind of place you know will impress and satisfy your guests without seeming overly booshie. \n\nwhile the food is always superb i think the ambiance and location really makes it an instant crowd pleaser, even before we crack the awesome fresh warm baguettes (that keep coming by the way, all you gotta do is ask).  in the evening the lighting is low and romantic with candles at every table.  in the day, the wonderful floor to ceiling window/doors from the patio let wonderful natural light in.  the key selling point is the patio seating that gives u a great view of the bellagio fountains.  you can't reserve patio seating though so you can try to reserve a table in the atrium that sometimes gives just as good as a view :) \n\nnow for the food!\n\nmy must order every visit is the fliet mingon with merlot butter and the steamed mussels for an appetizer.  my first couple times i've tried some other steak variations and sauces but my heart belongs to the filet! :) i order it medium and it's just melt in your mouth \"mmmmm\" after every bite good.  \n\nsteaks can be prepared anyway you like. they have set pairings like a certain cut with a certain sauce however, you can pair any sauce with any cut of meat just ask :) oh and every steak comes with frites (or awesome french fries)! \n\nthe steamed mussels are my absolute favorite the sauce they come in is a classic white wine with leeks and bacon but done to perfection!  make sure you dip your warm french bread in the sauce it's delicious! \n\nlunch is also a good option here because they serve great specials not normally on the menu.  the last time i went to lunch and brought my cousin's bachelorettes/bridal party here and the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> was sooo delicious! my sister ordered it and i ended up eating half  of it and my filet (yes i still ordered my filet at lunch...it's that good)!\n\nso if you're looking for an awesome casual steak place on the strip that really gives you or your guests that \"i'm in las vegas\" feel give mon ami gabi a try, you won't be sorry.", 
            "okay, it might not be the best french inspired restaurant around but it offers some of the best views of bellagio and has the shorted wait time for a table than any other restaurant inside the paris hotel. \n\nthe mussels are average\nthe <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> is average\nthe crab salad sandwich was fair\nbut the scallops are awesome. \n\nfor you cocktail lovers, they also have a great cocktail menu to sip on while enjoying the fountain show at the bellagio.",

            "disappointed!\n\ni came here with friends for lunch and was looking forward to sitting in the patio. too bad the wait was an hour so we decided to sit inside. of all the available seats, we were seated next to the door that had a draft. luckily, the server allowed us to move over one table. \n\nwarm bread was provided when the server came along. \n\nwe started off with <mark>Wild Escargots De Bourgogne</mark> ($10.50). it was described as \"oven-roasted snails, garlic-herb butter.\" it was decent. not enough butter for my taste and a bit too much garlic. however, dipping the hard bread in the sauce was still okay. unless you're really craving for escargot, i'd pass on this dish.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> cooked medium w/au jus, mustard mayo, caramelized onions ($13.95) and that came with their \"signature hand-cut frites.\"  i think i should have ordered this medium-rare because the steak was not as tender as i would like. overall, it was a simple sandwich and the sauces complimented well. their frites were definitely different from what i'm use to. like most of the reviewers have said, these are borderline potato chips! my friend and i kept calling them a tease. it was too thin to fulfill us...\n\ni would have given this place two stars but the server was engaging and attentive. \n\nsooo.....unless i was going to be seated in the patio with a few bloody marys in hand, i doubt i'd come back here for lunch.",

            "i'm a big fan of this place, it's got a great view of the strip and the bellagio fountain.  while the wait can be a bit long to get a table outside it's worth it.  the food is also cheap (but not you can taste it cheap).  <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> with caramelized onions yes please! oh i mean oui, s'il vous pla\\u00eet!\n\nthe atmosphere is really relaxing and i see no problem with catching a few drinks and watching the fountain show and people watching for several hours.  service is prompt and proper with a wine cart assisting the crew to carry around some good inventory.",

            "pardon my french, but this place is the shizzz. there isn't a better restaurant on the strip that blends quality of food, service, scenery and ambiance. just ate lunch here a little while ago. \n\ni ordered the steak frites. a staple dish of the restaurant that every other table had someone eating. its a thin steak rich in flavor alone, but amplified by one of their 4 signature sauces. the waiter recommended the bordelaise sauce, caramelized onions in a red wine sauce. great pick, it was amazing. next time i will try the brandy peppercorn sauce! other dishes at my table were the warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> and the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. both looked delicious, particularly the chicken and brie.\n\nthe cool thing about this restaurant is that it is in the paris hotel overlooking the bellagio across the street. you can eat outside on the elevated patio away from all the foot traffic. so while you are eating a beautiful meal, you are at the same time in the middle of the strip possibly watching the bellagio water fountain show. \n\nthe food, service and scenery causes sensory overload. bring your date here if you want to seal the deal.",

            "yummm !\n\nso the last 2 times i've been to vegas, i've eaten at this place. the first time i was brought by a cold tofu classmate that recently moved to the area. its a nice french style steakhouse that serves steaks, sandwiches, seafood and the like. walking in here really reminded me of my wonderful time in france and of all my amazing journeys. it seriously took me home :*)\n\nthe first time i was here, i tried the french onion soup, moules-frites and the escargot.\n\nnow, i must say that since walking into this place brought back so many intense memories of happier times, i was really setting the bar high for the food. maybe a little too high? if i were to compare my dishes to those i tried in france, then i must say that the food was just mediocre at best. \n\nthe french onion soup was definitely wayy too salty to be consumed without the amazingly fresh bread that they brought out to our table. we asked for bread about 6 times throughout our meal, and every time, it came fresh outta the oven and piping hot. that's how bread should be (: on the plus side, if you're a poor college student coming to vegas to party and want a slice of the good life, you could always come and order a bowl of french onion soup and dip it with the bottomless bread they have here. that would definitely get you full while letting you basque in the french ambience for a while. just saying (;\n\nmy mussels were also a tad on the fishy side, the sauce a bit too salty for my liking but my fries were outta this world deeelicious ! although, i must say that they are definitely not french style frites. these fries are sliced thinner than usual and so they are crispy all around, and stay that way throughout your whole meal ! (even 3 hours later back in our room at planet hollywood !) \n\nmy escargot was also on the saltier side (seriously, i used to smoke, so i definitely don't eat my food bland. if everything i ordered was too salty for my taste than something's gotta give), but i think it had to be like that to help cover the \"unfresh\" aroma of the actual snail. once again, that's where the bread came in handy ! the herb butter sauce that the escargot was prepared in was super flavorful, it just had a handful too many pinches of salt and so it needed the super carb of the bread to help soak it up.\n\nthat night, the friend that brought me had ordered a steak bearnaise on my recommendation. (it was one of my favorites in france, along with the steak roquefort. nommm) the bearnaise was a bit thin, but the flavor was spot on. and it came with a side of their amazing frites that just complete the meal.\n\njust a month later i decided to take the fam here for lunch during labor day weekend. there wasn't a wait, which was amazing for a saturday at 12 ! they seated us in the bright dining area with open windows, and ac blasted on high ! it felt so great to be able to be seated \"outdoors\" without the 100 degree plus weather.\n\nthe menu is different for lunch, as it should be i suppose ! the entrees are a lot lighter, and there are more salads and sandwiches to choose from. we ordered the tuna melt, <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>, bacon cheeseburger, and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. every sandwich/burger came an order of delicious fries ! i believe the only sandwich that stood out among all of our choices would have to be the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. it was flavorful, the steak was tender and the side of au jus to dip had just the right amount of kick to it ! i believe it was a grainy mustard that made the difference ! the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was a total disappointment, i believe there were literally 8 bites of overdressed salad for $10 and we could have added another 2 and just got another burger or sandwich. will definitely never order a salad form here again. i would have been much happier with wendy's caesar side salad for $1 ! that's how bad it was :/\n\nanyway, i know that i will definitely be back to visit this wonderful place again sometime in the future to try their <mark>Chilled Seafood Platter</mark> ! i saw a couple eating it together and it looked so scrump-diddly-umptious ! hahahaha, definitely needa find a bf to take me here for that one day (;\nhappy eating !", 
            "i've ventured to mon ami gabi a handful of times- one of the few places that, as a local, i enjoy going to on the strip- & truly feel it's a place everyone should treat themselves to, at least once. when i go somewhere like, say, pf chang's, it's generally the same experience every time. each experience at mon ami has been a different vibe but all equally enjoyable. over the years, my g.f.'s & i have joked about playing hooky & meeting there for the afternoon. i'd recommend reservations, if possible; otherwise, depending on the day/time, anticipate a bit of a wait. i've never been disappointed by the fare. leading up to today's celebratory work lunch, i had my tastebuds set on the <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark> but made a last minute switch to the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. upon my 2nd or 3rd bite, i enthusiastically declared \"i don't even like meat but if it all tasted like this, i'd love it!\" there's a misconception that mon ami is \\u00fcber pricey but it's really not that much different than going to places like outback, cheesecake factory, (the previously mentioned) pf chang's, etc. the ambiance is spot-on, even when it's a packed saturday nite, & the service is consistent. a few items to take into consideration: warm brie cheese appetizer, mussels, <mark>Grilled Chicken Paillard</mark>, onion soup, quiche, warm chicken & <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>, <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> & flourless chocolate cake. go. eat. take in the moment. enjoy.",

            "welcome to disney land!  a beautiful fa\\u00e7ade of a parisian cafe worthy of a single visit.  after that, the spell breaks.  \n\nquick and dirty:\n\n- three dining spaces (outdoor overlooking lv blvd facing the fountains of bellagio, indoor sun room, indoor steak house). \n\n- three check-in lines (outdoor wait list, indoor wait list, confirmed reservation).\n\n- franco / american caf\\u00e9 menu at reasonable prices.  \n\n- great selection of french wines by the glass or bottle.  glass prices are very high.\n\n- friendly, bordering on unprofessional service (faked french accents for some tables, parisian style silence for others).\n\n\nthe food is below average.  high point;  the baked brie starter.  served in a hot baking dish, accented with hazel nut oil and honey that perfumes the air.  unctuous.  rich.  just good eats.  unfortunately, the escargot is the opposite.  tender morsels of snail dressed with hard parsley stems.  ack.\n\nmains fail to deliver. a paltry two ounce, <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> served with an overly reduced, sweet onion au jus.  a <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> made with pressed deli ham.  very low quality (sub usda choice), albeit inexpensive steaks.  frites that accompany almost every dish are terrible.  some crisp, most soggy, rubbery, and oily.\n\nworth a single visit to enjoy a bottle of wine and see the fountain show.  after all, the parisian authenticity is enhanced by the confetti of playboyesque images on cards that litter the sidewalk below and well lit mobile billboards of  scantily clad \"hot hot hot ladies\" crossing your view.", 
            "ummmm why did i not come here years ago?!!! i've probably been to vegas nearly 10 times since mon ami gabi opened and always figured this was a tourist trap and therefore the food would be meh. whoa was i wrong! okay, well it still is a tourist trap --- but a delicious trap if i may say so! my gays and girls went to sunday brunch here on a whim. they immediately sat us at a fantastic table facing the bellagio fountain in the atrium. the dining room is so dark, but that atrium is where all the light is held hostage! \n\nour friendly server explained the menu and we got to ordering (because we were starving after a night and *ahem* morning of drinking)... my friend and i split the french onion soup since it looked massive and decadent (and it was!). it was just right! cheesy, ooey and gooey, and just salty enough. mhmm! oh and since they give every fresh bread to start off with, the soup accompanied that just beautifully. yay for dipping it in the soup! my girlfriends took advantage of the bloody mary bar. omg the fact you can make your own bloody mary is reason enough to come! they have hickory sticks!! i don't know why that got me so excited, but it did. it made me want to run to the hickory farms store and get reaaaall with buying some! (i know. sounds kinda sad. guilty food pleasure...) \n\ni ordered the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> which sounded \"ordinary.\" well, hell to the no it wasn't! wow. that cheesy bun, the mayo sauce, the steak, the jus... and fries?!?! sunday funday for sure!! i also ordered a republic of tea for an iced non-alcoholic beverage. yum. \n\nwhile i know this is not necessarily the most authentic french bistro food, it was still dang amazing! perhaps that is still the post-partying foodie talking in me, but hey, if you want something satisfying and reasonably priced (especially for vegas!), this is the place to go.... oh, and the strip view from the atrium (or patio) during the meal? that's half of the experience right there! i have to return!",

            "my wife, daughter and son-in-law recently made a road trip to las vegas from their home in palo alto. our lunch here was perhaps my best meal there, and it was also surprisingly affordable, at least by the standards of the vegas strip. the location is also great.\n\ni had the steak frites classique, which was superb, and well worth the 20-some dollars i paid for it. the steak was perfectly prepared (i ordered it medium rare), and was accompanied by a large mound of interesting and tasty french fries, fresh cut into ribbon shapes. (see my daughter adrienne m's review for photos.) i am informed that the fries taste very good cold the next day, like good potato chips. my wife had the lobster roll, which was her second choice (she had asked for the <mark>Trout Almondine</mark>, but was told after she ordered it that the trout had not made it to the restaurant yet that day). she was, however, very satisfied with her lobster roll, and was particularly pleased that it was served on a maine-style bun. my sil enjoyed his <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. my daughter wasn't wild about her chicken/brie/apple sandwich; she thought it had a sour taste. the bite she gave me did have a bit of a sour taste to it (probably from the apples), but i didn't mind it at all, although being a true carnivore i preferred my steak. \n\nthe meal was preceded by a fabulous crusty baguette, served with butter. this didn't last long with the four of us, but a request for a second was cheerfully and promptly satisfied (no extra charge).\n\nservice was also very good, prompt and courteous at all times.\n\nhighly recommended for an excellent and reasonably priced meal in a town where these two descriptions often contradict one another.",

            "came here for lunch and had a <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> and the boyfriend had their steak. per him the steak was very good. my sandwich was a 3 stars. it was more quantity than quality. the meat was chewy and a tad thicker than my liking on a sandwich. i only had half of it. the menu was also rather small. i say come here if you want cheap steak and fries.  look at the menu before coming. i would come back only to check out their breakfast.", 
            "if you enjoy decent food and good service, this may be a good choice for you. i came here on a tuesday morning so there was no wait. usually on the weekend it's best to make reservations because this place is packed!\n\ni ordered the merlot steak for lunch and it was delicious! the merlot wine mixed well and made the steak very flavorful. this is one of their signature dish. my girlfriend had their <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> which she did not enjoy too much due to the lack of greens. my previous visit with mon ami i ordered their lobster roll which i did not find all that impressive.\n\nservice has always been top notch. although not all the items on the menu may be favorable to an individual's particular taste i believe that there are certain dishes that are worth coming back for. this restaurant has a great view of the bellagio fountain.", 
            "love this place! great views, great food and great service!  we love the steak frites, steak at pouvre and we have gone for sandwiches for brunch.  love the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>.  ask for outdoor seating to watch the fountains.", 
            "came here for lunch the other day and everything was delicious and affordable! we were seated promptly, despite it being during lunch rush, and were given a table on the patio with an amazing view of the bellagio fountains. our server was french and brought us our drinks and a warm baguette almost immediately. i ordered the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> and my sister ordered the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. let me just say that this <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark> was by far the best one i have ever had. the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> was also great but paled in comparison to the <mark>Croque Monsieur</mark>! overall, the meal was fantastic and i would highly recommend eating here!", 
            "we have been here about 10 times and it is a must when we are in las vegas. yesterday my wife had the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark> and i had the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. both we excellent as was the service. the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> is actually roast beef that is quite tender and the bread it is on is to die for. sit on the patio, it is worth the wait.", 
            "i'm pretty bummed that this place didn't meet my expectations. i have been wanting to try this place out for years but never got the chance to. my last trip to vegas was for my birthday, so i decided to do a birthday brunch here. i made reservations for 8 for a little after noon. \n\nthe food was very mediocre. i tried just about a little bit of everything because my friends and i all got something different. i wish the menu was a little more specific on what came with each item, because when i got my own personal order, i wasn't pleased. i ended up switching with someone else. i think the best thing i had tried was the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> that my boyfriend got. \n\nour server however, was very nice! he wasn't super attentive but he wasn't ignoring us either. we asked him for a couple wine recommendations and he was happy to oblige. \n\nwe definitely had a good time with the wine and service, but i don't think i would come back on my next vegas trip.", 
            "first time i came here, i didn't like this place at all but that was when i ordered something totally wrong--a cheeseburger.  i came back again and fell in love. \n\nmon ami gabi is located inside paris hotel but their outside patio is right on the strip.  they are always busy so try to come at off times if you're planning to dine here for lunch or dinner.  i've only been here for lunch on the weekends but i'd definitely recommend this spot to anyone who's never been.\n\nmy boyfriend and i shared:\n<mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> & <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> upon recommendation.\n\nthey also give you bread and butter to start off with which is always a plus in my book.\ni also noticed they had a bloody mary bar in the middle of the restaurant that i thought was interesting.  if i was a bigger bloody mary fan i would've been down to try it but perhaps next time.\n\nthe <mark>Onion Soup Au Gratin</mark> was a lot bigger than expected and boy was i glad!  definitely one of the top french onion soups i've ever had--the soup had a savory flavor with onions, bread and tons of melted cheese.  the warm bread they bring out to you while you wait, also pairs well with this soup.  must get!\n\nthe <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> was amaaaaaazing.  i was so happy i went with this recommendation as it did not disappoint one bit! we asked for our steak to be medium rare and it came out with peppercorn mayo and tons of carmelized onions.  everything complemented each other and each bite was better than the first.  the steak was so tender and juicy... and the buns they used were warm and soft.  the sandwich also came out with fries too which were good but nothing special.  i actually prefer my fries to be a bit more crispier.  \n\nthe service was excellent and there isn't really anything to complain about except i do wish the tables were a bit further apart from each other.  maybe it's just me but it feels like all the tables are closely set to each other and a bit crammed.  the prices are a bit steep but then again, it is vegas so it's expected.  i'd definitely recommend this place for lunch.", 
            "had the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. good food great location. too hot on the patio at 4:00 but the view was great. it would have been nice to have more shade.", 
            "i have worked in las vegas quite a bit in the last two years. i work in tv and often i am shooting for 8-10 weeks at a time. i always listen to locals. my local crew members raved on and on about mon ami gabi. not that i need to be pressured to eat french food. \n\nmy first bit of advice is to wait until you can sit on the patio. while the paris casino is a disney version of the actual paris, the atmosphere on the patio will make you feel quite parisian. \n\nmy second bit of advice is that you will more than likely get a spot on the patio during lunch time. there is simply less of a crowd at the door. \n\nwhen you are seated you will be presented immediately with a warm delicious baguette with soft butter. i ordered a glass of wine and a <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. the service was excellent as was the food.\n\ni took my time here and felt no pressure to leave. it was delightful", 
            "this is one of the best restaurants in vegas. the boyfriend and i came here and loved everything we ate. we ordered: \n\n<mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> medium - probably the best <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> i've ever had. i had no idea a <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> could taste so good. and it went with the dip so well. the bread is soft enough to be chewed on, but hard enough to not get all soggy once dipped. \nchicken and <mark>Chicken & Mushroom Crepe</mark> - delicious flavors in this crepe. it had brie cheese, which made it all the much better. \n<mark>Salmon Tartare</mark> - the <mark>Salmon Tartare</mark> was delicious and fresh, with nice crunchy chips and avocado. \nfrench onion soup - delicious french onion soup with the beautiful layer of cheese on top. i think the only good memories i have of great french onion soup has been in vegas. \n\nthe seating was perfect. we asked to be seated outdoors, but we weren't placed literally outside. instead, we were still under an air conditioned glass room, where we had an outdoor view of the poor passerbys suffering the hot sun. we got the best of both worlds. \n\nour server wasn't the best. she was rude and inattentive, but the food was so good i couldn't care less. \n\ni'd come back.", 
            "i really like this place. the food is good, the ambience and view are great! i had the <mark>Seafood Crepe</mark>, which was delicious. my kids enjoyed the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. husband said the french onion soup was good. i was here back in may 2015 with friends and we all enjoyed it then, too. if you like thick steak fries, don't order the frites. if you like them thin and crispy, you're in luck! great place to relax with a glass of wine and enjoy the view!", 
            "yesterday, my wife, fran and i went back to celebrate her birthday.  we last went to mon ami gabi in august of 2014. we waited to long to return.\n\nsome people call me a \"foodie\". basically because i love to go to different restaurants. fran and i have been to several different places along las vegas boulevard. today the weather was perfect with a good strong breeze. i suggested we try someplace with patio dining. fran, who was driving decided we were going to mon ami gabi.\n\nin all the places we have eaten, zach was easily the most professional of servers we have ever encountered. i honestly hope he sees this review, he does deserve the praise.\n\nokay, on to the meals...\n\nfran ordered the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> with caramelized onions and peppercorn mayo. \nshe enjoyed every last bite. the first time we went to mon abi gabi, i ordered the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> and immediately took note of the long cut made through the sandwich. i the meal was \"just what the doctor ordered.\" i am kinda surprised i didn't order it a second time. but since fran ordered it i decided to try something different.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Pulled Pork Brisket Banh Mi</mark> sandwich. served with sriracha mayo and pickled vegetables, and cilantro. there was a little more mayo then i like, but it was easily overlooked after a bite or two, it's a sandwich you will have to lick your fingers while devouring.\n\nwe both had hand cut frites with out meal. so far only a few places on las vegas boulevard would i say were better than these. (feel free to ask for the other places)\n\nin closing i would just like to say...\n\ni work in a casino and when people ask my advice for a good place to go eat. mon ami gabi is usually one of the first places i would suggest. \n\ngreat place to feel that \"las vegas experience\".\n\ngreat view for the bellagio fontains, people watching, or maybe even that significant other sitting on the other side of the table from you.\n\ngreat selections on the menu. decent prices that won't empty your wallet or purses.\n\ni would suggest, when taking a trip to las vegas, put mon ami gabi on you bucket list for places to go eat. read less", 
            "i came here with a party of 10 for a bridal shower and had such a wonderful experience. we sat close to the window and the lighting was great for our pictures. i ordered the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> and everything tasted on point. i'm just sad i didn't have enough room to finish it myself, but that meant there was more to share with my friends! the staff was really friendly and professional, thanks for making it memorable!", 
            "the food was mediocre at best. i ordered the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. the entire meal was too greasy and had entirely too much mayo on the bread. the service was nice, but the restaurant was really hot and very little space between tables.", 
            "terrific spot located directly across from the bellagio fountain. fantastic view of the water show while you enjoy french/ american menu.  the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> is a tasty choice. highly recommended. great place to take friends and family that want to \"hang out on the strip\"", 
            "nice place, with lots of room and very attentive.  we came on thanksgiving mid afternoon hoping for breakfast/brunch but because of the holiday they weren't serving it; understandable.\n\nordered a simple <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> with fries and a <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark>.  both were very good, but the complimentary bread is straight up addictive!  we also saw some of the other dishes that came out of the kitchen, like the french onion soup that looked tasty.  had a very good server who checked in often, even on such a busy day.  it's decently price, would recommend to anyone visiting here, but please stay away from the hotel in general. i would say that's the only negative of the restaurant, and only positive of the hotel.", 
            "i absolutely love this place!! my friend took me here for an early birthday treat and we had the best experience anyone could imagine. our server, billy, was so welcoming, down to earth and funny, i wanted him to be my bestfriend! haha\n\nanyways, the food was amazing. i don't remember what i ordered exactly but i know i got a medium rare steak, my friend ordered a <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> with fries and both were cooked perfectly. everything about this restaurant is perfect to be completely honest. the view, food, and customer service. i highly recommend and i will definitely come back!", 
            "we go to mon ami gabi almost every time we visit las vegas. \nwe love to sit on the patio and people watch while we dine but this trip it was too cold so we sat in the sunroom.\nthe food was a bit disappointing this trip. \nit wasn't that it was bad but we have high standard for this place because it's always so good. \ni had the spinach salmon salad. not that great. \nour guest had the hamburger and ordered it rare and it was a hockey puck well done. he has to send it back it was so bad. \nmy husband had the club sandwich that tasted like nothing special.\nthe best thing was the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark> my son had with the delicious au jus. \nwe had both pate appetizers and that was the only saving grace.\nwe had a party of 5 and they added on the 18% tip. really just for a party of 5. \nservice wasn't even that great either. \nwe had the pate appetizers and that was the best part.", 
            "it is my tradition to end every vegas trip with brunch at mon ami gabi.  this restaurant provides for a classy ambiance and and unbeatable view of the strip and the belliago water fountains, if you can get a table in the front area.  their fresh baguettes are also quite a treat and my last visit was no exception.  \n\nit is also my tradition to order the <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>.  $18 for a sandwich is not cheap but it was always justified here -- until this past visit.  i will say i was quite disappointed.  they were not the juicy, medium rare, fresh off the grill steak strips i got in the past.  it tasted like a warm beef sandwich you could order at any hot deli.  certainly not $18 worth and not what i expect from mon ami gabi.  on the other hand, my wife got the warm chicken and <mark>Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich</mark> was was surprisingly tasty.  the spread was just off the hook.  an entirely disappointing experience was luckily spared by my wife selflessly trading half her sandwich for mine.  i may still keep my mon ami gabi tradition but try something different on the menu next time.", 
            "twice we ate at mon ami gabi, a french restaurant located in the paris hotel & casino across from the bellagio. both times we were fortunate to get front-row seating outside on the terrace facing the famous las vegas strip.\n\nservice was excellent and the prices were reasonable given its location. brunch and lunch items were $10 to $15 each. you can see the fountains of the bellagio while you're having dinner. when you are seated you will be presented immediately with a warm delicious baguette with soft butter. i ordered a glass of wine and a <mark>Prime Steak Sandwich</mark>. the service was excellent as was the food. the waiters are really trying to make you have a great evening. highly recommended!"
