            "this is a great place high energy staff helpful. i had the <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark> love them followed by <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> this was great the mix of italian meats and the crown of prosciutto-wrapped smoked provolone! make this a must for the flavor town finale i had a s'more <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>  loved it will go back and try the <mark>Guy's Cheesecake Challenge</mark> soon highly recommend this place to everyone", 
            "on our one-week vacation to vegas, we visited guy's restaurant twice...i'd say we liked it ;) the first time we went around dinner time so we had to sit outside in the vegas heat, but the food made up for it! we started with the <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark>. these must have been our favorite thing we ate in vegas. the raw tuna with the crispy shell were the perfect combo. we then moved on to the original smash burger and mac and cheese burger. they were both huge and great. also came with a side of fries (i really recommend they write this on the menu because we didn't think we were getting any and were thinking of ordering a separate side). the seasoning on the fries was so good. it had a spicy kick with a hint of sweetness. the cocktails are also great. they are so different that the waiter had to explain them all to me to get a sense of what i was ordering. \n\nour second trip, we had nick l for lunch. he is the best server, so ask for him! he gave us great recommendations and was spot on. this time we tried the <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark> and <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>. again, great. prices are also unbeatable, especially on the strip. i highly recommend this spot for lunch or dinner, burgers or wings.", 
            "place feels exactly like i imagine guy fieri, lots of flare, very little substance.\n\nmy friend and i stopped by on our way out of vegas and were extremely disappointed. starving and walking away with money in our pockets we were ready for one last great meal before we returned to the daily grind, should have gone somewhere else.\n\nservice was eh in the beginning, 14 empty tables and the hostess tried telling us that they had no seats available. a manager came up and yelled at the poor hostess in front of us.\n\nafter being seated, our waitress was extremely friendly and the only good thing about my experience here.\n\nwe both ordered the <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark> and <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>. they were dry and underwhelming, guy is all about flavor and sauces and spices and his food was awful!\n\ni would never eat here again and cant even watch diners anymore, how can i trust someone who can't make a decent fish taco?", 
            "the food was phenomenal!! hats off to the chef!!! our waiter did a superb. job!! i had the big dipper  sandwich and my husband had the <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark>. we can't wait to go back and try a new dish! oh did i mention the <mark>Guy's Cheesecake Challenge</mark>,  <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>, and the <mark>Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae</mark> were over the top!! our table shared the guy-italian <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, righteous rojo rings and the best ever <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark> and we can't wait to try the other two sharables on the menu!! great time and superior food!!", 
            "i love guy's show, and i think he is great.  they were really busy the night we were there and didn't have a great experience from a service standpoint.  but i was amazed that one of their managers actually reached out to me about our experience!  we had the <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark> for an appetizer and they were really good!!!  i also really recommend the chicken lollipops, the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>!  i ordered the pulled pork sandwich called the motley que.  i like guy's carolina style bbq sauce and i buy it at the store, i thought the sauce was a little on the sweet side.  but the pretzel bun and slaw were good as well.  also, the restaurant is right next to the high roller.  so if you are planning on going there, it is a great place to stop on your way there.", 
            "came here for dinner with a friend.  we got the <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark>, <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, and the original ringer burger.\n\nthe won-tacos were really good; excellent combination of ingredients.  the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> were probably the standout dish for us; my friend normally has a lot of ketchup with her fries (she basically has some fries with her ketchup), but after eating a few fries, she leaned over and whispered, \"don't tell anyone, but i don't even want ketchup with fries!\", which, coming from her, is the highest praise you could give to fries.  the original ringer burger was quite delicious too.  my friend was so enamored with her half that she bit her own finger eating it!", 
            "waitress took my drink order (iced tea) while i perused the menu. someone else brought my iced tea. server returned later, and i ordered <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark>. she said she wasn't sure they were available...she would check to see if their \"order\" had come in yet... minutes later she returned saying not available....i chose to leave, but she charged me $4.32 for the untouched iced tea.\ni would avoid this place and go around the corner to chayo..much better service, and good food...especially the lobster tacos, and margaritas..", 
            "so if you have a party of four or less you wait outside the restaurant and if five or more you go inside. i don't get understand that, but okay. we had four and waited just 30mins. it was on a sunday for lunch. \n\nwe got seated and was given a menu. we looked over the menu, but we had a good idea already as to what we wanted to order. so now we're just sitting, waiting, thinking over how are weekend was in vegas since we were just hours away from going home. well, that time passed and passed...okay so we're super hungry and we're still waiting for someone to introduce themself to us. my boyfriend had to flag down a server and tell them we we're waiting for service! on top of that, we still waited an extra three mins for someone to come by. when the guy did, he was honestly creepy. plus he had just visited another table cuz he was carrying trays and menus. he asked us if we wanted anything to drink and then was going to get that, but we kinda were on a time crunch so we told him we were ready to order then too. our food took awhile, but that was worth the wait.\n\n i order the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>, the bf ordered the mac cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. my friends ordered the fireball whiskey wings and <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark>. i loved my wings!!! so much flavor, and it came with some veggies. plus on top of <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were onion strings, yum! i had a piece <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> and it was juicy and oily lol. i loved the fries that came with it. i also had a fireball wing. i didn't think it was that spicy, it was good, but spice wise, no. my friends also ordered <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> later on while we were eating. those took foreverrrrr to come out!!! they were good though, but man.\n\nthe food was amazing! the service was terrible and slow! our server took our checks and it took 12 mins! why? i saw him making up a drink @ bar for another table of his. isn't that the bartenders job?? then he took to them and then did our checks! like, if you're going to do that stuff @ least do it behind a solid wall, there wasn't even a wall to block him. i could see him!!! \n\nlike seriously!!! it was like the server worked @ a fancy fancy restaurant where the service and speed was more on the slow side. this wasn't and isn't that kind of place. we got seated @ 12:55pm. i thought we were going to be there for like an hour and 15mins, no! we were there till 2:36pm! i know this cuz we wanted to leave vegas by 3pm. and we still had shopping to do. that was soooo annoying, not the way i wanted to end my last meal there. so yeah, our server costed my rating a star or else this would have been a 5 star review.", 
            "the ratings here don't lie. \n\nbefore heading back home we wanted to grab a bite to eat, i love the food network and watch it all the time. so of course we had to try guy fieri.. the wait was about 30-40 mins. \n\ndecor of the restaurant was cool. after reading the reviews it's suppose to be western? fast forwarding to our order-\n<mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark>: i like how it had mango-jicama salsa. pretty tasty, and prob best thing ordered\n<mark>The General's Wings</mark>: was hesitant on these but surprisingly not bad!\n<mark>The Triple B Burger</mark>: it was ok. i know that their mac n cheese burgers is what their known for, so i guess if you wanted a burger here i'd probably order that\n<mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark>: i added chicken on this salad. they were chicken skewers, and again the chicken was nice. salad was okay, i wish they put more hummus on it because it was basically just dolloped onto the plate and piled romaine lettuce on top. \nbloody mary: i don't think anywhere can f*ck up a bloody mary.\n\nit was nice tryin you guy!", 
            "family reunion and our first stop was here for lunch. hubby and i shared the <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark> -sashimi-grade ahi tuna packed into crispy wonton shells with\nmango-jicama salsa, sweet soy, scallions + wasabi cream. others in the group has the nachos and big burgers. they said their food was fantastic! great ambiance, fun atmosphere. will certainly visit again!"

            "came here after seeing some promos for it just opening. pretty cool vibe to it, with a mix of music from the outside carnival court and music inside. a little loud for my liking but i get it. really friendly staff all around. i had the mac and cheese burger and it was really good. huge portions of everything!! wife had <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> and the pepperoni sticks. <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> came out cold. i will try it again down the road. overall a decent place for some good food.", 
            "i love gf and enjoy his shows on food network so i'm glad we were able to go to his new place.. i was worried it wouldn't be open in time cuz the place's opening date was supposed to be 'late april' so we lucked out really.. anyway, the decor and attire of the staff was very rock-cowboyish, and i was enjoying the general ambiance and environment.. the bar yells out when various events happen, like some patron is celebrating something, etc, it was hard to understand what the bartenders were yelling lol.. and there's an outside patio option for diners if they choose, but the down side to this is it's a big open wall so w/ it being a restaurant, flies and whatnot just roam freely throughout the place and chow down, very much interrupting diners like myself! so my suggestion would be to fix up that wall and make it a revolving door instead and just have outside speakers if u want the outside diners to still hear the music lol.. i ordered <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> app, and in general, it was a good deal, yums all around. then i got the big dipper sandwich, and omgosh, the whole plating thing was weird and i was not a fan! but b4 that, i found out that <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> has cheese caked on it, so i couldn't even peel it off, so they redid it w/o cheese and at no extra charge which i appreciated.. but yeah, <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> is a sub type w/ a bunch of prime rib meat stuffed into it lol (it had a weird smell but the meat tasted good lol, the bread got a bit soggy tho so i just ate the meat lol), it also came w/ a variety of fries w/ added flavor, and a big ass pickle (i'm a fan of certain pickles so i didn't mind and chomped on). so like i said, the whole plating of <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> was very awkward and messy. it's served on a cutting board type of 'plate' and it's cluttered like crazy w/ sauces in the corners, this weird downward slide for fries lol, and the sub that in my case was covered in thin onion rings which i just put to the side, oh and a big knife was stuffed underneath the sub for ur 'convenience' lol.. whoever thought this plating would be a good idea was an idiot, imo, i would've much preferred a regular plate! the whole plating deal they did was just messy and i got crumbs everywhere... so while i'm eating, i noticed all the diners around me keep asking the servers about gf and his personality/appearances at the restaurant lol.. of course the servers are gonna say he's a great guy and whatnot, he's their ultimate boss! but yeah i may have been the only one who didn't do that lol, but i'm not gonna lie, it would've been cool as hell to see the guy in person that i watch on tv a lot lol.. anyway, the end came and there's an option to do a customer satisfaction survey which i appreciated. it's a lil handheld device inside the check booklet lol, i thought that was particularly creative and i hope gf/the management takes my comments seriously.", 
            "great food and staff. didn't know it was here, as a fan of guy, we decided to stop and glad we did. <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> were a big hit as were the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>. our waiter eric was great and manager stephanie checked in with us and chatted. all the food that went by looked good. we will be back!", 
            "i have been wanting to try this place out for awhile. so went here with a few friends. i ordered the sashimi tacos. its basically 4 mini tacos from the appetizers. they were good but just needed a little bit more flavor. i thought if they added 1 more taco then it would be worth spending $14 for it. the sashimi was fresh and the shells are a soft crisp. they broke apart pretty easily. also tried <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark>. its only enough for 3 people. they give you only 3 pieces of lettuce and assorted chicken. its ground chicken, skewered chicken and chicken egg rolls. my friends had a regular burger and and a <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>. both dishes came with 3 or 4 assorted fries. it had good sized portions.\n\nfor a drink, i got the java guava. really good. it had a little spice to it. it came with a jalapeno on the side. dessert, we ordered a simple mint chocolate chip ice cream with oreos. nothing too special. it was just drizzled in fudge and oreos. also a good portion. its enough for 3-4 people.\n\noverall, its an ok place. the location of the restaurant is facing the street. it also has outdoor seating. so people watching can be interesting.", 
            "great restaurant guy.  ate there in june and loved it. <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> are awesome and <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>...any of them are fantastic!  guy, nick the waiter looks like he'd be your son/brother. you taught them well. if you go to vegas and don't eat there, you're a moron. guy, open one in houston please.", 
            "we decided to go there right before a show. we were seated quickly . we decided just to get appetizers.\nwe ordered the lettuce wraps and the onion rings. the lettuce wraps were amazing. it came with 3 different sauces, 3 small spring rolls that were very tasty and the lettuce and the chicken for <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> were very very good.  i wish i could say the same thing for the onion rings . the presentation looks really cool the way they serve them but i did not care for the taste. i don't think they were cooked all the way .\nthe wait staff was super friendly and they kept our drinks full. i would definitely go back here again and try something new. i noticed they give large portions so i would probably split my meal. loved the atmosphere", 
            "we stopped into this restaurant because it was close to our hotel, but wow, were we impressed. the atmosphere was terrific. the service was fast and super-friendly. we liked our waiter so much we asked for his full name--it's chris anderson for those of you lucky enough to be served by him. the food was fantastic. for starters, we had <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark>. then i had the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>, and my wife had the <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark>. so good. we'll be back!", 
            "i decided to take my girlfriend out to dinner last night. i heard about guys kitchen and finally wanted to try it out. already having the munchies, i medicated even more in the car, expecting a wait. i was wrong. higher than the high roller itself, i walked in and was greeted by a beautiful hostess. we waited for what seemed like less than a minute, before we were called for our seats. (i like how you could see the open kitchen when you're being seated.) \n\nthe menus were clipped to what seemed like oversized, thick clipboards. the menu  was simple and easily understood with a good amount of items. we started with drinks. \"lemon drop...not!\" for her and a firestone union jack ipa for me. i don't usually drink lemon drops (only when i try hers) but i have to say it was the best one i've had so far. we decided on the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>, <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> and the mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. \n\nthe <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> and <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> were served first. the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> were amazing! truffle chunks, truffle infused gouda and a creamy truffle sauce. bachi who? they don't skimp here! the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> were on another level. they consist of lightly grilled tequila-citrus tilapia, cabbage and avocado. then topped with radish and pickled ginger for a tasty combination. \n\nsoon after, <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> and mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> were heading to our table. <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> are a must try. the chinese minced chicken was on point. you also get three spring rolls and two thai style skewers. it's also a good way to be romantic, making your date lettuce wraps. just make sure your hands are washed! now onto <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. the six cheese mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> was bombdotcom. hands down one of the best burgers i've had. mac + cheese flowing over the thick applewood bacon all between a toasted garlic brioche bun. accompanied with a  combination of potato wedges, crisscut and regular fries. i was already full from finishing the previous dishes so i only ate half and have to pack the rest. next time i won't order as much so we could get dessert. \n\noverall the experience was fantastic! service was outstanding! food was amazing! i will be coming back again, and again.", 
            "this place has something for everyone. we went here twice during our vegas stay and i was pretty pleased with both meals. once was for a late night snack, the other lunch. \n\nfor the late night snack, we got the sashimi won-ton tacos. these were delicious and possibly one of the highlights of the menu! <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> were in the shape of taco shells and were perfect! super light and crispy. the filling was ahi tuna with a mango salsa- delicious! we ordered the fried ice cream dessert and i was pretty disappointed with the fried part- it was actually pretty soggy and instead of being crispy- it actually was more chewy- not what i had hoped for. it did come with a considerable amount of sides to top with it to make it your own- but i wouldn't order that one again. \n\nthe second meal we had here i tried the <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark>. you get 4 small tacos to an order, which is a good portion size. they were great and came with two salsa options. there was a good portion of steak in each of the tacos and a yummy cabbage slaw on top.  the quad hotel gave us a free coupon for <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>- so we tried those too--- think steak type fries meets buffalo wings. the bleu cheese dressing is pretty over whelming- i went for ranch instead. \n\noverall, the service is pretty good, the staff is welcoming and generally attentive. you even have the opportunity to do a digital survey (there's an i-touch in the bill folio) at the end of your meal to give feedback. the portion sizes can be pretty huge- make sure you go in hungry if you're ordering entrees!", 
            "everything great and huge portions.  hubby had hot wings if you like hot its not very hot fyi. but good.  lettuce <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> were good. i had the mac <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> very good i ate only half.  love the fries you get an assortment of different type of fries.  the 5 year old had macaroni and cheese ah not so good he ate like 1 bite ..  cheese a little too sour for kids taste.  \n\nwould i recommend this place definitely little pricey for burgers but they are very good.  suggestion make reservations we waited an hour but was entertained by the street performers and live music outside nice.", 
            "\"good, good, and.....good!\" i always come for the cocktails and thai <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark>. service is good and i like the atmosphere, but some advice, \"get there nice and early for seating on a weekend\".", 
            "i actually tried to not like this place, no i'm serious, i did. but here i am  giving it 4 stars. a lot of times places with a famous name attached to them or nutty publicity just stink, this place didn't. \n\nlet's get this out of the way.... it was overpriced. it's vegas, it's on the strip, and it has a celebrity chefs name on it. of course it's overpriced. \n\ni usually talk about the food first, but the creativity of this place and everything inside prompts a mention first. everything from the decor, down to the forks, oddly shaped glasses and wooden menus is unique. it gives it the extra charm i look for. \n\nthe food was great, but small portions. we just got some things to snack on so we had the sashimi won tacos and <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark>. they were really good, had some dipping sauces (love that) and cooked nicely.  \n\nhere on 10/02", 
            "we decided to check out this restaurant late one night after some gambling and walking around the strip.\n\nthe restaurant itself is very loud- the music is super pumped up.  the service was great- our waiter was very nice, not overbearing, and attentive.\n\nwe ordered <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> and the motley cue sandwich.  both were very flavorful and a great serving size. \n\nthey also have brunch which i'd really be interested in trying.  \n\noverall, the food was pretty good for the price.  only downside was the loud loud music.", 
            "started off with the asian inspired <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark>. the springs rolls and the chicken skewers were good but the lettuce wrap wasn't that great. i've had better before.\n\ni got the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> as my entree, i originally saw the recommendations on the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> on yelp but was told they had removed the tacos from the menu. <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were flavorful, but i didn't love them. i would consider it more drumsticks then wings. \n\n<mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> was delicious and it came with 3 different types of fries. i don't think i will return for the food but our sever was great.", 
            "i finally gave in and walked down to the linq to see if guy's burger kitchen and bar wasn't too busy for my wife and myself to give it try. lets face it for those who only visit here occasionally you have to pay the prices reflecting the high rent of being on the strip. the eateries don't have to worry about repeat business because new bodies show up everyday and service such as was at  michael's (barbary coast) is long in the past. ok got there around 1:30 waited for about 25 min before we were seated. my wife got <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> (15) and i ordered the original ringer burger (18) yes 18.00 for a burger. ordered <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> medium. it arrived overcooked and dry (not even a hint of pink). i cut it in half and we shared <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> also. they were just meh. since we live on the strip it's hard to pay the going prices for mediocre food. we see no need for a return visit. we don't eat much fast food fare but in our consensus the all natural burger at carl's jr. will stand up to any in the valley. cke has good angus beef. haven't tried the gordon ramsey burger but honestly what can be done to a burger to make it cost over 10 bucks. seems like the real bargain is a little further down. one dollar michelob at the casino royal.", 
            "first off, the french fries are awesome! they almost taste like they have lays barbecue chip seasoning on them. so good! \n\nwe came here on a monday night, and just had to wait about 15 minutes for an outdoor table. service was quick, and the waitstaff was great. the outdoor space is a decent size and it's covered, so you don't have to worry about the sun beating down on you on a hot day. \n\nback to the food: large portions! if you are visiting and can't store a doggy bag, definitely consider splitting. there were 3 of us, and we split 2 items, which was the perfect amount of food. we got <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> and the tatted up <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>. <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> were like 3 different meals in one- you get spring rolls, chicken skewers and the lettuce wraps. the chicken skewers were pretty good, but i wasn't blown away by the lettuce wraps or spring rolls. the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> on the other hand was the best i've ever had. when my friends wanted to order a <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> i was a little disappointed, but i absolutely loved it. there were so many flavors, so this was anything but boring! \n\nthis is a great casual dining spot on the strip, and the prices are pretty reasonable. this will be a go to place when i have visitors in town.", 
            "i came here for the fabulous yelp elite event prior to opening and i had the most amazing experience! my second visit was with ruben and my brother since i wanted them to check it out. the service was fantastic and gm mike was just as hospitable as the first time! my most recent visit was a couple weeks ago and the menu hasn't changed with exception of the removal of dishes like the rojo onion rings and churros. some of the food wasn't as good as i recall. service was still great and they're always insanely busy (no reservations). \n\nbrisket nachos ($17)\n<mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> ($15)\n<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> ($14)\n<mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> ($14)\nfireball whiskey wings ($16)\n<mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> ($18)\nseared flat iron poutine ($32)\n14-hour beef brisket ($34)\n\ni love the concept of <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> because of the multiple options, but the chicken is always salty and the sauces are just okay. the nachos are terrible. i do really enjoy the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, but again, salty. all of the entr\\u00e9es are decent. i haven't had a bad sandwich, but there are so many different flavors going on that it borders on too much. for example, the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> is grilled with poblano and pepper jack cheese, and has gouda, sweet pepper red onion jam, donkey sauce, and garlic butter on the bun. it's good, but it could do without one or two ingredients.", 
            "all i can say is wow!\n\ni always wondered when i watched diners, drive-ins & dives if this \"guy\" was the real deal...he is. they should feature this restaurant on the show.\n\nhere's what we had, and they were all very tasty: tuna tacos, truffle fries, the fondue, <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark>, brisket nachos (these are awesome!).\n\ngo there hungry and order a la carte so everyone can sample. great food, good staff."

            "my wife and i intended to go to a different restaurant at the same hotel, but the wait was too long. we checked out the menu and thought we'd give it a shot.  i suspect this place catches a lot of overflow, although it was not very busy when we went. \n\nimmediately upon entering you're greeted by a thirty foot guy fieri picture whose eyes tend to follow you, no matter where you go. occasionally throughout the meal i made awkward eye contact with guy. i felt judged. seriously, it was a little weird.\n\nservice: three different servers asked us if we wanted drinks, which is better than no servers asking if you want drinks, but a little bothersome. water glasses remained full and $12 mimosa and bloody mary were ok. service was attentive overall, but didn't take our app plate when the entrees came, making it a bit crowded at the table. \n\nfood: for an appetizer we had the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>. the cheese sauce was decent, but the breadsticks were more difficult to manage than food should be. long, dry breadsticks wrapped in pepperoni and dusted with parmesan cheese. i don't know if they put them in the oven or what, but they were lukewarm and broke easily. kind of messy. \n\nmy wife had a caesar salad and the dressing was not good, way too much cheese, and bland overall. it came with something called the \"mega crouton\" which looked like a bread boomerang.  no joke. she could barely eat any of it. $17 caesar salad failure.  \n\ni had the mayor of flavor town burger, or something like that. it had pastrami on <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> with asian slaw in a pretzel bun. came with a fry medley. this is not the kind <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> you can pick up and eat, which was what i was hoping for. if you're dressed nice and away from your hotel, handle with extreme caution. i ended up dismantling it with a fork and knife, but it still wasn't anything special. the fries were good. \n\nwe noticed some other diners having trouble with sandwiches, and i felt a little guilty when i didn't warn the table next to us when they placed their order for burgers.  we found humor in some of the decor and staff uniforms, and had a pretty good time despite the food, but your $95 with tip would be better spent elsewhere. i debated paying with cash so there would be no record we ever went there.", 
            "went here shortly after it opened and was not disappointed.  despite being busy we only waited about fifteen minutes to be seated. while we were being shown to our seats everyone working the bar gave us a big hello and warm welcome as we walked by which was cool. awesome staff and fantastic food. we had italian <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> and rojo rings for apps and they were both awesome! next up was <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> and the big dipper sandwich...wow! what an awesome place and not as expensive as you would think for a celebrity restaurant. will definitely go back on out next night out on the strip!", 
            "i've been fortunate enough to dine here three times since it's opening. guy fieri's vegas kitchen is located inside the quad hotel & casino. if you're familiar with guy fieri on tv and his personality. you will see it echoed prominently in the look & design of his restaurant. even the attitude & energetic atmosphere exuded by the employees represent guy fieri's style. of course, if you find guy fieri's persona & shows unappealing, this would not be the place for you.\ni've tried the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>, '67 cajun chicken sandwich & mac & cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> entrees. all were awesome, full of flavor. each comes with a fry mix & <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are massive. the mac & cheese was quite rich. some might find it too much so, but heck, theres mac & cheese in there, what do you expect right? the '67 surprised me in that the blackened chicken was super tender & cooked perfectly.  and a tasty <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> is always a good thing.\ntheir appetizers were all very yummy too. my favorites are the rojo rings, onion rings that come hanging on a pipe accompanied by a sriracha ketchup. the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, giant breadstickers wrapped in pepperoni with a sausage & provolone cheese dip. i was even dipping my fries in the cheesy dip 'cause i loved it so much.\nwaiters & servers were very attentive & lively. i was also fortunate enough to meet mike, the manager of the establishment. i would be willing to go out of my way to the quad just to come to guy fieri's. i do find it interesting that one of the low end hotel casinos on the strip is home to two great food spots. hash house and here. definitely earns a 5 star rating in my book!", 
            "i wanted to really like this place because the food looks amazing but it was just okay. the portions are also enormous and i normally wouldn't mind but i feel bad for wasting when the food just isn't that great! first off, the atmosphere is really fun and lively and our waiter was friendly. we came as a party of 5 and we had no wait going at 11pm on a sunday. our drinks were kept full and our food arrived in a timely manner. \n\n<mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> $13- pretty good flavor and their cheese sauce had a nice tang to it.\n\nmac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> $17- pretty dry and over cooked :( also nothing really popped in flavor, it was kind of under-seasoned. for how tall the whole burger was, the beef was probably only 1/4 an inch thick at most. i picked at the mac & cheese and that by itself was pretty bland. one thing i really liked was that your $17 burger comes with fries, you don't have to order it a la carte like most burger places on the strip. however, the fries were pretty stale and too crunchy, but wayy too seasoning! also, the serving board it comes on is ridiculous. it looks really nice but it's way too small, three of us that got burgers asked for extra plates otherwise it would end up on our laps.\n\noff da' hook burger $16- i didn't try this one but boyfriend basically said the same thing i said about the mac & cheese burger.\n\n<mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark> $17- i didn't try these as well but my friend said she really liked them even though she took all the toppings off lol.\n\n<mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> $10- this thing was rock hard!!!! i had to use my burger knife to cut through it and i could barely taste the chocolate and marshmallow :( way overfried. the raspberry dipping sauce it came with was really good so it saved it from being a complete fail. \n\n<mark>Guy's Cheesecake Challenge</mark> $12- another huge portion of eh. cheesecake tasted like something i could buy at smiths or albertsons. impressive looking but not impressive in flavor.\n\nmaybe it was an off night of everything being overcooked but overall, another case of where food looks way better than it tastes. $175 worth of mediocre food. the price isn't the issue since the portions are huge and comparable to other burger joints on the strip but the quality of flavor just wasn't there. i still think gordon ramsey's burgr and holsteins are my favorite. i would even prefer bachi burger.  my boyfriend and i didn't care for it, maybe we are spoiled here in vegas? but the other three that were visiting from solvang, ca really loved it. so idk...try it for yourself i guess!", 
            "amazing! amazing! i had the mac and cheeseburger! one of the best burgers i have ever had. we also ordered the onion rings and <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> and those we're very good also!  waitress had the best sense of humor and our drinks we're being refilled constantly . can't wait to go back here!", 
            "in vegas for my husband's birthday weekend and saw guy's new restaurant.  we decided to stop in for lunch since we are fans.  the place was clean and the service was great.  the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> were too die for!  i have to go again just to get them.  the victor chicken <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> were good but average.  they weren't special in any way. i can't wait to go back on our next trip.", 
            "went to guy fieri's last night as our last meal of vegas before flying home this morning. the triple t (truffle) fries were delicious. they came with a truffle dipping sauce and we were also served wing sauce for dipping. our was a big plate that fed 4. we almost ordered seconds to accompany our mac and cheese burgers but were pleased by the assorted fries that came with the meal. we split the 2 burgers in half and this was able to fill the four of us as well. the only thing that i was a little disappointed by was that my particular burger didn't seem to have the same hardy portion of mac and cheese as my friends did and it was hard for me to really taste the macaroni (it was still good though). also, we were a little disappointed to be told they had run out of the pepperoni <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> that we ordered (i also heard the table behind us ordered something behind us that they ran out of). i guess that's what happens when you try to order \"dinner\" at midnight.", 
            "i am right on the cusp of a 4-star review, unfortunately the service we received knocked it down to a 3-star. \n\nwe went there on may 12th for my 30th birthday, this was my choice and i did not even complain when we had to wait 10-15min for an outdoor table when we could've been seated right away inside. the girls at the front were all wicked nice and greeted us right away and were helpful. there was a band playing next door so it did make conversation a little difficult but nothing too bad, and the people watching was the best part of being outside. \n\nthe food for the most part was delicious. i got a smoke & mirrors for my drink, which besides the giant pepper on the glass was delicious. for appetizers we got righteous rojo rings and <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, the sauce for the rings was awesome nice and spicy. the dippers were also wicked good, my mom started making them at home, just can't get the dip right! for my meal i got carne asada <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark>, which were okay. the filling was very good but the thing i did not like was that the tacos seemed to be wrapped with two soft taco shells which were really really really dry. the best part was the dessert, the <mark>Triple Doublemint Pie</mark>, which was shared amongst all four of us because it was definitely too large for one person.\n\nour server is what killed this whole experience. i am not sure where she kept on disappearing to but she brought our drinks and then ran off for almost 20min before taking any part of our order. then after our meal it took awhile before she even asked if we wanted to dessert (which i did, come on it was my birthday!). my mom did ask several times for a glass of water which she never brought over. she was more concerned with other tables around us with whom she could flirt with (apparently my husband and dad are unflirtable?), and we tip well as long as you pay attention and are a good server. \n\nall in all it was a great place and next time i am back in vegas i will definitely go back.", 
            "service!!!  i can see guy's influence all over this place. my boyfriend and i ordered the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> for an app and i ordered the chicken tacos and my boyfriend ordered the beef dip sandwich. \nour food arrived and we never got our app. i was very disappointed because i ordered the lighter meal of chicken tacos because we were getting a heavy app. i told the waiter and he was very apologetic. i told him to just forget the app but he insisted on bringing them anyway free of charge. \nthen the manager showed up and apologized. i have to say the food was great and they redeemed themselves so well my boyfriend and i went back again a few days later! \n\np.s.  the small wooden style plates are waaaaay too small to hold the big and somewhat messy food.", 
            "this was a pleasant surprise.  the food is very good, but the ambiance is not conducive to a quiet relaxing lunch or dinner.  the place is loud and active....it is a place to party!  \n\nback to the food.  the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> are pepperoni-wrapped breadstick twists served alongside our smoky provolone + sausage cheese dip, topped with fresh tomato bruschetta.  they are delicious, even though it sounded strange to us.\n\nthe carne asada <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> are a winner too!  you get four tacos held upright in a metal rack.  there are different varieties but i chose the marinated skirt steak garnished with onions, cilantro and salsa [on the side].  generous portions for the price and the taste is both juicy and flavorful.\n\nreasonable prices given the portions and considering other vegas restaurants on the strip tend to be on the high side to begin with.", 
            "hip place! nice decor, nice atmosphere, good service\nas for the food, we had the following\n\nthe guy-italian <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> was great!\nthe <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> were goood!\n<mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was something else.\nthe mac cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> was the bomb! \n\na fun place to go eat when you are walking around las vegas blvd.\n\n we are going back soon!",

            "met up with some friends and headed here for the first time. hearing a lot of buzz about the bacon mac n cheese burger, it was something that i was gonna try first time out. so me and the lady both got the bacon mac n cheese burger, the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, and the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>. let's start with the sides. the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> was great, it was very flavorful, the fondue was light and cheesy.  the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> were great! i would say one of the top truffle fries i have tried. definitely a thing to try when coming here. now here's the thing with the bacon mac n cheese burger, i read that it was one of guy fieri's award winning burgers. the bacon was cooked great and tasted great. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was also tasty and cooked and seasoned well. now the mac n cheese was a huge let down, <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> is complex and has so much flavors in the bacon and <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> seasoned to perfection, then you put mac n cheese that has been sitting under a heat lamp, dried out, clumpy and very bland on it and it just about ruins it. as great as everything else was on <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>, the mac n cheese just brought <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> down. i dont mind paying $20 for a burger as i love food and trying new things. i just dont understand why the short cut?? i know time is pressed and everything needs to be done as quickly as possible, but when quality gets sacrificed things need to be reevaluated. also <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> does come with fries (a mixture of crinkle cut, straw fries, waffle fries, and chips???) but you cannot substitute the fries that come with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> for the likes of the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, forcing you to buy an entire order if you wanted. although the fries are a huge order and i was glad i got them maybe having the option to substitute the region fries that come with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> for them would be a good idea. so for around $75 for me and my lady it was expensive but in my opinion didn't live up to the hype. sadly the only way i would ever get the bacon mac n cheese burger would be if guy himself made it to his standards and maybe then it will be the great burger that it is claimed to be.", 
            "woof woof, *pant*, *pant*, *pant*, woof woof  (i'll get back to this).\n\nkeeping it real, this is an eatery created by a marketing group for a tv personality rather than a chef driven restaurant.  words like fresh, farm raised, organic are replaced by outta bounds, awesome, righteous,  slam dunk, mack daddy.  the flavors are very bold, bordering on over the top.  most components of a dish compete rather than compliment.    not a big deal if you spent the evening smoking a couple of cigars or killed your pallet on a packs of cigs.\n\nfor \"shareable\",  respectable \"sashimi won-taco\" (fried won ton skin shaped like a taco shell filled with ahi mixed with a mango jicama salsa and topped with an odd sweetened soy and a wasabi aioli).  passable but the aioli adds a flabbiness to the dish and obscures the flavor of the fish.  the \"<mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>\" are bizarre.  breadsticks are wrapped in pepperoni then self dipped into a fondue of  oil stabilized provolone, sausage, and tomato.  fans of a greasy pizza will be right at home.\n\non to <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> and burgers:\n\n\"come rod.  come here boy.  sit.  awww that's a good boy.  now shake hands.  awww rod's a good doggie\".\n\ncontrary to what my ex might say, i'm not a dog.  i don't expect my meal to be tossed on a plank, burger falling over, only half on the bun, toppings and sauce spilling everywhere and fries thrown on for good measure.\n\na \"big dipper\" features tender slices of prime rib, smothered by melting pepper jack cheese, topped by over seasoned deep fried onions in a garlic spread with excessive, bitter horseradish.  impossible to pick up, grease and oil mask the flavor of the beef.  the \"off-da-hook smash burger\" sports a decent mix of beef but obliterated by the cloyingly sweet, excessive bourbon bbq sauce.  they claim the bun is brioche, honestly the sauce kills the taste buds.  finally the \"<mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>\"  cloying, greasy, way over the top.  the overstuffed burger is impossible to pickup and messy to eat.  a side of flavorful but soggy fries accompanies all selections.\n\nprops for service.  fast and attentive.  \n\ngreat for the vegas tourist looking for the show.  locals and regulars look elsewhere.", 
            "had the mac and cheese burger and awesome <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>.  loved the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> and more mac and cheese on <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> please.  super server alex!!!", 
            "sit at the bar!  it's fun and full of action!  we ended up being quite happy that there was a wait for restaurant seating on a recent september saturday morning.  hungry, we opted to check out the bar, and got very lucky when a couple got up and left, vacating the perfect comfy spot for us.  honestly, this was the most comfortable bar stool i've ever sat in! we settled in and connected with new friends (they even let us try their sweet tea giant drink.  (way better than i would have thought, and surprisingly not too sweet!).  for around $35 you can get a giant fishbowl full of about 5 drinks that includes a free t-shirt.  not a bad deal! we even watched them walk vs. stumble out later.  kudos new friends!\n\nhowever still breakfast to us, we opted to go a little easier than that...very good regular iced tea for me, and a couple brews for husband.  later i added a  \"lemon drop...not\", which was very good. hungry, we had to start with the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>. (after i presented our bartender with my total rewards card to save a buck per item).  good thing we had already ordered our mains before this arrived, or we might have been fine with just these.  huge, majorly rich, and totally off the hook!  where else would you find pepperoni wrapped breadsticks with a cheese fondue with sausage, tomato and basil in it?  with a kicker of pepperoncini to cut through the richness? no where else...  thanks guy!\n\nour bartender was so awesome that she saved our leftover fondue for future fry-dipping...wise gal...loved her and her hard-working cohorts!  husband's '67 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark> was flavor-town indeed!  i know because of the small taste that he was willing to part with. he did more (slightly) willingly share his trio of fries with chipotle ketchup.  yum to all of them!  \n\nmeanwhile i was chowing down on <mark>The General's Wings</mark>.  as good as these were, they were wayyy sweet.  would have loved to share them and have something else with them as well, but alas husband doesn't do bones.  loved that they were served with crushed wasabi peas, peanuts and sesame sticks to dip the sticky sweetness into.  the salty crunch was a perfect compliment.  i didn't waste a bit.  (you're welcome, grandma in heaven).  \n\nneedless to say we were way too full to even contemplate desserts.\n\nhad an absolutely delightful time...until a big suit guy (the kind you see in the pit at a casino that is intimidating) come barging over to complain to the hard-working bartenders that the area was \"messy\".  (our neighbors had just left...you know, the ones that had just spent all that money on two breakfasts and several drinks including the giant one?) our server had been asked by us to settle up and was just coming back with it when he complained to her.  this made us feel horrible.  like we had made her get in trouble...management, not cool.  we were all doing great until you came along.  as they say...it's not what you say but how you say it...and from what we've seen on television, didn't feel like guy style...just sayin'.",

            "let me first say that i usually don't like bar food but this place just took it and ran. when we arrived there was a line but we waited for only 10 minutes which was super awesome.  we sat near the bar at a booth which was sitting high off the ground. i noticed that this place looks like it should be sitting in texas somewhere due to the atmosphere and the way the help staff was dressed. never would have pegged guys restaurant as country. \nthe food was absolutely delicious! to start we ordered  the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>. the cheese sauce for this was the best i had. i would have never put pepperoni around a pretzel stick but it was really good. my husband ordered the mac & cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>, which we were told that it is the most popular burger they have. he said it was really good. i ended up ordering the <mark>Pic-a-Nik Sandwich</mark>. it was surprisingly good. the cranberry relish is a little out there but it works and they also put bbq chips on <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> but nothing i can complain about. \ni give this a five star because the food was outstanding and everything i expected from guy fieri",

            "food - good stuff, though the menu is pretty limited. incidentally, we have a johnny garlic's near us in dublin, ca, and the exact same macaroni and cheese burger is on their menu for $6 less. since i know it's good though, i ordered that and was content. i liked the concept of the <mark>Quad Fries</mark>, too. really crunchy and good for those of us who like a little variety of all of the different kind of fries.\nservice - slow as f. it was unclear who our server even was, since we had multiple people helping us, but whatever. either way, they could step up their game in that arena.  and side note, i wish they served breakfast longer. i was dying to try the bacon biscuits (they have them advertised on their menu and i feel like i saw them somewhere else in some vegas highlights magazine), so it was a bummer to not be able to try them. when i go back to vegas in april, i hope to try them then. this is a good place to try if you want a burger and fries with a lot of flavor, and the back patio seems perfect for a group.", 
            "so i dropped in around 11:30 pm and was presented with a limited late night menu. on the bright side, the award winning bacon mac n cheese burger and <mark>Quad Fries</mark> were among the selected moonlight survivors. las vegas has become a mecca for gourmet burgers and guy's spot is a strong contributor. the only thing preventing me from giving this place the 5 stars it deserves is the cost. gordon ramsay's \"burgr\" has to be considered a strong rival and my comparable burger there was $6 less, leaving enough left over to add their incredible oreo creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e milk shake. that being said, you're in vegas and i'd recommend hitting both guy and gordon's spot for a heated burger showdown. if you can only choose one, i would personally give gordon the slight edge but it could go either way. gordon's patties are smaller but thicker and guy's are bigger but thiner. depending on how you like your burger prepared this could drastically affect your experience. i mean, i personally wouldn't want a one inch thick \"well done\" burger or a quarter inch thick burger done \"medium rare.\" \n\ntry it or diet final word\n\ntry it... and take. your. time. if you do it right the $19 you pay for your burger will save you $50+ in the casino.", 
            "really disappointed by this spot. i ordered the montly que bbq pull pork sandwich. meat was tuff; definately needed to be cooked longer to soften the shoulder meat. this sandwich was okay. \n\nmy boyfriend ordered their \"award\" winning mac n cheese burger. lol nothing winning about this burger. it was super gross to me. way waay worst than my sandwich. where's why:  the lettuce used was the same nasty subway lettuce. to describe it- it tasted like the lettuce was not covered in the refrigerator and tasted like the fridge chemicals. it over powered the entire burger. the patty was over cooked so it made <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> dry. \n\nfries: \nour orders came with the <mark>Quad Fries</mark>. it was cool. had a selection of 4 types of fries. just wished the fries were a bit crisper. but thats just a personal choice. \n\ncustomer service: average. not bad, but not great either. \n\npros\n1. location: has outside patio seating. conveniently located on the strip.\n\noverall :: not good. with the tuff pull pork, overcooked patty and the lettuce they use i recommend you go somewhere else for a burger.", 
            "the outdoor patio is a great place to people-watch outside the linq hotel and casino. i would recommend the desserts over anything else - the s'mores cake is amazing! the <mark>Quad Fries</mark> are flavorful but a little off. today i had a ceasar salad which was ok but was served on a giant cruton wheel (probably 5\" in diameter). seemed a bit wasteful since <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> also came with croutons...also, <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> had too much dressing. i got <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> last time and they were just ok and have since been removed from the menu. the menu seems to change frequently too. overall, giant portions, decent food, desserts are huge but blow you away!", 
            "this place is freakin amazing!!!!!! we ordered the bacon mac and cheese burger and the fried ice cream. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was huge, juicy and delicious. it was one of the best burgers i ever had!!! the <mark>Quad Fries</mark> that came with it was also amazing. the spice on the fries was amazing that you didn't really need the ketchup or any sauces. however, the hot sauce did enhance the flavor even more. the fried ice cream was humungous! i'm pretty sure 3-4 people can take that on instead of one person. it was covered with cornflakes and came with banana and peanut butter, strawberry and pineapple, hot fudge and maple syrup. combine everything together and it is delicious. the only reason i'm giving it a 4 and not a 5 is because the service was slow. our waiter took forever in getting us water and taking our orders. we even had different waiters filled our water and bring out our food. and while i see other waiter walking around doing things, my waiter was no where to be seen.", 
            "first off why is this listing guy fieri?  the name of the restaurant is guy fieri's vegas kitchen and bar.  i've tried updating the name and it was denied.  so annoying.  i mean there was a yelp event here.  you would think we could get the name right.  \n\nwe stopped in for a late dinner.  after 10 pm they have a limited menu, but are less busy so it's not too bad of a trade off.  there was a short line even though the restaurant inside and out was mostly empty.  parties of 4 or less wait in line.  5 or more check in with the hostess.  when we got to the front we were asked if we wanted to sit inside, outside or at the bar.  we didn't have a preference until the hostess told it would be 15 min wait for inside/outside or we could sit at the bar right away.  so the bar it was.  funny though that there was that much of a wait when there were dozen's of empty tables all around.  \n\nwe sat at the bar and got a cider and a guido's freaky tiki.  we ordered fireball whiskey wings, <mark>Quad Fries</mark> and <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>.  omg all of it was amazing.  so good.  i'll admit i was a little surprised.  i wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was.  i don't like chicken wings and i loved these.  <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was excellent.  loved the fries and all the dipping sauces.  portions are big enough to share.  don't be like the people next to us were trying to give us their fries because they each ordered <mark>Quad Fries</mark> and it was way to much.", 
            "now this was a good meal. i have the smoked brisket with the <mark>Quad Fries</mark>...fries took me on a fast track train to flavortown!", 
            "burger and fry heaven... well, at least my kind of heaven in a skulltastic, rock'n'rollish atmosphere. i'm a fan of the funky dude so maybe i'm biased. my trips to flavor town have been most excellent...\non my very first visit i had the mac and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. heart attack in a burg... i was in town for a convention and demolished the thing. i was a hot mess. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was a mess. it reminded my of hodad's but with some pizazz. during my last visit i met a drunkard who kept insisting that he's met me somewhere. he called me victoria. i had a full blown conversation with him while waiting for my food. my husband felt bad and was not amused while the guys sitting next to us couldn't stop laughing.\n\nsuggestions: \n-do yourself a favor and get the <mark>Quad Fries</mark>. with the seasoning salt and assortment of waffle, shoestring, sweet potato and crinkle cut taters... i couldn't bare to share, but i did because sharing is caring.\n-if you don't want to wait for a table, i highly suggest you sit at the bar. the servers are attentive and you get to meet some pretty interesting folks.", 
            "watching his show back to back to back is sometimes a hypnotic experience. so i had very high expectations about coming to his own restaurant. \n\nwell the food did not disappoint. the mac and cheese burger was just delicious. juicy marriage of flavors. absolutely something you come up with after some alcohol.  i don't know where this combination came out of but is in one word perfect. \n\nwe shared our burgers so we were able to order the pastrami burger. if the mac and cheese was perfect then the pastrami one was absolutely perfect. i'm from ny so i love me some pastrami. all of the stuff on it combined with a pretzel bun. again the taste buds go crazy. like what's happening here.  now add to all this the <mark>Quad Fries</mark> and it makes it one of the best dinning experiences i've encountered. \n\nthe reason i'm giving it 4 not a 5 is the service. it had a lot to be desired. took forever to get drinks and even longer to get our bill and our credit card back. she was gone for a good 15 minutes with my card. this is unsettling really. \n\nfood great, service needs help and attention.",

            "decided to try this place out after seeing the long lines and stopping by las vegas this week.  the wait was not too bad, around 25 minutes.  the front staff was very courteous and friendly.  we obtained a table for 5 and were seated in a central location.  the ambiance was nice as the place has plenty of windows and you get a partial view of the strip and surrounding buildings.  i understand the place was busy, but our food did take 52 minutes to arrive to our table.  when i asked our server gregory why the food was taking so long he said \"its because you ordered appetizers\" as if i was being penalized for ordering 2 appetizers.  he didn't even apologize.  i asked for a manager who came by was very polite and apologized for the situation.  he offered free dessert, which i politely declined and stated i just really wanted to give him the feedback.  the server later gave us the check and asked if he could take our bill quickly so \"we didn't have to wait...\" with a sarcastic undertone.  not nice... as far as the food goes, the appetizers we had were the <mark>Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries</mark> and <mark>The General's Wings</mark>.  the fries were good, lots of cheese and flavor... <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were just ok, and were a bit cold.  they have very little meat on them as they shave the bottom half of the wing to \"make it easier to eat\".  some of the plates we ordered included the blue cheese burger and the original burger.  they were mediocre at best.  for a $20 burger, i was expecting something much better.  the meat was dry and the bun was brittle and didn't taste fresh.  at the end of the day there are plenty of restaurants in las vegas that deserve your time and money, and this clearly is not one of them.  i had high hopes coming into this place, but left disappointed.  hopefully things change in the future.",

            "my husband and i decided to try this place out for our first anniversary last week. my husband is a huge burger fan so this seemed like a sensible place to go. we didn't make a reservation since we were still on the fence about it all day. it was a friday night and i was expecting a much longer wait than what we were quoted, 40 minutes and that was accurate. \nthere was not enough room for everybody waiting so that was really annoying. the front staff just seemed to be unhappy to be there. the lead host they had barely even looked up from her computer while she spoke with the guests. i did observe an older couple coming up to the host stand, old man was very friendly but like i said, lead host had no personality and eventually seemed to make the old man uncomfortable with the exchange. this really frustrated me because when i used to work the service industry, i would never let my guest feel like this. i did not see her smile once during my 40-minute wait. the other hosts seemed friendlier but mostly seemed fake. i also saw a manager bossing everybody around but not helping out. big pet peeve!!! managers, you are not above your employees. if it weren't for their hard work, you wouldn't be around!\nwe finally got sat and our server was very friendly. she was very attentive to our table and she had a few others too. my husband likes to gulp his drinks so it tends to be a lot of work for the servers and we make up for it with our tip. this night, he didn't even need to ask for a refill. not once! i am kicking myself right now for not remember her name! i ordered a mojito and it was really good. husband and i tried the <mark>Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries</mark> for the appetizer. the waffle fries were amazing, the chili was good but nothing special. i had <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> and my husband tried the mac and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. the barbe<mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> was phenomenal and my husband enjoyed his burger. however, i still didn't feel that the prices were justified. i've had better and cheaper barbeque and that goes the same for my husband and burgers.\nthe portions are big and we didn't really have the table space for them but i guess we made it work. i really should have been more mindful of this but i really didn't expect that the music would be so loud. my husband and i couldn't have a normal conversation without having to raise our voices to a level past our comfort zone. i also noticed a busser slacking off, chatting it up with the servers when there were three dirty tables within five feet of him. i consider this an eyesore, the dirty tables and the lazy employee. \noverall, my husband and i had an okay experience. we will definitely remember not to come here for a romantic date night. this would be a great place to hang out with some friends though. food was great, server was great, music was way too loud for comfort, either a bigger wait area or more efficient seating during volume, managers need to be leaders, not bosses, friendlier front staff!\nwe most likely won't be back. maybe unless we were already in vicinity and hungry. then again, there's a few other restaurants we could try out for experience. only because we have burger and barbeque joints that we go to that are cheaper, better, and friendlier front staff.",

            "let me start of by saying the service we received was excellent... sadly that's where the nice words stop. our cocktails where average at best, the cocktails waiters could use some additional training. now on to the food... this would have to be some off the worst food i have eaten let alone at such a price. i order the mac and cheese burger and found it so dry that i was only able to eat half. my fianc\\u00e9 had the ribs and found that they where 90% fat and incredibly chewy. watching her try to eat them made me wonder if i was engaged to a hyena. we also order chilli <mark>Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries</mark>, these where probably the only decent dish. my suggestion if you really want to visit this place is head in buy a drink enjoy the service and maybe have some snack food, don't waste your time with a full meal.", 
            "ok so let me start off by saying that i didn't want to go here, the boy did. and he previously kept repeating that this place got pretty bad reviews. well, as you can see, i'm leaving one of them. being that we were both drinking, we made a poor decision to stop by this sad-famous chef named restaurant. \n\nit was pretty empty when we entered which should've given us a clear indication of how much the food sucked... we got the bacon mac and cheese burger and the waffle <mark>Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries</mark>. i mean, how could you even go wrong with a combination like that? well, you can at guy's. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was so over cooked it was black, they basically just slapped some kraft cheese on top of pasta and microwaved some bacon and put that monstrosity together... and my waffle fries!! my poor dried hard crispy fries. they sat in the fryer way too long. they basically just added a bunch of chili and cheese to cover up what they'd done, but you can't fool me! honestly, carl's jr crisscu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> are better. and the cocktail, the $14 cocktail that was only filled just a little more than half way of my glass... \n\ni shake my head in disappointment and will never be back. pretty sure they'll be out of business soon."

            "let me say this, i came in twice to this restaurant because i freakin' love burgers. both times i was seated at the full service bar.\n\nthe first night christina helped me. she was very friendly and outgoing. if i needed anything she was right there. i ordered <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark>. it was phenomenal. one of the best burgers i've had. it came with a small sampling of four differen<mark>Triple T Fries</mark>. the fries weren't bad but nothing to write home about. at the end of my meal i was asked to fill out a short survey which i was sure would be thrown out because i answered so positively about her. the food service was quick and i enjoyed my visit. enough to come back the very next day even.\n\nnow the next visit i came in around the same time and was again seated at the full service bar. this time however the service was less than par. i sat on my stool for a solid five minutes before being handed a menu. one bartender spent this entire time talking to his friend that were sitting next to me. i knew they were friends because he knew their names and talked about what they posted on facebook. the bartender that finally helped me though barely looked at me other than to take my menu.\n\ni ordered the mac n cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> which came out fairly quickly. again <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was incredible, just as i expected. i have nothing bad to say about the food. however, while eating i finished my drink and despite sitting right at the bar it took nearly ten minutes to be refilled. i finished my meal and had to wait between five and ten minutes before i could ask for the check. this time i wasn't asked to fill out a survey (probably because even they knew the service was poor.)\n\ni'll consider coming back, but will be on the look out for christina or i'll wait for a table.", 
            "i really was hoping to like guy fieri's restaurant.  it is not bad, by any means.  it is a good burger.  the food is good.  the decor is good. the service is good.  but that is the problem.  it's all just \"good.\"  there was nothing that will make me want to go back.  i have been to burger bar (quite a few times), as well as gordon ramsey's burger place at ph.  i have to say that burger bar is quite a bit better.  the prices are comparable, but the fact of customization you can do at burger bar made it better for me.  the prices were average for vegas, but high for a burger place located anywhere else.\n\nwhat i liked the best about guy fieri is tha<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> come with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>, and they give you a variety of all the fries.  a great idea and very much appreciated.  if you are in the mood to splurge on the k-cals, go ahead and give guy fieri a try.  unfortunately, it just didn't blow my mind for an amazing meal.",

(i like how you could see the open kitchen when you're being seated.) \n\nthe menus were clipped to what seemed like oversized, thick clipboards. the menu  was simple and easily understood with a good amount of items. we started with drinks. \"lemon drop...not!\" for her and a firestone union jack ipa for me. i don't usually drink lemon drops (only when i try hers) but i have to say it was the best one i've had so far. we decided on the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>, <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> and the mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. \n\nthe <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> and <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> were served first. the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> were amazing! truffle chunks, truffle infused gouda and a creamy truffle sauce. bachi who? they don't skimp here! the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> were on another level. they consist of lightly grilled tequila-citrus tilapia, cabbage and avocado. then topped with radish and pickled ginger for a tasty combination. \n\nsoon after, <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> and mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> were heading to our table. <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> are a must try. the chinese minced chicken was on point. you also get three spring rolls and two thai style skewers. it's also a good way to be romantic, making your date lettuce wraps. just make sure your hands are washed! now onto <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. the six cheese mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> was bombdotcom. hands down one of the best burgers i've had. mac + cheese flowing over the thick applewood bacon all between a toasted garlic brioche bun. accompanied with a  combination of potato wedges, crisscut and regular fries. i was already full from finishing the previous dishes so i only ate half and have to pack the rest. next time i won't order as much so we could get dessert. \n\noverall the experience was fantastic! service was outstanding! food was amazing! i will be coming back again, and again.",

            "met up with some friends and headed here for the first time. hearing a lot of buzz about the bacon mac n cheese burger, it was something that i was gonna try first time out. so me and the lady both got the bacon mac n cheese burger, the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, and the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>. let's start with the sides. the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> was great, it was very flavorful, the fondue was light and cheesy.  the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> were great! i would say one of the top truffle fries i have tried. definitely a thing to try when coming here. now here's the thing with the bacon mac n cheese burger, i read that it was one of guy fieri's award winning burgers. the bacon was cooked great and tasted great. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was also tasty and cooked and seasoned well. now the mac n cheese was a huge let down, <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> is complex and has so much flavors in the bacon and <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> seasoned to perfection, then you put mac n cheese that has been sitting under a heat lamp, dried out, clumpy and very bland on it and it just about ruins it. as great as everything else was on <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>, the mac n cheese just brought <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> down. i dont mind paying $20 for a burger as i love food and trying new things. i just dont understand why the short cut?? i know time is pressed and everything needs to be done as quickly as possible, but when quality gets sacrificed things need to be reevaluated. also <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> does come with fries (a mixture of crinkle cut, straw fries, waffle fries, and chips???) but you cannot substitute the fries that come with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> for the likes of the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, forcing you to buy an entire order if you wanted. although the fries are a huge order and i was glad i got them maybe having the option to substitute the region fries that come with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> for them would be a good idea. so for around $75 for me and my lady it was expensive but in my opinion didn't live up to the hype. sadly the only way i would ever get the bacon mac n cheese burger would be if guy himself made it to his standards and maybe then it will be the great burger that it is claimed to be.", 
            "i hate to say this, but i have eaten meals at applebee's that were better than the two times i have been here.  we went yesterday and while i do enjoy the atmosphere, that is about it.  the first time we went a few months ago, we thought it was just okay too, but not bad enough to post a review, but also not good enough either.  the items we have tried thus far:\nfireball whiskey wings - not spicy at all, but i did like the lollipop style presentation.\n<mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark> - no flavor to the meat at all.  salsa bland as well.\nbbq burger -  way better and much cheaper at bobby's burger palace.\nbig dipper roast beef sandwich - no flavor at all!  no horseradish taste and the au jus tasted like canned beef broth.  also, horribly tough meat that tasted faintly like smoke and the bread hardened up immediately as if microwaved.\n\nboth the above had an assortment of differen<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> tossed together that would have been good had they not tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp.\n\nnow mind you, nothing at all between the meats and the fries on both visits tasted like they had been hit with any seasoning at all. i am very surprised at the bland fast food quality for the prices they charge.  guy always seems to be about flavor and nothing has it!!  i am a local and love his shows, which is why i gave him a second chance to begin with.  the restaurant seems to be about style only, not food and not service.\n\nnow, add to the fact that we had a snarky wannabe comedian for a waiter, who only came back to see if we wanted another drink after my husband was already done! will not be back!!", 
            "have to say that we weren't all that impressed with guy's. our trip to \"flavortown\" wasn't that impressive. we tried the mac n cheese burger with the mac n cheese being the only remarkable thing about <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. the mac did taste better than anything i've been able to make at home. \n\nwe also tried the 67 cajun chicken sandwich which had horribly dried out chicken (as if was 2230 hours it may have been leftovers from the swing shift). it came with a sauce that helped with the dryness but it was still a very disappointing sandwich. \n\nonly saving grace was the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>. truffles truffles and more truffles as the menu described. they were thinly sliced fries perfectly fried, crispy and seasoned; as my fianc\\u00e9 described them \"omfg these are the bes<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> i've ever had\" i did have to agree.\n\nour waiter explained after our ordering  it was his time to go home and passed us off to another. our server then spent 30 mins at the bar doing prep work and that was the last we saw of anyone till i finally got up grabbed the first person i saw and asked for our bill. \n\nwe had to wait 20 minutes for a table as they refused to give us a reservation (their policy i'm guessing to have people lined up outside to make them look popular/ busy) there were empty tables every where when we sat but we were given a two top that didn't have room for all our food. think of the user experience that late at night and give them a real table for heavens sake.\n\n\nall in all it was a disappointment but if in the area we may see if we can get those fries to go.",

            "my family had eaten here months earlier and enjoyed it so i wanted to try it.  i didn't know where the restaurant was, and walked down the linq promenade looking for it.  once we walked around linq, we saw it on the corner across from harrah's.  we accessed the entrance from inside which was a narrow hall.  the hostess let us know it could be a 45 min. wait and we said ok, and then she said it could be faster.  there are 2 small benches outside of the hostess area in dark corners, as well as one seating area by the hostess stand.\n\nit took about 10 minutes and we were shown to our table with booth and chair seating.  we were close enough to our neighbours that we could touch them.  the menu seemed to have changed from my family's visit as the food they ordered wasn't on it.  i decided to get the pulled pork sandwich and although it's not listed, it comes with different cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> or a salad.  that's good as most of <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> and burgers are between $15-20.  \n\nthe food comes out fast! it was probably less than 5 minutes after ordering and i noticed that most people around us also got their food quickly.  the pork was nicely seasoned but tasted a little greasy on the bun.  the fries were good and i liked the crinkle cut ones.  the portion was big and i took half my sandwich to go, but we wanted to try the dessert.\n\nour dessert was a mountain of mint ice cream covered with chocolate sauce, cookies, and large chocolate chips.  it was hard as you make your way to the middle of the dessert but better than melting.  the server couldn't believe we were able to finish it! this is a dessert that can be shared between 4! \n\nit's loud with the tvs showing the football games and music playing on the speakers.  \n\nthe service to order dessert and refill water was slow.  we had a 10% coupon from our hotel but the server gave us 20% off instead.  the food was good, and comes out fast and big! come hungry!", 
            "i am not a fan of guy fiery. i've seen him on tv and don't like him. i did not know his name before, but i saw a picture of him on a poster and told my wife that he would f-up our favorite foods. based on yelp reviews, we decided to try the place anyway. \n\nyelp let us down. our fist dish, bourbon buffalo wings, had a weird taste to it. <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were cold when they arrived. i showed my wife the inside of a red pepper half that came as a veggie side with <mark>The General's Wings</mark> because it looked black. i looked at the other half and it was moldy. my wife showed it to the manager, and he quickly took it away and removed it from the bill. the beef ribs had an equally weird taste and were served just a little warm. they came with little bars of soft flavorless bread. we ordered a burger, and that at least was good. the temperature was appropriate, and the side of fries was fresh from the firs<mark>Triple T Fries</mark>. \n\nmy wife agreed with me. guy fieri f-ed up two of our favorite foods: wings and ribs. i would give them one star except for the great service. the manager and the waiter were very attentive. but we can't justify more than two stars for a restaurant based on service alone.", 
            "came here for dinner with a friend.  we got the <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark>, <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, and the original ringer burger.\n\nthe won-tacos were really good; excellent combination of ingredients.  the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> were probably the standout dish for us; my friend normally has a lot of ketchup with her fries (she basically has some fries with her ketchup), but after eating a few fries, she leaned over and whispered, \"don't tell anyone, but i don't even want ketchup with fries!\", which, coming from her, is the highest praise you could give to fries.  the original ringer burger was quite delicious too.  my friend was so enamored with her half that she bit her own finger eating it!", 
            "we definitely picked a good choice when we picked this restaurant! \n\ni just had to see what all the hype was about. to start i ordered the guido's freaky tiki. a delicious cocktail that included everything in it. 2 different types of rum, passion fruit, pineapple juice, orange juice lime juice, grenadine. \n\nfor the entree my friend recommended the bacon mac and cheese burger. omg, it was amazing and i was definitely in heaven eating this thing. seriously imagine a huge burger with mac and cheese in it. one of the best parts was <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> come with fries. no extra charge! & not jus<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> but a variety. truffle fries, onion rings, and regular fries, so you get to try a little bit of everything. genius! what's not to love! everything was really pricy here but you get what you pay for! & it was definitely well worth it. i'll be back next time i'm in vegas. =)", 
            "the pictures <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> looked super crazy and deadly but the portions are actually very feasible. our group of 5 shared: sashimi \"won-tacos,\" <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, the original ringer burger, and the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. we probably could have stuffed ourselves with another item. my favorites were the fries and the original burger. the fries were super crisp and full of truffle flavor, especially the aioi. the original burger had the flavors i like most, although i think the bacon mac-n-cheese is more unique and a good combination to try.\n\nto me, <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are a little better than your average burger but not a favorite i would want again and again (i still prefer bachi burger or even holsteins). the tacos were definitely a let down- super small portion of tuna and not very interesting. overall, i would only come back for a beer and some of those fries.", 
            "totally excited to come here we love guy!\na short wait was no issue we got a a text when the table was ready my daughter wants to be a chef and was sooo stoked to be here. she loves guy vs rachel's kids cook off. as a former chef i was giddy too. it's an odd layout and ambiance. is it a bar? a bbq joint? country western or rock?  no clue the menu is basically burgers and sandwiches. no kids menu soo 13 bucks a kid or more.  we got the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> the triple d burger the dragon fries and the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark> . we'll the food on par omg so good but from the loud music the squished seating and it was uncomfortable the messed up a beer order which we'll can pass.  the two shining lights in this place was our server christopher and the flavor of the food.  the ambiance was hectic rushed and stressful the only working pos was outside sooo 30degree weather shooting\ndown my spine every time a server had to ring something up.   kudos to the waitstaff and chef to saving the night.", 
            "i love burgers. i have been extremely disappointed with probably the last 10 burgers i've tried around los angeles. i've told myself to stay away from foo foo non traditional burgers and i've been grilling them at home recently because i've been so disappointed lately. my favorite burger in la is pie and burger in pasadena so you can have an idea what i like.\n\nwifey wanted to hit this up. i had low expectations. we ordered the regular burger (forgot the name but it had bbq sauce). now i would normally not get bbq sauce but this burger was tasty. the bread was soft and fresh (so important). the meat was super juicy and not overcooked. perfect amount of condiments to keep it all moist and together. loved the differen<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> on the side. already seasoned and came out piping hot and fresh. i was so impressed with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.\n\nwe sat at the bar to avoid waiting. wifey loved her lemon drop drink and i appreciated the proper guiness pulls on my draft. also had the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>. they were okay. good concept and i love how they cut them up and push em up before cooking like those asian style wings. i'm just more of a fried wing kinda guy. liked the wasabi blue cheese sauce.\n\nmain point.. good damn burger. props to the cooks.", 
            "my wife and i ate hear on new year's eve, as we just wanted something quick, and weren't interested in some expensive prix fixe menu other restaurants were offering.  if you follow triple d at all, you'll notice that the decor of this place has guy written all over it.  it's not a huge place inside, but they also offer outdoor seating.  since it was about 35 degrees outside, we weren't interested in that, despite having heat lamps.\n\nthe only knock i have against this place is that the menu is a bit limited.  there were several things that looked good to me, but my wife was struggling to find something.  i had the bacon mac and cheese burger, while my wife decided on a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce.  each sandwich comes with a variety of differen<mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, which is cool.  you get crinkle cut, shoestring, wedge, waffle, etc.  i thought that was a cool idea.  the portions here are enormous, so be sure to bring your appetite.  my wife and i could barely finish half of our meals.  i thought the food tasted really good, so i'd be willing to give this place another shot.  it might be best to spilt a meal between two people, since they're so large.  it's probably not the best place to bring kids, as it's loud and there's a lot of boozing going on.\n\nall in all, i'm a fan of guy, and i thought his restaurant in vegas was good.  we got out of here for about $40-$50 for the two of us.  give this place a shot if you're in vegas, and sit out on the patio if it's nice outside.", 
            "someone asked me privately from yelp if i was picky with food because i used to cook for celebrity chefs? i'd like to say no because there are some food establishments that aren't considered 5 star that for a plate i'd slap my mama---but i am harder on establishments that consider themselves elite amongst top chefs. \n\na friend recommended this place to me and i decided to give it a chance. normally i don't frequent celebrity chef establishments because having worked in this industry i know that the chef is not who is cooking the food. i was excited about going on the strip since i avoid it like ebola, so i think my expectations were too high.\n\nwe were given a seat on a very busy corner and our next best option was to be seated by this wall with a flat screen. we opted by the wall. while waiting for our food we stared at this wall feeling like inmates serving a prison sentence. our server brought us some glasses of water and joked that we were about to enjoy the lovely minerals from lake mead. after one sip, i knew what he was talking about. yuck! i couldn't get over the jumbo ice cubes and thought they were the most beautiful thing. \n\nwe started out with the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> which were...ok. only the very top of the fries contained that truffle \"goodness\" and it was so faint. which means they probably didn't \"toss\" all of the ingredients together. they just piled and sprinkled it on top. cooking 101. i love truffle oil and i barely got any, leaving me feel like i just ordered garlic parmesan fries. on the menu it says, \"truffle, truffle, + more truffle.\" it was more like, \"lies, lies, + more lies!\"\n\nnot wanting to gorge myself silly i ordered bruthas badass caesar salad and the generals wings. my friend ordered some jumbo burger.\nour food came and after one look i could tell that my bread on the plate was stale. here's a little inside info for you guys. croutons are usually made with day old bread to avoid cost and waste. there's nothing wrong with that, but after a day----you don't make croutons or keep the ones you made previously.....you just cut your losses and toss it. i knew right away that jumbo crouton was made more than a day in advance. it was so friggin' hard and you could tell by looking at it closely that it had started to get old because when you cook old ass bread it leaves a pattern that looks pulled. it's hard to explain without showing you closely, but maybe you can see it in my photos.\n<mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> dressing was sooooo watery and thin, which was most likely caused by tossing the lettuce while wet. i don't even want to get into that. \n\n<mark>The General's Wings</mark> were hard as a brick! they were overcooked then glazed with this wierd walmart hoisin tasting sauce. nothing had flavor. my friend didn't enjoy his burger either. it was cold. we didn't complain because i understood that it wasn't something that could be corrected. the food is what it is due to errors that need to be corrected by the executive chef, or guy fieri just really sucks. i'm gonna sound like an old timer, but back in my day a chef wasn't a chef until he/she spent over ten years training, spent years in europe giving blood, sweat, and tears on the cooking line, and even then you were humble until you proved yourself leading a line. too many people call themselves chefs when they haven't mastered the basics of flavor. even i haven't mastered anything at this point since i left that world and discontinued my training--but i really was hard on this restaurant. food can't just look pretty on a plate---it has to taste good too. i expected much more from a big name \"chef\".", 
            "guy fieri's in las vegas is exactly as guy's show is on the food network, big burgers and lots of fries. the interior is indicative of his style with the clipboard menu and the wood planks that hold the drinks menu. our server, brittany provided great service. the kitchen is an open design where you can see what all of the line cooks are doing inside.\n\nfor two, we ordered the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> (truffles), the bacon mac n cheese burger, and <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark>. the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> are very thin cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> that come with micro-planed truffle shavings, gouda cheese and parsley sprinkled on top. the thin cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> are very crispy, and have great texture. the gouda cheese gives the fries a nice cheesy taste without overwhelming the taste of the fries or the truffles. the truffle, just as importantly was not overwhelming as well, providing an extra layer of flavor with the earthy, mushroomy tones. the creamy white truffle dip really did just taste like sour cream. as the price would suggest, the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> do come with a lot of fries. i would recommend sharing this with up to 4 people if everyone is having a burger as well.\n\nthe <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> is a charbroiled burger topped with a mac and cheese that is slightly better than average. other toppings included crispy deep fried onion stings, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> comes with what would be the equivalent of a medium mcdonalds fries (more on this later). the tomato really did not add much to this burger and really could have been either left off or given another slice of. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> patty alone was actually a little dry and could have been a bit moister. the mac-n-cheese was not supermelty as the menu would have you believe, but was tasty anyway. the donkey-sauce, i believe, is the bbq sauce at the bottom <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. the apple-wood bacon brought in salty and smoky flavors to the party and is always a great addition to a burger or mac-n-cheese. the brioche bun brought in some sweetness to balance all of the salty flavors in between. i wish there was a bit more pickle, but i just like pickles. overall, this burger was good, but short of great or excellent.\n\n<mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> is a charbroiled burger topped with blue cheese and bacon, with addition toppings of crisped onion strings, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> is also served on a brioche bun and this also helps balance out the flavors a little. the blue cheese was actually a little overwhelming on some parts of that burger, some areas of it had a ton of blue cheese and other areas had little to none. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> did have some interesting spice flavor to it, but it was difficult to discern what those were among the blue cheese. this burger also had the same problem with the dryer burger patty as the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. overall, this burger was good as well, it just could have used a bit more attention to detail to prevent that blue cheese from being overwhelming in certain areas <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.\n\nthe fries that come with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are crunchy just like the fries with the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, but there is a bit of variation, some are thicker cut home fries, mixed in with a few waffle fries, and the super thin cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> as well. the larger fries are seasoned with a spicy cajun type seasoning or spicy seasoned salt.\n\noverall, this was a good meal with solid flavors. i think that i can make a better mac-n-cheese with just three cheeses and have it actually be supermelty. the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> suffers from not having that supermelty cheese as well as a slightly moister patty. <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> has the same problem with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> patty and needed a bit more attention to detail. overall, the food was a solid 3/5 and the interior/service was an excellent concept for guy's restaurant (4/5). in any other location, i would consider the price and knock this down one star for the price based on the offerings. however, in vegas, it seems pretty average. guy fieri's gets a 3.5/5 with all things considered.",

            "my friends and i had really been looking forward to having dinner and drinks at this place. we went on a friday night so we knew that being a restaurant on the strip, the wait would be long but the hour long wait should have been the first red flag. in any case, we stuck it out since we really wanted to try out the drinks (which i ended up not getting because they were taking too long so i drank the red bull and vodka my friend brought with her on the walk to and from the ti, her hotel). after ordering drinks, our party waited at least 30 minutes for drinks. this includes non alcoholic drinks. for real?!?  disappointment after disappointment. menu was subpar. as my husband states, \"for a guy that travels around the country trying different food, the menu sure lacks variety and creativity.\"  then, the food we ordered took another 45 minutes to arrive. finally, when asking for water from the same server, 3 times, and not getting it, my friend got up and got it herself. when a waitress came over to the station where the water was held, instead of telling my friend that she would take us water, as she should have done, she directed my friend to the water with ice and told her to go ahead and take it to our table. how unprofessional!!!!  if she saw a colleague of hers wasn't working to her potential when it comes to customer service, she should have done it herself to help the restaurant redeem itself. \n\nwhen ou<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> spoke to the manager, his excuse was that that they were short staffed. again, a friday night on the strip, you should have more than enough staff, knowing how busy it can get. we were given a discount on the check, although it does not make up for the slow service and lack of professionalism. will not be visiting again.", 
            "i really, really enjoyed my overall visit. i loved the decor and liked that they had a foozball table to play with for those who are waiting. the area next to the hostess table had a lot of guy's merchandise, from books to shirts, so there is something for everyone from hardcore guy fans to those who just want a souvenir. there is seating inside, outside, and at the bar. the seating outside is okay, since you can people watch. but even with the misters, it was too hot and the view is just of the entrance of the linq and harrahs. while waiting, they have some guy memorabilia, like his unlv chef coat, to view and the kitchen is open so you can see <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> coming out.\n\nwe ended up sitting near the windows. i loved that the windows added natural light and allowed you to see the strip. i liked the decor from the napkins to the menu clipboards and tables, it was very guy-esque. \n\nthe food was very delicious and surprisingly filling. each burger comes with a mixture of waffle fries, shoestring fries, and crinkle cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> with seasoning. i got the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and i loooved it!! it's the best <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> i've ever had. it was so tasty and everything in and on <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> complimented one another. i tried some of my brother's off-da-hook original smash burger and it was also super delicious.\n\nservice was great. we were greeted right away upon arriving. our waiter was nice and attentive. bonus, our food came out right away after ordering. fyi, there is no restroom in the restaurant, but outside in the linq to the right when you exit. \n\noverall, i recommend coming here because as guy would say, \"it's off the chain!\"", 
            "ok so let me start off by saying that i didn't want to go here, the boy did. and he previously kept repeating that this place got pretty bad reviews. well, as you can see, i'm leaving one of them. being that we were both drinking, we made a poor decision to stop by this sad-famous chef named restaurant. \n\nit was pretty empty when we entered which should've given us a clear indication of how much the food sucked... we got the bacon mac and cheese burger and the waffle <mark>Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries</mark>. i mean, how could you even go wrong with a combination like that? well, you can at guy's. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was so over cooked it was black, they basically just slapped some kraft cheese on top of pasta and microwaved some bacon and put that monstrosity together... and my waffle fries!! my poor dried hard crispy fries. they sat in the fryer way too long. they basically just added a bunch of chili and cheese to cover up what they'd done, but you can't fool me! honestly, carl's jr crisscu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> are better. and the cocktail, the $14 cocktail that was only filled just a little more than half way of my glass... \n\ni shake my head in disappointment and will never be back. pretty sure they'll be out of business soon.", 
            "it's easy and fun to make fun of guy fieri.  when we arrived at the restaurant, my daughter laughed at his likeness on posters (and she doesn't know who he is).  however, i like  his restaurant, to my surprise!\nwe ordered the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> and loved 'em. \nwe ordered the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>.  loved those, too.  actually, i think i really loved 'em--more than the triple t's.  check the menu to see what they are.  \nwe ordered the ribs but the server came back and said they had run out of them :(  maybe they don't stock them on wednesdays?  bummer.\nwe had a caesar salad that came with a giant crouton underneath.  <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> was kind of small if you consider the giant crouton took up a lot of room on the plate and i think it was stale.  this was a bland caesar among caesars.\nsince we couldn't have ribs, the server suggested the brisket nachos.  the chips were definitely stale and the toppings were too sparse.  i liked the idea of them but was disappointed.  most of the chips i ate had some chopped tomato and hardly any cheese.  needs a lot more cheese and meat on top, for sure.\nservice was great.  the menu is small, which i like.  the fries are excellent. :)", 
            "during a recent visit with some family from out of town, we decided it would be fun to try guy fieri's las vegas restaurant.  we are all big fans of his.  i think the overall feeling of our visit is that it was worth trying once but this will not be a regular rotation location.  it was our mistake for going on a friday night on the weekend of life is beautiful.  is there a worse time we could have chosen?  perhaps new years but that just seems crazy.  this was busy enough.  the linq (hotel) was not even going to let us park valet because they were booked solid.  but there are a couple of elderly and handicapped members of our familial group that don't get around so well.  my dad told the valet attendant that we were going to guy's and he took care of the parking situation for us.  cool.  \n\nso we get into the casino and put in a name for the seven of us to eat at guy's. there was a long wait because it was so busy.  and there was very little seating outside of the restaurant for waiting purposes.  the bar was crowded too.  we got a couple of drinks and continued waiting.  when we finally got called up we were taken outside to the patio area.  it was hot and very loud with the adjacent carnival court just a few hundred feet away.  it was difficult to enjoy dinner when we were sweaty and struggling to hear each other.  inside didn't seem much better.  just as crowded and loud though noticeably cooler.\n\nfor all the people who were there i was surprised at how quickly our food came out.  of course with a smaller menu such as this place has, the preparation must go quickly.  opinions on the food were decidely mixed.  my aunt and i both got the onion ring burger.  she enjoyed it.  i thought is was over cooked.  but i like my burgers pink in the middle and she likes them well done.  my other aunt and my grandm split a beef dip.  my grandma did not seem to enjoy it much while my aunt loved it with the spicy horse radish sauce.  my dad and step mom both ordered a pulled pork sandwich which they seemed to like.  most of us had fried with our meals.  the fries were intriguing.  you get shoe strings, crinkle cut and waffle cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> all in one little paper taco.  the crinkle cut and waffle cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> were my favorite because you can actually taste the potatoes.  shoe string fries are too easy to over cook.  and they aren't the best for dipping in ketchup.    \n\nthis place is a hopping madhouse and very fieri-centric.  there are pictures of him with celebrities everywhere.  and so many different products with his name/face.  the man is a marketing genious.  as far as the restaurant goes, meh.  i'd rather pay half as much at red robbin for a jucier burger and a quieter atmosphere.", 
            "we weren't sure about trying out guy's place, but we were hungry, the reviews were decent, and it was handy at the time.  \n\nthe high tables are super uncomfortable if you don't have long, long legs.  i am 5'6\", so not very short, but too short for comfort at one of those tables.  the wooden stool just dug into my legs the whole time because my legs just weren't long enough for my feet to rest on the top rung of the stool.\n\ni tried a couple dishes here, the tripple <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, which were delish.  i could seriously live on them.  they are thin cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> so nice and crispy with loads of truffle.  they are seriously a 5/5.\n\nwhat i was not crazy about was the <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark>... this was the least <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark> i have ever tasted in my life.  i understand that guy does his own take on recipes, but this was taken so far to the extreme that it wasn't even recognizable.  it had croutons, carrot and chickpeas which was odd, but okay.  what was unforgiving to a <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark> though is that there was no tang or zip to the dressing.  it was a little sweet and just not very tasty.", 
            "bacon mac and cheese burger - wow!  fries are spicy if you like a kick.  nachos are okay, but the spicy wings were awesome.  party at my table also enjoyed lettuce wraps that were awesome so you can at least get something that is no<mark>Triple T Fries</mark>!", 
            "what can i say other than omg, i had the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> which was absolutely amazing, super tasty, really filling, just generally super.  my husband had the nachos which he thoroughly enjoyed, they had brisket and a delicious bbq sauce\n\ni had fries with my burger which were nice as they were different varieties e.g skinny fries, crinkle cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> etc.  \n\ni like the decor and atmosphere here, we were seated outside which was great for a warm vegas evening.\n\nmy negatives however, firstly there were a tonne of people waiting to be seated despite the fact there were lots of empty tables.  the music was horrendously loud to the point where my husband and i couldn't hear ourselves to have a conversation....what is it with this as it seems to be a common thing here in vegas?  \n\nthe biggest negative for me was the stupid wooden tray/plate that the food was served on.  i think that anything wooden in the kitchen can be quite unhygienic (we've all heard of  chopping boards harbouring bacteria) but they also line the wooden plate with paper which eventually softens from the juice in the meat and i ended up with several mouthfuls of goopy paper where is had stuck to my food, not a pleasant sensation for me nor for anyone noticing me digging it out of my mouth!!!!\n\noverall i really enjoyed this place and would definitely come back if i am in town again some day.", 
            "great food! guy did a great job with this restaurant, easy location to find with nice outdoor patio if you watch any of guy's shows you will definitely feel him in the restaurant. had the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>...delicious! also the highly rated bacon mac n cheese burger and loved it. \n\nwe visited on a very busy friday night and were seated within 15 minutes. we had three servers so everything we ordered was at the table within minutes of ordering.", 
            "i was seated immediately despite the crowd. the food was interesting and very good. as an appetizer i ordered the guy italian with a cheese fondue dip.   very favorable and outside the norm.  i ordered the mac and cheese burger which would have relieved four stars but i ate half of a beef dip sandwich that was off the hook with flavor.  the fries were also a medley of differen<mark>Triple T Fries</mark>. a bit salty but delicious. another must try place. i'd come back.", 
            "i came here for the fabulous yelp elite event prior to opening and i had the most amazing experience! my second visit was with ruben and my brother since i wanted them to check it out. the service was fantastic and gm mike was just as hospitable as the first time! my most recent visit was a couple weeks ago and the menu hasn't changed with exception of the removal of dishes like the rojo onion rings and churros. some of the food wasn't as good as i recall. service was still great and they're always insanely busy (no reservations). \n\nbrisket nachos ($17)\n<mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> ($15)\n<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> ($14)\n<mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> ($14)\nfireball whiskey wings ($16)\n<mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> ($18)\nseared flat iron poutine ($32)\n14-hour beef brisket ($34)\n\ni love the concept of <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> because of the multiple options, but the chicken is always salty and the sauces are just okay. the nachos are terrible. i do really enjoy the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, but again, salty. all of the entr\\u00e9es are decent. i haven't had a bad sandwich, but there are so many different flavors going on that it borders on too much. for example, the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> is grilled with poblano and pepper jack cheese, and has gouda, sweet pepper red onion jam, donkey sauce, and garlic butter on the bun. it's good, but it could do without one or two ingredients.", 
            "i was very surprised by the decor and the food selection that was available. don't get me wrong i understand you pay for quality but for some of the prices on the menu i thought to myself they are kind of pricy compared to other spots with similar esthetics. but after getting my nachos that exceeded my expectations i didn't feel so bad about the bill lol. bu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> interactive staff and a good place to put in your vegas food list.", 
            "like most folks, i'm a huge fan of diners, drive-ins and dives, so when guy fieri opened a place on the strip, i knew i was going to be there.  located inside the newly revamped linq casino, this place is nearest to the exit heading to harrahs.  the narrow small entrance creates a  slow flow area as everyone is funneled in and out of this place.  it has the feel of a ddd place and the ambiance is loud.  the menu was surprisingly disappointing.  i guess i shouldn't be surprised since it was really limited to bar food.  i have tried a number of sandwiches and my immediate reaction is that they really try to do too much.  sometimes simple is better.  i really don't like a sloppy sandwich and that is what you'll get here.  nonetheless, i did like the 3 differen<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> and i found the meals mostly tasty and quite large.", 
            "excellent service and extremely rich tasting food, guy has taken sports bar food to a new level of decadence. i had the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> and 14-hour brisket sandwich. the meal was heavily portioned. the truffle oil laden fries were topped with minced garlic, cheese, and cilantro. the brisket was fall apart tender on top of texas toast, abundantly garnished with cabbage. the mixed fries accompanying the brisket were like hot thick bbq chips, delicious. ashley made our experience perfect, attending to our wants and needs, making great suggestions, and patient. my suggestions though are to order margaritas or the ginger mint cocktail to temper the creamy robust and overwhelming at times. please share because the tastes are to strong to eat the same dish for 30 minutes, mix it up and prepare for large portions.", 
            "really wanted to try this place , so was excited when i got a table - well actually a seat at the bar. very nice  \"cushy\" seat actually ! ordered a bar special drink kick'd up caddy with patron tequilia, grand marnier, lime and spicy jalape\\u00f1o's were floating on top and the rim was dusted with spiced salt - which was like chilli powder, salt and something else i just can't put my finger on.....but blow your socks off good ! every sip was better and better ! so good that i had to have three ... i'm making that at home for sure - thanks guy ! \n\norder tuna sashimi tacos and they had fresh tuna and a mango salsa with creme and a wonton wrapper as the taco shell served with fresh lines and some radish. they were amazing and only 4 very small tacos. wish you could order that with something else small for lunch cause they were very small - but it was only an appetizer. so after my second drink i ordered the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> with truffles, gouda and a truffle drip, omg that was the best plate of french  fries that i ever ate (beats earl's truffle fries) thin little shoestring fries with truffle oil and very fine shredded gouda on top with a mayo and truffle oil dip - all was absolutely amazing. i couldn't even make a dent in the fries. if i was home would have taken a doggie bag on those for sure ! out of this world good.  \n\nthe place is a great buzz - music was just right and not too loud at all and played fantastic music !!!! the bar like most was busy with action and a great patio outside with heaters !  i did expect more on the menu from guy, but i was not at all disappointed. so many chefs have their own places now that they never come to, but you buying their concept of food, decor and the whole package knowing it is the true essence of them - at least that's my thought after three drinks ! \n\nawesome place - wish it was closer to home !! \n\nso glad i came here to enjoy and after three drinks i will waddle my way back to the hotel to burn this off for sure !!"

            "was here on 4/26/14 with family and friends. this was my first and much anticipated visit to a guy fieri restaurant and it far exceeded my expectations!\n\nour waitress, michelle, was friendly, energetic and informative  she knew the menu very well (for only being open one week!) and was able to make great suggestions. \n\ni had the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> and the blue-sabi sauce they came with was off the charts. my main course was the pastrami burger that was amazing!!  even two of my sons, who are very picky eaters, were totally impressed with the bacon mac n cheese burger. my wife had the <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark> that she said were some of the best she's ever had!!!\n\nthe entire experience was awesome and i am already looking forward to our next visit!", 
            "2 words: food poisoning!!!\nlet me start this by saying that i do not drink alcohol so that y'all don't think it was alcohol poisoning. \n\ni ordered <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> that had bleu cheese. i'm not quite sure what it was called, but i know it was $18.00. i also ordered the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> as an appetizer for our table to share.\n\nthe fries were nothing special. they are wedge cut and come with some sort of ranch dressing on the side. i really only ordered them because i love bleu cheese. \n\nas soon as i bit into my burger, i told everyone sitting with me that <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was not good. it was extremely dry and the meat was soooo thick it was hard to chew and even harder to swallow. \n\nanywho, i did not like <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> but i ate it anyway because i was starving. i couldn't finish it because it was soooo dry. so i left a little less than half. i was completely unsatisfied but i did not care enough to send it back. \n\nwe paid and went on our merry way to enjoy our last night in sin city. i got back to the room and a few hours later i had to run to the bathroom to throw everything up. i'm sorry if this is too much info but it's what happened. i threw up 4 times and all 4 times it was the hamburger patty and the bleu cheese. it was the worst feeling ever. and then a little something else hit me, but i won't mention that. around my eye area, i saw that i was starting to develop these little red dots all over and a little above my forehead. it had to have been an allergic reaction to the bad meat. now i thought it was just me, but that morning when we were heading down to valet, one of the girls who was in our party but staying in a different hotel told me she threw up 3 times and it was all <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. she had the same burger as i did. coincidence? i think not. \n\n2 nights before, we had eaten at gordon ramsay's burgr, and i had also ordered a burger with bleu cheese and i was perfectly fine. \n\ni hate to base my review on my experience but i can guarantee i'll never go back because just the thought of walking by there makes me sick to my stomach. \n\ni had to catch a flight back and i was terrified of not making it to the bathroom in time in case it hit me again. \n\ni will say this, even before i got sick, i did not like the taste of any of the food. \n\nsorry for the tmi but i just needed to get this out there.",

            "on our first visit here, the week it opened, the hostess have us a quick mini tour as she was taking us to our table. on our next visit, we didn't get that.\n\nthe first time, we sat outside, which was actually pretty nice. it's rather loud, but the people watching is awesome and you can hear / somewhat see the bands playing at carnival court. on our second visit, we sat inside at a high top. avoid this at all costs. the high-tops are way way way too close together and super awkward. our sever even apologized for how awkward it was. \n\nthe ambiance and space are cool. has a definite guy feel to it. it reminds me of a nicer and newer tex wasabi's (sonoma valley location). \n\ni was super super excited to come here because of one thing: <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>! as you might notice on my profile here on yelp, <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> would be my last meal. the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> at tex wasabi's are just a total dream. but alas, they are all different here. at wasabi's, they are thin fries, covered and drenched in hot sauce and parmesan crumbs. drenched, but still crispy. here, they're giant twisty fries. and you get a shot of hot sauce to pour over them. hint: right away when you order them, order extra hot sauce and extra blue wasabi sauce. the blue wasabi dipping sauce is insanely delicious. i could eat it by itself with a spoon. seriously. god bless guy fieri for coming up with this. so while the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> aren't the same, they're still tasty. and the portion is huge. 4 stars.\n\nso on to <mark>The General's Wings</mark>. have i mentioned how much i love hot wings? the fireball whiskey wings have a fantastic flavor and are served with the divine blue wasabi sauce. 4 stars. the parmaggedon wings are mostly breading and were too dry and overdone. they're served with a marinara dipping sauce which was tasty. 2 stars. <mark>The General's Wings</mark> themselves are kinda fatty and don't seem like the best quality. if they were better quality, they'd be more stars.\n\nbe wary of the beer flight deal. we were told it was $11. but that's actually $11 per each series of 4 beers. we were quite shocked when we received our bill. but after asking the waitress, she knocked the price back to what we thought it was. the full tasting is 4 series of 4 beers. and if you drink them all, you get a t-shirt. james o. and i were sharing, so our server was really nice and let us each have a t-shirt. very cool. fair warning: the beers are mostly ipas, and you should share as, well, that's a lot of f-ing beer.\n\nthe frozen shots sounded intriguing to me, so i ordered the fireball whiskey one. it was not frozen. it was totally room temp in a cold shot glass. not at all what i was imagining.\n\nthe <mark>Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae</mark> was so fabulous. huge! get it! it comes with a ton of toppings and you basically create your own <mark>Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae</mark>. we had a blast with this. 5 stars.\n\non both visits, the servers were nice, friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, and attentive. \n\nall in all, i'll keep coming back. but i wonder if i can get the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> tex wasabi-style? they are quite better that way.", 
            "i ate the <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark> which were very good and i will order again. my boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese burger. i want a huge fan of that one and would not order again but it's a popular one. it might just be my tastebuds that couldn't appreciate <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. the next day we  went back for dessert. we tried the <mark>Mexican Churros</mark>. i was honestly pretty disappointed. i was really hoping for the best churros ever. instead i got long pieces of over fried dough that was too crunchy and just fell apart. next time i'll try something different. over all, i love guy fieri and loved his restaurant. oh....almost forgot! you must try the fries. i they're the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>. not sure but they have a white cream on the side and i think they are covered in parmesan and parsley. absolutely delicious!", 
            "this place has something for everyone. we went here twice during our vegas stay and i was pretty pleased with both meals. once was for a late night snack, the other lunch. \n\nfor the late night snack, we got the sashimi won-ton tacos. these were delicious and possibly one of the highlights of the menu! <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> were in the shape of taco shells and were perfect! super light and crispy. the filling was ahi tuna with a mango salsa- delicious! we ordered the fried ice cream dessert and i was pretty disappointed with the fried part- it was actually pretty soggy and instead of being crispy- it actually was more chewy- not what i had hoped for. it did come with a considerable amount of sides to top with it to make it your own- but i wouldn't order that one again. \n\nthe second meal we had here i tried the <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark>. you get 4 small tacos to an order, which is a good portion size. they were great and came with two salsa options. there was a good portion of steak in each of the tacos and a yummy cabbage slaw on top.  the quad hotel gave us a free coupon for <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>- so we tried those too--- think steak type fries meets buffalo wings. the bleu cheese dressing is pretty over whelming- i went for ranch instead. \n\noverall, the service is pretty good, the staff is welcoming and generally attentive. you even have the opportunity to do a digital survey (there's an i-touch in the bill folio) at the end of your meal to give feedback. the portion sizes can be pretty huge- make sure you go in hungry if you're ordering entrees!", 
            "i want to shout out to the lovely and very talented waitress liz who was one of the few bright spots in our visit. another is the open kitchen which offers a different view into the kitchen than most.\n\nwe ordered a flight of beer which was plentiful however the beer simply wasn't very good.  2 of 10 stars\n\nwe had an appetizer of the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>.  i expected more flavor from the king of flavortown but you could hardly taste the blue cheese.  the buffalo sauce was good but not fire hot.  i did enjoy the large twisted steak fries and the fries were probably the best part of the night. 6 of 10 stars\n\ni ordered the mac and cheese burger.  i was expecting a well cooked burger with a cheddary taste from the mac.  instead i got an overcooked burger that reminded me of fat burger. in fact, liz helpfully suggested we smash <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> down in order to eat it without too much mess.  the mac had absolutely no cheese flavor and could have been simply boiled pasta if it didn't have a slightly orangy color.  i did like the bun but not enough to salvage <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.  4 of 10 stars\n\nmy so ordered the rock shrimp mini tacos. this was the most disappointing thing of the night.  the rubbery corn tortillas were bland and aside from the pickled onions there was no flavor at all. the shrimp was definitely overcooked in the frying process and the chili sauce could not save the dish. 1 of 10 stars\n\ni like guy's shows because he is animated and truly seems to enjoy his food but after dining here i seriously question his tastebuds, or his commitment to his restaurants.  i will say this restaurant reflects my perception of guy's on screen personality, which is a blur of add ridden angst with a lot of flare and little substance.  i will not rule out a return visit if someone visits who has to see guy's restaurant and i hope there are improvements but i see no reason to seek out this disappointing hot mess anytime soon.", 
            "omg this is a place not to miss.  quite simply...get <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.  this is the place to go if you want an outstanding \"gourmet\" burger.  our first experience with guy fieri and his delectable burgers was on a recent carnival cruise where carnival introduced  \"guy's burger joint\" on some of their cruise ships.  no joke...<mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> were so delicious and bursting with flavor that we ate there 6 out of 7 days on the cruise...sometimes twice, most times even avoiding the gourmet meals provided by the cruise.  and we were not alone. so after a late night show in vegas we discovered guy had a restaurant in the \"quad\" and had to try it out. the restaurant offers ample outdoor seating for great late night people watching on the strip.\n\nas for the menu:   my wife and i split the \"original smash burger\" and an order of \"<mark>Vegas Fries</mark>\".  the smash burger just melts in your mouth with bursting flavor...it is like an unbelievable taste beyond anything you have ever  experienced.  <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> comes with its own set of \"fries\"...a collection of different types of fries along with blue cheese and buffalo sauce for dipping.  the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> are also a taste sensation and \"rolled\" in buffalo sauce and again bursting with flavor.  hint: next time, my wife and i agreed...no splitting <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> (cause you just can't get enough)...and <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> comes with fries as well.  (who knew).  there are tons of other choices but why venture beyond <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.  and best yet...we don't have to wait a year for our next carnival cruise to get our guy burger fix!", 
            "i have to say that this place was well worth the wait. my husband surprised me for our anniversary. the food was delish! we shared an order of <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> and they were.....uh-maze-zing! i ordered the drunkin <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> for my main course and can i say that i was not disappointed. the fish was tender and all the fixins complimented it very well. would definitely recommend to family and friends.", 
            "mayor of flavor town burger was crazy good as were the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>. prices were pretty steep and i understand paying a little more on the strip but too much $$$ in my opinion. only go back if visitors want to go, we'll take them as neat experience plus good food.", 
            "we came here mainly just to say that we did, during a recent weekend getaway. we stopped in on a thursday night after a trip to the high roller. there were 4 of us (2 couples) and we all started with a  variety of drinks...i opted for the \"lemon drop - not\" and it was very good. we shared the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> and <mark>The General's Wings</mark>. both very good. we ordered 2 of the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> to share between the 4 of us, again just because we felt that we \"had\" to order this dish if we were at guy's restaurant. we weren't expecting much to be honest. we were all so pleasantly surprised that this was the best burger ever! it was fabulous and i want to go back to vegas just for this burger, and this is not something that i would normally have picked from a menu! \n\nthen the highlight of our night when we jokingly asked our server when guy would be joining us. he pointed and said he's right there if you want to ask him. sure enough, guy was in town and we had the opportunity to meet him. he even took some selfies with us...yes, he took the selfies. it was a fun way to spend our first night in vegas.", 
            "this was our first time here and it was a great time! we ordered the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> & fireball whiskey wings and they were delicious! we were served by dan and he was on point so give his section a try. we washed it all down the guido's freaky tiki. give this place a shot and you won't be sorry.", 
            "this place is over the top! the food is great and the portions...when the hell did every restaurant in vegas begin serving only sumo wrestlers. my family had a great mix of food - <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>, <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> and <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>. don't kid yourself, the fries aren't a side; not by a long shot. they are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. we all loved our food, but i'll have to say the motley que was the best meal of the night. damn it! my wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering, and she did it again here. \n\nthis place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. we had dinner at burgr the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot. \n\nmy only complaint is the hostess staff. they treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. they have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. next! when i asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. i showed her my phone - no text. well, that also meant no apology from her either. she gave me a look like, do you still want in or not, i have other people to be rude to.",

            "this place is \"out of bounds!\" my boyfriend is a huge fan of guy so it was a given that we would dine here as soon as we arrived in vegas. conveniently, we stayed at the linq so we had our first meal in vegas at guy's restaurant and ate here for breakfast. i ordered the breakfast burrito which was crrrazy delicious. the tortilla chips on the side were served with a cheese sauce which was rich but light. my boyfriend ordered the shortbread pancakes which were bigger than his head but he killed it because it was so delicious. we enjoyed breakfast so much my boyfriend wanted to come back for our last night in vegas. i ordered the original ringer burger that was juicy, savory, crunchy, and satisfying just like a good old american burger should be and my boyfriend ordered the bacon mac & cheese burger which disappeared from sight. we also ordered a side of the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> which was ridiculously good and reminiscent of buffalo wings with a blue cheese sauce. once again, not skimping on portions and satisfied our cravings. i also highly recommend the rumchata frozen shots...lord knows i had quite a few! definitely making this restaurant one of our favorite spots in vegas for casual food and drinks!",

(also a shot of buffalo sauce) and overall very grea<mark>Triple T Fries</mark>!\n\nso, as mentioned at the top, i really really really wanted to give this place a 4/5...but...due to the crazy loud music, lacking server, and forgotten items throughout the dishes, 3/5 is the best i could do :(\nbut also, i would love to return :)",

            "when i came here for dinner, there was a wait for approximately 45 mins. this  restaurant does not take reservations. the service was average and so was the food. i am a huge fan of guy fieri, and his show triple d (diners, drive-inns, and dives). with that being said, i had high expectations for his restaurant.\n\nthe service was o.k. my friends and i was hungry and staying in a nearby hotel. i was looking forward to going to a \"guy fieri\" restaurant, and just so happens this restaurant was two hotels down (in the linq.) the wait was about 45 minutes during dinnertime. after we were seated, we waited between 5 - 10 minutes  to get our water. anytime we needed something, we had to flag down a waiter. \n\nthe food was average. the waiter recommended the \"<mark>Vegas Fries</mark>.\" our whole table tried a couple of fries each and we did not finish them. they were served cold, and we pretty salty.  we also ordered the bbq chicken wings. i really enjoyed the chicken wings. the were brined before served and gave it a lot of flavor, and the ranch sauce it was served with was awesome. for the entree, i had the beef brisket. my portion of the brisket was a bit chewy and stringy. it says on the menu that it was cooked for 14 hours so i expected it to be more tender.", 
            "after striking out at chayo (also in the linq), we settled on going to guy fieri's restaurant because it was close, open late, and we were all hungry and wanted to try it.  i'll admit that i went in to this with high expectations, so maybe that lent to the fact that i found the entire place...underwhelming.\n\nthe decor is all right...kind of exactly what you would expect, and the servers are nice enough, even if they are a bit slow.  it was relatively busy, so i'm willing to overlook the slow pace of service.  the food, however, was just mediocre.  i think all four of us expected something more.  huge portions and huge flavor were expected.  the portions lived up to expectations, but unfortunately the food didn't.  \n\ni ordered the mac n cheese burger and while it was pretty large, the mac n cheese on it was very bland and the bacon was kind of chewy.  a friend ordered the fireball chicken wings and <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were small, and it only came with 7 wings.  another of us ordered the cajun chicken sandwich.  here is where you would really expect some big flavor, but it was just so-so.  my fiance ordered the ribs (33 bucks for a rack...not too bad for a strip restaurant with a famous dude's name attached) and those were definitely the best thing on our table.  they were tender and smoky and had a lot of flavor.  the rack of ribs came with cornbread that was pretty dry and normal...nothing special, and a small cup of the same bland mac n cheese that was on my burger.  we also ordered the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> to share as a table...those were actually pretty tasty.\n\ni'd love to give this place more stars but it just doesn't live up to any expectation we had going on.",

            "where do i even start... \n\nandy, and my gf jessica came here for dinner and enjoyed it at the bar. the bartenders were so attentive and so sweet! i cannot for the life of me remember the one female bartender we had but she was amazing! i started out with a pbr (yes i know, but its one of my guilty pleasures) and that was followed by numerous jameson shots. \n\napp and salad wise we started with the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>. thick wedges tossed in spicy buffalo sauce, topped with blue cheese crumbles and served with blue-sabi sauce. ahhhh ive literally had dreams about these. <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> we had was <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark>. prosciutto-wrapped smoked provolone filled with crisp romaine lettuce, imported italian meats & cheeses, pickled italian veggies then tossed in a red wine vinaigrette. so bomb!\n\nthe entrees we tried were the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>, they were tossed in a bourbon brown sugar bbq sauce and i had the side of wasabi blue cheese. nom. we also shared <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. seasoned pastrami, swiss cheese, caraway seed slaw, dill pickles, onion straws, dijon mustard and a pretzel bun. words cant describe how freaking delish this all was. \n\nthe manager alex was so nice and gave us some amazing recommendations. we will def be back sooner then later for another amazing experience!!", 
            "i'm basing my review off the couple items i've had. also if you go after 10 there is a limited menu. my favorite thing here is <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>. the pretzel bread was so soft and the bbq was tasty. i also really love slaw on my bbq. the mac and cheese burger was really good and i've had a mac and cheese burger somewhere else and i didn't like it so i almost didn't get this but i saw it on ddd so i decided to give it a try since it is their number 2 seller. the motley que being the number 1. i also liked the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>. it was really a great sauce for wings. it was spicy but not too spicy. i recommend the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> for an appetizer. this is all i had but i ate here twice on a 4 day trip to vegas and vegas has such great restaurants. i look forward to eating again when in vegas", 
            "this was my first time here and after seeing it featured on triple d i had high expectations. unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype. i tried the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> and the fireball whiskey wings. the portions were huge but $31 is still a little high for wings and fries even on the strip, and they were both just okay. the service was really good so i will give it another try and order something different."

            "my husband and i dined at guy fieri's vegas kitchen and bar last friday evening. the manager michael welcomed us, and the hostess took us to a nice table. \n\nfirst i like to mention the ace perry cider that i ordered. that will be my forever favorite! what an awesome taste, especially in combination with the tasty menu items! \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> and the righteous rojo rings for an appetizer. we loved it, and couldn't get enough! finally something different! american food but infused with worldly flavors! awesome! we love chili, so we had to try the <mark>Southern Smothered Chili Bowl</mark>! the cornbread on top with the sour cream, yummy! we give it a 5star! another one of my favorite are the fireball whiskey wings. the blue-sabi sauce that comes with it is divine! \nthe fries! omg! the bes<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> i ate in the united states for sure. they come in different sizes and styles... a must try! \n\ni especially like the unique way the food is presented. each menu item has a different kind of set up. i love eating with my eyes, and i was satisfied for sure.\n\nbig compliment to the entire staff! everybody is in a great mood, happy and helpful! they sure know what the menu items are, and explain it well. \n\nthis was my third visit to guy fieri's vegas kitchen and bar, and it definitely became one of my favorite american restaurant within one week!", 
            "i have been looking forward to trying guys food for a long time and i finally got the chance on my recent vegas vacation.  located at the linq hotel and casino the restaurant has a pretty hip vibe and some damn fine looking waitresses. the place is pretty tightly crammed together so it if your looking for a romantic dinner go elsewhere, but if you like an exciting place and good people watching then this fits the bill.the food however was hit and miss.  first off was the starter <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>. these were seriously good, as long as you like all things mushroom. crispy and thin shoestring fries are topped with black and white shaved truffles, truffled gouda cheese and are served with truffle dip. the portion was huge but of course we finished them all.\nnext up were the entrees. my turkey picnic sandwich entr\\u00e9e was great, perhaps one of the better sandwiches i have had recently. thick slices of moist roasted turkey are topped with cranberry relish, melted swiss, creamy coleslaw and (here's the kicker)...crunchy bbq chips. its all served between a sliced pretzel baguette slathered with guys  signature donkey sauce ( basically fancy thousand island dressing). that's a lot of stuff stuffed into one sandwich but it all mixed great together and every level of flavor showed up in each bite. also on the side of <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> were a mix of fries that were seasoned with bbq spices. not that i needed more fries but these were also excellent so i of course finished them.  as good as my sandwich was, i was very disappointed by my wife simones, <mark>Southern Smothered Chili Bowl</mark> entr\\u00e9e.  a rather large bowl of chili arrived to the table topped with melted cheese, sour cream, scallions and a big hunk of cornbread and it looked impressive. however, once we moved the cornbread the bowl itself was barely half full with the actual chili. then, after the first bite we both agreed that we have had better chili from the local wendys. someone took the wrong turn at flavortown and ended up at the no spice nursing home. this was perhaps one of the blandest bowls of chili i have had in recent memory. this was a disappointing end to an otherwise great meal. so at least in my experience i would say that depending on what you order you could walk away very happy or very letdown from guy's. i would return again but stick to <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> menu.", 
            "i came here at the suggestion of a friend.  was hesitant to come here at first, as celebrity chef restaurants tend to be overpriced and the quality of food generally lacks in flavor...generally.  however, this place is incredible and well worth the wait!  i checked in with the hostess, requesting an indoor table for four, and was told the wait would be approximately 45 mins.  she requested my cell phone number and informed me when a table was ready, i would be receiving a text message from them.  the text finally came and we were seated in a booth.  the drinks here are a bit overpriced, in my opinion (approximately $15-$20).  however, they are delicious.  the drink i had was (i believe) called the \"guava java.\".  the prices for their food items are decent, especially considering their food portions are texas-sized, meaning huge food portions!  if you have a player's card, the menu items come out to a dollar cheaper.  if you're active/retired military, your food bill will come out to 20% less.  i ordered their <mark>Southern Smothered Chili Bowl</mark>.  the chili had the right amount of kick to it and was topped with a very tasty corn bread muffin.  despite having to ask for our water glasses to be refilled, our waiter was very patient and friendly with our party.  the bill for our dinner didn't break the bank, but i believe it was still worth it, considering the amount of food served with your order.  if you're into bbq, this is the place to come!", 
            "i was very excited when guy fieri finally opened a restaurant in las vegas. it took me a few months to get there, but i finally did. we were seated very quickly and the waitress got to us the moment we were seated. i ordered a beer and my wife ordered a soda. it did take a long time to get our drinks. i had to ask about my beer a second time. i did cut them some slack because of how busy they were and it appeared they were a bit short staffed.\n\nthe place has a simple decor. but it does not stand out as anything special. it is just pleasant, nothing more.\n\nguy has put out an eclectic menu here. it is only two pages, so not a huge selection, but it is a pleasant selection consisting of salad's, wings, burgers, bbq, fries and desserts. i had a <mark>Southern Smothered Chili Bowl</mark>. the taste was pretty good, but for the price i expected a little bit more. i think guy's is a good place to give a try. i may or may not go back myself.", 
            "ok well first off, it states that the restaurant is inside the quad. the hotel is now re-branded as the linq.\n\nanyway, i have been here a couple times and each time i thoroughly enjoyed my time!\n\ni love the vibe of this whole restaurant. from the really big ice cubes they serve with your drinks, the design of silverware, to the uniforms that the workers have to wear, this restaurant is so fun!\n\ni ordered <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> as an appetizer, which were so good dipped into the smoky provolone cheese dip. i ordered a <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> as my entree. the pretzel bun was really good, and <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> itself was huge! my favorite part is their fires. they mix several different types of fries together, which i think is really fun. the only thing is that they don't serve a lot of fries with the entree and i definitely could have eaten more of them. i also dipped my fries into the left over smoky provolone dip and it was really tasty. \n\nthe second time i went it was late at night so they had a smaller a la carte menu. i order the <mark>Southern Smothered Chili Bowl</mark>, and a side of fries. the fries were the same mixture as the first time! the <mark>Southern Smothered Chili Bowl</mark> was really good, but the corn bread wasn't anything special like i had hoped. \n\nthe service was great each time i went. everyone is really lively and upbeat just like the restaurant is. overall i really enjoyed my experiences here and i definitely will be coming back!", 
            "came back to guy fieri's before heading back to la and all was great just as my past visits. \n\ntried the beef brisket this time around. the bbq sauce was a bit overpowering at times but a small swipe to the side with a fork took care of any extra bbq sauce. the brisket itself was tender with a delicious smoked flavor. i love garlic toast so it was pleasing to have two thick slices under the brisket.\n\nlast was the dragon <mark>Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries</mark> i shared amongs<mark>Triple T Fries</mark>. i couldn't quite figure out the flavor of guy's chili in terms of seasoning but it was good stuff. there's nothing better than good chili, which now prompts me to try his <mark>Southern Smothered Chili Bowl</mark> with sweet corn bread my next go round for lunch or dinner. \n\nservice was excellent as usual. i still have yet to have bad service and i'm sure it'll stay that way. another great ending to a vegas trip at guy fieri's.\n\nlunch 6/7/2015", 
            "would have been 5 stars but they were out of american ribs :( they sounded so good too, i think i almost cried when our server said they were out of pork ribs and only had beef short ribs. \n\ndecor is is industrial. lots of exposed brick or faux brick, metal, floor to ceiling windows. the patio has 6 large televisions. it wasn't that bad being out on. the patio in 104 degree heat, there was a breeze coming from somewhere and the cold beer kept us pretty cool. \n\nour server jonathan was really sweet and very attentive. at first i though oh no he looks mean but that was not the case i think he just has rbf, lol. he recommended pizza chronic ale and omg this is the best ipa i've tasted. normally i don't like ipas at all but this one was delish. i wish i had ordered that for myself instead of the angry orchard i normally get but i still stole a few sips from my boyfriend. \n\nwe for apps we ordered the <mark>Southern Smothered Chili Bowl</mark> and <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>. the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> were good. for an app they were really good. the <mark>Southern Smothered Chili Bowl</mark> comes with corn bread on top but due to corn allergies we asked for it on the side. the chili was good, very meaty comes with a really hot sauce and sour cream with chives on the side. it was good but nothing special about it. the corn bread was bland. but the chili covered it up. wish it was gritty like jiffy brand. i ordered the frozen fireball that i was told would be kinda slushy. the shot was like a normal chilled shot. that bummed  me out. don't advertise frozen if it's not. \n\ni asked how the mayor of flavor town was. jonathan said its the best burger ever. this was an awesome burger. cooked perfectly, full of flavor and juices without being pink.  it's a burger on a pretzel bun topped with swiss cheese, slaw, and lean pastrami. juices just running onto my hand mmmm.   the fries were a mixture of different fry styles.to me they tasted like lays bbq potato chips. good portion but still pricey $19. boyfriend ordered the brisket which was good, full of flavor but not much brisket, it looked sooo big because of the the two giant inch thick texas toast it sits on. also served with fries. but for $32 there better be more meat!\n\nthey accept all total rewards coupons.", 
            "i came here on sunday for brunch and was bummed to see it was only 8-11 am. that was my fault and the regular menu looked delectable so we stuck around to eat. the two of us only waited 7 minutes which was nice. inside of the restaurant is very clean and beautiful, they really utilized the view they have there! large open windows giving you a view of the strip. i'm a local and appreciated it so i'm sure an out of towner would love it. \nwe ended up ordering the 52oz hangover fishbowl bloody mary (extra spicy) and oh my god, delicious. i ordered the <mark>Southern Smothered Chili Bowl</mark> and my fianc\\u00e9 ordered <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>. for some reason the service was really slow, but at least our server was apologetic about it and brought us out complimentary shots. it was a mix of fireball and angry orchard. definitely not something i'd order on my own but it was free, so i gladly partook. i wish i remembered our servers name, she was a sweetheart. \nour food arrived and it was amazing. the chili had a layer of cheese on top to separate the cornbread so it didn't get soggy. i thought that was genius. \nmy fiance's sandwich was amazing. the smoked pulled pork was some of the best i've had in this town which i wasn't really expecting. the perfect amount of smokey flavor with moisture in the meat. \nwe also got the <mark>Guy's Cheesecake Challenge</mark> to go since we were stuffed, but i've been snacking on it all night. you wouldn't ever think to put potato chips and pretzels on a cheesecake but now i don't think i can eat it any other way. \noverall, i had a great experience. aside from the slow service it was perfect. luckily i enjoy my fiance's company and we didn't have any other plans so we had a wonderful time."

            "one word: disappointed\n\ni was so excited to try guy fieri's restaurant, but wow was i disappointed. i love his shows on the food network and i have been for the longest time, but unfortunately this meal did not do it for me. i tried the sashimi tacos, <mark>Chicken Wonton Takeout Salad</mark>, buffalo fries, but the only thing that passed good/mediocre was <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark>. coming from such a popular chef i guess i came in with very high expectations. sorry guy*\n\nrecommendations\n1. <mark>Chicken Wonton Takeout Salad</mark> - creative setting, okay good (3.5)\n2. sashimi tacos - too gamey fishy taste, garlic was too overpowering, mango did not complement the tuna.

            "i tried to go to hash house a go-go but with a 45 minute wait that was a no-go, so i wound up at this \"gastropub\" instead. i sat at the bar and got the <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark>. the ingredients were fresh and tasty and it was a good value. but...there was salad-bar style italian dressing on my <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark>! not okay! the waitstaff was really great, friendly and attentive, so 5 stars for the people but i would not return for that salad.", 
            "the ratings here don't lie. \n\nbefore heading back home we wanted to grab a bite to eat, i love the food network and watch it all the time. so of course we had to try guy fieri.. the wait was about 30-40 mins. \n\ndecor of the restaurant was cool. after reading the reviews it's suppose to be western? fast forwarding to our order-\n<mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark>: i like how it had mango-jicama salsa. pretty tasty, and prob best thing ordered\n<mark>The General's Wings</mark>: was hesitant on these but surprisingly not bad!\n<mark>The Triple B Burger</mark>: it was ok. i know that their mac n cheese burgers is what their known for, so i guess if you wanted a burger here i'd probably order that\n<mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark>: i added chicken on this salad. they were chicken skewers, and again the chicken was nice. salad was okay, i wish they put more hummus on it because it was basically just dolloped onto the plate and piled romaine lettuce on top. \nbloody mary: i don't think anywhere can f*ck up a bloody mary.\n\nit was nice tryin you guy!", 
            "we weren't sure about trying out guy's place, but we were hungry, the reviews were decent, and it was handy at the time.  \n\nthe high tables are super uncomfortable if you don't have long, long legs.  i am 5'6\", so not very short, but too short for comfort at one of those tables.  the wooden stool just dug into my legs the whole time because my legs just weren't long enough for my feet to rest on the top rung of the stool.\n\ni tried a couple dishes here, the tripple <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, which were delish.  i could seriously live on them.  they are thin cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> so nice and crispy with loads of truffle.  they are seriously a 5/5.\n\nwhat i was not crazy about was the <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark>... this was the least <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark> i have ever tasted in my life.  i understand that guy does his own take on recipes, but this was taken so far to the extreme that it wasn't even recognizable.  it had croutons, carrot and chickpeas which was odd, but okay.  what was unforgiving to a <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark> though is that there was no tang or zip to the dressing.  it was a little sweet and just not very tasty.", 
            "wonderful food every time! you have to try the mac n cheese burger, the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> and the <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark> was great as well! good service, great atmosphere. the bloody mary is absolutely over the top. a must go-to in vegas!", 
            "this was our second visit to this place.  first time it had just opened and food was mediocre.  this time the menu was changed and what we had was excellent. the <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark> was absolutely amazing. my husband had one <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> and great as well.   will definitely go back on our next vegas trip."

            "guy's is located to the newly renovated quad hotel near the pathway leading to harrah's. they have an option for indoor seating which features awesome brown cow print bar stools or covered outdoor seating allowing for people watching and music courtesy of carnival's dj. \n\nwe chose the later, it was a relatively cooler day (in vegas terms) so outdoor seating was obvious. i chose the <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark> with the barbecue chicken wings as an appetizer. our waiter was nice enough and took our orders quickly and got us our drinks. side note, our waters had some of the largest ice cubes (actual cubes) that i had ever seen in my life - i was amazed. i was also pleasantly surprised by the speediness in which our food came out. \n\nthe chicken drumsticks were ingenious, each drumstick was trimmed down leaving the meat at the bottom of the bone almost creating a handle making it super easy to bite down without the mess. the plate was accompanied by a delicious sauce that i can only guess was a creamy ranch and a bowlful of fresh veggies. \n\nmy <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark> was a complete work of art in multiple layers, so pretty but in the end a little hard to eat. the base layer of my salad featured hummus and then built upon that were romain lettuce spears, garbanzo beans, red and yellow tomato chunks, cucumbers, feta cheese triangles, croutons and topped off with shredded parmesan. <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> was drizzled with a lemon vinaigrette which i was most excited about however it was just a bit too sweet for my taste. as mentioned before it was difficult to cut into the spears without contents of my salad spilling onto the table so in the end i just picked up the spears with my hands and ate it that way, not a big deal but messy nonetheless. \n\nduring my meal i noticed how attentive the wait staff was, constantly checking on our party and others in our area. at one point a manager even came over to introduce herself to us. i realized why at the end when we were paying, inside of their bill placards they have an itouch installed so patrons can take surveys about their experience at the restaurant. \n\nnote: total rewards members get a discount on various items on the menu, if you don't have one - they're free so go get one.", 
            "this is a great place high energy staff helpful. i had the <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark> love them followed by <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> this was great the mix of italian meats and the crown of prosciutto-wrapped smoked provolone! make this a must for the flavor town finale i had a s'more <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>  loved it will go back and try the <mark>Guy's Cheesecake Challenge</mark> soon highly recommend this place to everyone", 
            "we went  for lunch to eat with my sister-in-law & husband . we live here in las vegas, and like to try different restaurants.  first complaint is that i'm a vegetarian, and wanted a salad, but all <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> on the menu aren't for vegetarians. i asked our waitress if i could get <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> with fish instead of chicken, and she said no. i asked her to ask the chef, and her answer was if i ask he is going to say no. waitress inform me that i could pay for salad plus pay for the fish plate, and they would add it to my salad are you kidding me!!! the fries were all very spicy. not everyone can eat spicy food, so we weren't able to eat the fries. did the waitress asked can we get you something else no!!!   we asked  if the fried ice cream was big enough to share for four since we were full, but wanted to try the fried ice cream anyway. we were told that it was big enough for two, so we ordered two. let me warned you it's big enough for four or more which is a good thing, but we were so upset at our waitress couldn't she have been honest, and more cooperative we only ate one, and the other one wasn't even touched. last complaint we were charged dinner prices instead of lunch prices, so beware, and check your receipt before you pay if you go for lunch.", 
            "bad service. sat for 20 minutes unattended.   then the bartender poured extra fake lime juice in the fish bowl- expensive cocktail - as they did not measure the drink correctly and even added ice on the top to make it look  \" full\". all the food was salty. <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> and <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark>- how to you make a salad salty!!?? last, asked server for additional side sauce and he went directly to the bar area and did nothing. even came back to ask of we needed anything but i decided to give up at that point and just write a review to save others from coming here to spend  money. bad food bad service.", 
            "this restraunt is all hype, im sure most of these comments are made up.\nfirst of all the place looks real nice, the service is great, i love triple d show and that alone made me want to come over and try it out.\n\nbut the food is just not worth the high prices, and people saying the portions are huge are straight up lying.  we ordered the wiskey wings, 9 bitesize tiny wings for $15, the menu claims they are super hot, but they are not even close to being hot. the taste was not that good and the blue cheese and ranch sauses are disgusting. i had better wings at applebees, and better ranch sauce at jack in the box.\n\nnext we tried the cesar salad, again not that good either and i have no idea what that wall of hard bread on <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> was, looked like a monster crouton but it was not eatable..\n\nso finally i asked for the best burger so i got the mac and cheese burger...  people claim burger is huge but its really just a decent size and its pricey $19.. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was just ok thats it. if thats the best they had i wonder how the others taste. i couldnt even taste the macaroni on <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.. honestly i had better burgers at chillis.. now the fries on the other had were great, they mix 4 different kind of fries together and are tastey..\n\nall i gotta say this place might be for other people but it wasnt for us, it looked like they are trying to hard to make the plates look fancy and cute but the taste just isn't there.. and not worth the high prices..", 
            "one word: disappointed\n\ni was so excited to try guy fieri's restaurant, but wow was i disappointed. i love his shows on the food network and i have been for the longest time, but unfortunately this meal did not do it for me. i tried the sashimi tacos, <mark>Chicken Wonton Takeout Salad</mark>, buffalo fries, but the only thing that passed good/mediocre was <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark>. coming from such a popular chef i guess i came in with very high expectations. sorry guy*\n\nrecommendations\n1. <mark>Chicken Wonton Takeout Salad</mark> - creative setting, okay good (3.5)\n2. sashimi tacos - too gamey fishy taste, garlic was too overpowering, mango did not complement the tuna. (0/5)\n3. buffalo fries - mediocre, good vegetarian option. (3/5)", 
            "wow had a great time loved what we ordered.  shared the bbq pulled pork on pretzel bun and the italian <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark>!! it was off the chain!!  defiantly will go back!  would love to meet guy ;) been following him since he won the food network star woohoo!   keep up the god work!!", 
            "i'm impressed, y'all! i'm a faithful food network cooking show watcher...guy's never been my fav, but he's certainly jovial, entertaining, & creative...and that shows in his restaurant & menu.\n\nthere was a wait when we arrived for linner about 4pm...just roll on over to the secksy azz bar: full menu served, great drinks, & hot nice service! our absolute fav was a cocktail with jameson, mint, & other goodness....sooo refreshing & a taste bud pleaser! get it!\n\nwe shared the guy-talian fondue (or...guy-taliban as my autocorrect keeps saying...lol!). absolutely ingenious! long pretzel sticks wrapped in greasy yummy salami...dunk it in the cheese sauce (meh). the star? besides <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark>....the peppercinis! i'm not a big fan but these ones were superb: crunchy, spicy, perfect. \n\nwe also got the spicy wings...wings were meh, but the blue cheese wasabi sauce was like foreplay, y'all. dip the crunchy fresh veggies on the side into it, slather <mark>The General's Wings</mark> in it, don't waste it!\n\ni've never observed so many burgers leaving a kitchen, seriously. look good, must be good. about 3/4 of the plates leaving the kitchen are burgers. \n\ni'd return next time i'm in vegas! kudos, guy!", 
            "you get a lot of food for the price, but the food doesn't deliver. we ordered the pepperoni pretzel appetizer thinking it was going to be oven baked pretzels with pepperoni served with the cheese dip. what we got was pretzel rods from a bag with cold pepperoni slices wrapped around them. the cheese dip was good but was cold by the time it made it to the table. major disappointment. we kept an open mind for the main entrees. my friend got the bacon mac n cheese burger with the house fries. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was huge but thin and didn't have a lot of mac n cheese on it. the fries were dusted with seasoning and were decent. it was ok but <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> and truffle fries at gordon ramsay's restaurant burgr were a lot better. i had the caesar salad which was enormous and by far the beat dish of  the meal. <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> was freshly tossed, cold and the croutons were delicious. overall, a lack luster experience that failed to meet expectations.", 
            "the food was all great bar type food with great presentation. everyone seemed to love the hot wings. the <mark>Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries</mark> were great as well as the chicken and sausage sandwich. my girlfriend loved the giant crouton on <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark>. \n\nthe only downside was our server although friendly messed up my order and my appetizer ended up coming out about 2 minutes after my meal. which kind of defeats the whole idea of ordering an appetizer. \n\nalso we were missing a place setting and when we asked for another one the busboy / server argued that he had the correct number and that we should look under our menus. we had a large party so i can see how it wasn't hard to miss one but why argue just bring a extra fork and we will be good.", 
            "someone asked me privately from yelp if i was picky with food because i used to cook for celebrity chefs? i'd like to say no because there are some food establishments that aren't considered 5 star that for a plate i'd slap my mama---but i am harder on establishments that consider themselves elite amongst top chefs. \n\na friend recommended this place to me and i decided to give it a chance. normally i don't frequent celebrity chef establishments because having worked in this industry i know that the chef is not who is cooking the food. i was excited about going on the strip since i avoid it like ebola, so i think my expectations were too high.\n\nwe were given a seat on a very busy corner and our next best option was to be seated by this wall with a flat screen. we opted by the wall. while waiting for our food we stared at this wall feeling like inmates serving a prison sentence. our server brought us some glasses of water and joked that we were about to enjoy the lovely minerals from lake mead. after one sip, i knew what he was talking about. yuck! i couldn't get over the jumbo ice cubes and thought they were the most beautiful thing. \n\nwe started out with the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> which were...ok. only the very top of the fries contained that truffle \"goodness\" and it was so faint. which means they probably didn't \"toss\" all of the ingredients together. they just piled and sprinkled it on top. cooking 101. i love truffle oil and i barely got any, leaving me feel like i just ordered garlic parmesan fries. on the menu it says, \"truffle, truffle, + more truffle.\" it was more like, \"lies, lies, + more lies!\"\n\nnot wanting to gorge myself silly i ordered bruthas badass caesar salad and the generals wings. my friend ordered some jumbo burger.\nour food came and after one look i could tell that my bread on the plate was stale. here's a little inside info for you guys. croutons are usually made with day old bread to avoid cost and waste. there's nothing wrong with that, but after a day----you don't make croutons or keep the ones you made previously.....you just cut your losses and toss it. i knew right away that jumbo crouton was made more than a day in advance. it was so friggin' hard and you could tell by looking at it closely that it had started to get old because when you cook old ass bread it leaves a pattern that looks pulled. it's hard to explain without showing you closely, but maybe you can see it in my photos.\n<mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> dressing was sooooo watery and thin, which was most likely caused by tossing the lettuce while wet. i don't even want to get into that. \n\n<mark>The General's Wings</mark> were hard as a brick! they were overcooked then glazed with this wierd walmart hoisin tasting sauce. nothing had flavor. my friend didn't enjoy his burger either. it was cold. we didn't complain because i understood that it wasn't something that could be corrected. the food is what it is due to errors that need to be corrected by the executive chef, or guy fieri just really sucks. i'm gonna sound like an old timer, but back in my day a chef wasn't a chef until he/she spent over ten years training, spent years in europe giving blood, sweat, and tears on the cooking line, and even then you were humble until you proved yourself leading a line. too many people call themselves chefs when they haven't mastered the basics of flavor. even i haven't mastered anything at this point since i left that world and discontinued my training--but i really was hard on this restaurant. food can't just look pretty on a plate---it has to taste good too. i expected much more from a big name \"chef\".", 
            "we had pretty high expectations seeing as though we're big guy fans and really loved his restaurant in santa rosa. \n\nwe stumbled in on valentine's day around 3pm as we were traipsing around vegas. we knew we wouldn't be able to get in anywhere else on valentine's day any later in the evening, so when we were told that it would only be a 10-15 minute wait, we went for it.\n\nwe weren't super hungry, so we opted for just drinks and a couple apps.\nwe got the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>, & the caesar salad which comes in a giant crouton.\n\nthe service was okay. there were a few times when i would have liked a refill and there was nobody, but they came eventually.\n\nthe food was also only ok.\n\nthe <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> were okay in my book, but my husband didn't really care for them and only ate one. the pepperoni on them was a bit waxy, but the cheese dip was good i thought. we ate about half the app.\n\n<mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> looked cooler than anything else. the giant crouton ring was awesome, but it wasn't super flavorful. the dressing was okay.\n\nthe <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> were definitely the best part of the meal. they were cut into lollipops which i enjoy if i have to have wings with bones (i'm a boneless fan) and the sauce was delicious. it was spicy and sweet at the same time. i would definitely enjoy having those again, but i could leave the rest.\n\ni would be interested in trying the mac n' cheese burger since it won best burger in vegas and looked great, but other than that and those wings, i don't think i'd order anything else. \n\nsorry guy! still love ya!", 
            "mixed review here, but so are the members of our family.  good location, yet we only had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated outside on a beautiful day.  waited on right away for drinks and we were already to order.  food came out fast.\n\nwife and son had the motley que pulled pork.  teenager thought it was great, but my wife thought for all his talk about bold flavors it might have been a little bland.  daughter had a cheeseburger that was very big and cooked perfectly.  all of them go<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> 4 ways and were pleased.  my 16 year old got the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark> and didn't find them tasty and didn't have enough heat.  \n\ni had the italian <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> and it ranks up there on one of the best i have had.  the \"bowl\" is made of a thick piece of smoked provolone wrapped in prosciutto.  plenty of different types of olives, cheese and dried sausage on the side.  i wasn't that hungry to start, but ate every last bite of a large salad.  wish i went there when i was hungry.\n\nso one teenager didn't care for it, wife and daughter thought it was ok and the other teen and i had a great meal.  in vegas i thought it was a good value.", 
            "the outdoor patio is a great place to people-watch outside the linq hotel and casino. i would recommend the desserts over anything else - the s'mores cake is amazing! the <mark>Quad Fries</mark> are flavorful but a little off. today i had a ceasar salad which was ok but was served on a giant cruton wheel (probably 5\" in diameter). seemed a bit wasteful since <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> also came with croutons...also, <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> had too much dressing. i got <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> last time and they were just ok and have since been removed from the menu. the menu seems to change frequently too. overall, giant portions, decent food, desserts are huge but blow you away!", 
            "went there when we were in town and i was very annoyed to see that there was no real vegetarian options. when i asked the server  about it, she looked at me like i had three heads. so i settled on a side salad and side order of mac and cheese. both were disappointing. <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> was nothing, but a little cheese and very hard croutons, and the mac and cheese tasted like it came out of the velveeta box. bf had the mac and cheese burger, but said it was nothing special. won't come back, and its disappointing for being a celebrity chef rest.  oh and there servers were rude.", 
            "i'm only giving two stars because the fries were good , they took the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> off the menu , they were out of the italian <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> , they were out of the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and they were out of the ribs , which was about 1/2 the menu , service was good and the food we got came out fast i guess because they don't have much other stuff to cook lol", 
            "we come to vegas every year to see a different show and we stopped by guy's place for lunch, plus we had a 20% off coupon.  the place was busy but we got seated within 10 minutes and had a couple of cold beers.  now for the food....wow, it was fantastic!  i had the motley que pulled pork sandwich on a pretzel bun that was out of this world.  the bbq sauce was very tasty and the pretzel bun was not too thick and very soft.  the fries were great and seasoned just right.  my wife had the italian <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> and that was also great.  very fresh with lots of different \"items\" but <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> dress was the \"bomb\" as guy would say.  we are here for 4 days and will be going back for lunch.  great service and reasonably priced by vegas standards.  you cannot go wrong coming here.", 
            "came here yesterday and this is a review on food and service . i probably would come back if i stayed in linq as we did with this trip.  wouldn't come out of my way   we more or less has to see what the hype was all about.  had prosciutto salad and truffle fries.   <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> was really good.   fries were similar to umamis ..we had to wait about 30 mins but i'm used to it being from la...  the waitress's ..ehh she was whatever.  not too attractive but her tip was reflective of her service !!!      try it if you're in the area but don't feel bad if you miss it", 
            "it's easy and fun to make fun of guy fieri.  when we arrived at the restaurant, my daughter laughed at his likeness on posters (and she doesn't know who he is).  however, i like  his restaurant, to my surprise!\nwe ordered the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> and loved 'em. \nwe ordered the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>.  loved those, too.  actually, i think i really loved 'em--more than the triple t's.  check the menu to see what they are.  \nwe ordered the ribs but the server came back and said they had run out of them :(  maybe they don't stock them on wednesdays?  bummer.\nwe had a caesar salad that came with a giant crouton underneath.  <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> was kind of small if you consider the giant crouton took up a lot of room on the plate and i think it was stale.  this was a bland caesar among caesars.\nsince we couldn't have ribs, the server suggested the brisket nachos.  the chips were definitely stale and the toppings were too sparse.  i liked the idea of them but was disappointed.  most of the chips i ate had some chopped tomato and hardly any cheese.  needs a lot more cheese and meat on top, for sure.\nservice was great.  the menu is small, which i like.  the fries are excellent. :)", 
            "service was great. food came our fast and everything was pretty good. \n\nwatch out for their ceasar salad though. most of it is a crouton! though <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> is delicious..def not enough greens", 
            "where do i even start... \n\nandy, and my gf jessica came here for dinner and enjoyed it at the bar. the bartenders were so attentive and so sweet! i cannot for the life of me remember the one female bartender we had but she was amazing! i started out with a pbr (yes i know, but its one of my guilty pleasures) and that was followed by numerous jameson shots. \n\napp and salad wise we started with the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>. thick wedges tossed in spicy buffalo sauce, topped with blue cheese crumbles and served with blue-sabi sauce. ahhhh ive literally had dreams about these. <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> we had was <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark>. prosciutto-wrapped smoked provolone filled with crisp romaine lettuce, imported italian meats & cheeses, pickled italian veggies then tossed in a red wine vinaigrette. so bomb!\n\nthe entrees we tried were the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>, they were tossed in a bourbon brown sugar bbq sauce and i had the side of wasabi blue cheese. nom. we also shared <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. seasoned pastrami, swiss cheese, caraway seed slaw, dill pickles, onion straws, dijon mustard and a pretzel bun. words cant describe how freaking delish this all was. \n\nthe manager alex was so nice and gave us some amazing recommendations. we will def be back sooner then later for another amazing experience!!"

            "came here with a friend last week. wait time was about 45 minutes, but at least they text you when your table is ready so you can wander or gamble. when we got the text we were seated promptly. our table was in the patio which was nice, but the band at carnival was a bit too loud (luckily they only had a few songs left before the end) and the table was slanted/wobbily. i cracked a joke about it with the waiter, but he just made a comment saying it wasn't so bad. we had issues where if one of us took our hand off the table it would lean to the otherside possibly spilling our drinks.\n\nonto the food. we split an order of general tso's lollipop wings which were great! they came with crystalized peanuts, wasabi peas, and brown rice chips to dip them in. i really wanted to try some wings here after seeing the pictures of it, unfortunately these were the only ones that sounded appetizing. i wanted some more traditional spicy wings, but the closest one to that was the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> (which i'm not a fireball fan) and they had spicy bbq sauce on it. i'm glad we got the general tso's.\n\nmain course we both got burgers and split them. we got the mac'n'cheese burger and the other one i forgot the name for (onion rings, kicker sauce, and bbq sauce). both were good, i was worried the mac'n'cheese burger would be way too heavy and it wasnt overloaded with it. \n\noverall the food was great, the service was good, the only complaint i really have is that slanted table we got. i would definately come back to try some of the other offersings.", 
            "i remember hearing that guy fieri had opened a new restaurant in vegas, and as we were walking by the quad i saw this place and new i had to try it.  my friends are always willing to try new places so we went in.  there was a pretty long line, which led me to think it would be a long wait, but we were seated shortly after.  \n\nwe had two waitresses that took care of our table.  one took the order and brought out the food, and the other was for drinks.  this is something new to me, but was glad it worked out great.  i had my drinks refilled my times without having to ask for a refill.  \n\non to the food, our table ordered <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>, <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>, <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, and the mac and cheese bacon cheeseburger.  \n<mark>The General's Wings</mark> are like a lollipop style so sizes do vary.  unfortunately, ours were on the smaller size.  we got a wing/pop that was a size of a quarter.  the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> does have a spicy kick to it. not overwhelmingly spicy but leaves a tingle.  flavor was pretty good.  the double barrel bbq wing is pretty normal.  the mac and cheese burger was ginormous.  good luck taking a bite out of this one.  i had to use a fork and knife to eat this burger.   i ordered it medium but it came out well done.  was not cooked to order.  wished the mac and cheese would were more cheesy.  overall, <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was a bit dry and lacking in flavor.  \n\nthey have a beer challenge here if you can drink their flight sampler under a certain amount of time, you will win a t-shirt.  we didn't do it because we were already full after eating.  service is great here even while they are extremely busy. prices are a little bit on the expensive side for burgers and wings.", 
            "my favorite place we ate in vegas! \nthe decor was exactly what you would expect from guy, and it looks awesome!\n\nthe prices are good, for vegas. \n\nthe food was amazing. i had the motley que, and it was hands down the best pulled pork i have ever eaten... and i would expect it from guy, a man who goes crazy over them when they are presented. \n\nwe also got the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>, and while delicious, and very nice to look at, we did wish they weren't lollipopped! we want the meat!! with everything else being messy, don't lollipop for easy eating... trust me, we will dig in! \n\nmy boyfriend got the macaroni and cheese burger and loved it! juice was rolling down his arms. we both had to do \"the hunch\" to eat! \nthe staff was very helpful and pleasant, without being over bearing! \namazing place, definitely go check it out.", 
            "as guy would say, \"out of bounds!!\"  my husband and i loved this place.  we had the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> and the macaroni and cheese burger.  we tried just about every speciality drink on the menu while sitting at the bar watching guy's film crew set up to film a commercial.  service was impeccable, atmosphere was great, and bonus--we got to meet guy after he was done filming!!!  super nice, and genuinely cares about his patrons and what's going on at this restaurant.  will be back many times for sure!", 
            "i consider myself a chicken wing aficionado, so i had to try the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>. they were absolutely amazing! the presentation was beautiful and the flavor was mind blowing. you get the sweetness from the fireball and the heat of the hot sauce that perfectly balance each other. the service at the bar was great and the staff was very attentive. i'm definitely be back soon to try one of their burgers!", 
            "ambiance: 2 - i wasn't impressed by the look of the restaurant. it was like a cross between a saloon/log cabin with flat screens to make it a more accessible place for men, so they can eat and watch the game. it looks like a place where modern day, tough-guy bikers are supposed to hang out..with those skulls on the napkins ha! \n\nthey had an okay seating area, but the staff didn't clean it very well. they left tons of crumbs on the seats!! \n\nservice: 4 - the staff was awesome. super friendly and funny! they are also very young and some are good-looking ;) \n\nbut, i felt like i was seated after a very long time. there were quite a few \"closed sections\"..and even after waiting a super long time, they still didn't clean the table well, which was a little gross. \n\nfood: 3 - the food was definitely average. i had the truffle fries and the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>. both of which were served pretty lukewarm, which was not that pleasant. i wanted it to be served hot!!! \n\ntheir system of leaving warm things out is ineffective. it leaves the food way, way too cold for my taste. i would have rather taken my food scalding than barely warm. the food would have been way better if served hot. \n\nthe highlight of <mark>The General's Wings</mark> was the bleu cheese wasabi dipping sauce. it was a great combination and made the chicken loads better! truffle fries were good, but nothing to write home about. my parents ordered <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>, and they are probably the best things on the menu. \n\nin conclusion, it was just okay. i just really wanted hot food--being served cold food made it taste old and not newly cooked.", 
            "started off with the asian inspired <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark>. the springs rolls and the chicken skewers were good but the lettuce wrap wasn't that great. i've had better before.\n\ni got the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> as my entree, i originally saw the recommendations on the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> on yelp but was told they had removed the tacos from the menu. <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were flavorful, but i didn't love them. i would consider it more drumsticks then wings. \n\n<mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> was delicious and it came with 3 different types of fries. i don't think i will return for the food but our sever was great.", 
            "what happened?! \n\nthey used to have delicious tacos in their menu, which i think it's the style of the restaurant in relation to the flavor mixes. those tacos were immaculate. \n\nreturned after my two previous visits to find out they were now gone. which was fine, i would dare try something else. i ordered the turkey sub sandwich that comes in a pretzel hoagie and cranberry sauce. if it hadn't been for the sauce the turkey would have been impossible to eat <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>. \n\nmy friend had the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> that tasted like they had been reheated or were thawed in a microwave. then covered with an absurd amount of green leafy stuff. \n\nthe bbq fries saved the experience but there is a noticeably drop in quality over the past six months.", 
            "soooooo stinkin good! portions are ridiculously fulfilling. most items are big enough to share with someone else. i got the \"dragon breath chili cheese waffle fries\", the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> and hubby got the \" <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>\". there are literally layers of flavor in each dish. from the cumin in the chili to the basil in the fondue - you will not be disappointed! great job, guy!", 
            "i love burgers. i have been extremely disappointed with probably the last 10 burgers i've tried around los angeles. i've told myself to stay away from foo foo non traditional burgers and i've been grilling them at home recently because i've been so disappointed lately. my favorite burger in la is pie and burger in pasadena so you can have an idea what i like.\n\nwifey wanted to hit this up. i had low expectations. we ordered the regular burger (forgot the name but it had bbq sauce). now i would normally not get bbq sauce but this burger was tasty. the bread was soft and fresh (so important). the meat was super juicy and not overcooked. perfect amount of condiments to keep it all moist and together. loved the differen<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> on the side. already seasoned and came out piping hot and fresh. i was so impressed with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.\n\nwe sat at the bar to avoid waiting. wifey loved her lemon drop drink and i appreciated the proper guiness pulls on my draft. also had the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>. they were okay. good concept and i love how they cut them up and push em up before cooking like those asian style wings. i'm just more of a fried wing kinda guy. liked the wasabi blue cheese sauce.\n\nmain point.. good damn burger. props to the cooks.", 
            "it hurts my heart to give guy's restaurant a 3. it just didn't blow my mind as i thought it would.\n\nfirst off, the menu is extensive and everything that guy fieri stands for. the menu even reads like guy talks. fries, loaded fries, wings, burgers, brisket, sandwiches, salads, dessert...it's a big menu. they also have breakfast as well. i would like to come back and try breakfast -- we came for lunch.\n\nwe started off with the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> - they were an interesting flavor, you can definitely taste the fireball, but they were a bit dry. the wasabi blue cheese that it comes with is delicious. overall, not my favorite. i'd like to try the general tso's next time as our neighbor table got them and enjoyed them a lot. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> sound ginormous, but they actually are very manageable, so don't be afraid. i got <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> ($19 creole blackening spice, blue cheese, bacon,lettuce, tomato, onion, donkey sauce on a garlic-buttered brioche). underwhelming in flavor - i wouldn't order it again. my girlfriends both got the mac & cheese burger and they loved it. \n\nthe service was the pits. we were drawn in by the \"hangover recovery- build your own bloody mary\" sign, as we really needed a recovery. when i asked our waitress if i could see the bloody mary menu, she said \"pick a vodka and pick a spice level 1-5.\" we had no idea how much they cost and were disappointed because that didn't seem like \"building\" to me. i went on the website to look at the food menu to help jog my memory as i write this review, and, there is absolutely a menu for the build your own bloody mary (you choose a protein, you choose garnishes...i'm irritated). \n\ni would go back, because it's guy fieri, and the menu is extensive so i would hope for better service and to try something else that i would enjoy more.", 
            "went to guy fieri las vegas kitchen for an early dinner and loved it! this is smash burger but bigger and better!  i ordered the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> - i agree with the other reviewers here, not my favorite, but it was a beautiful app.  i ordered the original ringer burger for my entree and loved it! it was well seasoned and delicious!  i love the mix of fries that come with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.  it's genius.  i will be back!", 
            "this is one of those places on the strip that draws you in with an enticing smell. my brother had mentioned before that the aroma that emits from this establishment will peek your interest and urge you to step inside, and it sure worked on my girlfriend and i. we had no issue drifting in to experience something new.\n\nsomething new in more ways then one. this was the first time i had been anywhere that has a cut down menu after a certain time. the menu was small but not short of intriguing and delicious sounding items. we went with the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>, and <mark>Quad Fries</mark>. both items were so good and they gave us so much. \n\nthe food was really good but the condiments were what i have to rave about. the garlic ranch that came with the fries was hands down the best ranch i have ever had. i wish they bottled it and sold it in stores. the <mark>Quad Fries</mark> were unique, it was a basket of four different types of fries, waffle, sidewinders, julienne, and crinkle cut, something for everyone. wings could be ordered in different quantities so we ordered twelve of their <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> and these i enjoyed very much. i have a weird thing about eating chicken on the bone but these were cooked so well that the meat slid right off the bone. they tasted as if they were baked, lightly fried and then covered in sauce. the meat was juicy with the outside having a little crisp. again the dipping sauce was the thing that  had my attention. it was a blue cheese wasabi sauce, weird combination i know. somehow it worked, spicy and tangy all in one. \n\nthe service here was top notch, i am always afraid to just order a few small items and watch the waiter or waitress roll their eyes in disgust. since we just wanted a taste of this place, all that was ordered was some wings, fries, a beer, and a soda. the waiter just said \"excellent, let me get this order in right away for you\", no \"anything else?\", or \"did you need a few more minuets to pick out some more items?\". he was perfectly content with our small order. he came back twice to see if our food was good, filled my soda up twice and quickly got us some more of that amazing garlic ranch that we quickly devoured.\n\nnext positive of this place was the decor. the way i described it while sitting there was a rustic sort of american pickers kind of vibe. a lot of interesting antique items on the walls. a very comfortable night environment, and if you do not like the inside they have a large outdoor patio that overlooks the vegas street folk. they are not short of televisions either, at least five right around me, and most of the stations were appropriately tuned into cooking shows which was a nice attention to detail. the silverware was beefy heavy metal and the lighting was nice and dim.\n\ni really enjoyed this place. the best part part is enjoying their tasting menu. so when i go back to vegas in a few months i will get here in time to try something off their full menu. my suggestion is to stop in, enjoy the service, decor, grab a little snack, and for heavens sake try the garlic ranch!", 
            "we had pretty high expectations seeing as though we're big guy fans and really loved his restaurant in santa rosa. \n\nwe stumbled in on valentine's day around 3pm as we were traipsing around vegas. we knew we wouldn't be able to get in anywhere else on valentine's day any later in the evening, so when we were told that it would only be a 10-15 minute wait, we went for it.\n\nwe weren't super hungry, so we opted for just drinks and a couple apps.\nwe got the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>, & the caesar salad which comes in a giant crouton.\n\nthe service was okay. there were a few times when i would have liked a refill and there was nobody, but they came eventually.\n\nthe food was also only ok.\n\nthe <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> were okay in my book, but my husband didn't really care for them and only ate one. the pepperoni on them was a bit waxy, but the cheese dip was good i thought. we ate about half the app.\n\n<mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> looked cooler than anything else. the giant crouton ring was awesome, but it wasn't super flavorful. the dressing was okay.\n\nthe <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> were definitely the best part of the meal. they were cut into lollipops which i enjoy if i have to have wings with bones (i'm a boneless fan) and the sauce was delicious. it was spicy and sweet at the same time. i would definitely enjoy having those again, but i could leave the rest.\n\ni would be interested in trying the mac n' cheese burger since it won best burger in vegas and looked great, but other than that and those wings, i don't think i'd order anything else. \n\nsorry guy! still love ya!", 
            "i love bar food! we had the mac and cheese burger (hubby and i split it) and the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>. very good  we ordered the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> as an app and they were great too. service would be my only knock. slow service and we had to beg for ranch since everything came with a side of blue cheese. bloody mary was pretty good. we sat outside and didn't have to wait long, but as we were leaving the line was super long and plenty of open tables..i guess not enough servers? i would eat here again. it's also pricey, but so is everything in vegas. bring your total rewards card, they take a buck off every item of you show the card.", 
            "guys food was good, but the service was sub par and it was pretty overpriced.\n\nwe ordered a little bit of everything, including the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>, pepperoni <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>, fried ice cream and churros. \n\n<mark>The General's Wings</mark> were good, sweet and spicy and all drums so we liked that. \n\nthe <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>...i wanted real warm soft pretzels with cheese sauce so bad. these pretzel rods were the hard crunchy ones you can buy in the store so they weren't my favorite and at $12! yikes! the fondue was delicious though, a good portion and we used it for our fries.\n\nthe <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> i had was full of flavor, it's smashed so not your typical juicy burger but had plenty of sauce and toppings to make up for that. layered with bacon, great slaw, red pepper sauce and the perfect cheese. it's served with a side of various fries but for $18 it's overpiced.\n\nthe churro was perfect. warm dough fried and tossed in cinnamon sugar and served with chocolate and duce de leche. i'd order it again. the fried ice cream was also killer. it's served with a smorgasbord of sides including pineapple, mexican creme, burbon syrup, bananas and peanut butter and strawberries. \n\nas for the service, it was constantly delayed. we had to ask then wait 5 minutes for appetizer plates so the apps became cold, we needed ketchup with our burgers and she didn't come back after our food was delivered for over 10. then delayed the check and bringing back our cards as well. our dinner took entirely too long based on service alone. that and the prices makes me hesitant to return.", 
            "i ordered <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> they were good nice flavor my family had <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> they really enjoyed them fries were good and also the pretzel sticks", 
            "we had the bbq beef brisket open faced sandwich and <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>. the food was delicious but it being a guy fiery restaurant i expected more flavor. <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> was topped with coleslaw which had a delicious tangy flavor, served with seasoned fries that didn't require ketchup. the firewall wings were flavorful but a little too hard for my taste, served with blue cheese w/a touch of wasabi (yummy). no room for dessert. the wait was about 10 minutes, great atmosphere, our waitress was nice and attentive. we sat in the patio. prices are reasonable, nice place overall.", 
            "this place was alright. wanted to like it. i ordered the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> which was supposed to presented like a lollipop so it is easier to eat. it wasn't. tasted like regular buffalo wings. also sampled a few beers like the serving size but would like it better if the name of the beer i was tasting was listed somewhere. all in all nice decor but all televisions were playing food network.", 
            "i'll start by saying i came to this test establishment 3 times in about 70 hours. \n\nfriday night we land, semi-non sober and we want drinks and more drinks and some food. we landed late and it took for-ev-er to check in so it was close to midnight before we started our adventures. \n\nas we walked around we saw guys was open and we thought why not. \n\nthe menu was limited but <mark>The General's Wings</mark> and nachos we stupid delicious. the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> are the truth. \n\nstop 2: we had a quick lunch and i just got the pepperoni pretzels with some cheese sauce. again deadly. \n\nstop 3: breakfast. i forget what i got but you can imagine it was again....delicious. \n\n\nbloody mary's looked yummy. burgers are yummy. go now if you are in vegas.",

            "i have to say, this was not a restaurant i'd had my eye on to visit, but we were near the linq when family visited and it was convenient.\n\nfor a restaurant hosted by a food network star, i was not impressed..\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>, the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>, and the brisket nachos. the nachos were okay, the meat was nicely cooked and the flavors were balanced. the cheese sauce made it seem a little on the cheap side. the fries and <mark>The General's Wings</mark> had the same 'cheap franks hot sauce' taste and i didn't like either. the fries were drenched in this sauce and had blue cheese to boot and were beyond salty. <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were breaded and also had the same sauce - with the name \"fireball\" i was expecting something much more sweet and the same thing happened when i bit into them as when i bit into the fries: my lips puckered up from the overuse of salt..\n\nthe staff was okay, not super friendly or quick when it came to drinks, food, refills...anything really.\n\ncost: each appetizer was over $15. for the price and after the taste trial, we were pretty disappointed. i know that it is off of the strip, but i expected at least <mark>The General's Wings</mark> to be crispy and flavorful.\n\ni wouldn't take anyone back here who was here to visit our town, i would rather go to a smaller local restaurant that put more love into their food than this restaurant did... i am sure it's not a reflection of guy himself, but all-in-all it was not a good experience.",

            "i'm basing my review off the couple items i've had. also if you go after 10 there is a limited menu. my favorite thing here is <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>. the pretzel bread was so soft and the bbq was tasty. i also really love slaw on my bbq. the mac and cheese burger was really good and i've had a mac and cheese burger somewhere else and i didn't like it so i almost didn't get this but i saw it on ddd so i decided to give it a try since it is their number 2 seller. the motley que being the number 1. i also liked the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>. it was really a great sauce for wings. it was spicy but not too spicy. i recommend the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> for an appetizer. this is all i had but i ate here twice on a 4 day trip to vegas and vegas has such great restaurants. i look forward to eating again when in vegas"

            "beyond disappointed and embarrassed to have taken my boyfriend's parents here last night. i'm a huge fan of guy fieri and was bummed to miss his yelp elite event last month, and was so excited to try this place. epically backfired.\n\nget this: \n<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> are delish, but don't eat the \"creamy white truffle dip\"- no flavor, seems to be sour cream. oh, and they're $14, so consider yourself warned.\nthe hefeweizen beer featured on the current menu is also damn delicious. too bad it took 20 minutes and half of our meal to get to us.\n\ndon't get: \n<mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark> is plated poorly and difficult to cut up and eat the full romaine leaves. only one piece of feta in the entire dish, fell off the plate due to the plating issue and was unable to eat it. the dressing was citrusy and not at all appealing. only greek components of this salad were the feta i couldn't eat and a handful of olives. there was no hummus in this dish as listed on menu, and the croutons were soggy.\nthe mayor of flavortown is a dry burger with pastrami of questionable quality. somehow it looked like brisket with a dark color and odd taste. the dijon mustard was also flavorless. served with crinkle-cut sweet potato fries that looked and tasted like they were from the grocery store bulk bag. did not finish.\n\nmaybe take a gamble:\n<mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark> are cut lollipop style, which was visually pleasing and easier for my bf's dad to consume, and guy's signature bourbon brown sugar bbq sauce was neither bold nor flavorful, making it even more palatable for a guy who hates spice but couldn't find anything else on the menu he wanted to take a gamble on. good dish for the person who ordered it, but not something i can recommend.\n\nservice was also awful. as mentioned above, we waited 20 minutes for our beers. that is simply unacceptable. we also ordered a margarita that tasted like lemonade and did not seem to have any liquor in it- sent it back. should have sent everything back, but at 1am our options were limited, i didn't want to make a scene in front of my potential future in-laws, and quite frankly, we never saw our server.\n\nreceipt came in an iphone holder, with the device, to complete a dining experience survey about our visit. i would have loved to. but the iphone was out of battery and shut off. seriously?!\n\ni am so embarrassed to have suggested this place and will not be recommending it.  spending $100 to like an order of fries is ridiculous.\nbad service + bad food = bad experience.", 
            "let me start with the good. the waitstaff was awesome. very nice. and helpful as this was my first time at the restaurant. also were helpful when my son got sick at the table from eating the fresno chile that came with his <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>. also they removed the pepperoni breadsticks from my bill when it was obvious they were not a hit with the table. \n\nhere is the bad: my son said <mark>The General's Wings</mark> tasted funny. so i made the mistake of eating them. i didn't pay attention to whether the meat was fully cooked. but the meat must not have been, because within one hour of leaving i became violently ill. i am on my third day of suffering the effects of the food poisoning. ruined the last 2 days of my trip to vegas. my friend's son got the runs from eating the hamburger. and my friend is still sick as well from the grease. we are pretty sure the issue was  uncooked chicken and old grease. we will not return to the restaurant. which is sad because we only went to the restaurant because my son loves guy fieri.",

            "on our one-week vacation to vegas, we visited guy's restaurant twice...i'd say we liked it ;) the first time we went around dinner time so we had to sit outside in the vegas heat, but the food made up for it! we started with the <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark>. these must have been our favorite thing we ate in vegas. the raw tuna with the crispy shell were the perfect combo. we then moved on to the original smash burger and mac and cheese burger. they were both huge and great. also came with a side of fries (i really recommend they write this on the menu because we didn't think we were getting any and were thinking of ordering a separate side). the seasoning on the fries was so good. it had a spicy kick with a hint of sweetness. the cocktails are also great. they are so different that the waiter had to explain them all to me to get a sense of what i was ordering. \n\nour second trip, we had nick l for lunch. he is the best server, so ask for him! he gave us great recommendations and was spot on. this time we tried the <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark> and <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>. again, great. prices are also unbeatable, especially on the strip. i highly recommend this spot for lunch or dinner, burgers or wings.", 
            "walked in at 10:30pm after rock of ages show.  sat at the bar.  bartender was very nice and helpful for recommendations.  we enjoyed our food a lot.  it was unique.  my hubby and i split an order of the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>.  they are lollipop style and had a nice ranch for dipping and the veggies were not just typical celery but radishes, peppers, carrots, etc.  then we had the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>.  it was the best <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> we've ever had.  it had smoked gouda and other fixings.  the fries that came with it were a mix of differen<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> which was really good.  ok draft beer selection.  we each had one beer. good meal for $56 in vegas!", 
            "i was very excited to try out guy fieri's new restaurant since i love his ddd show.  this restaurant is located in the quad hotel.  the patio area is nice for hanging out and people-watching.\n\nunfortunately, nothing that we ordered was good.  starting with the drinks:  my friend ordered the smoke and mirrors cocktail.  it had a beautiful presentation with a small pepper garnish.  it tasted like cough syrup.  i got the rebel dragon--not very good either.\n\nfor appys, we ordered the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> (kind of bland) and the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>.  i got the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> for my entree, and my friend got the big dipper sandwich.  all of the food was kind of bland and underwhelming.  not what i expected from guy fieri.  i was so disappointed.  the service was good, but i don't think that i will be returning because it was such a lackluster meal.", 
            "couldn't wait to try this place and it didn't disappoint. we ordered the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>, <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark>, and mac n cheese burger. all 4 were awesome. would recommend this place.", 
            "best lunch i've had at vegas so far! bf and i were searching for an affordable and delicious lunch on our romantic vegas getaway, guy's fit the bill! it feels like the food is made with love! necessary ingredient. \n\nfast service, great food at \"affordable\" (for vegas) prices! highly recommend if you're looking for good quality for under $20/person. ordered nachos and each one had the perfect amount of cheese etc on it! <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark> were sooo good and served in a unique, convenient way. if you're near mirage, harrah's or caesar,a eat at guy's!", 
            "i'm a huge fan of guy fieri (especially triple d) so for my one night trip to vegas, this restaurant was my number one pick. it was my bud's 21st birthday too so we had a party of 6. it was a saturday night and we found the place after arriving on the strip (great location at the quad) and put our names in. i loved that we could just give them our numbers and chill out in a casino until the table was ready. after we were seated, our waiter introduced himself and the night went from average to top notch. his name was chris anderson and not only did he know his stuff, but he was incredibly attentive and did everything possible to make our first visit the best. we ordered the truffle fries as an appetizer and it blew our minds so much that chris kept bringing out their truffle aioli later for our entrees. between all os us, we took down the mac & cheese burger (literally one of the best burgers i've ever had, everything down to the lettuce is flavored to a t), the steak asado tacos, the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>, and the cheesecake for dessert. we only spent one night in vegas and all we can remember is how good that meal was. they even put candles in the cheesecake and sang happy birthday. the only way it could have been better is if guy himself was there, but eating at his restaurant was the next best thing.", 
            "love guy fieri's show on the food network channel.  we had high expectations, but was sadly disappointed. the atmosphere was cool; we sat outside on the patio to listen to the music in the surrounding area/casino. our server looked like he did not want to be there and was not pleasant. the mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> was huge and pretty good. my husband's <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> was over seasoned, leaving a bad taste. all our fries with our meals were all too salty - over seasoned!  even both our kids, who love fries, didn't like it or want any. the  <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark> were ok, nothing to brag about. our server never checked on us during the meal, then all of a sudden, another server was asking if we wanted dessert. we kindly declined and asked for the bill. when we got it, some of the billing/charges were incorrect. if you have a \"total rewards\" players card, each of the meal prices should be discounted. this had not been the case,  only two items were discounted; the new server blamed our first server since he entered our order on the system/computer. please review your itemize receipt before paying. they fixed the bill after we addressed it to the server, but if we didn't review it, then we would have paid more.", 
            "i love guy's show, and i think he is great.  they were really busy the night we were there and didn't have a great experience from a service standpoint.  but i was amazed that one of their managers actually reached out to me about our experience!  we had the <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark> for an appetizer and they were really good!!!  i also really recommend the chicken lollipops, the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>!  i ordered the pulled pork sandwich called the motley que.  i like guy's carolina style bbq sauce and i buy it at the store, i thought the sauce was a little on the sweet side.  but the pretzel bun and slaw were good as well.  also, the restaurant is right next to the high roller.  so if you are planning on going there, it is a great place to stop on your way there.", 
            "i know who guy fieri is, but was never a fan of the food network.  but i am a fan of good food, and i got it here!\n\nmy girlfriend and i stepped in for a late lunch.  we noticed right away that the fun atmosphere was reflected all the way down to the skull napkins.\nwe ordered the won tacos for an appetizer, which was recommended by our server.  the right amount of heat on tuna tacos. i could have just eaten a couple more of these and had been happy.  very good.\ni ordered the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>.  i was initially skeptical because i thought that the effort to make them \"lollipop\" wings (pushing all of the meat to one end of the bone) was to disguise something was missing.  but i was wrong, they were delicious all around.\nit's a burger joint, so we had to order a burger.  my girl got the smash burger, which was great.  the plating was again fun, a little bit heavy on the salt-side but nothing overwhelming.  \n\nservice was great.  our server was jill, and not only did she know about all of the food, she was easy to interact with.  you can tell she cares about her job because she expresses the \"fun\" nature that this place tries to provide its customers.\n\ni have to get going, i'm off to watch some food network.", 
            "the best! so delish - sat our party of four quickly for a busy thursday night. had great <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> and <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark> with my hubby - <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were smothered in the greatest bbq sauce we've ever had, and the dipping sauce was so tasty. we ordered the cheesecake for dessert - so glad we shared! really great mix of sweet and salty. also, we loved the way all of the food was presented. great trays, plates, taco stands, etc. awesome!", 
            "totally excited to come here we love guy!\na short wait was no issue we got a a text when the table was ready my daughter wants to be a chef and was sooo stoked to be here. she loves guy vs rachel's kids cook off. as a former chef i was giddy too. it's an odd layout and ambiance. is it a bar? a bbq joint? country western or rock?  no clue the menu is basically burgers and sandwiches. no kids menu soo 13 bucks a kid or more.  we got the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> the triple d burger the dragon fries and the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark> . we'll the food on par omg so good but from the loud music the squished seating and it was uncomfortable the messed up a beer order which we'll can pass.  the two shining lights in this place was our server christopher and the flavor of the food.  the ambiance was hectic rushed and stressful the only working pos was outside sooo 30degree weather shooting\ndown my spine every time a server had to ring something up.   kudos to the waitstaff and chef to saving the night.", 
            "as a big guy fierri fan i was really looking forward to eating here on our trip from phoenix. the food did not dissapoint, the service did. we got the dragons <mark>Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries</mark>, fireball whiskey wings, fondue pretzel dippers and the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>. again the food was very good all around. our server was unfriendly and completely disinterested in making this a 5 star experience. to be honest the entire staff just seemed like they were sleepwalking. very little smiling.  fix the staff and this place would be perfect.", 
            "i've never had such a wonderful experience eating lunch!   the service was superior, drinks on point and our food was absolutely amazing!  the mac n cheese burger, omggggggggggg what a experience, when <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark> were cooked to perfection and we topped off our meal with the mint pie, mercy is all i can say!", 
            "mixed review here, but so are the members of our family.  good location, yet we only had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated outside on a beautiful day.  waited on right away for drinks and we were already to order.  food came out fast.\n\nwife and son had the motley que pulled pork.  teenager thought it was great, but my wife thought for all his talk about bold flavors it might have been a little bland.  daughter had a cheeseburger that was very big and cooked perfectly.  all of them go<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> 4 ways and were pleased.  my 16 year old got the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark> and didn't find them tasty and didn't have enough heat.  \n\ni had the italian <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> and it ranks up there on one of the best i have had.  the \"bowl\" is made of a thick piece of smoked provolone wrapped in prosciutto.  plenty of different types of olives, cheese and dried sausage on the side.  i wasn't that hungry to start, but ate every last bite of a large salad.  wish i went there when i was hungry.\n\nso one teenager didn't care for it, wife and daughter thought it was ok and the other teen and i had a great meal.  in vegas i thought it was a good value.", 
            "so if you have a party of four or less you wait outside the restaurant and if five or more you go inside. i don't get understand that, but okay. we had four and waited just 30mins. it was on a sunday for lunch. \n\nwe got seated and was given a menu. we looked over the menu, but we had a good idea already as to what we wanted to order. so now we're just sitting, waiting, thinking over how are weekend was in vegas since we were just hours away from going home. well, that time passed and passed...okay so we're super hungry and we're still waiting for someone to introduce themself to us. my boyfriend had to flag down a server and tell them we we're waiting for service! on top of that, we still waited an extra three mins for someone to come by. when the guy did, he was honestly creepy. plus he had just visited another table cuz he was carrying trays and menus. he asked us if we wanted anything to drink and then was going to get that, but we kinda were on a time crunch so we told him we were ready to order then too. our food took awhile, but that was worth the wait.\n\n i order the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>, the bf ordered the mac cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. my friends ordered the fireball whiskey wings and <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark>. i loved my wings!!! so much flavor, and it came with some veggies. plus on top of <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were onion strings, yum! i had a piece <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> and it was juicy and oily lol. i loved the fries that came with it. i also had a fireball wing. i didn't think it was that spicy, it was good, but spice wise, no. my friends also ordered <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> later on while we were eating. those took foreverrrrr to come out!!! they were good though, but man.\n\nthe food was amazing! the service was terrible and slow! our server took our checks and it took 12 mins! why? i saw him making up a drink @ bar for another table of his. isn't that the bartenders job?? then he took to them and then did our checks! like, if you're going to do that stuff @ least do it behind a solid wall, there wasn't even a wall to block him. i could see him!!! \n\nlike seriously!!! it was like the server worked @ a fancy fancy restaurant where the service and speed was more on the slow side. this wasn't and isn't that kind of place. we got seated @ 12:55pm. i thought we were going to be there for like an hour and 15mins, no! we were there till 2:36pm! i know this cuz we wanted to leave vegas by 3pm. and we still had shopping to do. that was soooo annoying, not the way i wanted to end my last meal there. so yeah, our server costed my rating a star or else this would have been a 5 star review.", 
            "i had a food credit from my hotel and thought i'd give it a try. i would absolutely return! i just got the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark> and <mark>Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries</mark> and was totally blown away. our server had a ton of knowledge and was super helpful. i made sure to take my leftovers with me this time. this place is on point!",

            "had the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> and they were awesome.  buffalo style fries is something i was hesitant to try but i'm glad i did. <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark> were also great. food took a little long to come out but presentation was excellent and food was great. would definitely recommend.",

            "service was serviceable. food was awful. we ordered <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark> and general tso wings. we were told they were preboiled then fried. the meat was stringy and very unappetizing. there was pink juice secreting from every wing. we were told <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were fully cooked and not to worry. my poor gf had to scurry back to our room before she got sick in public. don't let this happen to your loved ones. you can do so much better on the strip.",

            "the service, food, and staff were amazing!  i went here with my family, party of four, during the pre-soft opening where our whole meal was comped. we were instantly greeted and shown our table. although, we weren't seated at the bar, the bartenders made us feel welcome as we passed by. \n\nthe service was quick and they managed to make conversation despite being packed. my glass was never empty and the servers were kind. \n\nwe ordered the big dipper, <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, nachos del jefe, <mark>The General's Wings</mark>, margarita fajita wings, and victor's sweet tacos. and for dessert we had the <mark>Triple Doublemint Pie</mark>. we were huge fans of the margarita fajita wings, the amazing truffles smothered all over the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, nachos del jefe and the big dipper. \n\nthe sauce for the margarita fajita wings was phenomenal. they almost took this off the menu, but we are so glad that they didn't. it was a sweet and sour sauce with herbs accompanied with perfectly cooked chicken. so worth it! \n\nmy brother loved the nachos del jefe. everyone else at the table enjoyed it, but didn't believe that it was \"spectacular\". \n\neveryone at the table loved the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>. there were truffles over the fries and within the sauce. there was so much, we couldn't possibly finish all of it, because the portion size was huge (which is a great thing). \n\nthe big dipper was a great sandwich. the manager came by to inquire about our experience and he informed us that they spent hours cooking the meat to perfection. it was seasoned well, and moist. it's a must try! \n\noverall, we enjoyed the food, service and staff. the managers even came by a couple times to personally talk and make us feel welcome while the servers were friendly and consistently checked on us in a pleasant manner.",

            "i remember hearing that guy fieri had opened a new restaurant in vegas, and as we were walking by the quad i saw this place and new i had to try it.  my friends are always willing to try new places so we went in.  there was a pretty long line, which led me to think it would be a long wait, but we were seated shortly after.  \n\nwe had two waitresses that took care of our table.  one took the order and brought out the food, and the other was for drinks.  this is something new to me, but was glad it worked out great.  i had my drinks refilled my times without having to ask for a refill.  \n\non to the food, our table ordered <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>, <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>, <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, and the mac and cheese bacon cheeseburger.  \n<mark>The General's Wings</mark> are like a lollipop style so sizes do vary.  unfortunately, ours were on the smaller size.  we got a wing/pop that was a size of a quarter.  the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> does have a spicy kick to it. not overwhelmingly spicy but leaves a tingle.  flavor was pretty good.  the double barrel bbq wing is pretty normal.  the mac and cheese burger was ginormous.  good luck taking a bite out of this one.  i had to use a fork and knife to eat this burger.   i ordered it medium but it came out well done.  was not cooked to order.  wished the mac and cheese would were more cheesy.  overall, <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was a bit dry and lacking in flavor.  \n\nthey have a beer challenge here if you can drink their flight sampler under a certain amount of time, you will win a t-shirt.  we didn't do it because we were already full after eating.  service is great here even while they are extremely busy. prices are a little bit on the expensive side for burgers and wings.", 
            "best server at this place is chris anderson!!! in all seriousness ask for a reservation with him you will be impressed!! he really knows his stuff and gave me & my fianc\\u00e9 an amazing experience. he has an in depth knowledge of the menu and the beers that are offered & i'm glad we had him as our server! thank you chris!! amazing!!\n\nwe walked in with no reservation & was lucky enough to be seated right away in his section. we ordered the 16 beer flight which was more then enough for 2 people & we also ordered the onion rings to start which are a bit spicy (it was more the spicy ketchup that comes with it not the actual onion rings that was spicy) and we also ordered <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> & came back the next day to try the fireball whiskey wings. everything tasted great except i do agree with other reviews i read about the fries, there wasn't too many & <mark>The General's Wings</mark> are a bit small however the flavors were great & i'm glad i experienced this place! we also got a free t-shirt for ordering the beer flight which was cool but if i could suggest anything i would ask to keep the menu simple and work on a theme for this place. the menu is a little corny since it uses a lot of words you think guy would say on his triple d show when describing the food he's eating. just keep it simple! read the menu and you will understand what i'm talking about....hope to see you again chris!", 
            "the food was decent. we had wings, shrimp and steak tacos and fried s'mores dessert. <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were so good. tacos were ok, and our dessert was not good at all. service was a little below average, our waiter was the one that recommend the dessert.", 
            "i was excited to try this place since it opened in late april. i was finally able to try it this last weekend. \n\noverall, the experience was great. the server was friendly and very nice. she took our order and had a friendly conversation with us about food and guy fieri. \n\nwe ordered the \"triple t\" fries and <mark>The General's Wings</mark>. it did take about 25 minutes to get our food-disappointing.\n\n<mark>The General's Wings</mark> were good. a sweet, tangy, and spicy sauce with 3 dipping choices of toppings. lollipop style wing was easy to eat.\n\nthe \"triple t\" fries were good but not the greatest truffle fries i have tried. in my opinion and the girlfriend's opinion they were a little too greasy.\n\nwould i try this place again? yeah, i'll give it another whirl. i guess, i was just expecting a little too much from guy.", 
            "such a great place, 5 stars all around! i went here with my husband and a couple friends, we had heard about the restaurant and were hoping it would live up to our expectations! it absolutely did, the atmosphere was great and the food was amazing! i loved the decor and even the menu was so unique! i would recommend <mark>The General's Wings</mark>, chicken tacos as well as the churros! everything we had was delish! great chef they have here! yummy! definitely will be going back the next time we are in vegas!", 
            "needs to be better with a brand like his. he has huge potential because of his television persona but the restaurant is essentially a typical casual dining with slightly better food.\n\nfood quality: tasty and interesting. had <mark>The General's Wings</mark> and <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>. wings are great but very small, were those quail wings? portions seem small for the price, my son had a burger said it was very good.\n\nservice: friendly but slow, bizarre disjointed room and table layout doesn't help. greeters are clueless, 30 minute wait was over an hour and that's after i complained. entrance is disappointing.\n\nambiance: poor, too dark, music is too low, table layout is terrible, too much empty space. uncomfortable, you can't see or feel the vibe.\n\nlocation: terrible for locals, ok if you are a first time vegas tourist otherwise for the foodie or smart vegas traveler it's a poor location.", 
            "it was the best of guy, it was the worst of guy...\n\ni know the place has gotten mixed reviews, but the missus and i loved the food and the atmosphere.   we had the breadsticks wrapped in pepperoni with a sausage cheese fondue dipping sauce for our app... over the top, to quote mr. f.   entree for me was the <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark> with grilled chicken, sausage, peppers... heaven on a hogie.   the missus did <mark>The General's Wings</mark>, which she went nuts for.... and we both loved the fries 3 ways.\n\ngreat times, hard working, friendly staff, cool... until.\n\nsome self important manager in a suit (the only staff member that wasn't dressed in guy-style) started huffing around, bossing the staff around.   the people beside us at the bar had only gotten up a minute before when he strutted up and bellowed, \"get this cleaned up, this side of the bar is filthy!\"   mind you, the staff was working their asses off, and didn't need to be bullied... nor did we, as customers, have to witness it.\n\nso... great food, mostly cool people, enjoyed.   note to manager... put on a jersey and take the stick out... you were a buzz kill.", 
            "sit at the bar!  it's fun and full of action!  we ended up being quite happy that there was a wait for restaurant seating on a recent september saturday morning.  hungry, we opted to check out the bar, and got very lucky when a couple got up and left, vacating the perfect comfy spot for us.  honestly, this was the most comfortable bar stool i've ever sat in! we settled in and connected with new friends (they even let us try their sweet tea giant drink.  (way better than i would have thought, and surprisingly not too sweet!).  for around $35 you can get a giant fishbowl full of about 5 drinks that includes a free t-shirt.  not a bad deal! we even watched them walk vs. stumble out later.  kudos new friends!\n\nhowever still breakfast to us, we opted to go a little easier than that...very good regular iced tea for me, and a couple brews for husband.  later i added a  \"lemon drop...not\", which was very good. hungry, we had to start with the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>. (after i presented our bartender with my total rewards card to save a buck per item).  good thing we had already ordered our mains before this arrived, or we might have been fine with just these.  huge, majorly rich, and totally off the hook!  where else would you find pepperoni wrapped breadsticks with a cheese fondue with sausage, tomato and basil in it?  with a kicker of pepperoncini to cut through the richness? no where else...  thanks guy!\n\nour bartender was so awesome that she saved our leftover fondue for future fry-dipping...wise gal...loved her and her hard-working cohorts!  husband's '67 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark> was flavor-town indeed!  i know because of the small taste that he was willing to part with. he did more (slightly) willingly share his trio of fries with chipotle ketchup.  yum to all of them!  \n\nmeanwhile i was chowing down on <mark>The General's Wings</mark>.  as good as these were, they were wayyy sweet.  would have loved to share them and have something else with them as well, but alas husband doesn't do bones.  loved that they were served with crushed wasabi peas, peanuts and sesame sticks to dip the sticky sweetness into.  the salty crunch was a perfect compliment.  i didn't waste a bit.  (you're welcome, grandma in heaven).  \n\nneedless to say we were way too full to even contemplate desserts.\n\nhad an absolutely delightful time...until a big suit guy (the kind you see in the pit at a casino that is intimidating) come barging over to complain to the hard-working bartenders that the area was \"messy\".  (our neighbors had just left...you know, the ones that had just spent all that money on two breakfasts and several drinks including the giant one?) our server had been asked by us to settle up and was just coming back with it when he complained to her.  this made us feel horrible.  like we had made her get in trouble...management, not cool.  we were all doing great until you came along.  as they say...it's not what you say but how you say it...and from what we've seen on television, didn't feel like guy style...just sayin'.",

            "ambiance: 2 - i wasn't impressed by the look of the restaurant. it was like a cross between a saloon/log cabin with flat screens to make it a more accessible place for men, so they can eat and watch the game. it looks like a place where modern day, tough-guy bikers are supposed to hang out..with those skulls on the napkins ha! \n\nthey had an okay seating area, but the staff didn't clean it very well. they left tons of crumbs on the seats!! \n\nservice: 4 - the staff was awesome. super friendly and funny! they are also very young and some are good-looking ;) \n\nbut, i felt like i was seated after a very long time. there were quite a few \"closed sections\"..and even after waiting a super long time, they still didn't clean the table well, which was a little gross. \n\nfood: 3 - the food was definitely average. i had the truffle fries and the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>. both of which were served pretty lukewarm, which was not that pleasant. i wanted it to be served hot!!! \n\ntheir system of leaving warm things out is ineffective. it leaves the food way, way too cold for my taste. i would have rather taken my food scalding than barely warm. the food would have been way better if served hot. \n\nthe highlight of <mark>The General's Wings</mark> was the bleu cheese wasabi dipping sauce. it was a great combination and made the chicken loads better! truffle fries were good, but nothing to write home about. my parents ordered <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>, and they are probably the best things on the menu. \n\nin conclusion, it was just okay. i just really wanted hot food--being served cold food made it taste old and not newly cooked.",

            "someone asked me privately from yelp if i was picky with food because i used to cook for celebrity chefs? i'd like to say no because there are some food establishments that aren't considered 5 star that for a plate i'd slap my mama---but i am harder on establishments that consider themselves elite amongst top chefs. \n\na friend recommended this place to me and i decided to give it a chance. normally i don't frequent celebrity chef establishments because having worked in this industry i know that the chef is not who is cooking the food. i was excited about going on the strip since i avoid it like ebola, so i think my expectations were too high.\n\nwe were given a seat on a very busy corner and our next best option was to be seated by this wall with a flat screen. we opted by the wall. while waiting for our food we stared at this wall feeling like inmates serving a prison sentence. our server brought us some glasses of water and joked that we were about to enjoy the lovely minerals from lake mead. after one sip, i knew what he was talking about. yuck! i couldn't get over the jumbo ice cubes and thought they were the most beautiful thing. \n\nwe started out with the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> which were...ok. only the very top of the fries contained that truffle \"goodness\" and it was so faint. which means they probably didn't \"toss\" all of the ingredients together. they just piled and sprinkled it on top. cooking 101. i love truffle oil and i barely got any, leaving me feel like i just ordered garlic parmesan fries. on the menu it says, \"truffle, truffle, + more truffle.\" it was more like, \"lies, lies, + more lies!\"\n\nnot wanting to gorge myself silly i ordered bruthas badass caesar salad and the generals wings. my friend ordered some jumbo burger.\nour food came and after one look i could tell that my bread on the plate was stale. here's a little inside info for you guys. croutons are usually made with day old bread to avoid cost and waste. there's nothing wrong with that, but after a day----you don't make croutons or keep the ones you made previously.....you just cut your losses and toss it. i knew right away that jumbo crouton was made more than a day in advance. it was so friggin' hard and you could tell by looking at it closely that it had started to get old because when you cook old ass bread it leaves a pattern that looks pulled. it's hard to explain without showing you closely, but maybe you can see it in my photos.\n<mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> dressing was sooooo watery and thin, which was most likely caused by tossing the lettuce while wet. i don't even want to get into that. \n\n<mark>The General's Wings</mark> were hard as a brick! they were overcooked then glazed with this wierd walmart hoisin tasting sauce. nothing had flavor. my friend didn't enjoy his burger either. it was cold. we didn't complain because i understood that it wasn't something that could be corrected. the food is what it is due to errors that need to be corrected by the executive chef, or guy fieri just really sucks. i'm gonna sound like an old timer, but back in my day a chef wasn't a chef until he/she spent over ten years training, spent years in europe giving blood, sweat, and tears on the cooking line, and even then you were humble until you proved yourself leading a line. too many people call themselves chefs when they haven't mastered the basics of flavor. even i haven't mastered anything at this point since i left that world and discontinued my training--but i really was hard on this restaurant. food can't just look pretty on a plate---it has to taste good too. i expected much more from a big name \"chef\".", 
            "came on a weekday for dinner with no wait!  score!  we opted to sit outside.  our waiter was great - he had some recommendations and hand a cheerful demeanor.  we ordered:\n\n-<mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> - these were a little disappointing considering all the reviews on them, mainly because the pretzels tasted a little stale.  i thought it might have been from the baking?  but i'm not sure.  they were wrapped with thinly sliced pepperoni along with a pot of melted cheese.  i wouldn't get this again, though it wasn't bad.\n-bacon mac n cheese burger - good burger!  the mac 'n cheese didn't make <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> to heavy, as i was worried about.  it actually tasted really good with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.  it was also not a huge as it looks in some people's pictures.  don't get me wrong, it's a big burger and is a half pound but in some pictures, it looks just gigantic.  came with three different types of fries - i liked the tiny shoestring ones the best.\n\ndrinks were good.  my friend got the kentucky rock'r and liked it so much, she chose it for her second drink.   guido's freaky tiki, which was both sweet and sour.  i thought it was okay - i enjoyed my second drink, the java guava, better.  \n\ni don't think i'd wait an hour to eat here, but i wouldn't mind trying out <mark>The General's Wings</mark> or a different burger next time.", 
            "as a fan of ddd we've been dying to try this place. we don't often visit the strip but we were already near by so we stopped by. they don't take reservations so when we arrived we were told there was a 25 minute wait. we waited. the host was supposed to text us after seating was available but we never were notified so we walked up after waiting and were seated right away. \n\nfrom the wait we expected it to be busy. half the seats were empty and some staff members were just standing around. we were pleasantly greeted after we sat down.\n\ni ordered the mac and cheese burger and husband ordered fireball whiskey wings with a side of truffle fries. food took a while to get to us but we were slightly distracted by the spicy bloody mary's. very very good! \n\nmy burger was huge and delicious along with the truffle fries. burger was a little runny. <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were satisfactory but did not live up to the menu description.\n\ndefinitely worth a second trip for a better experience and more bloody mary's. they have a brunch we need to check out.", 
            "was wanting to try this place since i planned my vegas trip. there was plenty of seating available. i opted for a table in doors facing the strip. server came around right away. i started with a virgin bloody mary. they threw every kinda of garnish you could imagine! i ordered the fondue and the general wings. the fondue wasn't too bad. it's meat wrapped around pretzels dipped in cheese. so pretty much yum! <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were so so. i was hoping for a bit more kick to them. i found them one flavor. that being sweet. there were crushed peanuts, wasabi peas and rice crackers to \"dip\" them in. i would of fathered a sauce to off set the sweet. but the meal was good and very filling. i think i would try one of <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> next time. but i would for sure go back.", 
            "i was skeptical given the poor reviews and the menu i had looked over and passed on...however, we had a comp to use and had guests that wanted to go, so we did.  \n\ni was pretty impressed given the location and celebrity chef status...anticipated, mediocre and overpriced food.   it ended up a pretty decent value given those specifics.\n\nordered the $33 rack of ribs...which was basically 3 half racks (6 meaty, moist bones) plated w yummy moist jalapeno corn cakes and mac n cheese, creamy topped w onion straws.  shared this w my mom, really whole table ate off it.  you could smell the ribs being slow cooked when you walked in, so if people don't enjoy bbq smell, lol.  was surprised by the texas decor.\n\nalso ordered the bleu cheese burger, had a lot of creamy bleu cheese, great for me, might be a bit much for others.  \n\nalso ordered the mac n cheese burger...huge and shareable served w seasoned house fries included...rare for a celeb place to have sandwiches include fries.\n\ni will not say sides because there were no sides, which is strange and my one complaint.....the menu was too limited.  i am not a burger person anyway, but 3 burgers and 3 flavors of wings and a few random things thrown on for good measure just doesn't make sense, except that he wants a limited menu to turn over tables quickly without a lot of kitchen prep.  disappointed that a man whose job it is to find the tastiest menu items in the country has this menu....but the menu itself was well implemented.  we did not get to try any of <mark>The General's Wings</mark>.  again, reiterating that everything was flavorful and \"high end\", not a here's a 3 dollar burgar, add my name and pay 16.  \n\nportions and location made this a pretty good value, so add celeb name and i call it a good value.\n\nalso ordered the smores <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>....good, reminded me of a funnel cake w chocolate.  shared w 5.  dipping choc was delish.  i would order again.  \n\nthe menu turned me off several times before finally just going.  it doesn't sound as appealing as it was.", 
            "had high expectations. unfortunately was let down. the mac in cheese burger was could, not much flavor, the bun was not toasted, and the meat was dry ( probably cooked to death). i was expecting a nice juicy hot burguer. <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were good, but nothing much better than hooters. the burguer i hate to say it was awful. after $40, i was wondering why didn't we just went to in:out burguer or hooters, would been much better.", 
            "we love triple d and guy fieri, so wanted to try his place while in vegas.  we loved the atmosphere of the place and the menu looked really good. i had the <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark> and my husband had <mark>The General's Wings</mark>.  they were both very tasty. \n\n<mark>The General's Wings</mark> were\"trimmed into \"lollipop\" shapes, to make them easier to eat\", in doing so they took  the one part of the chicken, with the least amount of meat, and cut off half of the meat to make the \"lollipop\" shape.  i don't know who thought that would be a good idea, but stop it!!  wings are messy, give me a wet nap, don't cut the meat off <mark>The General's Wings</mark>.  maybe they thought by taking off half of the meat, you had less to eat, thus less time to get messy??  not sure, but for those prices, i want all of the meat left on my wings. i'll deal with being messy. \n\nthe <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark> was very good, but the lettuce was not cut up, at all, and by the time i finished cutting it, and was ready to eat, my husband had eaten all but one of his wing \"lollipops\".  thankfully i looked up in time to stop him from eating the last one and was able to try them.",

            "decided to try this place out after seeing the long lines and stopping by las vegas this week.  the wait was not too bad, around 25 minutes.  the front staff was very courteous and friendly.  we obtained a table for 5 and were seated in a central location.  the ambiance was nice as the place has plenty of windows and you get a partial view of the strip and surrounding buildings.  i understand the place was busy, but our food did take 52 minutes to arrive to our table.  when i asked our server gregory why the food was taking so long he said \"its because you ordered appetizers\" as if i was being penalized for ordering 2 appetizers.  he didn't even apologize.  i asked for a manager who came by was very polite and apologized for the situation.  he offered free dessert, which i politely declined and stated i just really wanted to give him the feedback.  the server later gave us the check and asked if he could take our bill quickly so \"we didn't have to wait...\" with a sarcastic undertone.  not nice... as far as the food goes, the appetizers we had were the <mark>Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries</mark> and <mark>The General's Wings</mark>.  the fries were good, lots of cheese and flavor... <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were just ok, and were a bit cold.  they have very little meat on them as they shave the bottom half of the wing to \"make it easier to eat\".  some of the plates we ordered included the blue cheese burger and the original burger.  they were mediocre at best.  for a $20 burger, i was expecting something much better.  the meat was dry and the bun was brittle and didn't taste fresh.  at the end of the day there are plenty of restaurants in las vegas that deserve your time and money, and this clearly is not one of them.  i had high hopes coming into this place, but left disappointed.  hopefully things change in the future.",

            "so if you have a party of four or less you wait outside the restaurant and if five or more you go inside. i don't get understand that, but okay. we had four and waited just 30mins. it was on a sunday for lunch. \n\nwe got seated and was given a menu. we looked over the menu, but we had a good idea already as to what we wanted to order. so now we're just sitting, waiting, thinking over how are weekend was in vegas since we were just hours away from going home. well, that time passed and passed...okay so we're super hungry and we're still waiting for someone to introduce themself to us. my boyfriend had to flag down a server and tell them we we're waiting for service! on top of that, we still waited an extra three mins for someone to come by. when the guy did, he was honestly creepy. plus he had just visited another table cuz he was carrying trays and menus. he asked us if we wanted anything to drink and then was going to get that, but we kinda were on a time crunch so we told him we were ready to order then too. our food took awhile, but that was worth the wait.\n\n i order the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>, the bf ordered the mac cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. my friends ordered the fireball whiskey wings and <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark>. i loved my wings!!! so much flavor, and it came with some veggies. plus on top of <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were onion strings, yum! i had a piece <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> and it was juicy and oily lol. i loved the fries that came with it. i also had a fireball wing. i didn't think it was that spicy, it was good, but spice wise, no. my friends also ordered <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> later on while we were eating. those took foreverrrrr to come out!!! they were good though, but man.\n\nthe food was amazing! the service was terrible and slow! our server took our checks and it took 12 mins! why? i saw him making up a drink @ bar for another table of his. isn't that the bartenders job?? then he took to them and then did our checks! like, if you're going to do that stuff @ least do it behind a solid wall, there wasn't even a wall to block him. i could see him!!! \n\nlike seriously!!! it was like the server worked @ a fancy fancy restaurant where the service and speed was more on the slow side. this wasn't and isn't that kind of place. we got seated @ 12:55pm. i thought we were going to be there for like an hour and 15mins, no! we were there till 2:36pm! i know this cuz we wanted to leave vegas by 3pm. and we still had shopping to do. that was soooo annoying, not the way i wanted to end my last meal there. so yeah, our server costed my rating a star or else this would have been a 5 star review.", 
            "after striking out at chayo (also in the linq), we settled on going to guy fieri's restaurant because it was close, open late, and we were all hungry and wanted to try it.  i'll admit that i went in to this with high expectations, so maybe that lent to the fact that i found the entire place...underwhelming.\n\nthe decor is all right...kind of exactly what you would expect, and the servers are nice enough, even if they are a bit slow.  it was relatively busy, so i'm willing to overlook the slow pace of service.  the food, however, was just mediocre.  i think all four of us expected something more.  huge portions and huge flavor were expected.  the portions lived up to expectations, but unfortunately the food didn't.  \n\ni ordered the mac n cheese burger and while it was pretty large, the mac n cheese on it was very bland and the bacon was kind of chewy.  a friend ordered the fireball chicken wings and <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were small, and it only came with 7 wings.  another of us ordered the cajun chicken sandwich.  here is where you would really expect some big flavor, but it was just so-so.  my fiance ordered the ribs (33 bucks for a rack...not too bad for a strip restaurant with a famous dude's name attached) and those were definitely the best thing on our table.  they were tender and smoky and had a lot of flavor.  the rack of ribs came with cornbread that was pretty dry and normal...nothing special, and a small cup of the same bland mac n cheese that was on my burger.  we also ordered the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> to share as a table...those were actually pretty tasty.\n\ni'd love to give this place more stars but it just doesn't live up to any expectation we had going on.",

            "so i was hesitant about even coming here, but hash house had an hour and a half wait for brunch on a sunday. we show up at 10:30, thinking no problem we can get in by 11 for breakfast because there's no one there. i was wrong. the hostess forgot to put our name in so after checking back in at 11 and finally sat at 11:10 it was too late for breakfast. ok, that was disappointing but we were hungry and really thought \"how bad could it be?\" \n\ni will say, our server was awesome. he was attentive and friendly and knowledgeable. he repeated our order back to us so we knew that we were getting the correct items.\n\ntruffle fries were great! honestly thought i haven't had truffle fries i haven't liked. that's about the best part. i order the general wings. they were cool in presentation and came with different items to dip them in. while <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were big, the sauce was way way way too sweet. my friend got the buffalo wings, and they were eh. neither wings were crispy, but the buffalo wings were definitely soggy. the blue cheese was great though! my boyfriend ordered <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>. the fries were good, and <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> was ok. the meat tasted like liquid smoke had been added to it and tasted artificial. \n\nover all the service was great but the food was blah. i like guy, but this is disappointing. head over to the yard house just a few steps away for better food and pricing!", 
            "i have to say, this was not a restaurant i'd had my eye on to visit, but we were near the linq when family visited and it was convenient.\n\nfor a restaurant hosted by a food network star, i was not impressed..\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>, the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>, and the brisket nachos. the nachos were okay, the meat was nicely cooked and the flavors were balanced. the cheese sauce made it seem a little on the cheap side. the fries and <mark>The General's Wings</mark> had the same 'cheap franks hot sauce' taste and i didn't like either. the fries were drenched in this sauce and had blue cheese to boot and were beyond salty. <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were breaded and also had the same sauce - with the name \"fireball\" i was expecting something much more sweet and the same thing happened when i bit into them as when i bit into the fries: my lips puckered up from the overuse of salt..\n\nthe staff was okay, not super friendly or quick when it came to drinks, food, refills...anything really.\n\ncost: each appetizer was over $15. for the price and after the taste trial, we were pretty disappointed. i know that it is off of the strip, but i expected at least <mark>The General's Wings</mark> to be crispy and flavorful.\n\ni wouldn't take anyone back here who was here to visit our town, i would rather go to a smaller local restaurant that put more love into their food than this restaurant did... i am sure it's not a reflection of guy himself, but all-in-all it was not a good experience.", 
            "i'm not big on writing reviews but this restaurant compelled me to do it.\n\nyou ever eat a meal and walk away no longer hungry but unsatisfied? this is how i felt about guys vegas restaurant. i expected more from a celebrity chef. \n\ni ordered the original burger topped with a fried onion ring. the ring was cold and <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was over cooked. if you're not going to ask me how i would like my burger cooked at least have the decency to give me a juicy burger. for $18 you better have something really tasty and memorable.\n\ni also ordered the buffalo wings. <mark>The General's Wings</mark> are like any other restaurant and not even the good ones at that. if your going to charge me $16 for wings, i expect to be blown away.\n\ndefinitely not worth spending your money here.\n\nwho am i? i'm a chef, food blogger and culinary historian.", 
            "service: took about 45 mins to get a table for 4 on sunday afternoon. they should implement a text/call back feature to let you know when your table is ready. our waiter was very nice and took time to explain some choices. he even gave us a sample of the fireball whiskey wing sauce. \n\nfood: we tried the fireball whiskey wings and they were amazing! <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were big and not too saucy. just right. they had a slight taste of the cinnamon but it wasn't overpowering. i ordered the bacon mac n cheese burger. it was so juicy and melted in your mouth. the mac n cheese alone was noting special but it was the right combination with the bacon and patty. my friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich. she loved the gooey yumminess. the bread was so warm and soft. the fries were too small for my usual portions but had a good seasoning and crispness. \n\nwe would definitely go back for the same order! just hope that next time the service is a little quicker and the ac isn't blasting cold air above my head.", 
            "this place is magnificent and i can't wait to go back!  loved <mark>The General's Wings</mark> and my burger with mac and cheese on it sent shivers down my spine.  great lemon drop martini as well with basil!", 
            "i am a huge fan and really wanted to love the food but it was just okay... my burger was a little dry, the fries were great and <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were really good.  service was a bit slow.", 
            "another stop on my list to eat at when we were in las vegas. i love gastropubs and guy fieri's menu made it stand out above the rest! a lot of the menu items were fusion inspired and i love how that takes it to another level of food experience. located at the linq hotel. decided to come around lunch time on a weekend. i did not expect such a wait for this place, but to me, a line is always a good thing regarding food. says something about the popularity of it in my experience and has never been wrong. waited roughly 30 minutes. but well worth the wait!\n\nfor appetizers, we ordered <mark>The General's Wings</mark>. general tso's chicken, but in wing form. like a sesame chicken wing fort those unfamiliar with general tso's chicken. the plate looked lovely and <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were very crispy, and amazingly good! the crunchy dipping sides of crushed wasabi peas, rice crackers and peanuts added a very enjoyable texture that paired excellently well with each bite! \n\nfor our entree, my girlfriend and i both ordered the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. all i can say is mouthwateringly delicious!! the idea of having mac and cheese on a burger was genius! <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> itself was juicy and worked very well with the garlic-buttered brioche bun. it was all presented lovely with the side of fries...4 different ways! \n\nwe wanted dessert, but were way to full to even have a bite! but will definitely save from for next time! highly recommend guy's!!", 
            "i have eaten/drank here a couple of times and been underwhelmed.  last time <mark>The General's Wings</mark> came out lukewarm.  i have included a picture of the ridiculous bloody mary i got last year which had more food than drink and tasted of barbeque sauce when i finally got to the cocktail.  however this restaurant will likely survive for a while based on the celebrity name and its location."

            "went on opening night, nervously anticipating the staff's performance. we were greeted at the door around 9pm and told there may be a wait of up to 2 hrs. they took our phone number to send us a text when our table was ready. only about 40 min later we got the text. so things were looking better already. \n\nthe staff was very attentive. we had a waiter and a backup the whole night. guy was there too. heard him give a great pep talk to the staff in the kitchen before he came around to the tables to see the guests. \n\non to the food...big portions. great takes on traditional stuff. we had the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>. 4 smaller tacos with fresh grilled tilapia, slaw radishes avocado slices , corn salsa and limes. excellent! served on unique wooden platters and chrome stands. awesome presentation. \n\nwe also got the famed macaroni and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. a piled high burger big enough for 2 with seasoned fries. while they didn't ask how well i wanted <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> done, it came out medium well to well. that's good for me. the mac and cheese addition was over the top. \n\na good beer selection of craft brews and the old standby, pbr. we didn't get any cocktails, but they all appeared to be original creations for this restaurant. \n\nreasonably priced. great service. fun environment. option of indoor or patio seating.  i think guy has another hit here.", 
            "i'm a fan of guy fieri, he's from vegas and i love his diners, drive-ins and dives so i was excited to try his new restaurant.  the place had a cool casual decor, wood and metal.  went on a n<mark>Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae</mark> for lunch.  we were seated after about a 20 minute wait.  we ordered our drinks and it came.  flagging a server was like trying to flag a taxi -- can't find one.  i don't know where our server disappeared to.  after that it took about an hour to get our appetizer which came with our sandwiches and tacos.  presentation was nice!  i ordered the big dip or whatever it was called -- i can't remember since it's best to forget how dry it was -- it needed au jus which i recommend on the side.  my son ordered the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>.  he said it was plain and not much flavor.  my other son ordered the blackened chicken sandwich or whatever it was again.  it was easy to forget because he said it was just ok.  the truffle fries were great, skinny cut and flavorful.  the server forgot my daughter's water.  she finally got it when our food was brought out.  service was 1 out of 10.  we ordered another appetizer which never came but were charged and also a beer that we didn't order.  when our server came to bring our check and i told him how bad the service was he started to argue with me and made excuses.  i don't want to hear they just opened 4 days ago.  apologize, give me a free soda or something for me to return!  which i won't.  did he come  to see how we were doing during the hour wait?  not!  the lunch experience left a bad taste.  we live in vegas and expect much more from a strip restaurant especially from guy fieri.",

            "terrible! we were so excited to try this place and all 3 of us were way underwhelmed. the server was nice and yet it still gets a 1 star. had the <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark> which was so gross, i couldn't stomach it. when my sister tried it her reaction was the same. how can you mess up <mark>Morgan's Gnarly Greek Salad</mark>? my husband and sister ordered the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> and they were so bland and boring that they both just kinda went, \"uh.\" we also tried the pepperoni wrapped pretzels that were super gross and the cheese sauce, while ok, was so salty when combined with the pretzels it was almost inedible. the fries appetizers were so tiny, thin cut, nasty and looked and tasted so cheap; and yet surprise, they were expensive!!! after spending $100 for lunch for 3 people (no liquor or desserts) we expected to really like at least one item but we were all very disappointed and didn't really care for any...and this is coming from the least picky eaters ever. way better places out there! try the social house if you happen to like japanese...it's way cheaper (don't let the fancy outside detour you) and all 6 of us were amazed at how good it was! another one we tried in vegas was goodwich. yes, it's a little scary on the outside and it's kind of a hot dog stand type set up that sells sandwiches but wow, amazing sandwiches!!! the 3 of us fell in love! do yourself a favor and try anywhere else but here.", 
            "i really wanted to like this place, but sadly it was a let down. the service was ok - mostly friendly staff (there are tons of them in very uncomfortable-looking uniforms), our food came out promptly... maybe a little too promptly. presentation was great, but it highly lacked in flavor. my <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> were bland - no spice factor at all - and when i asked for some hot sauce my choices were sriracha or tabasco. uh... what the hell? come on guy, you can do better than that. my buddy ordered chicken wings that were supposed to be \"so hot they should be illegal\", but they were not. bottom line: it's factory food for the masses with little to no finesse where it counts, which i suppose is perfect for that tourist trap area of vegas. guess i should have seen that coming.", 
            "had a quick bite to eat here last night and the food was good but it wasn't fantastic.  the service however was not good at all.  our server was shelby and she was not attentive in any way.  she did not ask if we have any questions about the menu nor did she offer to tell us her recommendations. we ordered 2 items from the menu and 2 beers.  i had the summer ale and the hubs had a lager.  she brought the beers out and mistakenly gave me my husband's.  i didn't know and i took a couple of sips before my husband realized it.  we ordered the whiskey spicy wings and the drunkun <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>, both were good but <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were not spicy. the server brought the food out, laid them on the table and disappeared.  it would be nice of her to offer a couple of plates...  we had to ask for it when she reappeared which was a while later. towards the end of the meal, she did ask us once how the food was but as soon as she asked the question, she looked away to check on the next table, never looking back at us for our response.  finally what i found to be the most rude is that she never thanked us for coming.  she handed me the bill without saying anything!!!  and the same thing when she handed me back my credit card and the slip.  i will come back to eat here but definitely hope another server would be taking care of me.", 
            "i had the mac n cheese burger, it was pretty much delicious! not much else to say apart from the taste profile was just about perfect! \ndownside? absolutely difficult to eat given how mahousive it was! also... it was huge. i chopped it in half. my friend had the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> which were described as 'mediocre'.... \n\nservice was far from adequate, we sat outside and our waters were not topped up fast enough, it was roasting! \n\nfinally... the manager wandered randomly to the table and asked how the meal was, here's the thing, he didn't identify himself and wasnt wearing anything remotely identifying him as an employee or a manager ... creepy.", 
            "i think the 4 star average review this place has is spot on.\n\ni enjoy fieri's (nee: ferry) show \"diner's drive-ins, and dives\" on the food network very much.  guy himself seems like kind of a d-bag but the places he visits are very interesting.\n\nbeing a d-bag from northern california, i suspect his own cuisine for his restaurants is firmly in the flingers (google office space) category: over-engineered snack food for fat/lazy/stupid people.\n\nnow, if you know this going in, it's not half bad.\n\nthe waitresses are done up in a denim skirt/dress thing and the waiters are in a similiar denim outfit.  ok i guess, but i prefer waitstaff to not be subject to a fixed  dress code unless i am at hooters.\n\ni got the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> and the truffle fries.  i could not finish the truffle fries, the bowl was huge.  the tacos were actually not bad, i could eat that regularly.  the fries weren't bad either, but i was on a business trip and eating alone.  to share, they would be perfect.\n\nto sum up, there's really nothing wrong with this place, assuming you are ok with average middle-america mall type food.  this will amaze you.\n\nit's a little hard to get to (unless you are staying at the quad); you have to negotiate your way to the self-parking (or take the tram) and then find your way back to the car afterwards.  \n\ni know it sounds like i'm dumping all over the place, but i did like it.  i would even go back and try something else out.  i bet it would be a blast with friends (kinda like a sports bar).  but haute cuisine it's not.  expect something better than your average tgi-fridays and you'll have a good time.\n\nanother plus is that it is open late (2am) which kept it on my \"list of places to try when i've been out all night and everything else is closed\".",

(i like how you could see the open kitchen when you're being seated.) \n\nthe menus were clipped to what seemed like oversized, thick clipboards. the menu  was simple and easily understood with a good amount of items. we started with drinks. \"lemon drop...not!\" for her and a firestone union jack ipa for me. i don't usually drink lemon drops (only when i try hers) but i have to say it was the best one i've had so far. we decided on the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>, <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> and the mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. \n\nthe <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> and <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> were served first. the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> were amazing! truffle chunks, truffle infused gouda and a creamy truffle sauce. bachi who? they don't skimp here! the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> were on another level. they consist of lightly grilled tequila-citrus tilapia, cabbage and avocado. then topped with radish and pickled ginger for a tasty combination. \n\nsoon after, <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> and mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> were heading to our table. <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> are a must try. the chinese minced chicken was on point. you also get three spring rolls and two thai style skewers. it's also a good way to be romantic, making your date lettuce wraps. just make sure your hands are washed! now onto <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. the six cheese mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> was bombdotcom. hands down one of the best burgers i've had. mac + cheese flowing over the thick applewood bacon all between a toasted garlic brioche bun. accompanied with a  combination of potato wedges, crisscut and regular fries. i was already full from finishing the previous dishes so i only ate half and have to pack the rest. next time i won't order as much so we could get dessert. \n\noverall the experience was fantastic! service was outstanding! food was amazing! i will be coming back again, and again.",

            "i have to say that this place was well worth the wait. my husband surprised me for our anniversary. the food was delish! we shared an order of <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> and they were.....uh-maze-zing! i ordered the drunkin <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> for my main course and can i say that i was not disappointed. the fish was tender and all the fixins complimented it very well. would definitely recommend to family and friends.", 
            "needs to be better with a brand like his. he has huge potential because of his television persona but the restaurant is essentially a typical casual dining with slightly better food.\n\nfood quality: tasty and interesting. had <mark>The General's Wings</mark> and <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>. wings are great but very small, were those quail wings? portions seem small for the price, my son had a burger said it was very good.\n\nservice: friendly but slow, bizarre disjointed room and table layout doesn't help. greeters are clueless, 30 minute wait was over an hour and that's after i complained. entrance is disappointing.\n\nambiance: poor, too dark, music is too low, table layout is terrible, too much empty space. uncomfortable, you can't see or feel the vibe.\n\nlocation: terrible for locals, ok if you are a first time vegas tourist otherwise for the foodie or smart vegas traveler it's a poor location.", 
            "visited guy's restaurant in the quad on sunday night.  we were seated right away on the patio.   our waitress was rehearsed and unnatural.  no recommendations made.  we had the lettuce wraps which were very good.  i ordered the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> which was a huge disappointment.  <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was dry and bigger than the bun....normally that's not a bad thing but in this case, <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was dry, flat and burnt.  i almost sent it back.  my friend got the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> which she said were just ok.   for the price and the name, i expected much more.  if it weren't for the lettuce rolls, this place would've gotten 2 stars.", 
            "this was a really flavorful experience from the iced tea through dessert. the bloody mary was excellent. the wonton sashimi taco appetizer was light yet packed full of flavor. the bbq was perfectly sweet and finger-lickin' good. the drunk <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> were good but a slight disappointment after the wonton taco appetizer. churros crispy and a good ending.", 
            "the best! so delish - sat our party of four quickly for a busy thursday night. had great <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> and <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark> with my hubby - <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were smothered in the greatest bbq sauce we've ever had, and the dipping sauce was so tasty. we ordered the cheesecake for dessert - so glad we shared! really great mix of sweet and salty. also, we loved the way all of the food was presented. great trays, plates, taco stands, etc. awesome!", 
            "i had the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> and my husband had the <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark>. we have had the same thing at chili's before for half price with half the wait for a table. the breadstick and fondue appetizer was off balance, way too much cheese left over and nothing to eat it with. the breadsticks were more like crackers wrapped in pepperoni. the only real highlight of the meal was an amazing bloody mary complete with candied bacon. other than that, i expected more from a \"celebrity\" chef. all hype and no real substance.", 
            "started off with the asian inspired <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark>. the springs rolls and the chicken skewers were good but the lettuce wrap wasn't that great. i've had better before.\n\ni got the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> as my entree, i originally saw the recommendations on the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> on yelp but was told they had removed the tacos from the menu. <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were flavorful, but i didn't love them. i would consider it more drumsticks then wings. \n\n<mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> was delicious and it came with 3 different types of fries. i don't think i will return for the food but our sever was great.", 
            "stayed at the linq and had two terrible experiences at this so called restaurant if you don't mind ridiculously loud obnoxious people and waiters and bartenders who completely ignore you then serve you overpriced food such as the ribs which were half fat while none of the online entrees were available then this is the place for you.   \n\ninstead of <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> you get for 15 bucks three teeny literally single bite sized appetizers. this place is a joke. stay away, save your money go somewhere else.", 
            "pretty darn good food. a little pricy; but hey; it is vegas. went with a party of 18 from work so we had a somewhat fixed menu. i had the macaroni and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. it was very good. excellent appetizers to include the mini <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>, pepperoni wrapped pretzel rods and french fries with a spicy dip. over all very tasty and i didn't have to pay the bill, so the price really didn't matter to me. i have been there twice now and there is always a line to get in.", 
            "the outdoor patio is a great place to people-watch outside the linq hotel and casino. i would recommend the desserts over anything else - the s'mores cake is amazing! the <mark>Quad Fries</mark> are flavorful but a little off. today i had a ceasar salad which was ok but was served on a giant cruton wheel (probably 5\" in diameter). seemed a bit wasteful since <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> also came with croutons...also, <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> had too much dressing. i got <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> last time and they were just ok and have since been removed from the menu. the menu seems to change frequently too. overall, giant portions, decent food, desserts are huge but blow you away!", 
            "i'm only giving two stars because the fries were good , they took the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> off the menu , they were out of the italian <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> , they were out of the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and they were out of the ribs , which was about 1/2 the menu , service was good and the food we got came out fast i guess because they don't have much other stuff to cook lol", 
            "decent. i was disappointed because the menu online is old and the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> weren't available (i'm a pescatarian) but the truffle fries were great! love the side sauce. my family enjoyed the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>, pork sandwich, and mac and cheese burger. waiter jeff was good, he recommended the paleo cattle drink."

            "watch out everyone guy fieri's back in town not as a unlv student but as a restaurateur! this time he's taking no prisoners -- well, no chefs -- because chefs bobby flay and gordon ramsay should be quivering and quaking in their boots because, by far, guy has the best burger in vegas, especially with the bbq bourbon sauce.\n\nmy wife, 11-year-old daughter, and i had an italian themed day in vegas. we  went to mob museum (daughter thought one of the mobsters looked like actor robert deniro), rode on a gondola at the venetian, went to a gun range, and topped it off by eating at the italian's place guy fieri, who is aka guido. \n\nwe started with the sashimi won-taco shareables. awesome. my daughter wanted more --- all of us did.then, my wife ordered the <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark>, i ordered a burger and my daughter ordered the pork sandwich. all were awesome.the mixture of the fries were great! though, i'd like a twist on the sauce, say, a kicked up dill dipping sauce for the fries along with the standard ketchup. (fryer tuck eatery in portland, or had that sauce years ago with their wedge-like fries)\n\nunfortunately, we had a problem. the dessert. my wife and i loved the <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> dessert creation but my daughter had an allergic reaction. we had asked the waitress if there were any tree nuts in the dessert. she checked. the kitchen told her no. (i wonder if peanut oil uses any tree nuts.)\n\nbut reaction was just like a reaction she had before with tree nuts. her lips became swollen, throat itchy and bumps on her head. (several hours past till she was okay again.)\n\nthe waitress immediately got the assistant manager involved. she was a super waitress, and he was a super man as a manager.\n\nhe went way above and beyond the call of duty --- he went to store across the way and purchased benadyrl for my daughter! \n\nwow, the assistant manager treated us as if we were guy, his wife lori and this had happened to one of guy's sons hunter or ryder.\n\nthe manager comped us the $90 bill too! \n\nwe left a nice tip for our waitress despite the incident because service and food were excellent.\n\nwe will definitely go back for not only the great food but the awesome customer service.\n\nby the way, guy seems so real and unpretentious like we're part of his family --- and now we witnessed how that attitude spilled over into the attitude of his staff.\n\nfinally, here's a big and heartfelt thank you to guy, his family and his wonderful staff for taking care of our daughter though it was an unfortunate incident, it made it more palatable for us even if was for the rest of the evening.\n\nwe wish guy, his family and his staff much success with the new \"guy fieri's vegas kitchen and bar\"!\n\nsee you next time we're in vegas! we will definitely be eating at \"flavortown\" again!\n\nby the way, italians, food, and casinos go well together. bada bing, cha ching! \n\nguido, you know what i'm sayin'?", 
            "was here on 4/26/14 with family and friends. this was my first and much anticipated visit to a guy fieri restaurant and it far exceeded my expectations!\n\nour waitress, michelle, was friendly, energetic and informative  she knew the menu very well (for only being open one week!) and was able to make great suggestions. \n\ni had the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> and the blue-sabi sauce they came with was off the charts. my main course was the pastrami burger that was amazing!!  even two of my sons, who are very picky eaters, were totally impressed with the bacon mac n cheese burger. my wife had the <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark> that she said were some of the best she's ever had!!!\n\nthe entire experience was awesome and i am already looking forward to our next visit!", 
            "great joint! i really enjoyed their food and their overall ambiance. the restaurant opened not too long ago so the wait for a table is ridiculous during the weekend and unfortunately they do not allow reservations. the restaurant decor is great and i love the employees uniforms, they are super cute! we ordered the macaroni and cheese burger and the <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark>! they were both great! the bread was soft, the meat very juicy and the overall flavor was exquisite. the only bad part was the taster flights.. for $35 you get 4oz tasting of 16 beers. the bad part is that the \"tasting\" included ordinary beers such as blue moon, pbr, miller light, sierra nevada well you get the idea.  who has not sampled those cheap beers before! i felt like it was a joke! the good part is that you get a t-shirt! i would totally recommend this place!", 
            "awesome rings with kicked up ketchup. husband had carne asada <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> and i had tatted up <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>. both were really good. burger was big and with shredded lettuce a bit messy, just saying. didn't stop me from eating it though. could only finish half with the rings. husband finished tacos (four small ones). service was friendly and timely. would go again.", 
            "yes!!!\n\nwelcome to flavortown!  if you are a ultra picky foodie this might not be the place for you.  however if you like real good food with even better service this is the place for you to go!\nfor an app our family of four had the nachos to share.  really tasty.  the cheese and topping to chip ratio is better than any other restaurant i have been to.  the flavors are spot on.  just enough spice to make it all really tasty.\nmains were the <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> (you got five small tacos with two dipping sauces), and the mac and cheese burger.  the <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> were really good and almost overstuffed the small tortillas.  <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was very good.  too bad i didn't see the mac and cheese as a dish or side.  i would have ordered it.  fries are also fantastic.  just enough of a spice to make them a little different.  warning <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> is messy.  you will get the napkin dirty.  \nservice was also really good, place has great food.  hopefully he branches this concept out to more than vegas.  i will be back!", 
            "what a great surprise! we live in vegas and normally don't go to the strip to eat. but this place does it right! \n\nstarted with the nachos. seriously delicious. and they pride themselves with zero \"naked nachos\". they hit the mark. \n\nhad the pulled pork and rock shrimp <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> for our main meal. great tasting. large portions. and to top it off, the fries that cd with the pulled pork are mixed! so you get waffle fries, steak fries, and skinny fries all together! bonus! \n\ncustomer service was great. prices were extremely reasonable (especially for a strip restaurant). \n\nhighly recommend making this a go-to place for any meal while you're in vegas!", 
            "we had the pleasure of eating here twice in the same day.  guy is the bomb, so we figured his joint would be, as well. \n\nthe restaraunt is very nice and the open kitchen rocks.  the wait staff was fun and attentative.  \n\nall of the decor, uniforms, menu and experience  totalled up to be very guyish.  dug it. \n\nour meals, however, were a bit up and down.  i'll describe each meal and dish seperately. \n\nlunch: \n\n2 people - 0 wait time\n\napp: \nultimate chicken wrap - this was very good.  consisted of a few small egg rolls, a few chicken skewers, and lettuce wraps with three sauces (spicy sweet/sour, soy, satay).  this was a great start to the meal. \n\nmeal: \n<mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>.  it is big and awesome.  great flavor. this comes with a medley of fries with a very good seasoning.  i, now, have a mission to find ancho bacon.  \n\nimpression: this was a great experience.  my wife and i loved our meal.  \n\ndinner: \n\n5 people - 20 minute wait time\n\napp: \nrojo rings:   both of these were brought out quickly.  the onion rings were good and crispy.  they had good seasoning on the batter and the sauce was great.   \n\nnachos del jefe: the nachos (holy batman!) were killer.  these little chips are a sublime mix of mild chorizo and cheese that bring flavortown down to it's knees praying.  they are that good.\n\nmeal:\n\n<mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>: friend had this and loved it.  \n\nvictors <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark>: very average and small.  the tortilla's weren't really prepped at all. friend stated that this was bland and needed more salsa. \n\n<mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>: this was were the rails came off.  this sandwich is an exact replica of the deli cowboy from jason's deli.  it is a very saucy pulled pork.  all you can taste is a bbq that i would expect any joe blow to be able to prep in their crock pot.  to make matters worse, the waitress stated that this sandwich was the absolute best thing on the menu.  i don't think the chick from vegas knows what real bbq should be.  when you have tp pay $20 bucks for it, it just makes you disappointed.  \n\ndessert: \n\n<mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>: this was ok.  it looks cool, but it came accross too greasy.  it is really big and all in all, too much grease and sweetness to eat all of it.... even for 5 of us sharing one dessert.  \n\ni would have marked this a 5 after lunch... but, a few pieces of the dinner made this a big dip.  that pulled pork sandwich should really, really be re-considered.", 
            "in vegas for my husband's birthday weekend and saw guy's new restaurant.  we decided to stop in for lunch since we are fans.  the place was clean and the service was great.  the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> were too die for!  i have to go again just to get them.  the victor chicken <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> were good but average.  they weren't special in any way. i can't wait to go back on our next trip.", 
            "went during 25th birthday weekend in vegas. heard good reviews and decided to give the place a try on my walk down the strip. bf got carne asada <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> and i got chicken. four tacos to a plate were about $16. it is the strip so i'm not surprised. the tacos were realllyyyy good especially with the sauces provided. i liked the chicken more than i did the carne. will definitely be back to try one of those huge burgers that passed me by!!", 
            "i am right on the cusp of a 4-star review, unfortunately the service we received knocked it down to a 3-star. \n\nwe went there on may 12th for my 30th birthday, this was my choice and i did not even complain when we had to wait 10-15min for an outdoor table when we could've been seated right away inside. the girls at the front were all wicked nice and greeted us right away and were helpful. there was a band playing next door so it did make conversation a little difficult but nothing too bad, and the people watching was the best part of being outside. \n\nthe food for the most part was delicious. i got a smoke & mirrors for my drink, which besides the giant pepper on the glass was delicious. for appetizers we got righteous rojo rings and <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, the sauce for the rings was awesome nice and spicy. the dippers were also wicked good, my mom started making them at home, just can't get the dip right! for my meal i got carne asada <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark>, which were okay. the filling was very good but the thing i did not like was that the tacos seemed to be wrapped with two soft taco shells which were really really really dry. the best part was the dessert, the <mark>Triple Doublemint Pie</mark>, which was shared amongst all four of us because it was definitely too large for one person.\n\nour server is what killed this whole experience. i am not sure where she kept on disappearing to but she brought our drinks and then ran off for almost 20min before taking any part of our order. then after our meal it took awhile before she even asked if we wanted to dessert (which i did, come on it was my birthday!). my mom did ask several times for a glass of water which she never brought over. she was more concerned with other tables around us with whom she could flirt with (apparently my husband and dad are unflirtable?), and we tip well as long as you pay attention and are a good server. \n\nall in all it was a great place and next time i am back in vegas i will definitely go back.", 
            "i really wanted to enjoy this place, but it failed me on so many different levels.  the initial problem was the long wait (approximately 1-1 1/2 hours). once we finally got seated the environment was very loud and hectic. it was hard to hear the rest if our party without yelling back and forth. the menu was very small and everything was very pricey for the quality of food they were serving. i ordered the mac and cheese burger and expected a lot of flavor, all i got was a mediocre burger that had some flavorless macaroni on top of it. my wife ordered the <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> and for $20 they brought out a few tiny tacos that didn't compare to a local taco shop that would give you 20 of them that were bigger, better, and full of flavor for the same price.  definitely another tourist trap with a celebrity name on it like many of the other ones on the strip.  won't be returning here sadly, but i'm sure many will ignore this review and try out the waters for themselves.", 
            "carne asada <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> were phenomenal and the service was excellent (great job, daniel b.). we had our food very quickly and everything was delicious.", 
            "we had the truffle fries, the victors <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> and the <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark>.  the fries were really good. the tacos are pretty small, but you get four, so that good.  the victors tacos were really good, but we didn't care for the carne asada. \n\nthe drinks were watered down but we weren't charged for them so no foul there.  our waiter was tripping on something. we had a good laugh all night watching this guy. he couldn't stay focused long enough to take or drink order.\n\nlook, we went into this knowing it is a \"gimmick\" joint that brings you in just because you saw this guy on t.v. and he told you where to get those really good donuts in texas should you ever be unfortunate enough to find yourself in texas.  also, we know that being on the strip we'd be paying a premium. if this were any other location i'd be ticked at the whole experience.\n\nthis place is as average as applebees and chili's.", 
            "the reason for two stars:\n\nfood- just ok, the easy things like fries, <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> and wings are good, you would have to be absolutely terrible to ruin things like these.\n<mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> have no flavor.\nservice - waited a very long time for a greeting by our server, ordered non alcoholic drinks that also took a very long time to arrive, and i even had to get up and try and find my server just to see if our party could place a food order.\nour party had a sense that our server was strongly pushing us to order alcoholic  drinks. \n\n\ni expected a lot more from this place based on the name. myself and my dining party were very disappointed. \n\nfood c\nservice d\natmosphere d \n\ni would not recommend.", 
            "this place has something for everyone. we went here twice during our vegas stay and i was pretty pleased with both meals. once was for a late night snack, the other lunch. \n\nfor the late night snack, we got the sashimi won-ton tacos. these were delicious and possibly one of the highlights of the menu! <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> were in the shape of taco shells and were perfect! super light and crispy. the filling was ahi tuna with a mango salsa- delicious! we ordered the fried ice cream dessert and i was pretty disappointed with the fried part- it was actually pretty soggy and instead of being crispy- it actually was more chewy- not what i had hoped for. it did come with a considerable amount of sides to top with it to make it your own- but i wouldn't order that one again. \n\nthe second meal we had here i tried the <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark>. you get 4 small tacos to an order, which is a good portion size. they were great and came with two salsa options. there was a good portion of steak in each of the tacos and a yummy cabbage slaw on top.  the quad hotel gave us a free coupon for <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>- so we tried those too--- think steak type fries meets buffalo wings. the bleu cheese dressing is pretty over whelming- i went for ranch instead. \n\noverall, the service is pretty good, the staff is welcoming and generally attentive. you even have the opportunity to do a digital survey (there's an i-touch in the bill folio) at the end of your meal to give feedback. the portion sizes can be pretty huge- make sure you go in hungry if you're ordering entrees!", 
            "this was a pleasant surprise.  the food is very good, but the ambiance is not conducive to a quiet relaxing lunch or dinner.  the place is loud and active....it is a place to party!  \n\nback to the food.  the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> are pepperoni-wrapped breadstick twists served alongside our smoky provolone + sausage cheese dip, topped with fresh tomato bruschetta.  they are delicious, even though it sounded strange to us.\n\nthe carne asada <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> are a winner too!  you get four tacos held upright in a metal rack.  there are different varieties but i chose the marinated skirt steak garnished with onions, cilantro and salsa [on the side].  generous portions for the price and the taste is both juicy and flavorful.\n\nreasonable prices given the portions and considering other vegas restaurants on the strip tend to be on the high side to begin with.", 
            "went here for lunch. there was no wait. had great beer and delicious food. our table had <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark>-great, <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>-amazing, and mac n cheese burger-delicious. we had <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> for dessert. you'll need to share this beast. the raspberry sauce is the perfect dip for this decadent dessert. service was good. the value is amazing for vegas strip! we spent less here than in the food court!  i highly recommend guy's restaurant!",

            "i hate to say this, but i have eaten meals at applebee's that were better than the two times i have been here.  we went yesterday and while i do enjoy the atmosphere, that is about it.  the first time we went a few months ago, we thought it was just okay too, but not bad enough to post a review, but also not good enough either.  the items we have tried thus far:\nfireball whiskey wings - not spicy at all, but i did like the lollipop style presentation.\n<mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark> - no flavor to the meat at all.  salsa bland as well.\nbbq burger -  way better and much cheaper at bobby's burger palace.\nbig dipper roast beef sandwich - no flavor at all!  no horseradish taste and the au jus tasted like canned beef broth.  also, horribly tough meat that tasted faintly like smoke and the bread hardened up immediately as if microwaved.\n\nboth the above had an assortment of differen<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> tossed together that would have been good had they not tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp.\n\nnow mind you, nothing at all between the meats and the fries on both visits tasted like they had been hit with any seasoning at all. i am very surprised at the bland fast food quality for the prices they charge.  guy always seems to be about flavor and nothing has it!!  i am a local and love his shows, which is why i gave him a second chance to begin with.  the restaurant seems to be about style only, not food and not service.\n\nnow, add to the fact that we had a snarky wannabe comedian for a waiter, who only came back to see if we wanted another drink after my husband was already done! will not be back!!", 
            "very good food.  great service.   we sat at the bar and had a great lunch.  the asian wings were some of the best i have ever had.  bloody marts looked good.... but didn't have one.  tasty <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark> too!!!", 
            "1. this place treats locals amazingly well. we faced a 25 minute wait, yet when we first talked to the hostess and mentioned we were locals here for a birthday she accommodated us and we were at a table in 5 minutes. \n\n2. our waiter was awesome. (hey management, greg was a killer guy and one of the best waiters i've ever had)\n\n3. food was beyond delicious. i had the <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark> and they blew out any tacos if ever had at a restaurant. tortillas were especially good. i tried the bbq chicken wings, and the bbq sauce is extreme unique but equally delicious. \n\nwould recommend for anyone looking for dinner at the linq, nice job fieri", 
            "we all love guy fieri and were excited to see his restaurant in the nearby quad. we arrived at 11am (just missed breakfast darn it) and were seated quickly. the restaurant does not have a kids menu, but our awesome waiter made sure our toddler was fed. he was good enough to check with the kitchen and we were able to order her a side of chicken and avocado. our 14 month old loved it! we ordered the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark>, tatted up turkey burder, <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>, and <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark>. all the entrees were delicious. our waiter was great and the hostesses were friendly and gorgeous. we all had an amazing experience and will be returning.", 
            "the ambiance and location are great. unfortunately those are  the only good qualities. the service is slower than one would expect at a four star reviewed restaurant. at times you feel as if you were forgotten  and no one at anytime came to check if the food was ok. the food it's self would be fine if served separately but the mac and cheese burger was an overload of flavors that would have taste the same if served after being in a blender. i have a funny feeling that the cooks are chain smokers as all of the food is way over salted. we also ordered the <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> that taste fine but was cold. by the expressions on the staffs faces it looks like a miserable place to work....not one of them were smiling! very disappointing.", 
            "this place was great! the staff are very friendly and attentive.  i ate the carne asada <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark>. they weren't the best <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> that i have had but they were alright. all of the food was plated beautifully.", 
            "excellent meal. great service. our server, greg, was really patient, helpful, and was there when we needed him. the manager stopped by and she was real friendly and easy going. my group ate the various <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> and loved them! another had <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> and was happy the rest of the evening. i recommend checking it out when you have a chance.",

            "we are fans of guy's and when we saw his restaurant on the strip we wanted to try it. it was a sunday a night and it was fairly busy. we didn't wait very long for a table.  our server came over and she was very friendly.  she asked if we had any question and took our drink orders. \nmy husband order the mac and cheese burger. and i ordered the <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark>.  our food came and it was good.  nothing overly special.  the services was excellent.  our server really made our experience great.  the resturant had an overall touristy feel but but that is expected being on the vegas strip. we would visit this restaurant again."

            "i wanted to really like this place because the food looks amazing but it was just okay. the portions are also enormous and i normally wouldn't mind but i feel bad for wasting when the food just isn't that great! first off, the atmosphere is really fun and lively and our waiter was friendly. we came as a party of 5 and we had no wait going at 11pm on a sunday. our drinks were kept full and our food arrived in a timely manner. \n\n<mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> $13- pretty good flavor and their cheese sauce had a nice tang to it.\n\nmac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> $17- pretty dry and over cooked :( also nothing really popped in flavor, it was kind of under-seasoned. for how tall the whole burger was, the beef was probably only 1/4 an inch thick at most. i picked at the mac & cheese and that by itself was pretty bland. one thing i really liked was that your $17 burger comes with fries, you don't have to order it a la carte like most burger places on the strip. however, the fries were pretty stale and too crunchy, but wayy too seasoning! also, the serving board it comes on is ridiculous. it looks really nice but it's way too small, three of us that got burgers asked for extra plates otherwise it would end up on our laps.\n\noff da' hook burger $16- i didn't try this one but boyfriend basically said the same thing i said about the mac & cheese burger.\n\n<mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark> $17- i didn't try these as well but my friend said she really liked them even though she took all the toppings off lol.\n\n<mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> $10- this thing was rock hard!!!! i had to use my burger knife to cut through it and i could barely taste the chocolate and marshmallow :( way overfried. the raspberry dipping sauce it came with was really good so it saved it from being a complete fail. \n\n<mark>Guy's Cheesecake Challenge</mark> $12- another huge portion of eh. cheesecake tasted like something i could buy at smiths or albertsons. impressive looking but not impressive in flavor.\n\nmaybe it was an off night of everything being overcooked but overall, another case of where food looks way better than it tastes. $175 worth of mediocre food. the price isn't the issue since the portions are huge and comparable to other burger joints on the strip but the quality of flavor just wasn't there. i still think gordon ramsey's burgr and holsteins are my favorite. i would even prefer bachi burger.  my boyfriend and i didn't care for it, maybe we are spoiled here in vegas? but the other three that were visiting from solvang, ca really loved it. so idk...try it for yourself i guess!", 
            "it was ok.  i got the mac n cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> which was super messy and hard to eat! i knife and fork'ed it :p i liked the outer well-done edges of the patty (i like well-done burgers) and any bite with bacon. the rest was \"eh.\" it came with fries that tasted like barbecue chips - and i'm not much of a barbecue chips kind of person :/ my dining companion ordered their <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark> which she finished. either she was very hungry or she really liked them :p the portion wasn't huge though.\n\nwe got there sometime after 11am and it wasn't too busy, but it started to fill up soon after. we sat outside where it was sort of shady, sort of not, depending on where you sat. we had the outermost seating which got a little bit of sun so it felt quite hot at times in that 100 degree heat! plus it was a bit smoky as it's so close to the quad's open-air casino entrance. oh, and tables were packed kind of close together. but i love outdoor seating on the strip so i dealt with it all :)\n\nservice was pretty good. we received proper greetings upon entrance and exit, and we never had to wait too long for anything. a manager even came by to see how things were going, and we were given a survey to fill out at the end of our meal. so clearly they are aiming to please their customers, which is good.\n\noverall, food was just ok and service above average. three stars for you, guy fieri.", 
            "on our one-week vacation to vegas, we visited guy's restaurant twice...i'd say we liked it ;) the first time we went around dinner time so we had to sit outside in the vegas heat, but the food made up for it! we started with the <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark>. these must have been our favorite thing we ate in vegas. the raw tuna with the crispy shell were the perfect combo. we then moved on to the original smash burger and mac and cheese burger. they were both huge and great. also came with a side of fries (i really recommend they write this on the menu because we didn't think we were getting any and were thinking of ordering a separate side). the seasoning on the fries was so good. it had a spicy kick with a hint of sweetness. the cocktails are also great. they are so different that the waiter had to explain them all to me to get a sense of what i was ordering. \n\nour second trip, we had nick l for lunch. he is the best server, so ask for him! he gave us great recommendations and was spot on. this time we tried the <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark> and <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>. again, great. prices are also unbeatable, especially on the strip. i highly recommend this spot for lunch or dinner, burgers or wings.", 
            "i ate the <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark> which were very good and i will order again. my boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese burger. i want a huge fan of that one and would not order again but it's a popular one. it might just be my tastebuds that couldn't appreciate <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. the next day we  went back for dessert. we tried the <mark>Mexican Churros</mark>. i was honestly pretty disappointed. i was really hoping for the best churros ever. instead i got long pieces of over fried dough that was too crunchy and just fell apart. next time i'll try something different. over all, i love guy fieri and loved his restaurant. oh....almost forgot! you must try the fries. i they're the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>. not sure but they have a white cream on the side and i think they are covered in parmesan and parsley. absolutely delicious!",

            "bad service. sat for 20 minutes unattended.   then the bartender poured extra fake lime juice in the fish bowl- expensive cocktail - as they did not measure the drink correctly and even added ice on the top to make it look  \" full\". all the food was salty. <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> and <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark>- how to you make a salad salty!!?? last, asked server for additional side sauce and he went directly to the bar area and did nothing. even came back to ask of we needed anything but i decided to give up at that point and just write a review to save others from coming here to spend  money. bad food bad service.", 
            "the food was phenomenal!! hats off to the chef!!! our waiter did a superb. job!! i had the big dipper  sandwich and my husband had the <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark>. we can't wait to go back and try a new dish! oh did i mention the <mark>Guy's Cheesecake Challenge</mark>,  <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>, and the <mark>Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae</mark> were over the top!! our table shared the guy-italian <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, righteous rojo rings and the best ever <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark> and we can't wait to try the other two sharables on the menu!! great time and superior food!!", 
            "i really wanted to like this place but the service was terrible from the get go!! first when we walked in the hostess asked us how many we said 2 and she looked out the window at all the open seats and stared at it like they were busy!! \nafter we got seated we waited for 15 min for someone to come to our table, when the waiter finally came he took our food and drink order. i ordered <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> with pastrami on it, it was ok but not worth $20 my daughter ordered the <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark> which was ok.\nthe food came we ate at the end of our meal our 2 arnold palmers finally came and when i told the girl i was done eating and didnt want it she rolled her eyes at me and said gah you dont want it? she then ran over to our waiter and pointed us out, the waiter brought our bill with the 2 drinks on the bill still and said dont worry i will take it off but he left the bill there. i questioned him and he said dont worry i will take it off, just minus the $8 yourself which i did, hopefully he minused it because there was no tip on there if he didnt!! i feel sad because i really wanted to like the place sadly i will not ever go back there!", 
            "actual rating 3.75 stars.\ni had some friends in town and wanted to give this place another chance.  \ni was feeling adventurous and tried the smoke and mirrors.fireball cinnamon whisky, fresh lemon juice, apple & cherry juice dash of lagavulin single malt\ni really enjoyed this drink.  \nfor food starters we split the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, crisp breadsticks wrapped with pepperoni and an amazing provolone and sausage cheese dip. the breadsticks were forgettable but the dip was fantastic.  we took the manager's advice and kept the dip for our fries later.\nfor my entree i went with the 67 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark>. from the menu \" this one packs a punch! it's crammed with blackened chicken, andouille sausage, cheddar cheese, the creole trinity + louisiana hot sauce.\"\ni got the hot sauce on the side.  the chicken, sausage and cheese were excellent.  i was a bit disappointed with the hot sauce as it tasted more buffalo than cajun but because i had it on the side, i was able to dip into the provolone dip.  the bread was a little chewy and didn't add anything to the dish but didn't hurt it either.\n\nwhat struck me about this visit was the <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark> that were skimpy and bland the first time we came were smothered in shrimp this time.  my friend enjoyed them.  the mac and cheese burger was also a hit with my other dining mate.\n\nthe fries remain the hit though and i still get a kick out of the differen<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> mixed together.  \n\nfor desert we had the smores.  a <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> style desert that rocked.  we couldn't finish it between the three of us because we were stuffed.\n\nfinally, i commend the service again.  colie (sp?) was an excellent waitress with a sharp wit and happy to make suggestions.  colie really took this up to the fourth star.  \n\nwe also got to meet chef kyle and the managers and i am really impressed with their commitment to the restaurant's success and desire for it to stand on its own.  \n\ntry it for yourself, it has a lot to offer!", 
            "i had the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> and my husband had the <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark>. we have had the same thing at chili's before for half price with half the wait for a table. the breadstick and fondue appetizer was off balance, way too much cheese left over and nothing to eat it with. the breadsticks were more like crackers wrapped in pepperoni. the only real highlight of the meal was an amazing bloody mary complete with candied bacon. other than that, i expected more from a \"celebrity\" chef. all hype and no real substance."

            "went on opening night, nervously anticipating the staff's performance. we were greeted at the door around 9pm and told there may be a wait of up to 2 hrs. they took our phone number to send us a text when our table was ready. only about 40 min later we got the text. so things were looking better already. \n\nthe staff was very attentive. we had a waiter and a backup the whole night. guy was there too. heard him give a great pep talk to the staff in the kitchen before he came around to the tables to see the guests. \n\non to the food...big portions. great takes on traditional stuff. we had the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>. 4 smaller tacos with fresh grilled tilapia, slaw radishes avocado slices , corn salsa and limes. excellent! served on unique wooden platters and chrome stands. awesome presentation. \n\nwe also got the famed macaroni and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. a piled high burger big enough for 2 with seasoned fries. while they didn't ask how well i wanted <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> done, it came out medium well to well. that's good for me. the mac and cheese addition was over the top. \n\na good beer selection of craft brews and the old standby, pbr. we didn't get any cocktails, but they all appeared to be original creations for this restaurant. \n\nreasonably priced. great service. fun environment. option of indoor or patio seating.  i think guy has another hit here.",

            "i'm a huge fan of ddd and guy fieri, so i was excited to try the newest addition to the quad resort and casino. \n\nfood: the menu is pretty much your regular burgers, tacos, wings but definitely with a gourmet twist. we went with the mac and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. we originally had it cut in half to share, but it was crazy messy. the patty is pretty thin but super wide...way wider than the bun. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> itself was really tasty, complete with the gooey mac and cheese and crispy bacon. i really liked the fries that was served with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. there were different types: curly, ridged, wedges, and i'm sure i found a regular fry in there as well. we also ordered the triple-<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> which was just as it was described: truffle+truffle+more truffle! loved the truffle flavor and the shoestring style fries. we didn't get to really try anything else because we were so full, but i definitely want to try their cocktails and dessert next time.\n\nambiance: alan l. described it perfectly: ed hardy-themed. and an extra touch of rocker style. the indoor seating area seemed a little small, but i would recommend sitting outdoors. the outdoor seating area sits right next to the walkway between the quad and harrah's. you definitely get a good view of people walking right by. hopefully they see your meal and suddenly get a craving for some good burgers. \n\nservice: the staff was fantastic! our servers were attentive and helpful. we did have to wait for our food but the restaurant was about a week old and they were pretty busy that day. \n\ntips: try out this place if you're wanting an overall good dining experience on the strip. and definitely opt for outdoor seating!",

            "my wife and i intended to go to a different restaurant at the same hotel, but the wait was too long. we checked out the menu and thought we'd give it a shot.  i suspect this place catches a lot of overflow, although it was not very busy when we went. \n\nimmediately upon entering you're greeted by a thirty foot guy fieri picture whose eyes tend to follow you, no matter where you go. occasionally throughout the meal i made awkward eye contact with guy. i felt judged. seriously, it was a little weird.\n\nservice: three different servers asked us if we wanted drinks, which is better than no servers asking if you want drinks, but a little bothersome. water glasses remained full and $12 mimosa and bloody mary were ok. service was attentive overall, but didn't take our app plate when the entrees came, making it a bit crowded at the table. \n\nfood: for an appetizer we had the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>. the cheese sauce was decent, but the breadsticks were more difficult to manage than food should be. long, dry breadsticks wrapped in pepperoni and dusted with parmesan cheese. i don't know if they put them in the oven or what, but they were lukewarm and broke easily. kind of messy. \n\nmy wife had a caesar salad and the dressing was not good, way too much cheese, and bland overall. it came with something called the \"mega crouton\" which looked like a bread boomerang.  no joke. she could barely eat any of it. $17 caesar salad failure.  \n\ni had the mayor of flavor town burger, or something like that. it had pastrami on <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> with asian slaw in a pretzel bun. came with a fry medley. this is not the kind <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> you can pick up and eat, which was what i was hoping for. if you're dressed nice and away from your hotel, handle with extreme caution. i ended up dismantling it with a fork and knife, but it still wasn't anything special. the fries were good. \n\nwe noticed some other diners having trouble with sandwiches, and i felt a little guilty when i didn't warn the table next to us when they placed their order for burgers.  we found humor in some of the decor and staff uniforms, and had a pretty good time despite the food, but your $95 with tip would be better spent elsewhere. i debated paying with cash so there would be no record we ever went there.",

            "i wanted to update my review because the manager messaged me on yelp inviting me back to the restaurant. i appreciate the fact that they are concerned with their customers feedback. hopefully they will use the customer feedback and implement the necessary changes that should be made. they could start with either lowering their menu prices or purchasing higher quality product. i don't mind paying top dollar for top quality, but that is not what is offered here. i am not looking for a free meal. i just give honest feedback to inform other consumers. so, i want to be clear about why i gave them two stars on my review.\n\ni would give them five stars if the review was just based on their staff. the service was excellent. the staff is very friendly and attentive to the customers, as demonstrated by the manager showing concern about my review. the kitchen staff did a fine job on the preparation and the presentation of the food. i was disappointed with the quality of the product used in the perpetration. the prime rib in <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> and the meat in <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> were not up to par. the chicken wings were average at best and extremely over priced for what you are served. personally, i don't care for some of the flavor combinations on the menu.\n\ni want to be very clear about the fact that the kitchen staff cooked the food properly and presented it as they were supposed to. it was the quality of the product i gave two stats to, not the service or the preparation.\n\ni think my expectations of the food before i arrived led me to be so disappointed with the food. it is just average food though. it was not a bad meal and none of the food tasted bad. if the prices were not so high, i may have given them three stats. it is just not worth the money. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are definitely not up to par with the likes of lbs, bacchi burger, and gordon ramsay burger. i would even say smash burger and fat burger serves better tasting burgers.\n\nto be fair, i will conclude by suggesting that you give them a try and make your own decision on the quality and taste of the menu items.",

            "this was hands down the best place i have ever eaten!  i was not disappointed in any way here. \n\nthe restaurant:  the atmosphere is very fun and very much like guy.  the staff is dressed in denim outfits with leather like vests/aprons.  the tables, silverware and layout have a modern industrial type feeling.  the kitchen is very open to the restaurant so you can just look in and see exactly what's going on in there (a well oiled machine).  there is also a mini shop in the front to buy various things from him and the restaurant.  we ended up buying one of the bandana like napkin towels that are on the table.\n\nthe food:  this was the best food i've had in a long time!  certainly the best on the strip.  in any price class.  it came out very fast and was presented extremely well.  the fries are a mix of all types and seasoned to perfection.  <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are moist and flavorful.  try the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> and you won't want anything else.  the pulled pork was so good and on a pretzel bun it was over the top.  the drink selection was awesome and they had a little something for whatever you're looking for.\n\noverall:  extremely pleased at my whole experience at this eatery.  i went straight to flavor town and never looked back.  go and enjoy yourself!",

(i like how you could see the open kitchen when you're being seated.) \n\nthe menus were clipped to what seemed like oversized, thick clipboards. the menu  was simple and easily understood with a good amount of items. we started with drinks. \"lemon drop...not!\" for her and a firestone union jack ipa for me. i don't usually drink lemon drops (only when i try hers) but i have to say it was the best one i've had so far. we decided on the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>, <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> and the mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. \n\nthe <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> and <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> were served first. the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> were amazing! truffle chunks, truffle infused gouda and a creamy truffle sauce. bachi who? they don't skimp here! the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> were on another level. they consist of lightly grilled tequila-citrus tilapia, cabbage and avocado. then topped with radish and pickled ginger for a tasty combination. \n\nsoon after, <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> and mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> were heading to our table. <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> are a must try. the chinese minced chicken was on point. you also get three spring rolls and two thai style skewers. it's also a good way to be romantic, making your date lettuce wraps. just make sure your hands are washed! now onto <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. the six cheese mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> was bombdotcom. hands down one of the best burgers i've had. mac + cheese flowing over the thick applewood bacon all between a toasted garlic brioche bun. accompanied with a  combination of potato wedges, crisscut and regular fries. i was already full from finishing the previous dishes so i only ate half and have to pack the rest. next time i won't order as much so we could get dessert. \n\noverall the experience was fantastic! service was outstanding! food was amazing! i will be coming back again, and again.",

            "i recently found out that my favorite chef have opened up a restaurant in las vegas. i told the hubby we have to go. the restaurant is located at the quad hotel. the atmosphere in the restaurant was very upbeat very live and your hostess greet you right on the spot. it was packed for friday night which is normal for any restaurant. we waited about 15 minutes. we sat outside near the strip so we can see the people walking up and down the street. our server chris was funny as hell. he made our first time coming here very fun and he also recommended some items on the menu. the first thing i got was a shot of fireball whiskey. next the hubby and i decided what we were going to get. he got the off the hook burger. i got <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark>. we got our food the presentation was good. all <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> come with fries and its just not one set of fri you have a mixture of fries there are crinkle cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> criss cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> and steak fries all mixed together in a small dish. they are seasoned with this dry barbecue rub that is so good especially when you dip the fries and ranch. not to mention that the ranch is homemade which is really good. the hubby and i could not even finish our burgers they were so big and so good. we said we would definitely be back because we want to try the tacos that he has on the menu. this would definitely be a place that i go too when i go to vegas.", 
            "i love guy's new restaurant in vegas at the quad resort and casino. it has a high energy atmosphere with unbelievable food options. you can choose to sit inside or outside on their large patio. the service is top notch, including a manager walking around making sure everyone is enjoying their food and overall experience. \n\nthe menu included things like burgers, wings, and tacos. their entrees are large portions so you can easily share. we started out with the righteous onion rings. the sauce served with this is outstanding. then for my main meal i shared <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. this was the best burger i have ever put in my mouth. the size alone is outstanding. it has a blanket of seasoned pastrami and swiss with a seed slaw and dill pickles served with a pretzel bun. this made me very happy! i tried a bite if my sons <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. i can't believe he almost ate the whole thing. it is so massive and delicious. \n\nyou will leave very full and completely satisfied. they also have a great variety of about 16 craft beers and wine from sonoma county. this is a must try if you are in las vegas.",

(who knew).  there are tons of other choices but why venture beyond <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.  and best yet...we don't have to wait a year for our next carnival cruise to get our guy burger fix!",

            "met up with some friends and headed here for the first time. hearing a lot of buzz about the bacon mac n cheese burger, it was something that i was gonna try first time out. so me and the lady both got the bacon mac n cheese burger, the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, and the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>. let's start with the sides. the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> was great, it was very flavorful, the fondue was light and cheesy.  the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> were great! i would say one of the top truffle fries i have tried. definitely a thing to try when coming here. now here's the thing with the bacon mac n cheese burger, i read that it was one of guy fieri's award winning burgers. the bacon was cooked great and tasted great. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was also tasty and cooked and seasoned well. now the mac n cheese was a huge let down, <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> is complex and has so much flavors in the bacon and <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> seasoned to perfection, then you put mac n cheese that has been sitting under a heat lamp, dried out, clumpy and very bland on it and it just about ruins it. as great as everything else was on <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>, the mac n cheese just brought <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> down. i dont mind paying $20 for a burger as i love food and trying new things. i just dont understand why the short cut?? i know time is pressed and everything needs to be done as quickly as possible, but when quality gets sacrificed things need to be reevaluated. also <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> does come with fries (a mixture of crinkle cut, straw fries, waffle fries, and chips???) but you cannot substitute the fries that come with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> for the likes of the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, forcing you to buy an entire order if you wanted. although the fries are a huge order and i was glad i got them maybe having the option to substitute the region fries that come with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> for them would be a good idea. so for around $75 for me and my lady it was expensive but in my opinion didn't live up to the hype. sadly the only way i would ever get the bacon mac n cheese burger would be if guy himself made it to his standards and maybe then it will be the great burger that it is claimed to be.", 
            "i love guy and triple d so i reallllllly wanted to love this place, but unfortunately i was disappointed.\n\ni'm short, my experience was over priced and sub par.\n\nat around 2pm on a friday, there was quite a wait to sit inside, but immediate seating on the patio. we opted for the latter. the restaurant couldn't control the weather, but some misters out there would be nice.\n\nthe waiter took some time to get to us, which was particularly odd since there were only a couple tables seated outside. we ordered water and he had to come by twice to say our drinks were on the way... -_-\n\nwe passed on any appetizers as we found that section to be a little lacking. actually, i expected more from the entire menu.\n\ni ordered the cajun chicken sandwich and my fianc\\u00e9 ordered the signature mac and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. we both finished our waters and didn't have a refill until after our food arrived. \n\nmy <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark> tasted like the chicken had been pre cooked and then reheated with the vegetables and seasonings separately. the cheese was melted into the roll and then the filling placed on top. when it arrived, the cheese had hardened again-as if it had been waiting under a heat lamp for some time after being cooked. i asked for a side if ranch, and wouldn't you know...i finished half my food before it arrived.\n\nthe \"signature\" burger wasn't all that much better. first, they need to use a different bun. it fell apart immediately. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> itself was dry, overlooked, and under seasoned. i think they hoped all the other toppings would mask that. unfortunately, the mac and cheese was bland. the blue box at home would have left this stuff in the dust. the bacon was carelessly placed and hanging off the side  when it came.\n\ni will say the fries were good. a combination of curly, shoestring, crinkle cut, and waffle fries with some bbq cheddar kind of seasoning.\n\nit seemed like everything on the menu was $20. we passed on the disappointment of ordering a desert and chalked this experience up to something we could say we've done. :/",

            "the pepperoni breadstick fondue was amazing and so we're the drinks i had. the mac and cheese burger was not as outstanding as i would have expected especially since it claimed to win some kind of award. and at nearly $20 for <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> alone, it was pretty pricey. all in all, i'd come back for the apps and drinks, but that's about it.", 
            "had the mac and cheese burger and awesome <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>.  loved the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> and more mac and cheese on <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> please.  super server alex!!!", 
            "excellent meal. great service. our server, greg, was really patient, helpful, and was there when we needed him. the manager stopped by and she was real friendly and easy going. my group ate the various <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> and loved them! another had <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> and was happy the rest of the evening. i recommend checking it out when you have a chance.", 
            "skip the tacos....get <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.\n\nfirst i have to say that i am a huge guy fieri fan so was very excited to eat at one of his restaurants...that being said, i should have waited to make it to california before i ate at one of his restaurants... \n\nfrom the start it was an awkward place to go, when we went to put our name in to be seated our name were not taken and we were told that we could wait in the seats around the corner out of the hostesses view.  we sat there for a second then opted to stand in the tiny waiting area as we were not confident she would remember that we were there.  \n\nwe were escorted to our table and given very awkward planks of wood with the menu items on it (in the style of a clipboard).   once we decided on what we wanted we waited...and waited...and waited for our server.  when he got there we both ordered the tacos (the chicken and steak respectively).  i was impressed by <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> so i didn't think about taco size.  \n\nwhen they arrived i was floored - for $16 i got 4 small tacos....appetizer size!.  i looked in disbelieve at my tacos compared to <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.  i wasn't expecting huge tacos but the were so small that i asked if maybe we accidentally got the kids size tacos.  nope those were the adult tacos.   \n\nhad i known that i would have skipped guy's totally and gone to bobby burger palace.. not really worth it...even in las vegas",

            "so my husband and i went on a date night, and my friend said we had to try guy's restaurant so we decided we would. there was no wait when we got there on a saturday night around 9:30pm. it was a cool setting. i liked the decorations and the menus, however it was a bit cramped. the waiter was friendly and took our drink order, we like to order appetizers, but the selection was very limited so we just decided to order our dinners. we both ordered the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> which also comes with fries. it took about 20-30 minutes for our food to come so it wasn't too long of a wait. i was super excited to try this burger, recommended by the hostess. i was not impressed. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was a good size but for being a <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> you could hardly taste any cheese. i was a little disappointed. it was cool they <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> came with a side of 4 different types of fries, however they were coated with seasoning making them really hard to eat. all i tasted when i ate them was the chili pepper salt mix that was covering them. i love food network and guy's show, but i was sadly disappointed with the quality of the food. i thought for $20 i would get a little better burger than it was. most likely won't go back, which i'm sad about because i was so excited to try it.",

            "good food, good atmosphere, but a little disappointing. \n\nhaving watched guy's show, i was excited to eat here. i even remember cheering for him on his initial appearance on a food network amateur cooking competition show. and then i read about his menu...i was looking so forward to the mac & cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> thinking it sounded as good as it could get. \n\ni arrived with 8 friends and it took about an hour and a half for a table to open. the interesting thing is that while i sat at the bar waiting, there were more than several empty tables around. \n\nwhen we sat down, the waiter was friendly and delivered our menus then literally disappeared for 20mins. after our orders were placed, the appetizers arrived promptly. i had the fondue dipper....breadsticks, wrapped in pepperoni, with a bowl of chews to dip them in, truly a guy's heaven. the food was gobbled up and we sat waiting. so we ran down the waiter and ordered another round of drinks, and we waited. (there seems to be a theme here). the drinks came, we kept talking and drinking and waiting for our food. when it came, it looked incredible. it was presented very well. \n\ni launched into my burger with gusto expecting to be astounded...and i got only \"meh\". such a shame! i so wanted that burger to be the end all. it was good, just not great. but it was huge! a couple could split this and still take some home. \n\nand then the bill came. i had a beer, a burger, a coke, and an appetizer...$56. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> alone was $20. \n\nall in all it was decent. and i loved the super open kitchen they have so you can watch them at work. maybe the public view keeps the cooks from adding the magic because the food, although good, was uninspiring. then add in the price (given its on the strip and has strip prices), i don't think i'll return - there are plenty of other awesome good burgers in vegas.",

            "it is so hard to review things in vegas because i feel like you have to judge them differently than you would other places.  everything is expensive and vegasy so you have to rate them based on other vegasy places.  so i must give guy fieri an average rating.  the food was good but not great and if i am paying vegas prices i want high vegas quality food.  \n\nthe restaurant is pretty small so if you don't have a reservation you will probably have to wait during peak times.  we arrived and were told it would be a 45 minute wait so we put our name down and then stacked out a place at the bar and were able to claim bar seating in about 5 minutes.  the service from behind the bar was very good, fast but not bothersome.  the specialty drinks ok but small for the price.  \n\ni had the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and it was better than most i have had at restaurants but still not as good as the one my husband makes at home.  i did find it funny that they put bacon on a <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> but hey that was fine with me.  i liked that the pretzel bun was good and soft like i prefer.  i also liked the fries that came with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.  they give you all sorts of different ones all together and they were all good.",

            "food: \n-the motley q burger was awesome. if you love bbq, it's the best burger on the menu to fulfill your tastebuds. \n-the bacon mac & cheese burger was good too. i think it can totally lose the shredded lettuce. it's just way too much for that kind of savory burger. \n-the fries that come with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> and sandwiches were bomb. i love that they were mixed and matched with waffle & shoestring and whatnot. \n-caesar salad was basic, fresh and delightful. i didn't care too much for the big crouton that was holding everything up. too stale. \n\nservice: \nelizabeth was nice, knew the menu but there were a couple of times when my guest request was brushed aside and it lagged too much. we asked for salt and pepper with our caesar and we didn't get it till we were 3/4 of the way done with our caesar... we're not fast eaters. \ngreeters were not upbeat and did not even seem like they wanted to be there. \n\noverall the whole reason why i'm giving this a 3 star rating is because of the cleanliness. my glasses were super dirty. i talked to a manager and said what was wrong, he wasn't defensive but just said that there's something wrong with the water and chemicals.. sure. i agree with you but a simple polishing of glasses so i don't think it's dirty would be so much better for my perception. polishing doesn't take a long time especially since it's just the rim.\nalso, the table and booth were dirty and wet upon seating. seriously? doesn't take much to clean it up. \n\n\n\nfood was alright, nothing knocked my socks off, service was mediocre, cleanliness was what made it a meh experience.",

            "guy fieri's in las vegas is exactly as guy's show is on the food network, big burgers and lots of fries. the interior is indicative of his style with the clipboard menu and the wood planks that hold the drinks menu. our server, brittany provided great service. the kitchen is an open design where you can see what all of the line cooks are doing inside.\n\nfor two, we ordered the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> (truffles), the bacon mac n cheese burger, and <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark>. the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> are very thin cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> that come with micro-planed truffle shavings, gouda cheese and parsley sprinkled on top. the thin cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> are very crispy, and have great texture. the gouda cheese gives the fries a nice cheesy taste without overwhelming the taste of the fries or the truffles. the truffle, just as importantly was not overwhelming as well, providing an extra layer of flavor with the earthy, mushroomy tones. the creamy white truffle dip really did just taste like sour cream. as the price would suggest, the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> do come with a lot of fries. i would recommend sharing this with up to 4 people if everyone is having a burger as well.\n\nthe <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> is a charbroiled burger topped with a mac and cheese that is slightly better than average. other toppings included crispy deep fried onion stings, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> comes with what would be the equivalent of a medium mcdonalds fries (more on this later). the tomato really did not add much to this burger and really could have been either left off or given another slice of. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> patty alone was actually a little dry and could have been a bit moister. the mac-n-cheese was not supermelty as the menu would have you believe, but was tasty anyway. the donkey-sauce, i believe, is the bbq sauce at the bottom <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. the apple-wood bacon brought in salty and smoky flavors to the party and is always a great addition to a burger or mac-n-cheese. the brioche bun brought in some sweetness to balance all of the salty flavors in between. i wish there was a bit more pickle, but i just like pickles. overall, this burger was good, but short of great or excellent.\n\n<mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> is a charbroiled burger topped with blue cheese and bacon, with addition toppings of crisped onion strings, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> is also served on a brioche bun and this also helps balance out the flavors a little. the blue cheese was actually a little overwhelming on some parts of that burger, some areas of it had a ton of blue cheese and other areas had little to none. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> did have some interesting spice flavor to it, but it was difficult to discern what those were among the blue cheese. this burger also had the same problem with the dryer burger patty as the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. overall, this burger was good as well, it just could have used a bit more attention to detail to prevent that blue cheese from being overwhelming in certain areas <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.\n\nthe fries that come with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are crunchy just like the fries with the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, but there is a bit of variation, some are thicker cut home fries, mixed in with a few waffle fries, and the super thin cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> as well. the larger fries are seasoned with a spicy cajun type seasoning or spicy seasoned salt.\n\noverall, this was a good meal with solid flavors. i think that i can make a better mac-n-cheese with just three cheeses and have it actually be supermelty. the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> suffers from not having that supermelty cheese as well as a slightly moister patty. <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> has the same problem with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> patty and needed a bit more attention to detail. overall, the food was a solid 3/5 and the interior/service was an excellent concept for guy's restaurant (4/5). in any other location, i would consider the price and knock this down one star for the price based on the offerings. however, in vegas, it seems pretty average. guy fieri's gets a 3.5/5 with all things considered.",

            "went here last week for lunch. when we were seated it took about 10 minutes for anyone to come over and even get our drink order. once they did we ordered our food, which consisted of the pepperoni pretzel fondue things and 2 of the mac and cheese burgers. it took 45 minutes for our appetizer to come out, which i believe they forgot about since the cheese fondue was super cold. our waitress wasn't the most pleasant either. she barely said a word and seemed really irritated. i didn't get her name but we had blue hair and glasses. she must have walked by our table 5 times and noticed our appetizer plate was empty but still didn't take it so by the time <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> came there was hardly any room. i had really high hopes for <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>, since on the menu it said it was award winning. it wasn't good at all. for starters, i don't like how they don't offer how you'd like it cooked. the mac and cheese on <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was flavorless and <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> itself was just mediocre. the selection of french fries had a weird sweet cinnamon taste. i'm not sure about them. i won't be coming back, mainly for the service alone. if you're looking for an amazing burger go eat at burgr inside planet hollywood.", 
            "i finally gave in and walked down to the linq to see if guy's burger kitchen and bar wasn't too busy for my wife and myself to give it try. lets face it for those who only visit here occasionally you have to pay the prices reflecting the high rent of being on the strip. the eateries don't have to worry about repeat business because new bodies show up everyday and service such as was at  michael's (barbary coast) is long in the past. ok got there around 1:30 waited for about 25 min before we were seated. my wife got <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> (15) and i ordered the original ringer burger (18) yes 18.00 for a burger. ordered <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> medium. it arrived overcooked and dry (not even a hint of pink). i cut it in half and we shared <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> also. they were just meh. since we live on the strip it's hard to pay the going prices for mediocre food. we see no need for a return visit. we don't eat much fast food fare but in our consensus the all natural burger at carl's jr. will stand up to any in the valley. cke has good angus beef. haven't tried the gordon ramsey burger but honestly what can be done to a burger to make it cost over 10 bucks. seems like the real bargain is a little further down. one dollar michelob at the casino royal.", 
            "really disappointed by this spot. i ordered the montly que bbq pull pork sandwich. meat was tuff; definately needed to be cooked longer to soften the shoulder meat. this sandwich was okay. \n\nmy boyfriend ordered their \"award\" winning mac n cheese burger. lol nothing winning about this burger. it was super gross to me. way waay worst than my sandwich. where's why:  the lettuce used was the same nasty subway lettuce. to describe it- it tasted like the lettuce was not covered in the refrigerator and tasted like the fridge chemicals. it over powered the entire burger. the patty was over cooked so it made <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> dry. \n\nfries: \nour orders came with the <mark>Quad Fries</mark>. it was cool. had a selection of 4 types of fries. just wished the fries were a bit crisper. but thats just a personal choice. \n\ncustomer service: average. not bad, but not great either. \n\npros\n1. location: has outside patio seating. conveniently located on the strip.\n\noverall :: not good. with the tuff pull pork, overcooked patty and the lettuce they use i recommend you go somewhere else for a burger.", 
            "rich. probably one of the worst servers i've ever had. it's 6 pm. our party is sober. what's your excuse? \n\noutside seating area is nice. food is good but not great. the portions are pretty large, but don't ask for any add-ons or substitutions. the bbq is dry and disappointing. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> were tough and the fries were cold. we sent one dish back because everything wasn't even what we ordered - 45 minutes later we finally got the new food, but the same cold fries and overcooked meat. no apology and an extra charge on the bill for an \"add-on\". it wasn't even worth disputing. we just wanted to get the hell out of there.", 
            "this place can be hit or miss based on what you order. i highly recommend sticking to <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. if you order either the mac n cheese burger or the take me to flavor town burger your taste buds will die and go to heaven!!! honestly the ribs were a big disappointment, it was like drinking a bottle of liquid smoke.", 
            "i feel like, if you're a fan of guy, you'll love this place. everything from the staffs outfit to the drink/food menu was bulky and just in-your-face. \n\nif you're a fan of his show ddd, that's another story. \n\nwe started off with the asian lettuce wraps which were amazing. from the minced chicken and chicken skewers, to the choices of three dripping sauces. so good! \n\nthen the entrees came in. i had the brisket and my girlfriend had the first burger option on the menu - i can't remember the name they have for it \n\nthe brisket - for 30something dollars was a bit of a let down. covered in a bath of sweet and tangy bbq sauce and on top of two giant texas toasts, you're not really giving the chance to taste the flavors of the actual brisket. it comes with an assortment of fries \n\n<mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> - a perfectly seasoned burger with crispy onion ring and a toasty bun. it was good. \n\njust as another yelper mentioned, in a town like las vegas, there are much better food options.", 
            "i heard that guy fieri puts mac and cheese on a burger. i also heard that guy fieri puts bacon with the mac and cheese on a burger. i was sold.\n\nthere seems to be a never-ending line around peak meal times (i heard a customer say that they waited 3 hours to get seated. three. hours.), so we delayed our lunch time and sauntered in around 2pm. no lines. 1 minute wait while they cleaned a table for us. no pain.\n\nas soon as we sat down, i already knew what i wanted -- the bacon mac and cheese burger. one of my weaknesses is mac and cheese, so of course i had to have it. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> is massive -- piled high with a patty, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and of course, the mac and cheese and bacon. sadly, the patty was a bit thin and dry compared to other burgers i've had. maybe i can ask for it to be medium rare next time... the flavor of everything else was good but not foodgasmic. i'm glad to have tried it, but i'm not sure i would drop $20 for it again.\n\ni like that they give a variety of fries on the side -- skinny cut, thick cut, waffle cut... all perfectly seasoned with a side of ketchup.\n\nservice is superb. our server was extremely friendly and came around as much as he could to check on us.\n\nas far as burgers go, though, gordon ramsay's burgr still wins for now. sorry, guy.", 
            "this place is freakin amazing!!!!!! we ordered the bacon mac and cheese burger and the fried ice cream. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was huge, juicy and delicious. it was one of the best burgers i ever had!!! the <mark>Quad Fries</mark> that came with it was also amazing. the spice on the fries was amazing that you didn't really need the ketchup or any sauces. however, the hot sauce did enhance the flavor even more. the fried ice cream was humungous! i'm pretty sure 3-4 people can take that on instead of one person. it was covered with cornflakes and came with banana and peanut butter, strawberry and pineapple, hot fudge and maple syrup. combine everything together and it is delicious. the only reason i'm giving it a 4 and not a 5 is because the service was slow. our waiter took forever in getting us water and taking our orders. we even had different waiters filled our water and bring out our food. and while i see other waiter walking around doing things, my waiter was no where to be seen.", 
            "first off why is this listing guy fieri?  the name of the restaurant is guy fieri's vegas kitchen and bar.  i've tried updating the name and it was denied.  so annoying.  i mean there was a yelp event here.  you would think we could get the name right.  \n\nwe stopped in for a late dinner.  after 10 pm they have a limited menu, but are less busy so it's not too bad of a trade off.  there was a short line even though the restaurant inside and out was mostly empty.  parties of 4 or less wait in line.  5 or more check in with the hostess.  when we got to the front we were asked if we wanted to sit inside, outside or at the bar.  we didn't have a preference until the hostess told it would be 15 min wait for inside/outside or we could sit at the bar right away.  so the bar it was.  funny though that there was that much of a wait when there were dozen's of empty tables all around.  \n\nwe sat at the bar and got a cider and a guido's freaky tiki.  we ordered fireball whiskey wings, <mark>Quad Fries</mark> and <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>.  omg all of it was amazing.  so good.  i'll admit i was a little surprised.  i wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was.  i don't like chicken wings and i loved these.  <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was excellent.  loved the fries and all the dipping sauces.  portions are big enough to share.  don't be like the people next to us were trying to give us their fries because they each ordered <mark>Quad Fries</mark> and it was way to much.", 
            "the signs promise \"in your face food.\"\n\nthat is definitely the premise here. the portions and plating are designed to shock and awe. but the food? well, let's just say i'm afraid to find out what part of the donkey the \"donkey sauce\" on my mac & cheese burger came from. it tasted like raw garlic mixed with mayo. the fries taste like they're seasoned with the same stuff they put on bbq potato chips. the bartender was cool and took it away when she saw i wasn't overly pleased with my meal. but i couldn't find anything on the menu that really appealed to me to replace it - the entire menu is designed to overwhelm. it seems like the idea is to just pile a whole bunch of things on for the sake of piling them on, taste be damned.\n\nso i switched to dessert. the chocolate mint ice cream pie must come with at least a pint of ice cream, topped with mint oreos, and drizzled tableside with chocolate. it was tasty but enough to feed a family of 6. they took <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> off of my bill, and two drinks and dessert came to $30.\n\ni can't think of a reason to return to this tourist trap. you'll find better food at the linq (with no lines to get in) at off the strip next to o'shea's.", 
            "good drinks, but <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> and appetizers were terrible.  noisy and crowded too.", 
            "just had an early dinner here with my bes<mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, mom & her bes<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> and we were definitely pleased with everything from the drinks to the service! <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are delicious!", 
            "basically a glorified fast food restaurant. went there for lunch on a sunday.  had to wait almost an hour to get a table, and now we wish we hadn't waited.  vegas prices for <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>, but no where near the quality!  all our burgers were overdone, fries were nothing special, salads were average.  the menu reads well, but food is not.  we live here in town and won't go back.  bummer, cause we love his tv show.", 
            "love watching his shows and figured he picked up a lot of great ideas to use at his new restaurant. first the line to get in - 35 minute wait. the problem was that the patio was 1/2 empty and the inside was 2/3's full at best. i asked if we can sit on the patio since it was 1/2 empty but was told we had to wait. i understand you cannot overload a given server area, but i do not think that was the case. i think it was to keep a line so it looked like it was always busy. our server was great - she was helpful and always there when needed. the problem was the food. presentation looked good on everything coming out of the kitchen, but <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> were not worth what they charge and nothing to rave about. the signature app was pepperoni wrapped pretzels - the pepperoni was the lowest quality you find on frozen pizzas. i guess my expectations were too high on the quality of the food he would serve.", 
            "so if you have a party of four or less you wait outside the restaurant and if five or more you go inside. i don't get understand that, but okay. we had four and waited just 30mins. it was on a sunday for lunch. \n\nwe got seated and was given a menu. we looked over the menu, but we had a good idea already as to what we wanted to order. so now we're just sitting, waiting, thinking over how are weekend was in vegas since we were just hours away from going home. well, that time passed and passed...okay so we're super hungry and we're still waiting for someone to introduce themself to us. my boyfriend had to flag down a server and tell them we we're waiting for service! on top of that, we still waited an extra three mins for someone to come by. when the guy did, he was honestly creepy. plus he had just visited another table cuz he was carrying trays and menus. he asked us if we wanted anything to drink and then was going to get that, but we kinda were on a time crunch so we told him we were ready to order then too. our food took awhile, but that was worth the wait.\n\n i order the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>, the bf ordered the mac cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. my friends ordered the fireball whiskey wings and <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark>. i loved my wings!!! so much flavor, and it came with some veggies. plus on top of <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were onion strings, yum! i had a piece <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> and it was juicy and oily lol. i loved the fries that came with it. i also had a fireball wing. i didn't think it was that spicy, it was good, but spice wise, no. my friends also ordered <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> later on while we were eating. those took foreverrrrr to come out!!! they were good though, but man.\n\nthe food was amazing! the service was terrible and slow! our server took our checks and it took 12 mins! why? i saw him making up a drink @ bar for another table of his. isn't that the bartenders job?? then he took to them and then did our checks! like, if you're going to do that stuff @ least do it behind a solid wall, there wasn't even a wall to block him. i could see him!!! \n\nlike seriously!!! it was like the server worked @ a fancy fancy restaurant where the service and speed was more on the slow side. this wasn't and isn't that kind of place. we got seated @ 12:55pm. i thought we were going to be there for like an hour and 15mins, no! we were there till 2:36pm! i know this cuz we wanted to leave vegas by 3pm. and we still had shopping to do. that was soooo annoying, not the way i wanted to end my last meal there. so yeah, our server costed my rating a star or else this would have been a 5 star review.", 
            "ordered a late night snack and got the recommended burger. let's just say it tasted great going down but my body didn't agree about 2 hours later with all the grease on it. if <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> wasn't so oily and they skipped on buttering the bun it would have been fine because they still had a mayo and bbq and some donkey sauce on there which had loads of flavor in itself.  forgot to mention there is an onion ring on there also. ohh gosh my stomach is churning as i think about it again.", 
            "burger and fry heaven... well, at least my kind of heaven in a skulltastic, rock'n'rollish atmosphere. i'm a fan of the funky dude so maybe i'm biased. my trips to flavor town have been most excellent...\non my very first visit i had the mac and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. heart attack in a burg... i was in town for a convention and demolished the thing. i was a hot mess. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was a mess. it reminded my of hodad's but with some pizazz. during my last visit i met a drunkard who kept insisting that he's met me somewhere. he called me victoria. i had a full blown conversation with him while waiting for my food. my husband felt bad and was not amused while the guys sitting next to us couldn't stop laughing.\n\nsuggestions: \n-do yourself a favor and get the <mark>Quad Fries</mark>. with the seasoning salt and assortment of waffle, shoestring, sweet potato and crinkle cut taters... i couldn't bare to share, but i did because sharing is caring.\n-if you don't want to wait for a table, i highly suggest you sit at the bar. the servers are attentive and you get to meet some pretty interesting folks.",

            "i went here on a recommendation from a food network show on guilty pleasures of celeb chefs. the bacon macaroni cheese burger is good but not great. and honestly looks nothing like the pictures i have seen. what made it 3 stars and saved it was the buffalo wings in a whiskey sauce my friend had. they were great and really waaaay better than <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.",

            "<mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> here were good. interesting burger ingredients, such as mac and cheese in your burger. however, i would have liked the mac and cheese to come through more, especially if it's named the mac and cheese burger.\n\nthe <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark> were quite good, the sauce was the vip. better than any hot wings restaurant i've been to. i never really expect much out of <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark> because they're normally very similar, but this one surprised me.\n\nwomen may feel slightly out of place. this restaurant has a very \"manly\" vibe to it.",

            "two stars only because the service was good. the mac n cheese burger was dry and tasteless...<mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> patty itself was so bland and the mac and cheese wasn't gooey and had congealed a bit. not juicy or full of flavor like i would expect for a $20 burger. so many better burgers along the strip, this one was a joke. won't come back.", 
            "watching his cooking show and have been to his restaurant in santa rosa, ca this place is a casual easy going good eats! the mix of frys make choices easy, <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are off the hook! absolutely a must stop when in vegas!", 
            "my wife & i ate here on our latest trip to vegas. we are both big fans of guy so we had to check out this place. the restaurant decor was farm based which worked well. our waiter was very friendly and attentive. i started with the fireball whiskey wings. these were very tasty and i thoroughly enjoyed them. if i had 1 criticism i wish they would have been a little crispier. my wife ordered the pretzel wrapped in pepperoni with a cheese dip. this was delicious as well. we the split <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> with mac & cheese on it which came with a trio of fries. my wife really liked <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> but i was a little disappointed. i found <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> itself was over cooked. i prefer my burger to be medium rare & this burger was at least medium. the other ingredients on <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> provided a good mix a favor. the trio of fries were great. i would definitely eat here again but i'm not sure i would order a burger again. i debated on what star rating to give. i felt a 3 was too low but a 4 was a little high. i decided to go with a 4 because the service was very good and the appetizers & fries were great.", 
            "this time as guy's vegas restaurant. the food was really, really good!!! the service was good, and the ambiance was great. the missing start is for the price <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> my wife and i had. a lil too high in opinion",

            "this place is oh so mediocre.  with other good dining establishments nearby, i'm not sure why anyone would choose to come here.\n\nlet's start with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.  most really good burgers are thick and juicy and cooked to order.  you can look at the photos and tell that these patties are just a notch better than fast food patties at best.  in order for a burger with thin patties to be considered top tier, there needs to be some other selling point, some other flavor which makes up for the lower quality patties.  guy attempts to do that with the mac and cheese burger which i had.  i love the concept but <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> falls flat.  it doesn't have enough mac and cheese on it and the mac and cheese becomes an afterthought.  it's mostly just a mediocre burger with a little mac and cheese on it.\n\ni didn't want to judge the place solely on subpar burgers so i made a return trip and got the <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark>.  it had a ton of cajun flavoring that takes over the taste of the dish.  that is kind of what i wanted from guy's burgers.  unfortunately, this cajun flavoring is not that tasty imo...too salty for my tastes and thus the overpowering nature of <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> actually made me dislike it.  also, the bun was too small as was the cutting board you eat on so i kept spill meat on the table.\n\nthe mixture of fries they give you is \"ok\". i wish they would allow you to substitute them for truffle fries though and wish they had a special sauce option rather than simply dipping them in ketchup.\n\nthe service at this restaurant is mediocre to poor.  the first server i had was cute but was pretty terrible at her job.  the 2nd didn't have much of a personality.  \n\nthe layout of the restaurant is terrible.  this may be due largely to the structure which long pre-existed this restaurant but it should still be noted that there are very few good places to sit here.  most everything is cramped in.\n\nthe atmosphere of the place is pretty bad too.  the uniforms give off a white trash sort of vibe.  the clientele doesn't help much either.  it's location relative to harrah's means that you can expect a lot of the inbred types to stop here for a meal.  i hope caesars renovates that property soon to get rid of most of the riffraff that still occupies the center strip.", 
            "okay the first night my wife and i checked in we enjoyed our meal greatly. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was great the desert was delicious. but the day we left we were so excited to eat it again that when we got our food to go we were completely shocked at how my burger was over cooked then my wife's burger was way under cooked then the fries were way over seasoned.  i don't know what happened, i think it's just simply a hit or miss thing. if they work on consistency then it would be perfect. other than that  the customer service was good. just so if anyone is wondering and if these comments are actually viewed the day of the not so great service was on august 4, 2015 around 1125 am.",

            "i wish i liked it more. we were staying in the hotel (never again btw) and after looking at the menu we decided to try it. we obviously had to get the mac n cheeseburger. i think we all would have ordered it if i didn't convince my bf to get the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> which was good but i mean it's turkey not beef. anyway <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was good but it seemed like it had been sitting under a heat lamp.. the mac \"melted\" off the patty but then it just looked like hard cheese. i like that it came with seasoned fries, crinkle, thin, and wedge. i probably wouldn't suggest to come here again bc there are so many other places to eat in vegas, but i'm glad i at least tried it and if someone wanted to try this burger i would go with them.", 
            "i really, really enjoyed my overall visit. i loved the decor and liked that they had a foozball table to play with for those who are waiting. the area next to the hostess table had a lot of guy's merchandise, from books to shirts, so there is something for everyone from hardcore guy fans to those who just want a souvenir. there is seating inside, outside, and at the bar. the seating outside is okay, since you can people watch. but even with the misters, it was too hot and the view is just of the entrance of the linq and harrahs. while waiting, they have some guy memorabilia, like his unlv chef coat, to view and the kitchen is open so you can see <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> coming out.\n\nwe ended up sitting near the windows. i loved that the windows added natural light and allowed you to see the strip. i liked the decor from the napkins to the menu clipboards and tables, it was very guy-esque. \n\nthe food was very delicious and surprisingly filling. each burger comes with a mixture of waffle fries, shoestring fries, and crinkle cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> with seasoning. i got the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and i loooved it!! it's the best <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> i've ever had. it was so tasty and everything in and on <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> complimented one another. i tried some of my brother's off-da-hook original smash burger and it was also super delicious.\n\nservice was great. we were greeted right away upon arriving. our waiter was nice and attentive. bonus, our food came out right away after ordering. fyi, there is no restroom in the restaurant, but outside in the linq to the right when you exit. \n\noverall, i recommend coming here because as guy would say, \"it's off the chain!\"", 
            "we could not wait to eat here. the whole family watches food network constantly and i have been a guy fan for years. well, this was disappointing. highly overpriced for average food. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was good, but no better than anywhere else i've been. and we spent more here on burgers and fries than we spent at every other restaurant during our week long vacation. i will not be back and i cannot recommend.", 
            "i had the bowl of red chile, it was ok.  probably how anthony bourdain referred to the chile used on a frito pie in downtown santa fe, tasted like it was wolf canned chile.  the bartender was talented and juggled many a bottle of booze without breaking them.  not a place i'd go out of my way to hit, though.  a limited menu consisting mostly <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> and, let's be honest, there are better places in vegas, even on the strip, for a burger...", 
            "ok so let me start off by saying that i didn't want to go here, the boy did. and he previously kept repeating that this place got pretty bad reviews. well, as you can see, i'm leaving one of them. being that we were both drinking, we made a poor decision to stop by this sad-famous chef named restaurant. \n\nit was pretty empty when we entered which should've given us a clear indication of how much the food sucked... we got the bacon mac and cheese burger and the waffle <mark>Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries</mark>. i mean, how could you even go wrong with a combination like that? well, you can at guy's. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was so over cooked it was black, they basically just slapped some kraft cheese on top of pasta and microwaved some bacon and put that monstrosity together... and my waffle fries!! my poor dried hard crispy fries. they sat in the fryer way too long. they basically just added a bunch of chili and cheese to cover up what they'd done, but you can't fool me! honestly, carl's jr crisscu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> are better. and the cocktail, the $14 cocktail that was only filled just a little more than half way of my glass... \n\ni shake my head in disappointment and will never be back. pretty sure they'll be out of business soon.",

            "saw a lot of reviews and wanted to see what the hype was about... and to say that i've been to a guy fieri restaurant. \n\nwe waited about 15 minutes, which usually isn't too bad except that there are only about 5 seats available and 20 people waiting. once seated, we had a hard time hearing our server because the music was so loud (it was good music though). the food presentation was great, but the taste was pretty average. i got the bacon mac and cheese burger because what else would i get. it didn't seem like there was too much mac and cheese on it and <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was pretty well done. tasted ok, but it was pricey.", 
            "most of the food is really good but also really expensive. the truffle fries are awesome and so is the mac & cheese burger. the fries they give you with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are throw aways and the pepperoni pretzel sticks aren't any good, especially for the price. \ni would give the place 4 to 5 stars if i hadn't met guy fieri last time we were there. he happened to be there, and we are huge fans. we didn't want to act star struck so we waited until the crowds had died down and he was near us. i went up to him, told him how we watch all his shows, make all his recipes, go to all the ddd restaurants. his response was, \"just snap your picture.\" i was shocked. not even a thanks. i always thought he was such a nice down to earth guy. \nwe are locals and have been there a few times even though the prices are ridiculous because we wanted to support who we thought was a good guy. $15 for fries and $20 for a burger is not worth it to support someone who does not appreciate his fans. a celebrity wouldn't be one if it wasn't for their fans, and guy fieri lost two fans and customers that night.", 
            "was our first spot to hit when we got to vegas. waited to write this review until i went to various other places to eat/drink. this has a chain restaurant feel to it when you first get in but it surpasses that feeling once the food comes.  my girlfriend and i split the nachos, which were really good. good portion and very tasty. we also ordered two kinds of wings, the general wings and the bbq.  i enjoyed both for sure, as one was sweet and the other (general wings) a bit on the spicy side.  both were very good and all of it was too much food for both of us. wait staff was a little slow but was apologetic, but was odd that it would be slow for a thursday at noon.  <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> looked insanely good so if/when i go back i would definitely get one.", 
            "i was underwhelmed. the restaurant was nice and the late night menu looked appetizing until the food came. i had the ringer burger (no cheese) and my mom got the pulled pork sandwich. first off, the playing was terrible. it was a small and narrow wooden slab and the food was barely on it. if something shifted, your food would be on the table. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was thinner than i expected but the meat was seasoned well. the onion ring on top <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was not good flavor wise. is once that is the feature of this particular item, that is ungood. the breading was too think and it was not crispy. the bun was a buttered brioche bun and it had a spicy mayo and bbq sauce condiment. all that made <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> greasy and it was too many competing flavors. i ended up cutting the buttery part out and it ended up being much better.  my mother liked the pulled pork but the bread was too much. \n\nthe last disappointment was the fries. i love fries and that is usually my favorite part. this plate had four different types of fries (waffle, shoestring, crinkle & curly). some of the fries were seasoned and some were not. this was awful. they were overseasoned and due to the different types it highlighted what you didn't like. i think it should be one type of fry and the best one was the curly. i wanted to like this place but i did not. i definitely would not go back.", 
            "after being a huge guy fieri fan for ddd, i became disenchanted after dealing with his brand professionally for a campus restaurant project. his nyc disaster opening in furthered my distaste for him. after eating at his restaurant i do think he is a legit restaurateur.  the food was fantastic. our waitstaff was super pleasant. we had the turkey picnic, mac and cheese burger, and lettuce wraps. the lettuce wrap stuffing and sauces were awesome. spring rolls were crispy and delicate yet bumped up by the sauces. the turkey sandwich was raved by our friends. the pretzel roll was amazing!  turkey well cooked. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was definitely a signature burger and super tasty. the mac and cheese can be flavorless (cheesecake factory) but this one actually added a nice cheese sauce and extra carbs to <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. no need for ketchup for us as the sauce on there was plenty. the fries were fantastic and a mix of different kinds. the locked up spicy ketchup was a perfect complement for the fries. overall great place. food came out slowly. we anted breakfast and just missed it ( i guess 10:30 or 11?).  since when did guy allow breakfast?  our campus vision wasn't allowed to do breakfast but this place had it. our neighbors had some awesome french toast. maybe a brunch option for weekend would be good.",

(truffle fries are the best!) i always order their caesar salad as it's the only vegetarian friendly meal they offer. it's a really savory salad that comes in great proportions! i really dislike that giant crouton it comes with, though. it looks like a bread bowl that takes up almost half the plate and is incredibly hard, basically a rock. i shouldn't need a steak knife to eat my salad. trying to cut pieces off that giant crouton is a task making it feel as if it's not meant to be eaten. however, i don't expect to eat the best salad at guy fieri's restaurant lol. \ntheir bloody mary's are awesome! you get to choose on a level of 1-5 how spicy you want yours to be, though be advised they tend to run on the spicier side. i ordered a 2 which is supposed to be lightly spicy but was rather a medium level of spicy. still super good! its garnish for dinner time consists of a generous sized stalk of celery accompanied with a raspberry, a cherry, a few olives & jalape\\u00f1os. \nthough i haven't tried them myself, my friends love to order <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> here which come in huge proportions and make the best pre-drinking meal. from my experience, <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> seem to be the best thing here as my friends have me coming back here just for <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. considering vegas' overpriced food theme, these burgers are definitely worth it just from their size alone!",

            "a wonderful environment. very \"guy\" from the shows i've enjoued watching him on. my husband ordered the mac and cheese burger and absolutely died over it. it was big and full of flavor. i personally didn't find it as enjoyable but if you are a mac and cheese lover you may love it too. i had the pastrami burger and it was full of different ingredients that made it unique, tasty and full of flavor. id rate <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> a 4 out of 5 for sure! the fries were a mixture of crinkle and thin, they were overpowered with seasoning and cold/stale. while we were waiting to be seated, we saw a man putting fries on a load of plates before <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> were done-i really think we got one of those that were sitting out for 20 minutes or so. we just didnt eat the fries. the prices were a tad overpriced, we had to wait 15 minutes for a seat with multiple tables open and cleaned and the fries were just a big disappointment. overall this was a good restaurant, burgers were good but old stale fries removed a star.", 
            "wow...no doubt about it this place has the best burgers i have ever eaten. i ordered the mac n cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> and could not have been more pleased. the service took about 25 minutes but well worth the wait. i would give this place 6 stars if i could.  \n\n<mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> is tender and cooked perfectly. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was topped with their signature sauce, crisp shredded lettuce, thinly sliced pickles, and too top that all off...mac n cheese and 2 slices of crisp bacon. (picture is attached)\n\nthe french fries come in different varieties from waffle, truffle, and regular with your burger. \n\ni highly recommend this place if you are looking for a delicious meal, friendly service, and an all around great time."

            "guy fieri's in las vegas is exactly as guy's show is on the food network, big burgers and lots of fries. the interior is indicative of his style with the clipboard menu and the wood planks that hold the drinks menu. our server, brittany provided great service. the kitchen is an open design where you can see what all of the line cooks are doing inside.\n\nfor two, we ordered the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> (truffles), the bacon mac n cheese burger, and <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark>. the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> are very thin cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> that come with micro-planed truffle shavings, gouda cheese and parsley sprinkled on top. the thin cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> are very crispy, and have great texture. the gouda cheese gives the fries a nice cheesy taste without overwhelming the taste of the fries or the truffles. the truffle, just as importantly was not overwhelming as well, providing an extra layer of flavor with the earthy, mushroomy tones. the creamy white truffle dip really did just taste like sour cream. as the price would suggest, the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> do come with a lot of fries. i would recommend sharing this with up to 4 people if everyone is having a burger as well.\n\nthe <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> is a charbroiled burger topped with a mac and cheese that is slightly better than average. other toppings included crispy deep fried onion stings, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> comes with what would be the equivalent of a medium mcdonalds fries (more on this later). the tomato really did not add much to this burger and really could have been either left off or given another slice of. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> patty alone was actually a little dry and could have been a bit moister. the mac-n-cheese was not supermelty as the menu would have you believe, but was tasty anyway. the donkey-sauce, i believe, is the bbq sauce at the bottom <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. the apple-wood bacon brought in salty and smoky flavors to the party and is always a great addition to a burger or mac-n-cheese. the brioche bun brought in some sweetness to balance all of the salty flavors in between. i wish there was a bit more pickle, but i just like pickles. overall, this burger was good, but short of great or excellent.\n\n<mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> is a charbroiled burger topped with blue cheese and bacon, with addition toppings of crisped onion strings, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> is also served on a brioche bun and this also helps balance out the flavors a little. the blue cheese was actually a little overwhelming on some parts of that burger, some areas of it had a ton of blue cheese and other areas had little to none. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> did have some interesting spice flavor to it, but it was difficult to discern what those were among the blue cheese. this burger also had the same problem with the dryer burger patty as the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. overall, this burger was good as well, it just could have used a bit more attention to detail to prevent that blue cheese from being overwhelming in certain areas <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.\n\nthe fries that come with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are crunchy just like the fries with the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, but there is a bit of variation, some are thicker cut home fries, mixed in with a few waffle fries, and the super thin cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> as well. the larger fries are seasoned with a spicy cajun type seasoning or spicy seasoned salt.\n\noverall, this was a good meal with solid flavors. i think that i can make a better mac-n-cheese with just three cheeses and have it actually be supermelty. the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> suffers from not having that supermelty cheese as well as a slightly moister patty. <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> has the same problem with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> patty and needed a bit more attention to detail. overall, the food was a solid 3/5 and the interior/service was an excellent concept for guy's restaurant (4/5). in any other location, i would consider the price and knock this down one star for the price based on the offerings. however, in vegas, it seems pretty average. guy fieri's gets a 3.5/5 with all things considered.", 
            "it hurts my heart to give guy's restaurant a 3. it just didn't blow my mind as i thought it would.\n\nfirst off, the menu is extensive and everything that guy fieri stands for. the menu even reads like guy talks. fries, loaded fries, wings, burgers, brisket, sandwiches, salads, dessert...it's a big menu. they also have breakfast as well. i would like to come back and try breakfast -- we came for lunch.\n\nwe started off with the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark> - they were an interesting flavor, you can definitely taste the fireball, but they were a bit dry. the wasabi blue cheese that it comes with is delicious. overall, not my favorite. i'd like to try the general tso's next time as our neighbor table got them and enjoyed them a lot. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> sound ginormous, but they actually are very manageable, so don't be afraid. i got <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> ($19 creole blackening spice, blue cheese, bacon,lettuce, tomato, onion, donkey sauce on a garlic-buttered brioche). underwhelming in flavor - i wouldn't order it again. my girlfriends both got the mac & cheese burger and they loved it. \n\nthe service was the pits. we were drawn in by the \"hangover recovery- build your own bloody mary\" sign, as we really needed a recovery. when i asked our waitress if i could see the bloody mary menu, she said \"pick a vodka and pick a spice level 1-5.\" we had no idea how much they cost and were disappointed because that didn't seem like \"building\" to me. i went on the website to look at the food menu to help jog my memory as i write this review, and, there is absolutely a menu for the build your own bloody mary (you choose a protein, you choose garnishes...i'm irritated). \n\ni would go back, because it's guy fieri, and the menu is extensive so i would hope for better service and to try something else that i would enjoy more.",

            "the mac n cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> is one of the best i've had.  <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> are awesome.  ambiance is great, menu had plenty to offer, and service was top notch.  ask for bria she was great! food is reasonably priced, and don't forget your total rewards card, they discount.", 
            "since this place my wife and i heard about this place opening we were interested in checking it out.  everything was spectacular from start to finish, our food was phenomenal, i had the mac n cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> and my wife the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>.  we finished with the <mark>Guy's Cheesecake Challenge</mark>.  overall the meal was amazing and our server chris anderson was awesome!!! we will be back soon.",

            "my wife and i tried this yesterday. when we checked in we were told there would be a 40 minute wait, plus we also requested the outdoor patio. we'd get called around 25 minutes, but they forgot about the patio request and wanted to seat us inside. we eventually got the patio seating. \n  once seated, service was on the slow side. we ordered drinks, i got the sammy hagar rum drink, which was very good. but our order was not taken until we got our drinks after a long wait.  we ordered hamburgers, i got the mac and <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. i took about 30 mins to come out. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are smash burger style, and unfortunately ours were on the over done side. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> is described as an award winning burger, but not in this case. the mac and cheese was stingily applied and could not overcome the dryness of an overdone burger. \n\nduring the whole time there, when visits from the server were few and far between, there were about six people getting a table ready for a group of 15. must have been a vip, because it was setup meticulously. i've never seen that much cleaning and rechecking of the setup before. maybe if they put that much attention to the rest of the customers, it would have been a better experience. \n\nsince it's only been open a week, hopefully things will get better. but with so many choices for good food in vegas, it's hard to give places a second chance.", 
            "its about time that a 5 star chef came to town with a moderate priced place to eat.  guy's place rocks!  \nshowed up at 6 pm on a tuesday and we were seated right away.  our server was fast to take our order with a wonderful smile and helpful information regarding the food. \n my choice, mac n cheese and <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. my husband got the big dipper sandwich, smoked roast beef.\nmy burger was out of this world, mac n cheese, perfectly cooked bacon, lettuce, cheese and a juicy burger.  <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> and all sandwiches are served with a side of assorted fries.  \nthe only small thing i would have changed was the plating, its a small item.  the plating is done on a small wooden cutting board which doesn't leave a lot of room for your food. \nnow my husbands sandwich, not our favorite, but that's a personal taste.  the roast beef was had a very heavy smoke to it.  neither of us are huge fans of a heavy smokey taste to our beef/bbq.  the meat was tender and juicy, just didn't care for the heavy smoke.  \ntotal bill was $44 for both meals with included 2 pops.  price isn't bad for a casual dinner on the las vegas strip from a 5 star chef.  can wait for friends to come into town so we have an excuse to go back.", 
            "last meal in vegas before we have to fly home to idaho.  you know that saying save the best for last?  well that is the case with guys restaurant.   was not disappointed at all.  even our son said we need to come back here again after eating the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>.\n\nthe mac n cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> was legit.  turn into harras to park and wind your way back to the quad. once you valet park it is right there. winner winner chicken dinner.", 
            "burgers, tacos, wings, & beer.. everything you'd expect from a diners, drive-ins, & dives professional!\n\nthe quad is really starting to shape into an attractive vegas casino.. as long as you don't see their hotel rooms. haha\nthe addition of guy fieri's restaurant, along with hash house, really steps up the food game in this area of the strip..\n\nfood: going through the menu, there weren't a lot of fancy-shmancy ingredients or toppings.. just your classic all-american foods assembled into fantastic combinations.\ni decided to go with the mac+cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>.. the ultimate burger throw-up! the patty: very thin but wide, coming out <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> covering the entire bottom bun.. while the bacon and mac&cheese slightly oozed out on top of the patty. this is the true definition of a \"beautiful mess\". very tasty burger, loved the 5-cheese mac&cheese and the simple \"backyard bbq\" grilled type <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. \nthe fries that came with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> came in 3 types: ridged, curly, and wedges.. awesome!\nwe also ordered the triple-<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> which was like truffle overload with gouda. we didn't get to try any of the specialty cocktails.. there were many interesting concoctions that we'll definitely try next time.\n\nambiance: i'd describe it as an ed hardy-themed restaurant.. even the napkins had skulls. haha. a lively restaurant with high, exciting energy. if you're there for lunch, definitely sit outside.. you get the view of the walkway between harrah's and the quad, and the front of caesars. i'm not sure how it is at night but probably crazy loud with harrahs' carnival court right next door.\n\nservice: staff was great.. there were two consistent servers continually checking on us. it was a bit of a wait for our food to come out but i give them a little leeway since the restaurant's still brand new.\n\ntips: don't pass up this place if you're torn on what to eat on the strip. grab a burger, a few drinks, and enjoy!", 
            "one word...awesome! i loved their system of texting you when your table was ready. our server was phenomenal. it did take a while to get our cocktail drinks. but our food came out fast, i'm glad we didn't order any appetizers! i had the mac & cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. it was everything i thought it could be and more. it was just delicious and i highly recommend it. it's cooked medium well but was still really juicy and loved the mix of fries you receive with it. it's a big burger and will get messy, but you will enjoy it!  my friend had the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and she liked hers as well. it was a great time, and the staff was very friendly. thanks guy! :)", 
            "i'm a huge fan of ddd and guy fieri, so i was excited to try the newest addition to the quad resort and casino. \n\nfood: the menu is pretty much your regular burgers, tacos, wings but definitely with a gourmet twist. we went with the mac and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. we originally had it cut in half to share, but it was crazy messy. the patty is pretty thin but super wide...way wider than the bun. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> itself was really tasty, complete with the gooey mac and cheese and crispy bacon. i really liked the fries that was served with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. there were different types: curly, ridged, wedges, and i'm sure i found a regular fry in there as well. we also ordered the triple-<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> which was just as it was described: truffle+truffle+more truffle! loved the truffle flavor and the shoestring style fries. we didn't get to really try anything else because we were so full, but i definitely want to try their cocktails and dessert next time.\n\nambiance: alan l. described it perfectly: ed hardy-themed. and an extra touch of rocker style. the indoor seating area seemed a little small, but i would recommend sitting outdoors. the outdoor seating area sits right next to the walkway between the quad and harrah's. you definitely get a good view of people walking right by. hopefully they see your meal and suddenly get a craving for some good burgers. \n\nservice: the staff was fantastic! our servers were attentive and helpful. we did have to wait for our food but the restaurant was about a week old and they were pretty busy that day. \n\ntips: try out this place if you're wanting an overall good dining experience on the strip. and definitely opt for outdoor seating!", 
            "come hungry! leave stuffed!\n\nafter dining with them on the grand opening, i wanted to bring my husband to taste the magnificent creations of guy fieri.  we were greeted and seated immediately.  awesome.  within seconds, nick the sheriff, was over to introduce himself.  he was incredible and took great care of us during our dining visit.  thanks nick!\n\nwe started off with the rojo rings to split.   so huge! so tasty! i love the dipping sauce it comes with.  has a kick to it that compliments the rings.  \n\nwe then split the mac n cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>.  since we told nick, he had the kitchen already cut it for us.  we also had our own serving of french fries. nice! i love the blend of every style of fry in one bunch on your plate.  as for <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>? just as delicious as i remember.  so juicy and full of flavor.  i was glad we split it because i couldn't have finished it myself.  \n\nit is a great bar and grill that's full of life in a great location in the strip.  don't forget to bring your total rewards card for the $1 discount on each menu item.  your stomach will thank you for eating here!", 
            "soooo amazing! our party of three shared the mac n cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> and picnic turkey sandwich. they were both full of flavor, unique, and so delicious. our waiter, adrian c, was as awesome as the food. loved him! we went at 2:00 pm on a friday afternoon and had just a short wait and once we ordered the food came out fast. my only complaint would be the snobby hostesses. will definitely come again next time i'm in vegas!", 
            "i've been fortunate enough to dine here three times since it's opening. guy fieri's vegas kitchen is located inside the quad hotel & casino. if you're familiar with guy fieri on tv and his personality. you will see it echoed prominently in the look & design of his restaurant. even the attitude & energetic atmosphere exuded by the employees represent guy fieri's style. of course, if you find guy fieri's persona & shows unappealing, this would not be the place for you.\ni've tried the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>, '67 cajun chicken sandwich & mac & cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> entrees. all were awesome, full of flavor. each comes with a fry mix & <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are massive. the mac & cheese was quite rich. some might find it too much so, but heck, theres mac & cheese in there, what do you expect right? the '67 surprised me in that the blackened chicken was super tender & cooked perfectly.  and a tasty <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> is always a good thing.\ntheir appetizers were all very yummy too. my favorites are the rojo rings, onion rings that come hanging on a pipe accompanied by a sriracha ketchup. the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, giant breadstickers wrapped in pepperoni with a sausage & provolone cheese dip. i was even dipping my fries in the cheesy dip 'cause i loved it so much.\nwaiters & servers were very attentive & lively. i was also fortunate enough to meet mike, the manager of the establishment. i would be willing to go out of my way to the quad just to come to guy fieri's. i do find it interesting that one of the low end hotel casinos on the strip is home to two great food spots. hash house and here. definitely earns a 5 star rating in my book!", 
            "i wanted to really like this place because the food looks amazing but it was just okay. the portions are also enormous and i normally wouldn't mind but i feel bad for wasting when the food just isn't that great! first off, the atmosphere is really fun and lively and our waiter was friendly. we came as a party of 5 and we had no wait going at 11pm on a sunday. our drinks were kept full and our food arrived in a timely manner. \n\n<mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> $13- pretty good flavor and their cheese sauce had a nice tang to it.\n\nmac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> $17- pretty dry and over cooked :( also nothing really popped in flavor, it was kind of under-seasoned. for how tall the whole burger was, the beef was probably only 1/4 an inch thick at most. i picked at the mac & cheese and that by itself was pretty bland. one thing i really liked was that your $17 burger comes with fries, you don't have to order it a la carte like most burger places on the strip. however, the fries were pretty stale and too crunchy, but wayy too seasoning! also, the serving board it comes on is ridiculous. it looks really nice but it's way too small, three of us that got burgers asked for extra plates otherwise it would end up on our laps.\n\noff da' hook burger $16- i didn't try this one but boyfriend basically said the same thing i said about the mac & cheese burger.\n\n<mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark> $17- i didn't try these as well but my friend said she really liked them even though she took all the toppings off lol.\n\n<mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> $10- this thing was rock hard!!!! i had to use my burger knife to cut through it and i could barely taste the chocolate and marshmallow :( way overfried. the raspberry dipping sauce it came with was really good so it saved it from being a complete fail. \n\n<mark>Guy's Cheesecake Challenge</mark> $12- another huge portion of eh. cheesecake tasted like something i could buy at smiths or albertsons. impressive looking but not impressive in flavor.\n\nmaybe it was an off night of everything being overcooked but overall, another case of where food looks way better than it tastes. $175 worth of mediocre food. the price isn't the issue since the portions are huge and comparable to other burger joints on the strip but the quality of flavor just wasn't there. i still think gordon ramsey's burgr and holsteins are my favorite. i would even prefer bachi burger.  my boyfriend and i didn't care for it, maybe we are spoiled here in vegas? but the other three that were visiting from solvang, ca really loved it. so idk...try it for yourself i guess!", 
            "it was ok.  i got the mac n cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> which was super messy and hard to eat! i knife and fork'ed it :p i liked the outer well-done edges of the patty (i like well-done burgers) and any bite with bacon. the rest was \"eh.\" it came with fries that tasted like barbecue chips - and i'm not much of a barbecue chips kind of person :/ my dining companion ordered their <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark> which she finished. either she was very hungry or she really liked them :p the portion wasn't huge though.\n\nwe got there sometime after 11am and it wasn't too busy, but it started to fill up soon after. we sat outside where it was sort of shady, sort of not, depending on where you sat. we had the outermost seating which got a little bit of sun so it felt quite hot at times in that 100 degree heat! plus it was a bit smoky as it's so close to the quad's open-air casino entrance. oh, and tables were packed kind of close together. but i love outdoor seating on the strip so i dealt with it all :)\n\nservice was pretty good. we received proper greetings upon entrance and exit, and we never had to wait too long for anything. a manager even came by to see how things were going, and we were given a survey to fill out at the end of our meal. so clearly they are aiming to please their customers, which is good.\n\noverall, food was just ok and service above average. three stars for you, guy fieri.", 
            "i had the six cheese mac and <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> and it was delicious.  the fries were a nice touch as well.  the service was quick despite the number of people and the waitress was courteous and helpful.\n\nthe ambiance is unique and we were able to eat on the patio which is pretty much right on the strip.\n\ni will definitely go back", 
            "we had the pleasure of eating here twice in the same day.  guy is the bomb, so we figured his joint would be, as well. \n\nthe restaraunt is very nice and the open kitchen rocks.  the wait staff was fun and attentative.  \n\nall of the decor, uniforms, menu and experience  totalled up to be very guyish.  dug it. \n\nour meals, however, were a bit up and down.  i'll describe each meal and dish seperately. \n\nlunch: \n\n2 people - 0 wait time\n\napp: \nultimate chicken wrap - this was very good.  consisted of a few small egg rolls, a few chicken skewers, and lettuce wraps with three sauces (spicy sweet/sour, soy, satay).  this was a great start to the meal. \n\nmeal: \n<mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>.  it is big and awesome.  great flavor. this comes with a medley of fries with a very good seasoning.  i, now, have a mission to find ancho bacon.  \n\nimpression: this was a great experience.  my wife and i loved our meal.  \n\ndinner: \n\n5 people - 20 minute wait time\n\napp: \nrojo rings:   both of these were brought out quickly.  the onion rings were good and crispy.  they had good seasoning on the batter and the sauce was great.   \n\nnachos del jefe: the nachos (holy batman!) were killer.  these little chips are a sublime mix of mild chorizo and cheese that bring flavortown down to it's knees praying.  they are that good.\n\nmeal:\n\n<mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>: friend had this and loved it.  \n\nvictors <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark>: very average and small.  the tortilla's weren't really prepped at all. friend stated that this was bland and needed more salsa. \n\n<mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>: this was were the rails came off.  this sandwich is an exact replica of the deli cowboy from jason's deli.  it is a very saucy pulled pork.  all you can taste is a bbq that i would expect any joe blow to be able to prep in their crock pot.  to make matters worse, the waitress stated that this sandwich was the absolute best thing on the menu.  i don't think the chick from vegas knows what real bbq should be.  when you have tp pay $20 bucks for it, it just makes you disappointed.  \n\ndessert: \n\n<mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>: this was ok.  it looks cool, but it came accross too greasy.  it is really big and all in all, too much grease and sweetness to eat all of it.... even for 5 of us sharing one dessert.  \n\ni would have marked this a 5 after lunch... but, a few pieces of the dinner made this a big dip.  that pulled pork sandwich should really, really be re-considered.", 
            "i really wanted to like this restaurant as i like guy's tv show but i was nervous as some restaurants get by on name alone. as guys would say \"this is on point.\" the service was excellent, our server ayron was on top of every request.  i had the mac & cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. as many other reviews say it is messy and then the plate it comes on is way too small. the fries that come with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are of different shapes-; from waffle to shoestring to fatter fries. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was good not amazing but i was happy. the drinks come with real is cubes in the shape of ancube, which is kinda cool. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was a bit over priced at $20. i will be back if i'm near the quad but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.", 
            "the service was decent. took about 10 minutes to get us our drink order. i ordered the ceasar salad with this obnoxious crouton bowl that service no purpose. it was so hard i couldn't even cut through with a steak knife. i also had the sashimi taco, that was good and light. my fiance had mac n cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>, it was messy, the meat fell a part and the bun was the size of a silver dollar. with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> you get a side of fries... these aren't just regular fries, they are a variety of fries consist of steak fries, shoe string, crinkle fries, etc. my fiance started calling it left over fries, which what they tasted like. however, there, this one amazing item in this menu that i truly enjoyed.. the truffle fries. simply delicious. the aioli was well done. overall, decent experience,.giving them the benefit of the doubt they just opened.", 
            "let me say this, i came in twice to this restaurant because i freakin' love burgers. both times i was seated at the full service bar.\n\nthe first night christina helped me. she was very friendly and outgoing. if i needed anything she was right there. i ordered <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark>. it was phenomenal. one of the best burgers i've had. it came with a small sampling of four differen<mark>Triple T Fries</mark>. the fries weren't bad but nothing to write home about. at the end of my meal i was asked to fill out a short survey which i was sure would be thrown out because i answered so positively about her. the food service was quick and i enjoyed my visit. enough to come back the very next day even.\n\nnow the next visit i came in around the same time and was again seated at the full service bar. this time however the service was less than par. i sat on my stool for a solid five minutes before being handed a menu. one bartender spent this entire time talking to his friend that were sitting next to me. i knew they were friends because he knew their names and talked about what they posted on facebook. the bartender that finally helped me though barely looked at me other than to take my menu.\n\ni ordered the mac n cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> which came out fairly quickly. again <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was incredible, just as i expected. i have nothing bad to say about the food. however, while eating i finished my drink and despite sitting right at the bar it took nearly ten minutes to be refilled. i finished my meal and had to wait between five and ten minutes before i could ask for the check. this time i wasn't asked to fill out a survey (probably because even they knew the service was poor.)\n\ni'll consider coming back, but will be on the look out for christina or i'll wait for a table.", 
            "my wife and i went to this place on a friday after seeing some good reviews and knowing that it's located on a very nice spot, close to a nighclub, so we could eat while paying attention to the nearby people.\n\nmy wife ordered a mac and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> and i got a <mark>The Off-Da-Hook Original Smash-Burger</mark>.\nwe both agreed that this was a overly expensive burger for its quality. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> seemed huge in size, but you'll notice that <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> patty is very thin actually, the big size <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> is basically because they use a bunch of cabbage and the bun in tall, you can confirm that from other people's photos here at yelp.\n\nthe fries that came with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> were a joke, they were probably worse than mcdonald's, and came with a ketchup-like (which was probably just ketchup) sauce.\n\nthe drink my wife ordered (named smoke and mirrors) tasted and looked great.\n\nservice was good, nothing really special about it.\n\nwe will never go back or recommend.", 
            "went with family for a birthday.  we got the parm wings,  fireball whiskey wings, mac and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> and the cheesecake.  the food was great.  the only thing pulling them down are the serbers. we had to ask 5 tomes for lemons for water and waited a good 15 for a taster for beer.  would recommend this because of the food just do not expect good service", 
            "this was hands down the best place i have ever eaten!  i was not disappointed in any way here. \n\nthe restaurant:  the atmosphere is very fun and very much like guy.  the staff is dressed in denim outfits with leather like vests/aprons.  the tables, silverware and layout have a modern industrial type feeling.  the kitchen is very open to the restaurant so you can just look in and see exactly what's going on in there (a well oiled machine).  there is also a mini shop in the front to buy various things from him and the restaurant.  we ended up buying one of the bandana like napkin towels that are on the table.\n\nthe food:  this was the best food i've had in a long time!  certainly the best on the strip.  in any price class.  it came out very fast and was presented extremely well.  the fries are a mix of all types and seasoned to perfection.  <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are moist and flavorful.  try the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> and you won't want anything else.  the pulled pork was so good and on a pretzel bun it was over the top.  the drink selection was awesome and they had a little something for whatever you're looking for.\n\noverall:  extremely pleased at my whole experience at this eatery.  i went straight to flavor town and never looked back.  go and enjoy yourself!",

(i like how you could see the open kitchen when you're being seated.) \n\nthe menus were clipped to what seemed like oversized, thick clipboards. the menu  was simple and easily understood with a good amount of items. we started with drinks. \"lemon drop...not!\" for her and a firestone union jack ipa for me. i don't usually drink lemon drops (only when i try hers) but i have to say it was the best one i've had so far. we decided on the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>, <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> and the mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. \n\nthe <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> and <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> were served first. the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> were amazing! truffle chunks, truffle infused gouda and a creamy truffle sauce. bachi who? they don't skimp here! the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> were on another level. they consist of lightly grilled tequila-citrus tilapia, cabbage and avocado. then topped with radish and pickled ginger for a tasty combination. \n\nsoon after, <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> and mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> were heading to our table. <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> are a must try. the chinese minced chicken was on point. you also get three spring rolls and two thai style skewers. it's also a good way to be romantic, making your date lettuce wraps. just make sure your hands are washed! now onto <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. the six cheese mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> was bombdotcom. hands down one of the best burgers i've had. mac + cheese flowing over the thick applewood bacon all between a toasted garlic brioche bun. accompanied with a  combination of potato wedges, crisscut and regular fries. i was already full from finishing the previous dishes so i only ate half and have to pack the rest. next time i won't order as much so we could get dessert. \n\noverall the experience was fantastic! service was outstanding! food was amazing! i will be coming back again, and again.",

            "loved this place. it is in a great spot- right past carnival court by harrah's. (it is in the quad though). very nice, country vibe on the inside. cow print stools and all. food was delicious. we ordered the sashimi tacos- o m g !! it was so weird we had to get them. they were so good. next my hubby got the motley que. pulled pork, slaw, and happiness on a pretzel bun. was very good. bbq sauce was the story. i got the mac n cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. huge, very impressive. came with 3 or 4 different kinds of fries all mixed together. getting all the differen<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> was very cool. didnt have to pick. steak fries, shoestrings, battered fries, etc. for dessert, you have several amazing options- they even had churros! lol. we had to get the <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>. yes people- a huge, deep fried s'mores sandwich. unreal. comes with berry jam and hot fudge to dip. so good. overall, great, casual, laid back feel. great staff and decent prices. i will be including photos. would def recommend and will go back next time we are in town.", 
            "i love guy and triple d so i reallllllly wanted to love this place, but unfortunately i was disappointed.\n\ni'm short, my experience was over priced and sub par.\n\nat around 2pm on a friday, there was quite a wait to sit inside, but immediate seating on the patio. we opted for the latter. the restaurant couldn't control the weather, but some misters out there would be nice.\n\nthe waiter took some time to get to us, which was particularly odd since there were only a couple tables seated outside. we ordered water and he had to come by twice to say our drinks were on the way... -_-\n\nwe passed on any appetizers as we found that section to be a little lacking. actually, i expected more from the entire menu.\n\ni ordered the cajun chicken sandwich and my fianc\\u00e9 ordered the signature mac and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. we both finished our waters and didn't have a refill until after our food arrived. \n\nmy <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark> tasted like the chicken had been pre cooked and then reheated with the vegetables and seasonings separately. the cheese was melted into the roll and then the filling placed on top. when it arrived, the cheese had hardened again-as if it had been waiting under a heat lamp for some time after being cooked. i asked for a side if ranch, and wouldn't you know...i finished half my food before it arrived.\n\nthe \"signature\" burger wasn't all that much better. first, they need to use a different bun. it fell apart immediately. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> itself was dry, overlooked, and under seasoned. i think they hoped all the other toppings would mask that. unfortunately, the mac and cheese was bland. the blue box at home would have left this stuff in the dust. the bacon was carelessly placed and hanging off the side  when it came.\n\ni will say the fries were good. a combination of curly, shoestring, crinkle cut, and waffle fries with some bbq cheddar kind of seasoning.\n\nit seemed like everything on the menu was $20. we passed on the disappointment of ordering a desert and chalked this experience up to something we could say we've done. :/", 
            "woof woof, *pant*, *pant*, *pant*, woof woof  (i'll get back to this).\n\nkeeping it real, this is an eatery created by a marketing group for a tv personality rather than a chef driven restaurant.  words like fresh, farm raised, organic are replaced by outta bounds, awesome, righteous,  slam dunk, mack daddy.  the flavors are very bold, bordering on over the top.  most components of a dish compete rather than compliment.    not a big deal if you spent the evening smoking a couple of cigars or killed your pallet on a packs of cigs.\n\nfor \"shareable\",  respectable \"sashimi won-taco\" (fried won ton skin shaped like a taco shell filled with ahi mixed with a mango jicama salsa and topped with an odd sweetened soy and a wasabi aioli).  passable but the aioli adds a flabbiness to the dish and obscures the flavor of the fish.  the \"<mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>\" are bizarre.  breadsticks are wrapped in pepperoni then self dipped into a fondue of  oil stabilized provolone, sausage, and tomato.  fans of a greasy pizza will be right at home.\n\non to <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> and burgers:\n\n\"come rod.  come here boy.  sit.  awww that's a good boy.  now shake hands.  awww rod's a good doggie\".\n\ncontrary to what my ex might say, i'm not a dog.  i don't expect my meal to be tossed on a plank, burger falling over, only half on the bun, toppings and sauce spilling everywhere and fries thrown on for good measure.\n\na \"big dipper\" features tender slices of prime rib, smothered by melting pepper jack cheese, topped by over seasoned deep fried onions in a garlic spread with excessive, bitter horseradish.  impossible to pick up, grease and oil mask the flavor of the beef.  the \"off-da-hook smash burger\" sports a decent mix of beef but obliterated by the cloyingly sweet, excessive bourbon bbq sauce.  they claim the bun is brioche, honestly the sauce kills the taste buds.  finally the \"<mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>\"  cloying, greasy, way over the top.  the overstuffed burger is impossible to pickup and messy to eat.  a side of flavorful but soggy fries accompanies all selections.\n\nprops for service.  fast and attentive.  \n\ngreat for the vegas tourist looking for the show.  locals and regulars look elsewhere.", 
            "we all love guy fieri and were excited to see his restaurant in the nearby quad. we arrived at 11am (just missed breakfast darn it) and were seated quickly. the restaurant does not have a kids menu, but our awesome waiter made sure our toddler was fed. he was good enough to check with the kitchen and we were able to order her a side of chicken and avocado. our 14 month old loved it! we ordered the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark>, tatted up turkey burder, <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>, and <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark>. all the entrees were delicious. our waiter was great and the hostesses were friendly and gorgeous. we all had an amazing experience and will be returning.", 
            "love guy fieri's show on the food network channel.  we had high expectations, but was sadly disappointed. the atmosphere was cool; we sat outside on the patio to listen to the music in the surrounding area/casino. our server looked like he did not want to be there and was not pleasant. the mac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> was huge and pretty good. my husband's <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> was over seasoned, leaving a bad taste. all our fries with our meals were all too salty - over seasoned!  even both our kids, who love fries, didn't like it or want any. the  <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark> were ok, nothing to brag about. our server never checked on us during the meal, then all of a sudden, another server was asking if we wanted dessert. we kindly declined and asked for the bill. when we got it, some of the billing/charges were incorrect. if you have a \"total rewards\" players card, each of the meal prices should be discounted. this had not been the case,  only two items were discounted; the new server blamed our first server since he entered our order on the system/computer. please review your itemize receipt before paying. they fixed the bill after we addressed it to the server, but if we didn't review it, then we would have paid more.",

            "good food, good atmosphere, but a little disappointing. \n\nhaving watched guy's show, i was excited to eat here. i even remember cheering for him on his initial appearance on a food network amateur cooking competition show. and then i read about his menu...i was looking so forward to the mac & cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> thinking it sounded as good as it could get. \n\ni arrived with 8 friends and it took about an hour and a half for a table to open. the interesting thing is that while i sat at the bar waiting, there were more than several empty tables around. \n\nwhen we sat down, the waiter was friendly and delivered our menus then literally disappeared for 20mins. after our orders were placed, the appetizers arrived promptly. i had the fondue dipper....breadsticks, wrapped in pepperoni, with a bowl of chews to dip them in, truly a guy's heaven. the food was gobbled up and we sat waiting. so we ran down the waiter and ordered another round of drinks, and we waited. (there seems to be a theme here). the drinks came, we kept talking and drinking and waiting for our food. when it came, it looked incredible. it was presented very well. \n\ni launched into my burger with gusto expecting to be astounded...and i got only \"meh\". such a shame! i so wanted that burger to be the end all. it was good, just not great. but it was huge! a couple could split this and still take some home. \n\nand then the bill came. i had a beer, a burger, a coke, and an appetizer...$56. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> alone was $20. \n\nall in all it was decent. and i loved the super open kitchen they have so you can watch them at work. maybe the public view keeps the cooks from adding the magic because the food, although good, was uninspiring. then add in the price (given its on the strip and has strip prices), i don't think i'll return - there are plenty of other awesome good burgers in vegas.",

            "guy fieri's in las vegas is exactly as guy's show is on the food network, big burgers and lots of fries. the interior is indicative of his style with the clipboard menu and the wood planks that hold the drinks menu. our server, brittany provided great service. the kitchen is an open design where you can see what all of the line cooks are doing inside.\n\nfor two, we ordered the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> (truffles), the bacon mac n cheese burger, and <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark>. the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> are very thin cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> that come with micro-planed truffle shavings, gouda cheese and parsley sprinkled on top. the thin cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> are very crispy, and have great texture. the gouda cheese gives the fries a nice cheesy taste without overwhelming the taste of the fries or the truffles. the truffle, just as importantly was not overwhelming as well, providing an extra layer of flavor with the earthy, mushroomy tones. the creamy white truffle dip really did just taste like sour cream. as the price would suggest, the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> do come with a lot of fries. i would recommend sharing this with up to 4 people if everyone is having a burger as well.\n\nthe <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> is a charbroiled burger topped with a mac and cheese that is slightly better than average. other toppings included crispy deep fried onion stings, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> comes with what would be the equivalent of a medium mcdonalds fries (more on this later). the tomato really did not add much to this burger and really could have been either left off or given another slice of. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> patty alone was actually a little dry and could have been a bit moister. the mac-n-cheese was not supermelty as the menu would have you believe, but was tasty anyway. the donkey-sauce, i believe, is the bbq sauce at the bottom <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>. the apple-wood bacon brought in salty and smoky flavors to the party and is always a great addition to a burger or mac-n-cheese. the brioche bun brought in some sweetness to balance all of the salty flavors in between. i wish there was a bit more pickle, but i just like pickles. overall, this burger was good, but short of great or excellent.\n\n<mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> is a charbroiled burger topped with blue cheese and bacon, with addition toppings of crisped onion strings, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> is also served on a brioche bun and this also helps balance out the flavors a little. the blue cheese was actually a little overwhelming on some parts of that burger, some areas of it had a ton of blue cheese and other areas had little to none. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> did have some interesting spice flavor to it, but it was difficult to discern what those were among the blue cheese. this burger also had the same problem with the dryer burger patty as the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. overall, this burger was good as well, it just could have used a bit more attention to detail to prevent that blue cheese from being overwhelming in certain areas <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.\n\nthe fries that come with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are crunchy just like the fries with the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, but there is a bit of variation, some are thicker cut home fries, mixed in with a few waffle fries, and the super thin cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> as well. the larger fries are seasoned with a spicy cajun type seasoning or spicy seasoned salt.\n\noverall, this was a good meal with solid flavors. i think that i can make a better mac-n-cheese with just three cheeses and have it actually be supermelty. the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> suffers from not having that supermelty cheese as well as a slightly moister patty. <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> has the same problem with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> patty and needed a bit more attention to detail. overall, the food was a solid 3/5 and the interior/service was an excellent concept for guy's restaurant (4/5). in any other location, i would consider the price and knock this down one star for the price based on the offerings. however, in vegas, it seems pretty average. guy fieri's gets a 3.5/5 with all things considered.", 
            "great comfort food! vibrant atmosphere! awesome service! tasty drink menu!\n\ni'm very much a fan of this place. as most signature-chef las vegas restaurants along the strip tend to feel like a black-tie event and pretentious. sometimes you just want to have a good time, relax and eat really good food. and this place absolutely does it.\n\ni had the mac cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> and wow did it taste magnifique. not too salty, not overbearing, not messy but just right. definitely give it a try and it will be one of the best burgers you'll ever taste in las vegas.", 
            "came here for their late night menu (served from 10pm-midnight). what caught my eyes was the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. this was a very creative burger and it turned out alright. not the best burger, and not the worst i've had. their firey chicken wings has this acquired taste that i just can't land my taste buds on. it came with their homemade blue cheese that just tasted weird to me. their <mark>Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries</mark> were probably the best thing on the late night menu that i've tried. \n\nhowever, our server was super. he was very attentive, friendly, and polite. great job there! i'll probably give this place another try during the day when they serve their full menu.", 
            "this was our one must-do dining experiences in vegas for the infamous <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>.  we waited ten minutes to get on the wait list.  we were told the wait would be 25-30 minutes but only took about 15 minutes probably because of the number of people not willing to wait that long.  \n\ninitially service was good, drinks were prompt.  we ordered and waited, and waited.  after 40 minutes, we were informed they were out of <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and would have to choose something else.  well, there is not much else on the menu for one that is allergic to hoofed animals.  finally they substituted unseasoned sliced turkey on <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.  at that time i communicated my concern about the amount of time we had already waited.  they said they would get right on it and bring it all out.  fifteen minutes later a server (not our waiter) brought out the food.  it did look amazing, but that's where it ended.  the pulled pork sandwich and <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> had obviously been sitting in wait of the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>.  everything was cold and the coleslaw had made the roll completely soggy.  the substitute turkey sandwich was pathetically bland.\n\ni would have mentioned this to our waiter but he became david copperfield and vanished. we had to flag down other wait staff to ask for something to put on the bland turkey sandwich.  we didn't see our waiter again until he brought out the $80 check for 3 burgers, he never did ask how the food was, i'm sure he knew. they did not even offer menial compensation for substituting as sub-par sandwich in place of a $20 burger.\n\nvery disappointed.",

            "let me first say that i usually don't like bar food but this place just took it and ran. when we arrived there was a line but we waited for only 10 minutes which was super awesome.  we sat near the bar at a booth which was sitting high off the ground. i noticed that this place looks like it should be sitting in texas somewhere due to the atmosphere and the way the help staff was dressed. never would have pegged guys restaurant as country. \nthe food was absolutely delicious! to start we ordered  the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>. the cheese sauce for this was the best i had. i would have never put pepperoni around a pretzel stick but it was really good. my husband ordered the mac & cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>, which we were told that it is the most popular burger they have. he said it was really good. i ended up ordering the <mark>Pic-a-Nik Sandwich</mark>. it was surprisingly good. the cranberry relish is a little out there but it works and they also put bbq chips on <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> but nothing i can complain about. \ni give this a five star because the food was outstanding and everything i expected from guy fieri", 
            "pretty darn good food. a little pricy; but hey; it is vegas. went with a party of 18 from work so we had a somewhat fixed menu. i had the macaroni and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. it was very good. excellent appetizers to include the mini <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>, pepperoni wrapped pretzel rods and french fries with a spicy dip. over all very tasty and i didn't have to pay the bill, so the price really didn't matter to me. i have been there twice now and there is always a line to get in.", 
            "first off why is this listing guy fieri?  the name of the restaurant is guy fieri's vegas kitchen and bar.  i've tried updating the name and it was denied.  so annoying.  i mean there was a yelp event here.  you would think we could get the name right.  \n\nwe stopped in for a late dinner.  after 10 pm they have a limited menu, but are less busy so it's not too bad of a trade off.  there was a short line even though the restaurant inside and out was mostly empty.  parties of 4 or less wait in line.  5 or more check in with the hostess.  when we got to the front we were asked if we wanted to sit inside, outside or at the bar.  we didn't have a preference until the hostess told it would be 15 min wait for inside/outside or we could sit at the bar right away.  so the bar it was.  funny though that there was that much of a wait when there were dozen's of empty tables all around.  \n\nwe sat at the bar and got a cider and a guido's freaky tiki.  we ordered fireball whiskey wings, <mark>Quad Fries</mark> and <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>.  omg all of it was amazing.  so good.  i'll admit i was a little surprised.  i wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was.  i don't like chicken wings and i loved these.  <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was excellent.  loved the fries and all the dipping sauces.  portions are big enough to share.  don't be like the people next to us were trying to give us their fries because they each ordered <mark>Quad Fries</mark> and it was way to much.",

            "went in for my daughter's 18th birthday for our for our very first visit. i wanted to see what all the hype about guy was. my daughter and friends are oddly fascinated and possibly obsessed with going to 'flavor town'. we eat out a lot and have high expectations when comes to service and food. let's just say this visit led to us rerunning the following day with her brothers... it was amazing!!! the mac & cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> was delectable... the ranch was out of this world, i cannot even put it into words... did i mention it was on the happy hour menu? just typing this is making my mouth water, literally. nice size patty with bacon, lettuce, pickles and a lightly toasted bun... the flavor was unlike any other i had ever had before. the mac & cheese enhanced those flavors and took this burger to the next level. the fries came with ketchup, bbq sauce and yes friends, ranch!!! also on the happy hour menu was frozen peach ciroq shots for 9$ i could go on forever, but no worries, i won't. last but certainly not least was our server, chris anderson from glendora, ca. he was the best server that i've seen and took very good care of us. he made sure we had everything we needed and answered all our questions about the food, restaurant and 'our' new obsession, mr. fieri. a real genuine man who made sure our night out as a family was a memorable one. as i mentioned before, we eat out a lot and this is my very first yelp review. go check it out and you will be as in love as i am. thanks, we will be back again to 'turn on our flavor jets'.", 
            "my husband and i decided to try this place out for our first anniversary last week. my husband is a huge burger fan so this seemed like a sensible place to go. we didn't make a reservation since we were still on the fence about it all day. it was a friday night and i was expecting a much longer wait than what we were quoted, 40 minutes and that was accurate. \nthere was not enough room for everybody waiting so that was really annoying. the front staff just seemed to be unhappy to be there. the lead host they had barely even looked up from her computer while she spoke with the guests. i did observe an older couple coming up to the host stand, old man was very friendly but like i said, lead host had no personality and eventually seemed to make the old man uncomfortable with the exchange. this really frustrated me because when i used to work the service industry, i would never let my guest feel like this. i did not see her smile once during my 40-minute wait. the other hosts seemed friendlier but mostly seemed fake. i also saw a manager bossing everybody around but not helping out. big pet peeve!!! managers, you are not above your employees. if it weren't for their hard work, you wouldn't be around!\nwe finally got sat and our server was very friendly. she was very attentive to our table and she had a few others too. my husband likes to gulp his drinks so it tends to be a lot of work for the servers and we make up for it with our tip. this night, he didn't even need to ask for a refill. not once! i am kicking myself right now for not remember her name! i ordered a mojito and it was really good. husband and i tried the <mark>Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries</mark> for the appetizer. the waffle fries were amazing, the chili was good but nothing special. i had <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> and my husband tried the mac and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. the barbe<mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> was phenomenal and my husband enjoyed his burger. however, i still didn't feel that the prices were justified. i've had better and cheaper barbeque and that goes the same for my husband and burgers.\nthe portions are big and we didn't really have the table space for them but i guess we made it work. i really should have been more mindful of this but i really didn't expect that the music would be so loud. my husband and i couldn't have a normal conversation without having to raise our voices to a level past our comfort zone. i also noticed a busser slacking off, chatting it up with the servers when there were three dirty tables within five feet of him. i consider this an eyesore, the dirty tables and the lazy employee. \noverall, my husband and i had an okay experience. we will definitely remember not to come here for a romantic date night. this would be a great place to hang out with some friends though. food was great, server was great, music was way too loud for comfort, either a bigger wait area or more efficient seating during volume, managers need to be leaders, not bosses, friendlier front staff!\nwe most likely won't be back. maybe unless we were already in vicinity and hungry. then again, there's a few other restaurants we could try out for experience. only because we have burger and barbeque joints that we go to that are cheaper, better, and friendlier front staff.",

            "i have been meaning to try this for a bit now.  located between harrah's and the linq and proximate to the carnaval court's raucous party- i never seem to make it outside the pearly gate that is the loop around carnaval court.\n\nmy wait was reasonable, about 10 minutes or so.  the service was prompt and polite.\n\nthis is a burger stand pure and simple.  the selection of non-burger food is very, very minimal.  so, now that going in.\n\ni ordered a mac & cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> which was just fine.  the meat is actual meat and not a patty of pink slime from some stockyard somewhere.  when it is all ground together it is pretty hard to say what it is, but i felt like this was ground chuck due to the mouth-feel, the juice (that sounds gross), and the taste.  two enthusiastically thumbs up for using real meat.\n\nthe bun to meat ratio favors the bun by a lot.  but, when we consider the toppings, in my case mac & cheese, bacon, pickles, lettuce, and so on, the only way to pull it off is with big buns.  =)\n\nall of <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> come with a side of fries.  the fries stink!  i was a little surprised because they are so easy to season to add some flavor.  but ultimately the fries are crappy.  on my way out i saw the kitchen and the plates prepped with the fries and waiting on <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> under heat lamps.  there were dozens and dozens of plates with fries waiting on a sandwich.  maybe ask for fresh fries to go with your $20 burger.  i would.\n\nthat brings me to price points, i had a burger and a soft drink, came to $23 or so.  toss in a tip and what not, you are probably at $30/person assuming no appetizers or alcohol.\n\nso the final shakedown:  glad i finally tried it, once visit for me was probably enough but i would not run away from that place either.", 
            "good food but pricey. we paid $40 for the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> and the 68 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark>. no drinks besides water... our waiter was nice the couple of times he actually came over to our table..", 
            "another stop on my list to eat at when we were in las vegas. i love gastropubs and guy fieri's menu made it stand out above the rest! a lot of the menu items were fusion inspired and i love how that takes it to another level of food experience. located at the linq hotel. decided to come around lunch time on a weekend. i did not expect such a wait for this place, but to me, a line is always a good thing regarding food. says something about the popularity of it in my experience and has never been wrong. waited roughly 30 minutes. but well worth the wait!\n\nfor appetizers, we ordered <mark>The General's Wings</mark>. general tso's chicken, but in wing form. like a sesame chicken wing fort those unfamiliar with general tso's chicken. the plate looked lovely and <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were very crispy, and amazingly good! the crunchy dipping sides of crushed wasabi peas, rice crackers and peanuts added a very enjoyable texture that paired excellently well with each bite! \n\nfor our entree, my girlfriend and i both ordered the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. all i can say is mouthwateringly delicious!! the idea of having mac and cheese on a burger was genius! <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> itself was juicy and worked very well with the garlic-buttered brioche bun. it was all presented lovely with the side of fries...4 different ways! \n\nwe wanted dessert, but were way to full to even have a bite! but will definitely save from for next time! highly recommend guy's!!", 
            "wow...no doubt about it this place has the best burgers i have ever eaten. i ordered the mac n cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> and could not have been more pleased. the service took about 25 minutes but well worth the wait. i would give this place 6 stars if i could.  \n\n<mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> is tender and cooked perfectly. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was topped with their signature sauce, crisp shredded lettuce, thinly sliced pickles, and too top that all off...mac n cheese and 2 slices of crisp bacon.

            "my girl friend and i stopped in here to grab a bite to eat for lunch and were not disappointed. she got the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and i got the mac n' cheese burger. both were very delicious and full of flavor. <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> came with \"variety\" fries which were seasoned very well. for being a new restaurant and the strip and celebrity themed i would say that the prices were very fare. \n\nno problem with the service. received some suggestions for the menu which seemed a little to \"scripted\" and not genuine. only problem we had was when we were asked where we wanted to sit we asked for inside and ended up getting put right next to the large open doors, which made it a little chilly and not feel like we were inside since it was windy out. \n\noverall good food, prices, and service. would suggest if you are looking for a place that offers a good burger and fries", 
            "i'm a huge guy fiery fan! this guy always makes my mouth water every time it watch his show! and to have him open a restaurant in vegas! now that's amazing you know your not in for a disappointment! with that said, i ordered the tatted up <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> now that was a huge juicy burger! i loved it and i couldn't finish it! the menu had a verity of food to chose from i'll definitely be back to try other foods!", 
            "let me start with saying the service was excellent.  it did take longer than i think it should have to get seated by the hostess for it not to be crowded. but not a crazy wait and they were nice.  \ni had the original smash burger and my friend had the tatted <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>.  the meat patties are larger than the bun. they also come with assorted french fries which i love.  my burger was delicious however if i order a burger again i would order it medium as all burgers are made medium well. i wish my burger had more bbq sauce on it, however i devoured it so fast i didn't have time to ask for an extra side.  the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> was good as well but not as good as the the smash burger.\nthe portions are healthy so unless you are with a group it is hard to even want to order and appetizer.\nwe shared the <mark>Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae</mark>.  a terrific idea, since i love deep fried ice cream and think the best one comes from el torito when they use chocolate chip ice cream.  the idea was good execution poor.  it comes with a side of caramel syrup, chocolate syrup, whipped cream, bananas and peanut butter, pineapple, and strawberries.  all the sides were great it was just the fried shell was not up to par.  the cornflakes were bland and seemed stale tasting.  maybe needing to be fried longer or something.  it just wasn't what i hoped for.  regardless my inner fatboy still devoured it.\ni would definitely come back i want to try the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> along with some other dishes.  \nyou can also use your total rewards card to pay for your bill so that was great all i had to do was leave the tip.", 
            "one word...awesome! i loved their system of texting you when your table was ready. our server was phenomenal. it did take a while to get our cocktail drinks. but our food came out fast, i'm glad we didn't order any appetizers! i had the mac & cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. it was everything i thought it could be and more. it was just delicious and i highly recommend it. it's cooked medium well but was still really juicy and loved the mix of fries you receive with it. it's a big burger and will get messy, but you will enjoy it!  my friend had the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and she liked hers as well. it was a great time, and the staff was very friendly. thanks guy! :)", 
            "awesome rings with kicked up ketchup. husband had carne asada <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark> and i had tatted up <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>. both were really good. burger was big and with shredded lettuce a bit messy, just saying. didn't stop me from eating it though. could only finish half with the rings. husband finished tacos (four small ones). service was friendly and timely. would go again.", 
            "i've been fortunate enough to dine here three times since it's opening. guy fieri's vegas kitchen is located inside the quad hotel & casino. if you're familiar with guy fieri on tv and his personality. you will see it echoed prominently in the look & design of his restaurant. even the attitude & energetic atmosphere exuded by the employees represent guy fieri's style. of course, if you find guy fieri's persona & shows unappealing, this would not be the place for you.\ni've tried the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>, '67 cajun chicken sandwich & mac & cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> entrees. all were awesome, full of flavor. each comes with a fry mix & <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are massive. the mac & cheese was quite rich. some might find it too much so, but heck, theres mac & cheese in there, what do you expect right? the '67 surprised me in that the blackened chicken was super tender & cooked perfectly.  and a tasty <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> is always a good thing.\ntheir appetizers were all very yummy too. my favorites are the rojo rings, onion rings that come hanging on a pipe accompanied by a sriracha ketchup. the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, giant breadstickers wrapped in pepperoni with a sausage & provolone cheese dip. i was even dipping my fries in the cheesy dip 'cause i loved it so much.\nwaiters & servers were very attentive & lively. i was also fortunate enough to meet mike, the manager of the establishment. i would be willing to go out of my way to the quad just to come to guy fieri's. i do find it interesting that one of the low end hotel casinos on the strip is home to two great food spots. hash house and here. definitely earns a 5 star rating in my book!", 
            "i have been wanting to try this place out for awhile. so went here with a few friends. i ordered the sashimi tacos. its basically 4 mini tacos from the appetizers. they were good but just needed a little bit more flavor. i thought if they added 1 more taco then it would be worth spending $14 for it. the sashimi was fresh and the shells are a soft crisp. they broke apart pretty easily. also tried <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark>. its only enough for 3 people. they give you only 3 pieces of lettuce and assorted chicken. its ground chicken, skewered chicken and chicken egg rolls. my friends had a regular burger and and a <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>. both dishes came with 3 or 4 assorted fries. it had good sized portions.\n\nfor a drink, i got the java guava. really good. it had a little spice to it. it came with a jalapeno on the side. dessert, we ordered a simple mint chocolate chip ice cream with oreos. nothing too special. it was just drizzled in fudge and oreos. also a good portion. its enough for 3-4 people.\n\noverall, its an ok place. the location of the restaurant is facing the street. it also has outdoor seating. so people watching can be interesting.", 
            "i had the mac and cheese burger, and my girlfriend had the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>.  she described it as the \"best <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> she has ever had\".  my burger was really good as well.  the fries that came with it were pretty cool... they gave you an assortment of types (waffle, shoestring, curly, etc). it was a lot of food... we also had the <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> .  not my favorite dessert... the description didn't say that it was deep fried (like a doughnut) but it was.  we didn't finish it.\n\nthe restaurant itself was really pretty cool... but i think most of the restaurants i vegas are... they certainly charge enough.  we had 2 specialty cocktails at the bar while we waited for our table (that we're really good and the bartender as really cool)  that cost us $24 plus tip and then our burgers,  1 more rail drink and a dessert for a little more then $60.\n\noverall, i would recommend this restaurant if you want a really good burger while your on the strip", 
            "we had the pleasure of eating here twice in the same day.  guy is the bomb, so we figured his joint would be, as well. \n\nthe restaraunt is very nice and the open kitchen rocks.  the wait staff was fun and attentative.  \n\nall of the decor, uniforms, menu and experience  totalled up to be very guyish.  dug it. \n\nour meals, however, were a bit up and down.  i'll describe each meal and dish seperately. \n\nlunch: \n\n2 people - 0 wait time\n\napp: \nultimate chicken wrap - this was very good.  consisted of a few small egg rolls, a few chicken skewers, and lettuce wraps with three sauces (spicy sweet/sour, soy, satay).  this was a great start to the meal. \n\nmeal: \n<mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>.  it is big and awesome.  great flavor. this comes with a medley of fries with a very good seasoning.  i, now, have a mission to find ancho bacon.  \n\nimpression: this was a great experience.  my wife and i loved our meal.  \n\ndinner: \n\n5 people - 20 minute wait time\n\napp: \nrojo rings:   both of these were brought out quickly.  the onion rings were good and crispy.  they had good seasoning on the batter and the sauce was great.   \n\nnachos del jefe: the nachos (holy batman!) were killer.  these little chips are a sublime mix of mild chorizo and cheese that bring flavortown down to it's knees praying.  they are that good.\n\nmeal:\n\n<mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>: friend had this and loved it.  \n\nvictors <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark>: very average and small.  the tortilla's weren't really prepped at all. friend stated that this was bland and needed more salsa. \n\n<mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>: this was were the rails came off.  this sandwich is an exact replica of the deli cowboy from jason's deli.  it is a very saucy pulled pork.  all you can taste is a bbq that i would expect any joe blow to be able to prep in their crock pot.  to make matters worse, the waitress stated that this sandwich was the absolute best thing on the menu.  i don't think the chick from vegas knows what real bbq should be.  when you have tp pay $20 bucks for it, it just makes you disappointed.  \n\ndessert: \n\n<mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>: this was ok.  it looks cool, but it came accross too greasy.  it is really big and all in all, too much grease and sweetness to eat all of it.... even for 5 of us sharing one dessert.  \n\ni would have marked this a 5 after lunch... but, a few pieces of the dinner made this a big dip.  that pulled pork sandwich should really, really be re-considered.", 
            "was not impressed at all.\nmy husband and i split the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and mac & cheese burger. \nthe <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> was cold but otherwise tasty. the mac & cheese burger was not seasoned well and very bland. \nservice was horrible. our waitress was in la-la land. she explained the menu but took forever to take our order and re-fill our waters. \nwe will not return.", 
            "it's everything you would expect from guy. outstanding. huge burgers full of innovative flavors and sauce combinations. i had the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and have been back twice to order it again. you won't be disappointed. delicious. if you like guy, you will love this place.", 
            "walked in at 10:30pm after rock of ages show.  sat at the bar.  bartender was very nice and helpful for recommendations.  we enjoyed our food a lot.  it was unique.  my hubby and i split an order of the <mark>Double Barrel BBQ Wings</mark>.  they are lollipop style and had a nice ranch for dipping and the veggies were not just typical celery but radishes, peppers, carrots, etc.  then we had the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>.  it was the best <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> we've ever had.  it had smoked gouda and other fixings.  the fries that came with it were a mix of differen<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> which was really good.  ok draft beer selection.  we each had one beer. good meal for $56 in vegas!", 
            "visited guy's restaurant in the quad on sunday night.  we were seated right away on the patio.   our waitress was rehearsed and unnatural.  no recommendations made.  we had the lettuce wraps which were very good.  i ordered the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> which was a huge disappointment.  <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was dry and bigger than the bun....normally that's not a bad thing but in this case, <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was dry, flat and burnt.  i almost sent it back.  my friend got the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> which she said were just ok.   for the price and the name, i expected much more.  if it weren't for the lettuce rolls, this place would've gotten 2 stars.", 
            "i have nothing negative to say at all.  i had the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and it was absolutely amazing. to bad i couldn't eat it all. the service was great. oh wait no i do have\none negative thing to say. the seating was ridiculous, after a long flight from nc we settled for the bar. of course it was probably the time of day but if i can visibly see tables are open and am told there is a 20 to an hour wait that is a problem. in such a high traffic area this should be well staffed. otherwise great food and beers. thanks for the experience guy fieri.", 
            "this place was top notch. we came to vegas for the weekend and ended up eating here twice. the chorizo nachos were amazing, and the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> was up there with the best burgers i have ever had, so juicy and full of flavor, not to mention giant. love this place. it is unique and really holds it's own out on the strip next to the other big time chefs' restaurants.", 
            "unbelievable! best burger ever.  we had to eat here.  my son says \"ramsay you went down big time!\". i agree. <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> and <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> were tried.  nick the sheriff was awesome too!  next time in vegas this will be a sure stop.", 
            "appearance\nwent to try guy's famous restaurant on a trip to vegas.\nhip trendy, american style decor.  metallic glad and woody appearance. also located on the strip to you can ppl watch from both inside or on the outside terrace\n\ngreat place to eat and watch the crazy, drunk ppl\n\nstaff\nyoung,  polite,  pretty, slim, smiling.   what more can you ask for!\n\nfood\n\nmenu isn't too large but there is a wide variety of foods.  i had a beer, sashimi taco and the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> which where delicious.  well decorated, good flavor. \n\nprice\n$44 for app beer and entree.", 
            "this is solid comfort food with little chefy nuances added that aren't necessary but will separate it from your other $15 burger joints. \nthe restaurant is pretty big and we showed up at around 5pm after work and we easily had our pick of inside or patio dining. we had two servers during our visit and both were genuinely nice and delivered great service.\nthe food is good, not healthy, but also not going to really knock your socks off either. the portions are humongous! plan on taking some home or sharing, girls. guys, you should be satisfied. we ordered the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> (friend loved it and if i come back, i will probably order that), the bacon mac & cheese burger, loaded <mark>Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries</mark>, and buffalo lollipop wings. the cocktails were good and like the food, was made with fresh ingredients. i wish i had room for dessert because they looked pretty good. \nby the end of our visit, it picked up a little more but this restaurant would probably do better in a different location.", 
            "by far the best burger i've ever had! we ordered the mac and cheese burger and the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and the truffle fries. i love that when <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> comes it also comes with an assortment on 4 types of fries. the truffle fries were simply amazing. right crunch and excellent flavor. since it was the two of us.. we decided to split <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> so we could try both.. i knew in my head that the mac and cheese was gonna be good... it has to be right??  well <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> was so good i might venture to say it's better than the mac and cheese. the meat on both was tender and juicy. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> ratio to bun was overwhelming larger than the bun.. awesomeness !! who wants to eat bun??? it's all about the meat.  eat <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> the way is was designed. don't add shit to it. why ruin a masterpiece? best burgers ever!!! if anyone can recommend a better burger please do but this it number 1 on my list. service was also great!! thanks chris for the extra truffle mayo for the fries and hooking us up with the total rewards price! yummm", 
            "quick disclaimer i am a huge guy fan so this  could be a little slanted. but, i honestly say best burger in vegas. i had the mac and cheese burger and it was beyond good. it included a mixture of fries and one of them was almost like a barbecue chip flavored fry. the service was quick. i would call it a little pricey, but it's on the strip so we expected that. my co-diners had the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and the regular burger and both loved them. we all agreed they were fantastic. guy's is a must visit if you are looking for a great burger on the strip!", 
            "it is so hard to review things in vegas because i feel like you have to judge them differently than you would other places.  everything is expensive and vegasy so you have to rate them based on other vegasy places.  so i must give guy fieri an average rating.  the food was good but not great and if i am paying vegas prices i want high vegas quality food.  \n\nthe restaurant is pretty small so if you don't have a reservation you will probably have to wait during peak times.  we arrived and were told it would be a 45 minute wait so we put our name down and then stacked out a place at the bar and were able to claim bar seating in about 5 minutes.  the service from behind the bar was very good, fast but not bothersome.  the specialty drinks ok but small for the price.  \n\ni had the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and it was better than most i have had at restaurants but still not as good as the one my husband makes at home.  i did find it funny that they put bacon on a <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> but hey that was fine with me.  i liked that the pretzel bun was good and soft like i prefer.  i also liked the fries that came with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.  they give you all sorts of different ones all together and they were all good.", 
            "we had the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, bacon mac n cheese burger, tatooed <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>. food was amazing! nick our server was wonderful. definitely come back and recommend to others.", 
            "the best <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> i have ever had!!! i was waiting for my food and thinking how blah my food was going to be and then bam a huge totally juicy <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>!!! i would come back to vegas just for this burger! good choice me!!!", 
            "oh mmmmyyyy god the best burger!\nwhat the hell us that damn amazing souse in there?!!!\nwe had the original, the mac& cheese and the flavor-town burger as well as the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> all were amazing!\nalso i should mention the staff are very friendly and the service is great!\nthank you", 
            "came here for food and drink. no complaints. the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> was so darn delicious and i'd come back just for that. the fries were a mix of every type of fry you can imagine (waffle, shoe string, steak etc) which was interesting. the drinks were very tasty. yes its a celebrity chef restaurant and it was pricey but i came away very satisfied.", 
            "what a treat  this place is. good ambiance and very good food with good presentation.wife and i had bowl of chili and split a <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> ( ok , really more like i had 3/4). look forward to coming back and trying his famous mac n cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>.", 
            "the food good for the most part. friend and i split two burgers between in. the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> was amazing. it has great flavor and was a good size. the second burger: <mark>The Triple B Burger</mark> was awful. they went extremely heavy on the blue cheese so you can't taste anything. also they didn't cook <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> the way i request. i asked for medium well and it came back medium rare. as for the service, our waiter was great and very help. as for the girls in front (who welcome and seat guest) i didn't appreciate the look they gave me when i asked if there was a discount for total rewards members (loyalty program with the company they're apart of)", 
            "had the tatted up <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>.  awesome but messy.   fries were delicious too and bf really enjoyed his hot wings.  my only complaint is about service.   staff is slow and hostess said there was a 25 minute wait for seating in the bar when there were numerous tables open,  but that we could sit on outside ring (bar height seating) facing harrahs.  so we do.but then move to another table (that's clearly open and a better spot) and the waitress let's us sit there but says the hostess didn't let us at sit at table because she is \"controlling the flow\".  what?  first i think it might be because of our age but then see several other come, some go, and sit in that area when there are still open tables.  completely ridiculous.  and the reason i've had so.kuch time to write all of this is because we are still waiting for our check!", 
            "this was a phenomenal dining experience. it's friendly enough to not be pretentious but it does it with great flavor and filling food. its not crazy extravagant meals that are science projects gone wring, this is quality food done with pride. i've been twice and i had the \"tatted up <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>\" and i've had the \"<mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark>\", both were flavorful and exactly the right size to not make you feel gross but to quench your hunger. the beer selection matches the food in thought and flavor. \n\ni just moved to vegas and this will be a regular place for me.", 
            "i expected a lot more out of this place.  the atmosphere was cool and casual.  my sister had the pork ribs which were a bit dry (hard to find with a pork rib) .  the ribs came with cornbread and mac n cheese.  the mac n cheese was very bland, and the cornbread a bit under cooked.\n\ni had a <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>.  <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was twice as big as the bun with an extra slice of turkey inside.  the flavors were not bad, but <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> itself was not something i would ever order again.\nhave to say the manager gave us a discount and was very receptive to our complaints.", 
            "this was our one must-do dining experiences in vegas for the infamous <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>.  we waited ten minutes to get on the wait list.  we were told the wait would be 25-30 minutes but only took about 15 minutes probably because of the number of people not willing to wait that long.  \n\ninitially service was good, drinks were prompt.  we ordered and waited, and waited.  after 40 minutes, we were informed they were out of <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and would have to choose something else.  well, there is not much else on the menu for one that is allergic to hoofed animals.  finally they substituted unseasoned sliced turkey on <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.  at that time i communicated my concern about the amount of time we had already waited.  they said they would get right on it and bring it all out.  fifteen minutes later a server (not our waiter) brought out the food.  it did look amazing, but that's where it ended.  the pulled pork sandwich and <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> had obviously been sitting in wait of the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>.  everything was cold and the coleslaw had made the roll completely soggy.  the substitute turkey sandwich was pathetically bland.\n\ni would have mentioned this to our waiter but he became david copperfield and vanished. we had to flag down other wait staff to ask for something to put on the bland turkey sandwich.  we didn't see our waiter again until he brought out the $80 check for 3 burgers, he never did ask how the food was, i'm sure he knew. they did not even offer menial compensation for substituting as sub-par sandwich in place of a $20 burger.\n\nvery disappointed.", 
            "ok well first off, it states that the restaurant is inside the quad. the hotel is now re-branded as the linq.\n\nanyway, i have been here a couple times and each time i thoroughly enjoyed my time!\n\ni love the vibe of this whole restaurant. from the really big ice cubes they serve with your drinks, the design of silverware, to the uniforms that the workers have to wear, this restaurant is so fun!\n\ni ordered <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> as an appetizer, which were so good dipped into the smoky provolone cheese dip. i ordered a <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> as my entree. the pretzel bun was really good, and <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> itself was huge! my favorite part is their fires. they mix several different types of fries together, which i think is really fun. the only thing is that they don't serve a lot of fries with the entree and i definitely could have eaten more of them. i also dipped my fries into the left over smoky provolone dip and it was really tasty. \n\nthe second time i went it was late at night so they had a smaller a la carte menu. i order the <mark>Southern Smothered Chili Bowl</mark>, and a side of fries. the fries were the same mixture as the first time! the <mark>Southern Smothered Chili Bowl</mark> was really good, but the corn bread wasn't anything special like i had hoped. \n\nthe service was great each time i went. everyone is really lively and upbeat just like the restaurant is. overall i really enjoyed my experiences here and i definitely will be coming back!", 
            "we came at 10:30 so we only had the late night menu. we ordered the truffle fries which we're awesome! the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> was the best i've ever had. <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were also good. the service was great too. loved this place!!!",

            "i'm only giving two stars because the fries were good , they took the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark> off the menu , they were out of the italian <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> , they were out of the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and they were out of the ribs , which was about 1/2 the menu , service was good and the food we got came out fast i guess because they don't have much other stuff to cook lol", 
            "first off, the french fries are awesome! they almost taste like they have lays barbecue chip seasoning on them. so good! \n\nwe came here on a monday night, and just had to wait about 15 minutes for an outdoor table. service was quick, and the waitstaff was great. the outdoor space is a decent size and it's covered, so you don't have to worry about the sun beating down on you on a hot day. \n\nback to the food: large portions! if you are visiting and can't store a doggy bag, definitely consider splitting. there were 3 of us, and we split 2 items, which was the perfect amount of food. we got <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> and the tatted up <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>. <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> were like 3 different meals in one- you get spring rolls, chicken skewers and the lettuce wraps. the chicken skewers were pretty good, but i wasn't blown away by the lettuce wraps or spring rolls. the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> on the other hand was the best i've ever had. when my friends wanted to order a <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> i was a little disappointed, but i absolutely loved it. there were so many flavors, so this was anything but boring! \n\nthis is a great casual dining spot on the strip, and the prices are pretty reasonable. this will be a go to place when i have visitors in town.", 
            "the worst place ever sorry guy i love you, but this was awful. i looked at the menu before we got there and it looked good....so first off we get there they have no nachos (their seasonal) wtf....second i order a <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and they have no more turkey ridiculous! and lastly i order hot wings which is my favorite but i wanted something else...the menu said larger wings (i wonder how small they were before) because mines was baby cornish hens size lbvs...i then asked the waiter since they didn't have the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> can i get some complimentary fries he said we'll see (what)...of course i didn't get them. \n\noh yeah i almost forgot <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are damn flat and crunchy my sister said the worst burger ever! i'm glad i didn't get one lol", 
            "every time i am in vegas i have to dine here if only for the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>.  topped with blue cheese and fried to a golden brown.  served with wasbi blue cheese - light my mouth on fire!\n\nthe original ring burger the slaw does all the talking.  as for the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> little bitty bun and lots of flavor.  the meat hangs over the side.  some nights get a pitcher of beer for $10 and call it a day.", 
            "i feel it necessary to update my previous review. we had a waitress named michelle this time.she was friendly and helpful and did a good job. service is still slow but that's from the kitchen. our drinks were kept full and she was efficient.\nhubby and grandson who is 9 ordered the motley q bbq sandwich to share and it was still yummy. i had the chili topped with cornbread and it was wonderful!! daughter had <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and she said it was very tasty! we had the churros...again delicious..shared the <mark>Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae</mark> which is a big ball of ice cream rolled in frosted flakes..deep fried ...served on a bed of shredded coconut..on the side to do your own thing is chocolate syrup, caramel, peanut butter and banana, strawberries, pineapple and honey. my daughter said she would eat it everyday at every meal it was so good!!\nadditionally his version of the mojto (forgot the name) got good reviews from my daughter.",

            "sadly this was nothing special. waited about 20 minutes for outdoor seating. our waitress had as much personality as a toad sitting on a lily pad. zero expression and not even a one word response when we ordered. i had the turkey bar and it was boring. i was very disappointed that it didn't even come out all that hot as the cheese was not melted and the bacon was black. turns out the bacon is cajun and had decent flavor but again not hot. the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> itself had no flavor and whatever the donkey sauce is was one tiny squirt that brought nothing to the dish. my friend had a burger and she said it was good...and she also got twice as many fries as i did. i am a fry whore...i love them...and eat them even when they aren't all that good...like at this place. just another famous name on a mediocre restaurant.", 
            "our server chris andersen provided the best service in the 10 days we spent in vegas. although it was incredibly busy, he took the time to ask where we were from, then proceeded to tell us they could make caesars! he was friendly and welcoming, which was a really nice change from other restaurants. \n\nthe food was good. <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> was juicy and had lots of flavor. the chili waffle fries were delicious!", 
            "i wish i liked it more. we were staying in the hotel (never again btw) and after looking at the menu we decided to try it. we obviously had to get the mac n cheeseburger. i think we all would have ordered it if i didn't convince my bf to get the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> which was good but i mean it's turkey not beef. anyway <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was good but it seemed like it had been sitting under a heat lamp.. the mac \"melted\" off the patty but then it just looked like hard cheese. i like that it came with seasoned fries, crinkle, thin, and wedge. i probably wouldn't suggest to come here again bc there are so many other places to eat in vegas, but i'm glad i at least tried it and if someone wanted to try this burger i would go with them.", 
            "i really, really enjoyed my overall visit. i loved the decor and liked that they had a foozball table to play with for those who are waiting. the area next to the hostess table had a lot of guy's merchandise, from books to shirts, so there is something for everyone from hardcore guy fans to those who just want a souvenir. there is seating inside, outside, and at the bar. the seating outside is okay, since you can people watch. but even with the misters, it was too hot and the view is just of the entrance of the linq and harrahs. while waiting, they have some guy memorabilia, like his unlv chef coat, to view and the kitchen is open so you can see <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> coming out.\n\nwe ended up sitting near the windows. i loved that the windows added natural light and allowed you to see the strip. i liked the decor from the napkins to the menu clipboards and tables, it was very guy-esque. \n\nthe food was very delicious and surprisingly filling. each burger comes with a mixture of waffle fries, shoestring fries, and crinkle cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> with seasoning. i got the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and i loooved it!! it's the best <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> i've ever had. it was so tasty and everything in and on <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> complimented one another. i tried some of my brother's off-da-hook original smash burger and it was also super delicious.\n\nservice was great. we were greeted right away upon arriving. our waiter was nice and attentive. bonus, our food came out right away after ordering. fyi, there is no restroom in the restaurant, but outside in the linq to the right when you exit. \n\noverall, i recommend coming here because as guy would say, \"it's off the chain!\"", 
            "customer service: slow...ended up having another waitress help us box our food due to our waiter was no where to be found\n\nwait time: can be long if you go during prime time meal times...(rather then going @ 12p go at 2p)...waited only a few mins.\n\nseating: indoor/outdoor\n\nfood: generous portions \n\nground <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>: tasty and filling\n\nasian chicken wrap (lettus wrap): very flavorful, comes w/ 3 different dipping sauces.", 
            "loved it! even better than expected. i got the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>. it was not dry, it was a a thin hand pattied burger that had great grill top flavor and the pretzel roll complimented it really well. i had the margarita with jalapenos, it was pretty good, my glass was broken..badly.. but he got me a new one.  service was questionable in the beginning but he got better.  we loved the menu and the atmosphere. we were not going to get dessert until our server said the words \"s'mores monticristo\" . sold. one of the best things i have ever tasted. no matter what you get....end with that dessert. seriously. not kidding.", 
            "i must say that i ate the absolute best <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> ever here. usually <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> can be kinda dry.  the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> here was moist, even succulent and beyond flavorful. it's huge so i shared it with s friend.  the assortment of different types of fries were quite tasty.  we sat at the bar so we wouldn't have to wait for a table.  the bartenders were wonderful especially a pretty blonde who gave us free shots bc my bf is a cop. will definitely visit again.", 
            "what can i say other than omg, i had the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> which was absolutely amazing, super tasty, really filling, just generally super.  my husband had the nachos which he thoroughly enjoyed, they had brisket and a delicious bbq sauce\n\ni had fries with my burger which were nice as they were different varieties e.g skinny fries, crinkle cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> etc.  \n\ni like the decor and atmosphere here, we were seated outside which was great for a warm vegas evening.\n\nmy negatives however, firstly there were a tonne of people waiting to be seated despite the fact there were lots of empty tables.  the music was horrendously loud to the point where my husband and i couldn't hear ourselves to have a conversation....what is it with this as it seems to be a common thing here in vegas?  \n\nthe biggest negative for me was the stupid wooden tray/plate that the food was served on.  i think that anything wooden in the kitchen can be quite unhygienic (we've all heard of  chopping boards harbouring bacteria) but they also line the wooden plate with paper which eventually softens from the juice in the meat and i ended up with several mouthfuls of goopy paper where is had stuck to my food, not a pleasant sensation for me nor for anyone noticing me digging it out of my mouth!!!!\n\noverall i really enjoyed this place and would definitely come back if i am in town again some day.", 
            "i came here for the fabulous yelp elite event prior to opening and i had the most amazing experience! my second visit was with ruben and my brother since i wanted them to check it out. the service was fantastic and gm mike was just as hospitable as the first time! my most recent visit was a couple weeks ago and the menu hasn't changed with exception of the removal of dishes like the rojo onion rings and churros. some of the food wasn't as good as i recall. service was still great and they're always insanely busy (no reservations). \n\nbrisket nachos ($17)\n<mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> ($15)\n<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> ($14)\n<mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> ($14)\nfireball whiskey wings ($16)\n<mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> ($18)\nseared flat iron poutine ($32)\n14-hour beef brisket ($34)\n\ni love the concept of <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> because of the multiple options, but the chicken is always salty and the sauces are just okay. the nachos are terrible. i do really enjoy the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, but again, salty. all of the entr\\u00e9es are decent. i haven't had a bad sandwich, but there are so many different flavors going on that it borders on too much. for example, the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> is grilled with poblano and pepper jack cheese, and has gouda, sweet pepper red onion jam, donkey sauce, and garlic butter on the bun. it's good, but it could do without one or two ingredients.", 
            "this was a second visit for sunman and my first visit.  it is conveniently located right off the strip in the linq hotel/casino lasvegas.  the staff are extremely friendly but can't get a simple order correct for the life of them.  wine is wine and there aren't that many beers to overwhelm the average bartender.\n\nwe spoke with other diners who had ordered <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and were not happy.  we had ordered the nachos with beef short rib which we had ordered without cilantro.  to our dismay, the nachos came with extra cilantro and were sent back.  on an afternoon with very little business, i would have expected that the order would be correct.  it is very loud and lacked a special lure as compared  to other sites along the strip.  customer service was only so-so.  the next trip to las vegas will not include a trip to guy fieri's spot.", 
            "i was excited to try out this restaurant especially after watching his tv shows. unfortunately i haven't had such a terrible dining experience all around in years. first of all our waitress took about 15 minutes to come and welcome the table of 5 of us. once finally taking our drink order and after another 10 minutes our drinks came out and she took them off the tray and sat them at one end of the table expecting us to pass out our drinks. once the appetizers arrives they were cold, two different types of french fries. the entrees we ordered were like warm and my <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> was terrible. the bun was hard as a rock and the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> was burnt. everyone at the table complained about their food and we were all disappointed. unfortunately other diners that were exiting with us had a similar experience. the food smelled great but was sub par. don't waste your time."

            "we had asian wrap appetizers and had two of <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> the pulled pork and the roast beef,.\nsandwiches were hot and the appetizer was really good and tasty.\nlove the fries cause it's a combination of four different types, waffle, crinkle, sliced and shoestring very good!\nwill come back again....", 
            "i love gf and enjoy his shows on food network so i'm glad we were able to go to his new place.. i was worried it wouldn't be open in time cuz the place's opening date was supposed to be 'late april' so we lucked out really.. anyway, the decor and attire of the staff was very rock-cowboyish, and i was enjoying the general ambiance and environment.. the bar yells out when various events happen, like some patron is celebrating something, etc, it was hard to understand what the bartenders were yelling lol.. and there's an outside patio option for diners if they choose, but the down side to this is it's a big open wall so w/ it being a restaurant, flies and whatnot just roam freely throughout the place and chow down, very much interrupting diners like myself! so my suggestion would be to fix up that wall and make it a revolving door instead and just have outside speakers if u want the outside diners to still hear the music lol.. i ordered <mark>The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps</mark> app, and in general, it was a good deal, yums all around. then i got the big dipper sandwich, and omgosh, the whole plating thing was weird and i was not a fan! but b4 that, i found out that <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> has cheese caked on it, so i couldn't even peel it off, so they redid it w/o cheese and at no extra charge which i appreciated.. but yeah, <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> is a sub type w/ a bunch of prime rib meat stuffed into it lol (it had a weird smell but the meat tasted good lol, the bread got a bit soggy tho so i just ate the meat lol), it also came w/ a variety of fries w/ added flavor, and a big ass pickle (i'm a fan of certain pickles so i didn't mind and chomped on). so like i said, the whole plating of <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> was very awkward and messy. it's served on a cutting board type of 'plate' and it's cluttered like crazy w/ sauces in the corners, this weird downward slide for fries lol, and the sub that in my case was covered in thin onion rings which i just put to the side, oh and a big knife was stuffed underneath the sub for ur 'convenience' lol.. whoever thought this plating would be a good idea was an idiot, imo, i would've much preferred a regular plate! the whole plating deal they did was just messy and i got crumbs everywhere... so while i'm eating, i noticed all the diners around me keep asking the servers about gf and his personality/appearances at the restaurant lol.. of course the servers are gonna say he's a great guy and whatnot, he's their ultimate boss! but yeah i may have been the only one who didn't do that lol, but i'm not gonna lie, it would've been cool as hell to see the guy in person that i watch on tv a lot lol.. anyway, the end came and there's an option to do a customer satisfaction survey which i appreciated. it's a lil handheld device inside the check booklet lol, i thought that was particularly creative and i hope gf/the management takes my comments seriously.",

            "i wanted to update my review because the manager messaged me on yelp inviting me back to the restaurant. i appreciate the fact that they are concerned with their customers feedback. hopefully they will use the customer feedback and implement the necessary changes that should be made. they could start with either lowering their menu prices or purchasing higher quality product. i don't mind paying top dollar for top quality, but that is not what is offered here. i am not looking for a free meal. i just give honest feedback to inform other consumers. so, i want to be clear about why i gave them two stars on my review.\n\ni would give them five stars if the review was just based on their staff. the service was excellent. the staff is very friendly and attentive to the customers, as demonstrated by the manager showing concern about my review. the kitchen staff did a fine job on the preparation and the presentation of the food. i was disappointed with the quality of the product used in the perpetration. the prime rib in <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> and the meat in <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> were not up to par. the chicken wings were average at best and extremely over priced for what you are served. personally, i don't care for some of the flavor combinations on the menu.\n\ni want to be very clear about the fact that the kitchen staff cooked the food properly and presented it as they were supposed to. it was the quality of the product i gave two stats to, not the service or the preparation.\n\ni think my expectations of the food before i arrived led me to be so disappointed with the food. it is just average food though. it was not a bad meal and none of the food tasted bad. if the prices were not so high, i may have given them three stats. it is just not worth the money. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> are definitely not up to par with the likes of lbs, bacchi burger, and gordon ramsay burger. i would even say smash burger and fat burger serves better tasting burgers.\n\nto be fair, i will conclude by suggesting that you give them a try and make your own decision on the quality and taste of the menu items.",

            "i had very high expectations for guy fieri's restaurant at the quad.! unfortunately, i left feeling underwhelmed. customer service was very good. upon arrival, my group and i were immediately greeted by a group of hostesses. there had to be at least four of them standing there. they were nice but also very nonchalant. maybe that's because it wasn't really busy on a wednesday night and they all really didn't have anything to do. one escorted us to our table and we were almost immediately given water. about ten minutes after getting the water, our server approached us and gave us the menus. he also asked if we had any questions about anything on the menu or about the restaurant. he was very polite, informative, and attentive. \n\ni ordered the '67 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark> and my friends ordered the big dipper sandwich to share. i also ordered the \"lemon drop..not\" cocktail and the <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> dessert. the '67 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark> was just alright. i expected the bread to be soft, but i believe it was sourdough so it was a little harder than i prefer. the meats were seasoned well and the hot sauce added a nice tangy kick to <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>. i really liked the fact that they serve different types of fries: crinkle, waffle, and string. with that being said, the fries were not hot and tasted like they had been sitting in a warmer waiting to be served. when served fresh, mcdonald's fries are better than these were.! yes, i said it.!! the lemon drop cocktail was sweet, lemony, and delicious. the s'mores dessert was very tasty and served with strawberry and chocolate syrups, although, i would've liked for it to be served warmer. my friends enjoyed there big dipper sandwich with au jus sauce and left happy. (partially because they didn't have to pay for dessert..lol.) \n\nso service was good and the food for me was just okay. it definitely was not the best \"american diner\" i've been to. i'll have to go back and try some other things on the menu and maybe update my rating, but for now 3 stars is all it's getting from me.!",

            "i have been looking forward to trying guys food for a long time and i finally got the chance on my recent vegas vacation.  located at the linq hotel and casino the restaurant has a pretty hip vibe and some damn fine looking waitresses. the place is pretty tightly crammed together so it if your looking for a romantic dinner go elsewhere, but if you like an exciting place and good people watching then this fits the bill.the food however was hit and miss.  first off was the starter <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>. these were seriously good, as long as you like all things mushroom. crispy and thin shoestring fries are topped with black and white shaved truffles, truffled gouda cheese and are served with truffle dip. the portion was huge but of course we finished them all.\nnext up were the entrees. my turkey picnic sandwich entr\\u00e9e was great, perhaps one of the better sandwiches i have had recently. thick slices of moist roasted turkey are topped with cranberry relish, melted swiss, creamy coleslaw and (here's the kicker)...crunchy bbq chips. its all served between a sliced pretzel baguette slathered with guys  signature donkey sauce ( basically fancy thousand island dressing). that's a lot of stuff stuffed into one sandwich but it all mixed great together and every level of flavor showed up in each bite. also on the side of <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> were a mix of fries that were seasoned with bbq spices. not that i needed more fries but these were also excellent so i of course finished them.  as good as my sandwich was, i was very disappointed by my wife simones, <mark>Southern Smothered Chili Bowl</mark> entr\\u00e9e.  a rather large bowl of chili arrived to the table topped with melted cheese, sour cream, scallions and a big hunk of cornbread and it looked impressive. however, once we moved the cornbread the bowl itself was barely half full with the actual chili. then, after the first bite we both agreed that we have had better chili from the local wendys. someone took the wrong turn at flavortown and ended up at the no spice nursing home. this was perhaps one of the blandest bowls of chili i have had in recent memory. this was a disappointing end to an otherwise great meal. so at least in my experience i would say that depending on what you order you could walk away very happy or very letdown from guy's. i would return again but stick to <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> menu.", 
            "i struggled with giving two stars or three.   i went for breakfast last weekend on a thursday morning.  the atmopshere is pretty cool, the staff was attentive.   i ordered a bloody mary and a few minutes later received the biggest bloody mary i've ever had.  it was really pretty good and had about a pound of vegetables on the rim.  a few people around me asked about it and also ordered one.  i was very (happily) suprised when my bill came to find out it was only $10.   i didn't ask the price when i ordered and when it arrived i was thinking to myself.. i'm in vegas, this will probably be a $25 drink.  haha.\n\nfor breakfast i ordered the chicken fried bacon biscuits and gravy.   this is the reason for the two star review.  my meal was gross.  the chicken fried bacon was fried until it was almost black.  it was burnt.  the biscuit was very big and very dense and dry.  the gravy was lukewarm, lumpy, and pasty.  it wasn't very good gravy.  it tasted like flour.  they added way too much flour to the gravy for some reason and when it cooled down it gummed up.  if the star of the dish is biscuit and gravy, the biscuit and gravy better be good, which this was not.   the bacon was a big disappointment.  if you are going to bread and deep fry something like bacon (which i'm sure is actually kind of tough to do) then get it right or don't do it.  i would have been just as happy with regular bacon and good gravy.   \n\nsome of <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> i saw come out to other people looked really good, so maybe i just ordered the wrong thing.   i'm not local, so it will be a while before i come back to vegas again, but i probably won't try the food next time.  i would stop in for a bloody mary though and eat somewhere else!",

            "my family had eaten here months earlier and enjoyed it so i wanted to try it.  i didn't know where the restaurant was, and walked down the linq promenade looking for it.  once we walked around linq, we saw it on the corner across from harrah's.  we accessed the entrance from inside which was a narrow hall.  the hostess let us know it could be a 45 min. wait and we said ok, and then she said it could be faster.  there are 2 small benches outside of the hostess area in dark corners, as well as one seating area by the hostess stand.\n\nit took about 10 minutes and we were shown to our table with booth and chair seating.  we were close enough to our neighbours that we could touch them.  the menu seemed to have changed from my family's visit as the food they ordered wasn't on it.  i decided to get the pulled pork sandwich and although it's not listed, it comes with different cu<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> or a salad.  that's good as most of <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> and burgers are between $15-20.  \n\nthe food comes out fast! it was probably less than 5 minutes after ordering and i noticed that most people around us also got their food quickly.  the pork was nicely seasoned but tasted a little greasy on the bun.  the fries were good and i liked the crinkle cut ones.  the portion was big and i took half my sandwich to go, but we wanted to try the dessert.\n\nour dessert was a mountain of mint ice cream covered with chocolate sauce, cookies, and large chocolate chips.  it was hard as you make your way to the middle of the dessert but better than melting.  the server couldn't believe we were able to finish it! this is a dessert that can be shared between 4! \n\nit's loud with the tvs showing the football games and music playing on the speakers.  \n\nthe service to order dessert and refill water was slow.  we had a 10% coupon from our hotel but the server gave us 20% off instead.  the food was good, and comes out fast and big! come hungry!", 
            "this place is over the top! the food is great and the portions...when the hell did every restaurant in vegas begin serving only sumo wrestlers. my family had a great mix of food - <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>, <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> and <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>. don't kid yourself, the fries aren't a side; not by a long shot. they are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. we all loved our food, but i'll have to say the motley que was the best meal of the night. damn it! my wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering, and she did it again here. \n\nthis place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. we had dinner at burgr the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot. \n\nmy only complaint is the hostess staff. they treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. they have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. next! when i asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. i showed her my phone - no text. well, that also meant no apology from her either. she gave me a look like, do you still want in or not, i have other people to be rude to.", 
            "i'm guessing the number of great reviews on this place is due to the fact that most people on the strip in vegas are drunk and have the munchies.  while the menu looks great, the food is underwhelming.  we had the <mark>Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries</mark> for an appetizer - it was ok, but nothing special.  then we had the mayor of flavortown.  <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> was kind of dry.  the seasoning on the fries was strange - almost sweet - not what i want in a french fry.  the staff was great and i liked the atmosphere, but we won't give it another try.",

            "my husband and i decided to try this place out for our first anniversary last week. my husband is a huge burger fan so this seemed like a sensible place to go. we didn't make a reservation since we were still on the fence about it all day. it was a friday night and i was expecting a much longer wait than what we were quoted, 40 minutes and that was accurate. \nthere was not enough room for everybody waiting so that was really annoying. the front staff just seemed to be unhappy to be there. the lead host they had barely even looked up from her computer while she spoke with the guests. i did observe an older couple coming up to the host stand, old man was very friendly but like i said, lead host had no personality and eventually seemed to make the old man uncomfortable with the exchange. this really frustrated me because when i used to work the service industry, i would never let my guest feel like this. i did not see her smile once during my 40-minute wait. the other hosts seemed friendlier but mostly seemed fake. i also saw a manager bossing everybody around but not helping out. big pet peeve!!! managers, you are not above your employees. if it weren't for their hard work, you wouldn't be around!\nwe finally got sat and our server was very friendly. she was very attentive to our table and she had a few others too. my husband likes to gulp his drinks so it tends to be a lot of work for the servers and we make up for it with our tip. this night, he didn't even need to ask for a refill. not once! i am kicking myself right now for not remember her name! i ordered a mojito and it was really good. husband and i tried the <mark>Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries</mark> for the appetizer. the waffle fries were amazing, the chili was good but nothing special. i had <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> and my husband tried the mac and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. the barbe<mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> was phenomenal and my husband enjoyed his burger. however, i still didn't feel that the prices were justified. i've had better and cheaper barbeque and that goes the same for my husband and burgers.\nthe portions are big and we didn't really have the table space for them but i guess we made it work. i really should have been more mindful of this but i really didn't expect that the music would be so loud. my husband and i couldn't have a normal conversation without having to raise our voices to a level past our comfort zone. i also noticed a busser slacking off, chatting it up with the servers when there were three dirty tables within five feet of him. i consider this an eyesore, the dirty tables and the lazy employee. \noverall, my husband and i had an okay experience. we will definitely remember not to come here for a romantic date night. this would be a great place to hang out with some friends though. food was great, server was great, music was way too loud for comfort, either a bigger wait area or more efficient seating during volume, managers need to be leaders, not bosses, friendlier front staff!\nwe most likely won't be back. maybe unless we were already in vicinity and hungry. then again, there's a few other restaurants we could try out for experience. only because we have burger and barbeque joints that we go to that are cheaper, better, and friendlier front staff.", 
            "we had the bbq beef brisket open faced sandwich and <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>. the food was delicious but it being a guy fiery restaurant i expected more flavor. <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> was topped with coleslaw which had a delicious tangy flavor, served with seasoned fries that didn't require ketchup. the firewall wings were flavorful but a little too hard for my taste, served with blue cheese w/a touch of wasabi (yummy). no room for dessert. the wait was about 10 minutes, great atmosphere, our waitress was nice and attentive. we sat in the patio. prices are reasonable, nice place overall.", 
            "i love this place the music is jammin. the atmosphere is fun! the staff is great! it's ok for everyone to be tattooed. it just fits. the bartenders are awesome. if your group is small enough to sit at the bar, do it. the food was great.i really enjoyed the bacon cheeseburger with mac & cheese. my friend got the pulled pork sandwich. the pickles were a great flavor addition. <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> come with an assortment of fries so you don't have to choose between waffle fries, potato wedges, spiral fries, regular fries. i can't wait to go back to this place.", 
            "this place is oh so mediocre.  with other good dining establishments nearby, i'm not sure why anyone would choose to come here.\n\nlet's start with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.  most really good burgers are thick and juicy and cooked to order.  you can look at the photos and tell that these patties are just a notch better than fast food patties at best.  in order for a burger with thin patties to be considered top tier, there needs to be some other selling point, some other flavor which makes up for the lower quality patties.  guy attempts to do that with the mac and cheese burger which i had.  i love the concept but <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> falls flat.  it doesn't have enough mac and cheese on it and the mac and cheese becomes an afterthought.  it's mostly just a mediocre burger with a little mac and cheese on it.\n\ni didn't want to judge the place solely on subpar burgers so i made a return trip and got the <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark>.  it had a ton of cajun flavoring that takes over the taste of the dish.  that is kind of what i wanted from guy's burgers.  unfortunately, this cajun flavoring is not that tasty imo...too salty for my tastes and thus the overpowering nature of <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> actually made me dislike it.  also, the bun was too small as was the cutting board you eat on so i kept spill meat on the table.\n\nthe mixture of fries they give you is \"ok\". i wish they would allow you to substitute them for truffle fries though and wish they had a special sauce option rather than simply dipping them in ketchup.\n\nthe service at this restaurant is mediocre to poor.  the first server i had was cute but was pretty terrible at her job.  the 2nd didn't have much of a personality.  \n\nthe layout of the restaurant is terrible.  this may be due largely to the structure which long pre-existed this restaurant but it should still be noted that there are very few good places to sit here.  most everything is cramped in.\n\nthe atmosphere of the place is pretty bad too.  the uniforms give off a white trash sort of vibe.  the clientele doesn't help much either.  it's location relative to harrah's means that you can expect a lot of the inbred types to stop here for a meal.  i hope caesars renovates that property soon to get rid of most of the riffraff that still occupies the center strip.", 
            "had the mac and cheese burger and the pulled pork sandwich. both were great!  also tried the <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark>. don't remember what it was called. it was a little too spicy for my taste, but that's what it was supposed to be, so i can't knock it.  everything was what i expected it to be, but it was just a little heavy on the grease. you could see the paper underneath <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> soaked through with it.  had an hour long wait to get inside. it was packed and loud but that added to the fun atmosphere. waitress was great and very attentive.", 
            "we were disappointed with guy's las vegas. maybe we had high hopes since we are big fans. the bloody mary's were nothing special even though they had a customize yourself menu. the service was also average. i ordered brisket and was brought ribs with no apology. the ribs were very good and i ate them anyway (probably better than the brisket). <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> were good size and also tasty. doubt that we will go back with all the choices to eat in vegas.", 
            "i came here on sunday for brunch and was bummed to see it was only 8-11 am. that was my fault and the regular menu looked delectable so we stuck around to eat. the two of us only waited 7 minutes which was nice. inside of the restaurant is very clean and beautiful, they really utilized the view they have there! large open windows giving you a view of the strip. i'm a local and appreciated it so i'm sure an out of towner would love it. \nwe ended up ordering the 52oz hangover fishbowl bloody mary (extra spicy) and oh my god, delicious. i ordered the <mark>Southern Smothered Chili Bowl</mark> and my fianc\\u00e9 ordered <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>. for some reason the service was really slow, but at least our server was apologetic about it and brought us out complimentary shots. it was a mix of fireball and angry orchard. definitely not something i'd order on my own but it was free, so i gladly partook. i wish i remembered our servers name, she was a sweetheart. \nour food arrived and it was amazing. the chili had a layer of cheese on top to separate the cornbread so it didn't get soggy. i thought that was genius. \nmy fiance's sandwich was amazing. the smoked pulled pork was some of the best i've had in this town which i wasn't really expecting. the perfect amount of smokey flavor with moisture in the meat. \nwe also got the <mark>Guy's Cheesecake Challenge</mark> to go since we were stuffed, but i've been snacking on it all night. you wouldn't ever think to put potato chips and pretzels on a cheesecake but now i don't think i can eat it any other way. \noverall, i had a great experience. aside from the slow service it was perfect. luckily i enjoy my fiance's company and we didn't have any other plans so we had a wonderful time.", 
            "staying at the flamingo we decided to go next door to the linq to try this guy restaurant as we have tried his mexican restaurant in laughlin a couple of times. i gotta say that based on the pulled pork sandwich i had i wouldn't go back. i have definitely had better for less money. pulled pork is definitely something that people can be picky about and i hate it when i get big chunks of fat and tough char. the pretzel bun was good but i ended up tearing <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> apart to pick out tye good meat and take off tye terrible sweet pickles. the menu says it comes with pickles but i assumed they would be dill and they most definitely were not. the fries were good as you get a mix of about 4 different types but the presentation doesn't make it very easy to eat and avoid most of them falling to the floor. definitely disappointed but glas we tried it to find out. service was good and the patio seating was nice.", 
            "my husband and i had an amazing lunch at guy fieri's vegas kitchen and bar. my husband ordered the fireball buffalo chicken wings and <mark>Quad Fries</mark>.  everything looked and tasted delicious. i ordered the motley que pulled pork sandwich. the barbecue sauce is amazing. <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> comes garnished string fried onions and very lite coleslaw, so perfect on <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> and the bread roll was perfectly grilled on the outside but soft on the inside. my husband ordered the bacon mac and cheese burger. and he thoroughly enjoyed it. the presentation was so unique and beautiful. i ordered a sweet iced tea, and even my tea was great, lite fresh tasting. our server was friendly and the food was really quick coming out. there were two metro bicycle police sitting next to us, and the manager came over and offered to pay for there meal in honor of 9/11 and in appreciation for all they do. how cool is that. needless to say, we highly recommend guy's vegas kitchen. we'll definitely return.", 
            "so i was hesitant about even coming here, but hash house had an hour and a half wait for brunch on a sunday. we show up at 10:30, thinking no problem we can get in by 11 for breakfast because there's no one there. i was wrong. the hostess forgot to put our name in so after checking back in at 11 and finally sat at 11:10 it was too late for breakfast. ok, that was disappointing but we were hungry and really thought \"how bad could it be?\" \n\ni will say, our server was awesome. he was attentive and friendly and knowledgeable. he repeated our order back to us so we knew that we were getting the correct items.\n\ntruffle fries were great! honestly thought i haven't had truffle fries i haven't liked. that's about the best part. i order the general wings. they were cool in presentation and came with different items to dip them in. while <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were big, the sauce was way way way too sweet. my friend got the buffalo wings, and they were eh. neither wings were crispy, but the buffalo wings were definitely soggy. the blue cheese was great though! my boyfriend ordered <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>. the fries were good, and <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> was ok. the meat tasted like liquid smoke had been added to it and tasted artificial. \n\nover all the service was great but the food was blah. i like guy, but this is disappointing. head over to the yard house just a few steps away for better food and pricing!", 
            "the food here was not a let down. i ordered the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> to start which was basically like eating buffalo wings except for they were a massive pile of thick curled potatos smothered in blue cheese, carrot, celery, and coated with buffalo sauce. it was amazing. i also got the 14 hour brisket which was sooo good and the montley <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>. all lived up to and beyond expectations. i only give 3 stars because the wait staff was very ameture like and unattentive and the tables and seating areas were left unbussed and dirty for extended periods of time and the restaurant wasn't even that busy. all in all it was a decent experience food wise but the service and restaurant cleanliness was under par. a little disappointed.", 
            "i had the 68 cajon chicken sandwich and my girlfriend had the mac and cheese burger <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> was okay kinda bland in taste had to as for some barbecue sauce for my burger so it would taste better. <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> was pretty good the chicken was very good and sausages and i work very good to the bread was a little stale but it was okay. my fries for free good they didn't give me enough to catch up but besides that i like them you do get three different types of flies in your back which is kind of need to get string fries curly fries and potato wedges sometimes overall the experience was fun food is good i would definitely come back again again.", 
            "i have been meaning to try this for a bit now.  located between harrah's and the linq and proximate to the carnaval court's raucous party- i never seem to make it outside the pearly gate that is the loop around carnaval court.\n\nmy wait was reasonable, about 10 minutes or so.  the service was prompt and polite.\n\nthis is a burger stand pure and simple.  the selection of non-burger food is very, very minimal.  so, now that going in.\n\ni ordered a mac & cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> which was just fine.  the meat is actual meat and not a patty of pink slime from some stockyard somewhere.  when it is all ground together it is pretty hard to say what it is, but i felt like this was ground chuck due to the mouth-feel, the juice (that sounds gross), and the taste.  two enthusiastically thumbs up for using real meat.\n\nthe bun to meat ratio favors the bun by a lot.  but, when we consider the toppings, in my case mac & cheese, bacon, pickles, lettuce, and so on, the only way to pull it off is with big buns.  =)\n\nall of <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> come with a side of fries.  the fries stink!  i was a little surprised because they are so easy to season to add some flavor.  but ultimately the fries are crappy.  on my way out i saw the kitchen and the plates prepped with the fries and waiting on <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> under heat lamps.  there were dozens and dozens of plates with fries waiting on a sandwich.  maybe ask for fresh fries to go with your $20 burger.  i would.\n\nthat brings me to price points, i had a burger and a soft drink, came to $23 or so.  toss in a tip and what not, you are probably at $30/person assuming no appetizers or alcohol.\n\nso the final shakedown:  glad i finally tried it, once visit for me was probably enough but i would not run away from that place either.", 
            "a must see, especially if you follow him and his shows. i got <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>. i never has bbq with bourbon flare, certainly very deep in flavor. the bread was so good. the beer selection is great and compliments everything on their menu very well. i love how interesting the fries are too. they different shapes, sizes, and veggies but yet it works! so great! i would highly recommend and i've been to several food network star restaurants.", 
            "fantastic!  i started off with a crazy hagar drink and the brisket nachos which were the second best i've ever had. \nnext up was <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> mmmmmmm, had to utilize the hunch method of eating it. the three way fries were all delicious.  my associates had the bacon mac n cheese burger and the big dipper sandwich and everyone was very satisfied with their choices. \nservice was excellent, the waiter kept our drinks filled and that's very important to me. not a bad wait, probably 15 minutes or so during the sema show was impressive....good sized area for seating helps!", 
            "i'm basing my review off the couple items i've had. also if you go after 10 there is a limited menu. my favorite thing here is <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>. the pretzel bread was so soft and the bbq was tasty. i also really love slaw on my bbq. the mac and cheese burger was really good and i've had a mac and cheese burger somewhere else and i didn't like it so i almost didn't get this but i saw it on ddd so i decided to give it a try since it is their number 2 seller. the motley que being the number 1. i also liked the <mark>Fireball Whisky Wings</mark>. it was really a great sauce for wings. it was spicy but not too spicy. i recommend the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> for an appetizer. this is all i had but i ate here twice on a 4 day trip to vegas and vegas has such great restaurants. i look forward to eating again when in vegas", 
            "i'll be honest, this wasn't my first choice but i expected more out of guy's restaurant. \n\nthe food was good but nothing to write home about and definitely not worth the $18-20 a plate. <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> portions were huge but the side of fries was a joke. \n\n\nmy real gripe was the horrible server we had.\n\nno way to really say it but ed was a total douche. the only times he came to our table was to take our order and to remind us that our tip should be a percentage of the total (one of our party paid with cash and rest with credit.) he always had his back to his locations and had others fill glasses with tea/soda/whatever.", 
            "talk about overpriced.  i get that it's vegas, but for what you get, it's definitely worth it to go somewhere else on the strip.  the fries have the taste of bbq potato chips which was not for me though my other peeps liked it, and the portion on the fries was just a joke.  <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> we had (pulled pork, turkey and a burger at our table) were nice portions, but still not worth the price we paid.  do yourself a favor and try a different spot."

            "i had very high expectations for guy fieri's restaurant at the quad.! unfortunately, i left feeling underwhelmed. customer service was very good. upon arrival, my group and i were immediately greeted by a group of hostesses. there had to be at least four of them standing there. they were nice but also very nonchalant. maybe that's because it wasn't really busy on a wednesday night and they all really didn't have anything to do. one escorted us to our table and we were almost immediately given water. about ten minutes after getting the water, our server approached us and gave us the menus. he also asked if we had any questions about anything on the menu or about the restaurant. he was very polite, informative, and attentive. \n\ni ordered the '67 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark> and my friends ordered the big dipper sandwich to share. i also ordered the \"lemon drop..not\" cocktail and the <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> dessert. the '67 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark> was just alright. i expected the bread to be soft, but i believe it was sourdough so it was a little harder than i prefer. the meats were seasoned well and the hot sauce added a nice tangy kick to <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>. i really liked the fact that they serve different types of fries: crinkle, waffle, and string. with that being said, the fries were not hot and tasted like they had been sitting in a warmer waiting to be served. when served fresh, mcdonald's fries are better than these were.! yes, i said it.!! the lemon drop cocktail was sweet, lemony, and delicious. the s'mores dessert was very tasty and served with strawberry and chocolate syrups, although, i would've liked for it to be served warmer. my friends enjoyed there big dipper sandwich with au jus sauce and left happy. (partially because they didn't have to pay for dessert..lol.) \n\nso service was good and the food for me was just okay. it definitely was not the best \"american diner\" i've been to. i'll have to go back and try some other things on the menu and maybe update my rating, but for now 3 stars is all it's getting from me.!",

            "went here twice! long story short, food was amazeballs. try it out if you're in vegas!\n\nlong story short made long:\n(first visit) - my boyfriend and i were walking from wynn's to grab some burgers at gordon ramsay's when we stumbled on this place. it was hot (what an understatement) and so we didn't want to walk any further so we decided to try this place out. best decision of the trip! we shared an original smash burger which came with their <mark>Quad Fries</mark>. pretty damn good. we were both happy with our midnight snack and happily walked back to our hotel in the blistering heat--content, to say the least. oh! and i brought my brother back a doggy bag of their parmageddon wings (i didn't try it myself but my brother said it was alright and wished it had more parmesan on it).\n\n(second visit)\nwe were determined to go back and try more of the menu before leaving las vegas so my boyfriend and i dragged my family along! the boyf and i got the smashburger again (only this time, the waiter asked us how we wanted it cooked). \"medium well please!\" my parents shared the smashburger as well (well done). and my brother got a '67 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark>. we finished every bit of our entrees with the exception of the <mark>Quad Fries</mark> because we were too busy nomming on the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> we ordered on the side. \n\nwait. i need to tell you all how these fries make me feel. \"<mark>Triple T Fries</mark>,\" i say to myself as i roll my eyes in pure foodgasm bliss followed by a mouthwatering longing to taste these beautiful things once again.\n\nokay. my party was fighting to get the most amount of these fries into our bellies. they were so good! order them! don't be like my boyf and i the first time and say, \"ooh, these sound good. we'll try them next time so we have a reason to come back!\" no, order them then and there.\n\nwe then ended the wonderful dining experience with a <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> for dessert. boy, believe me when i tell you to never say, \"we'll try it next time!\" when it comes to food. \"carpe diem\" should be rule number one in any foodie's rule book. actually, if my high school latin has actually stuck anything in my brain, it should be \"carpe cena!\" seize the meal. \n\nanyway, dessert was a great way to end the meal even though we were full. the chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces were the best part.\n\nyes to this place. yes to the food. yes to guy fieri. come through! totally worth every penny :)", 
            "i love guy and triple d so i reallllllly wanted to love this place, but unfortunately i was disappointed.\n\ni'm short, my experience was over priced and sub par.\n\nat around 2pm on a friday, there was quite a wait to sit inside, but immediate seating on the patio. we opted for the latter. the restaurant couldn't control the weather, but some misters out there would be nice.\n\nthe waiter took some time to get to us, which was particularly odd since there were only a couple tables seated outside. we ordered water and he had to come by twice to say our drinks were on the way... -_-\n\nwe passed on any appetizers as we found that section to be a little lacking. actually, i expected more from the entire menu.\n\ni ordered the cajun chicken sandwich and my fianc\\u00e9 ordered the signature mac and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. we both finished our waters and didn't have a refill until after our food arrived. \n\nmy <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark> tasted like the chicken had been pre cooked and then reheated with the vegetables and seasonings separately. the cheese was melted into the roll and then the filling placed on top. when it arrived, the cheese had hardened again-as if it had been waiting under a heat lamp for some time after being cooked. i asked for a side if ranch, and wouldn't you know...i finished half my food before it arrived.\n\nthe \"signature\" burger wasn't all that much better. first, they need to use a different bun. it fell apart immediately. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> itself was dry, overlooked, and under seasoned. i think they hoped all the other toppings would mask that. unfortunately, the mac and cheese was bland. the blue box at home would have left this stuff in the dust. the bacon was carelessly placed and hanging off the side  when it came.\n\ni will say the fries were good. a combination of curly, shoestring, crinkle cut, and waffle fries with some bbq cheddar kind of seasoning.\n\nit seemed like everything on the menu was $20. we passed on the disappointment of ordering a desert and chalked this experience up to something we could say we've done. :/",

(way better than i would have thought, and surprisingly not too sweet!).  for around $35 you can get a giant fishbowl full of about 5 drinks that includes a free t-shirt.  not a bad deal! we even watched them walk vs. stumble out later.  kudos new friends!\n\nhowever still breakfast to us, we opted to go a little easier than that...very good regular iced tea for me, and a couple brews for husband.  later i added a  \"lemon drop...not\", which was very good. hungry, we had to start with the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>. (after i presented our bartender with my total rewards card to save a buck per item).  good thing we had already ordered our mains before this arrived, or we might have been fine with just these.  huge, majorly rich, and totally off the hook!  where else would you find pepperoni wrapped breadsticks with a cheese fondue with sausage, tomato and basil in it?  with a kicker of pepperoncini to cut through the richness? no where else...  thanks guy!\n\nour bartender was so awesome that she saved our leftover fondue for future fry-dipping...wise gal...loved her and her hard-working cohorts!  husband's '67 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark> was flavor-town indeed!  i know because of the small taste that he was willing to part with. he did more (slightly) willingly share his trio of fries with chipotle ketchup.  yum to all of them!  \n\nmeanwhile i was chowing down on <mark>The General's Wings</mark>.  as good as these were, they were wayyy sweet.  would have loved to share them and have something else with them as well, but alas husband doesn't do bones.  loved that they were served with crushed wasabi peas, peanuts and sesame sticks to dip the sticky sweetness into.  the salty crunch was a perfect compliment.  i didn't waste a bit.  (you're welcome, grandma in heaven).  \n\nneedless to say we were way too full to even contemplate desserts.\n\nhad an absolutely delightful time...until a big suit guy (the kind you see in the pit at a casino that is intimidating) come barging over to complain to the hard-working bartenders that the area was \"messy\".  (our neighbors had just left...you know, the ones that had just spent all that money on two breakfasts and several drinks including the giant one?) our server had been asked by us to settle up and was just coming back with it when he complained to her.  this made us feel horrible.  like we had made her get in trouble...management, not cool.  we were all doing great until you came along.  as they say...it's not what you say but how you say it...and from what we've seen on television, didn't feel like guy style...just sayin'.", 
            "actual rating 3.75 stars.\ni had some friends in town and wanted to give this place another chance.  \ni was feeling adventurous and tried the smoke and mirrors.fireball cinnamon whisky, fresh lemon juice, apple & cherry juice dash of lagavulin single malt\ni really enjoyed this drink.  \nfor food starters we split the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, crisp breadsticks wrapped with pepperoni and an amazing provolone and sausage cheese dip. the breadsticks were forgettable but the dip was fantastic.  we took the manager's advice and kept the dip for our fries later.\nfor my entree i went with the 67 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark>. from the menu \" this one packs a punch! it's crammed with blackened chicken, andouille sausage, cheddar cheese, the creole trinity + louisiana hot sauce.\"\ni got the hot sauce on the side.  the chicken, sausage and cheese were excellent.  i was a bit disappointed with the hot sauce as it tasted more buffalo than cajun but because i had it on the side, i was able to dip into the provolone dip.  the bread was a little chewy and didn't add anything to the dish but didn't hurt it either.\n\nwhat struck me about this visit was the <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark> that were skimpy and bland the first time we came were smothered in shrimp this time.  my friend enjoyed them.  the mac and cheese burger was also a hit with my other dining mate.\n\nthe fries remain the hit though and i still get a kick out of the differen<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> mixed together.  \n\nfor desert we had the smores.  a <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> style desert that rocked.  we couldn't finish it between the three of us because we were stuffed.\n\nfinally, i commend the service again.  colie (sp?) was an excellent waitress with a sharp wit and happy to make suggestions.  colie really took this up to the fourth star.  \n\nwe also got to meet chef kyle and the managers and i am really impressed with their commitment to the restaurant's success and desire for it to stand on its own.  \n\ntry it for yourself, it has a lot to offer!", 
            "i'm not a fan of gimmick restaurants named after celebrities but i thought i would give this place a chance anyway. just know that this place is loud and full of tourists that have a hard time containing their enthusiasm about being in a place named after a tv host. the tables are uncomfortably close together too so be prepared for an intimate meal with loud strangers.\n\ni ordered the '68 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark>. the food was good although i expected it to have a bit more kick to it as far as the spiciness factor goes. it's pretty big. i had to use my knife and fork to break it down. my jaw was starting to hurt from trying to eat it like a normal hoagie. the menu doesn't state this but <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> come with a small side order of fries so don't feel obligated to order one of the big-ass plates of specialty fries on the menu. unless you want to.\n\nfor dessert, my wife and i split the the triple double pie which is chocolate chip mint ice-cream combined with crushed wafer cookies and mint candy. more chocolate than mint. our waiter referred to it as the mount fuji. be warned that this dessert is ideal for four people. it was all we could do to finish it. the manager even approached our table to express his congratulations to us for finishing it.\n\nif you enjoy loud, festive atmospheres with sports blaring in the background and you're okay with confined spaces, you'll like this restaurant.", 
            "this place was pleasantly surprising!!  our food managed to outdo my expectations of taste & quality, and the bartenders (the guys) are all really nice, friendly, and engaging while not intruding on couple's  date-night experience.  \n\nour first visit was top notch.  sitting at the bar, we ordered <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> (essentially a pulled pork item), and it was really amazing!!  it came with <mark>Quad Fries</mark>, which are equally amazing!!  i could eat those fries aaall daaayyy...  it's like a mixture of different shaped potato cuts, each seasoned differently / separately before being compiled together.  such a great concept! \n\nthey have a yummy shot that's like drinking cinnamon toast crunch, hah, it's fireball whiskey & rumchata together, and it's worth trying.  they have a good beer selection as well.  \n\nour second visit was okay, but had it been our first, we wouldn't have been rushing to return...  \n\n*the hostess that day had an attitude  \n\n*the bartender (female) kept ignoring me, haha (she would only address my husband, \"how's your food?\" while looking at him & shaking her overly exposed boobies... is that an areola?  lol.  she never asked how my food was, and i had to have my husband order my beer bc she wouldn't acknowledge my nods or waves.  whatever lady.  \n\n*the '68 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark> was good only bc i was hungry, but i would not order it again.  it was a small, open-faced sandwich on a hard bread, like a baguette maybe?  the menu stated it would be on a hoagie roll, which is a softer bread so i don't know what happened with that.  it was dripping with grease!!  <mark>Quad Fries</mark> were amazing again though!!", 
            "my bf and love guy so we finally got the chance to try his food here in vegas. ambience was western, casual, and relaxing. we sat at the bar since there were seats opened. we ordered a drink java guava, <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark>, and flavortown sandwich. the only thing we liked was my drink. we were high in sodium because <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> were extremely salty so we couldn't finish them. so disappointed, but who knows the other choices might be less salty, even the couple right next to us experienced the same thing. service was good though.", 
            "this was a phenomenal dining experience. it's friendly enough to not be pretentious but it does it with great flavor and filling food. its not crazy extravagant meals that are science projects gone wring, this is quality food done with pride. i've been twice and i had the \"tatted up <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>\" and i've had the \"<mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark>\", both were flavorful and exactly the right size to not make you feel gross but to quench your hunger. the beer selection matches the food in thought and flavor. \n\ni just moved to vegas and this will be a regular place for me.", 
            "it's been over a week and we are still talking about the meal we had here. all 3 of us loved our sandwiches. oh and the fries are sprinkled with crack, one taste and you are addicted.\n\nmy only issue, tiny tiny issue, was that the '68 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark> is served on this shallow roll so there is no good way to contain all the smoky meaty goodness inside. you end up eating it pretty much like a sandwich without a top. it was so good though that i really didn't care. besides, more bread may have just interfered with the flavor and just soaks up the tasty beer anyway. this is a two pint sammich!\n\nthey were busy but we sat at bar and the bartender was good at checking in on us without being bothersome. \n\nwe will absolutely be back.", 
            "this place is oh so mediocre.  with other good dining establishments nearby, i'm not sure why anyone would choose to come here.\n\nlet's start with <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>.  most really good burgers are thick and juicy and cooked to order.  you can look at the photos and tell that these patties are just a notch better than fast food patties at best.  in order for a burger with thin patties to be considered top tier, there needs to be some other selling point, some other flavor which makes up for the lower quality patties.  guy attempts to do that with the mac and cheese burger which i had.  i love the concept but <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> falls flat.  it doesn't have enough mac and cheese on it and the mac and cheese becomes an afterthought.  it's mostly just a mediocre burger with a little mac and cheese on it.\n\ni didn't want to judge the place solely on subpar burgers so i made a return trip and got the <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark>.  it had a ton of cajun flavoring that takes over the taste of the dish.  that is kind of what i wanted from guy's burgers.  unfortunately, this cajun flavoring is not that tasty imo...too salty for my tastes and thus the overpowering nature of <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> actually made me dislike it.  also, the bun was too small as was the cutting board you eat on so i kept spill meat on the table.\n\nthe mixture of fries they give you is \"ok\". i wish they would allow you to substitute them for truffle fries though and wish they had a special sauce option rather than simply dipping them in ketchup.\n\nthe service at this restaurant is mediocre to poor.  the first server i had was cute but was pretty terrible at her job.  the 2nd didn't have much of a personality.  \n\nthe layout of the restaurant is terrible.  this may be due largely to the structure which long pre-existed this restaurant but it should still be noted that there are very few good places to sit here.  most everything is cramped in.\n\nthe atmosphere of the place is pretty bad too.  the uniforms give off a white trash sort of vibe.  the clientele doesn't help much either.  it's location relative to harrah's means that you can expect a lot of the inbred types to stop here for a meal.  i hope caesars renovates that property soon to get rid of most of the riffraff that still occupies the center strip.", 
            "had the mac and cheese burger and the pulled pork sandwich. both were great!  also tried the <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark>. don't remember what it was called. it was a little too spicy for my taste, but that's what it was supposed to be, so i can't knock it.  everything was what i expected it to be, but it was just a little heavy on the grease. you could see the paper underneath <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> soaked through with it.  had an hour long wait to get inside. it was packed and loud but that added to the fun atmosphere. waitress was great and very attentive.", 
            "i was so excited to try guy's restaurant. i was not disappointed ! loved the design of the place and the food was great!  i had the best bloody mary ever - spicy with a sausage, candied bacon and a shrimp on top!  the mac and cheese burger was to die for!  i can't wait to go back and try the <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark> and the truffle fries.", 
            "good food but pricey. we paid $40 for the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> and the 68 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark>. no drinks besides water... our waiter was nice the couple of times he actually came over to our table.."

            "let me first say that i usually don't like bar food but this place just took it and ran. when we arrived there was a line but we waited for only 10 minutes which was super awesome.  we sat near the bar at a booth which was sitting high off the ground. i noticed that this place looks like it should be sitting in texas somewhere due to the atmosphere and the way the help staff was dressed. never would have pegged guys restaurant as country. \nthe food was absolutely delicious! to start we ordered  the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>. the cheese sauce for this was the best i had. i would have never put pepperoni around a pretzel stick but it was really good. my husband ordered the mac & cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>, which we were told that it is the most popular burger they have. he said it was really good. i ended up ordering the <mark>Pic-a-Nik Sandwich</mark>. it was surprisingly good. the cranberry relish is a little out there but it works and they also put bbq chips on <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark> but nothing i can complain about. \ni give this a five star because the food was outstanding and everything i expected from guy fieri"

            "i wanted to really like this place because the food looks amazing but it was just okay. the portions are also enormous and i normally wouldn't mind but i feel bad for wasting when the food just isn't that great! first off, the atmosphere is really fun and lively and our waiter was friendly. we came as a party of 5 and we had no wait going at 11pm on a sunday. our drinks were kept full and our food arrived in a timely manner. \n\n<mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> $13- pretty good flavor and their cheese sauce had a nice tang to it.\n\nmac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> $17- pretty dry and over cooked :( also nothing really popped in flavor, it was kind of under-seasoned. for how tall the whole burger was, the beef was probably only 1/4 an inch thick at most. i picked at the mac & cheese and that by itself was pretty bland. one thing i really liked was that your $17 burger comes with fries, you don't have to order it a la carte like most burger places on the strip. however, the fries were pretty stale and too crunchy, but wayy too seasoning! also, the serving board it comes on is ridiculous. it looks really nice but it's way too small, three of us that got burgers asked for extra plates otherwise it would end up on our laps.\n\noff da' hook burger $16- i didn't try this one but boyfriend basically said the same thing i said about the mac & cheese burger.\n\n<mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark> $17- i didn't try these as well but my friend said she really liked them even though she took all the toppings off lol.\n\n<mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> $10- this thing was rock hard!!!! i had to use my burger knife to cut through it and i could barely taste the chocolate and marshmallow :( way overfried. the raspberry dipping sauce it came with was really good so it saved it from being a complete fail. \n\n<mark>Guy's Cheesecake Challenge</mark> $12- another huge portion of eh. cheesecake tasted like something i could buy at smiths or albertsons. impressive looking but not impressive in flavor.\n\nmaybe it was an off night of everything being overcooked but overall, another case of where food looks way better than it tastes. $175 worth of mediocre food. the price isn't the issue since the portions are huge and comparable to other burger joints on the strip but the quality of flavor just wasn't there. i still think gordon ramsey's burgr and holsteins are my favorite. i would even prefer bachi burger.  my boyfriend and i didn't care for it, maybe we are spoiled here in vegas? but the other three that were visiting from solvang, ca really loved it. so idk...try it for yourself i guess!",

            "we're las vegas locals and have eaten at many \"celebrity chef\" restaurants on the strip. in my opinion, the bigger the tv \"star\", the worse the restaurant. in that sense, guy fieri's did not disappoint. we went about 5:30 p.m. on a thursday and it wasn't too crowded. unfortunately, half of the indoor seating was in direct blinding sunlight. as in you had to wear sunglasses during the dinner to not be blinded. and sadly, many patrons did wear them. seriously? not acceptable. then our waitress (i don't think she ever told us her name, which is lucky for her so i can't call her out) disappeared and barely to our order and had to be asked several times to refill our waters. she never even came back to take our cocktail order after i told her i needed a few extra minutes to order. oddly, she was extremely attentive to the table next to us. even then, our glasses sat empty forever. the food was salty, over sized portions and over priced. $19 for a pulled pork sandwich. that's high even by the strip prices. did i mention it was salty? thus the constant need for our water refills. even though the <mark>Mexican Churros</mark> that the table next to us ordered for dessert \"looked\" delicious, we had had enough and opted out of spending any more time or money there.",

            "i cannot recommend the churros enough! you have not lived until you've tasted the sugary deep-fried cinnamon sweetness of guy fieri's <mark>Mexican Churros</mark> ($11 with total rewards card). it's all about that dulce de leche dip, man! i could live without the spicy chocolate dip, but i won't let that take away from the overall awesomeness of my favorite spot for churros. \n\nexcuse my ravings. now, here's the nitty gritty. guy fieri's menu has changed very frequently since my first to this restaurant in the quad. prices have gone up $2-3 on all menu items and apparently they've gotten rid of their nachos (lame). here are my main gripes:\n\n1) they charge $4 for a fountain drink. really?!\n2) the tables are dirty. the tables that have the wood planks on them have tons of food/random sauce wedged in the cracks. eww.\n3) the uniforms of the staff are hideous. they're a tacky denim/western getup. i hate them. no one likes a \"denim dan\".\n4) guy fieri's is extremely unfriendly for vegetarians, unless you order fries or a salad, which isn't really food. hence my preference for eating at guy's mostly for dessert only. \n\nokay, now for the good stuff. everything is presented as an edible masterpiece. guy's wins for presentation. also, the portions are ginormous. yay! the caesar salad ($14) is a goodie. there's plenty for two and it can serve as an entree in its own right. the dressing is on the thicker side and the parmesan cheese was scrumptious. my husband and i had to do the \"push away\" to save room for our main course. \n\nwhen guy's used to have nachos on the menu, those were great too. very creative and extremely cheesy. the chef's spared no expense on loading the nachos up with ooey gooey cheese!  the jalapenos were my favorite part! somehow they had an almost sweet taste to them. \n\nmy husband ordered the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> ($19). he barely put a dent in it, it was so huge. he was quite pleased with his burger. \n\nwe did order the <mark>Guy's Cheesecake Challenge</mark> ($13), once. it's overrated. i'm not really a cheesecake person anyways, so don't mind me. i just gave it a shot because so many people were raving about it, i thought, well if it's so good maybe i'll like cheesecake this one time. no such magical moment happened. i didn't like the potato chips or the pretzels shoved in the cheesecake. they tasted stale. the cheesecake itself just didn't do it for me. oh well. \n\nservice has always been great or average. we usually come on monday or tuesday nights, so the wait time is under 10 minutes. \n\nin sum, i like guy's. the food is fun. to be honest though, i'll probably only eat here for dessert whenever i feel like splurging."

            "the service, food, and staff were amazing!  i went here with my family, party of four, during the pre-soft opening where our whole meal was comped. we were instantly greeted and shown our table. although, we weren't seated at the bar, the bartenders made us feel welcome as we passed by. \n\nthe service was quick and they managed to make conversation despite being packed. my glass was never empty and the servers were kind. \n\nwe ordered the big dipper, <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, nachos del jefe, <mark>The General's Wings</mark>, margarita fajita wings, and victor's sweet tacos. and for dessert we had the <mark>Triple Doublemint Pie</mark>. we were huge fans of the margarita fajita wings, the amazing truffles smothered all over the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, nachos del jefe and the big dipper. \n\nthe sauce for the margarita fajita wings was phenomenal. they almost took this off the menu, but we are so glad that they didn't. it was a sweet and sour sauce with herbs accompanied with perfectly cooked chicken. so worth it! \n\nmy brother loved the nachos del jefe. everyone else at the table enjoyed it, but didn't believe that it was \"spectacular\". \n\neveryone at the table loved the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>. there were truffles over the fries and within the sauce. there was so much, we couldn't possibly finish all of it, because the portion size was huge (which is a great thing). \n\nthe big dipper was a great sandwich. the manager came by to inquire about our experience and he informed us that they spent hours cooking the meat to perfection. it was seasoned well, and moist. it's a must try! \n\noverall, we enjoyed the food, service and staff. the managers even came by a couple times to personally talk and make us feel welcome while the servers were friendly and consistently checked on us in a pleasant manner.", 
            "i am right on the cusp of a 4-star review, unfortunately the service we received knocked it down to a 3-star. \n\nwe went there on may 12th for my 30th birthday, this was my choice and i did not even complain when we had to wait 10-15min for an outdoor table when we could've been seated right away inside. the girls at the front were all wicked nice and greeted us right away and were helpful. there was a band playing next door so it did make conversation a little difficult but nothing too bad, and the people watching was the best part of being outside. \n\nthe food for the most part was delicious. i got a smoke & mirrors for my drink, which besides the giant pepper on the glass was delicious. for appetizers we got righteous rojo rings and <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, the sauce for the rings was awesome nice and spicy. the dippers were also wicked good, my mom started making them at home, just can't get the dip right! for my meal i got carne asada <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark>, which were okay. the filling was very good but the thing i did not like was that the tacos seemed to be wrapped with two soft taco shells which were really really really dry. the best part was the dessert, the <mark>Triple Doublemint Pie</mark>, which was shared amongst all four of us because it was definitely too large for one person.\n\nour server is what killed this whole experience. i am not sure where she kept on disappearing to but she brought our drinks and then ran off for almost 20min before taking any part of our order. then after our meal it took awhile before she even asked if we wanted to dessert (which i did, come on it was my birthday!). my mom did ask several times for a glass of water which she never brought over. she was more concerned with other tables around us with whom she could flirt with (apparently my husband and dad are unflirtable?), and we tip well as long as you pay attention and are a good server. \n\nall in all it was a great place and next time i am back in vegas i will definitely go back.", 
            "i don't even know where to start! first of all, our server was excellent. brittany definitely knew the best things to order off the menu and was overall a very attentive server. \n\nas a table of four, we started off with the <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> and fireball whiskey wings. the cheese that came with the dippers was phenomenal, and we saved the leftovers for our fries later on during our mean! <mark>The General's Wings</mark> were amazing but were definitely spicy. didn't taste like cinnamon though, which i was happy about! we skipped the greens, because lets get real, this isn't a place for healthy eating! we had the mac and cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>, which was also a delicious option. we shared the brisket sandwich, which i didn't try, but my boyfriend said it was amazing but had a bit too much sauce. \n\nto top off our extremely greasy meal, we got the <mark>Triple Doublemint Pie</mark>. yum! i was kind of bummed there was only one oreo on there and two or three junior mints, but it was still delicious. definitely enough ice cream to share with 6 people! \n\ndefinitely enjoyed myself here! don't wear tight pants if this is a restaurant you're interested in going to! defintiely won't fit in them by the time you leave! ;)", 
            "this restaurant is totally something you would find on diners, drive-ins and dives. just amazing food and not just one style either. \n\nwe started off with <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> which were pepperoni-wrapped breadstick with a provolone and sausage cheese dip. im not a big pretzel person but these were great. the cheese dip is what makes the dish. we also got the fireball whiskey wings which were great. they came with some kind of blue cheese dip which paired great with it.\n\nfor our mains we got the <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> which won burger of the year in vegas last year. this burger is built with crispy applewood bacon, six cheese mac, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles.  great burger with great flavor. they even cut this burger in fourths for us. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> comes with 4 different types of fries and all were amazing and went great with the leftover cheese sauce from the pretzels. \n\nwe also got the 14 hour slow smoked brisket. wow, some serious flavor here. looks like a plate of bbq brisket that you would get in texas. i just thought that were was a little too much bbq sauce drizzled over the meat. i would've liked to try more of the flavor from the brisket. \n\nlastly, we ended with <mark>Triple Doublemint Pie</mark>. holly cow, this was huge. it was a mint chocolate chip ice cream pie with oreo cookie crust and hot fudge. we had 4 people and couldn't even get close to finishing this dessert. \n\n\nthe service was excellent and they were on top of everything."

            "i'm a fan of guy fieri, he's from vegas and i love his diners, drive-ins and dives so i was excited to try his new restaurant.  the place had a cool casual decor, wood and metal.  went on a n<mark>Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae</mark> for lunch.  we were seated after about a 20 minute wait.  we ordered our drinks and it came.  flagging a server was like trying to flag a taxi -- can't find one.  i don't know where our server disappeared to.  after that it took about an hour to get our appetizer which came with our sandwiches and tacos.  presentation was nice!  i ordered the big dip or whatever it was called -- i can't remember since it's best to forget how dry it was -- it needed au jus which i recommend on the side.  my son ordered the <mark>Drunken Fish Tacos</mark>.  he said it was plain and not much flavor.  my other son ordered the blackened chicken sandwich or whatever it was again.  it was easy to forget because he said it was just ok.  the truffle fries were great, skinny cut and flavorful.  the server forgot my daughter's water.  she finally got it when our food was brought out.  service was 1 out of 10.  we ordered another appetizer which never came but were charged and also a beer that we didn't order.  when our server came to bring our check and i told him how bad the service was he started to argue with me and made excuses.  i don't want to hear they just opened 4 days ago.  apologize, give me a free soda or something for me to return!  which i won't.  did he come  to see how we were doing during the hour wait?  not!  the lunch experience left a bad taste.  we live in vegas and expect much more from a strip restaurant especially from guy fieri.", 
            "let me start with saying the service was excellent.  it did take longer than i think it should have to get seated by the hostess for it not to be crowded. but not a crazy wait and they were nice.  \ni had the original smash burger and my friend had the tatted <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>.  the meat patties are larger than the bun. they also come with assorted french fries which i love.  my burger was delicious however if i order a burger again i would order it medium as all burgers are made medium well. i wish my burger had more bbq sauce on it, however i devoured it so fast i didn't have time to ask for an extra side.  the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> was good as well but not as good as the the smash burger.\nthe portions are healthy so unless you are with a group it is hard to even want to order and appetizer.\nwe shared the <mark>Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae</mark>.  a terrific idea, since i love deep fried ice cream and think the best one comes from el torito when they use chocolate chip ice cream.  the idea was good execution poor.  it comes with a side of caramel syrup, chocolate syrup, whipped cream, bananas and peanut butter, pineapple, and strawberries.  all the sides were great it was just the fried shell was not up to par.  the cornflakes were bland and seemed stale tasting.  maybe needing to be fried longer or something.  it just wasn't what i hoped for.  regardless my inner fatboy still devoured it.\ni would definitely come back i want to try the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> along with some other dishes.  \nyou can also use your total rewards card to pay for your bill so that was great all i had to do was leave the tip.", 
            "everything is big at guy's vegas kitchen & bar.  most vegas restaurants don't always live up to the hype that's built up around them.  this place had only been opened couple weeks when i went and was overpacked.  from the moment you walk in, you see guy's portrait and books to remind you of where you are.  but it's the little touches that makes this place unique.  napkins themed with spanish dia de muertos art to big wooden clipboard menus.  it's different with a unique touch of style\n\nthe food is out of bounds as you might expect.  big burgers to giant onion rings served on a metal pipe rack.  the cocktails did not dissapoint and i suggest you try some of them.  the star of the night was their peperoni wrapped breadstick fondue.  i ordered their champion mac n cheese burger and it was huge!  burger was decent but the meat could have been seasoned better.  finally we ended up sharing the recommended <mark>Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae</mark>, which is a masterpiece.  \n\ni will be returning to guy's restaurant and that's saying alot since the choices are usually endless in vegas.  the atmosphere is electirc and the staff is great.  i'm impressed with the new linq area and this restaurnt surrounded by the quad is a nice addition to the vegas night life.", 
            "on our first visit here, the week it opened, the hostess have us a quick mini tour as she was taking us to our table. on our next visit, we didn't get that.\n\nthe first time, we sat outside, which was actually pretty nice. it's rather loud, but the people watching is awesome and you can hear / somewhat see the bands playing at carnival court. on our second visit, we sat inside at a high top. avoid this at all costs. the high-tops are way way way too close together and super awkward. our sever even apologized for how awkward it was. \n\nthe ambiance and space are cool. has a definite guy feel to it. it reminds me of a nicer and newer tex wasabi's (sonoma valley location). \n\ni was super super excited to come here because of one thing: <mark>Vegas Fries</mark>! as you might notice on my profile here on yelp, <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> would be my last meal. the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> at tex wasabi's are just a total dream. but alas, they are all different here. at wasabi's, they are thin fries, covered and drenched in hot sauce and parmesan crumbs. drenched, but still crispy. here, they're giant twisty fries. and you get a shot of hot sauce to pour over them. hint: right away when you order them, order extra hot sauce and extra blue wasabi sauce. the blue wasabi dipping sauce is insanely delicious. i could eat it by itself with a spoon. seriously. god bless guy fieri for coming up with this. so while the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> aren't the same, they're still tasty. and the portion is huge. 4 stars.\n\nso on to <mark>The General's Wings</mark>. have i mentioned how much i love hot wings? the fireball whiskey wings have a fantastic flavor and are served with the divine blue wasabi sauce. 4 stars. the parmaggedon wings are mostly breading and were too dry and overdone. they're served with a marinara dipping sauce which was tasty. 2 stars. <mark>The General's Wings</mark> themselves are kinda fatty and don't seem like the best quality. if they were better quality, they'd be more stars.\n\nbe wary of the beer flight deal. we were told it was $11. but that's actually $11 per each series of 4 beers. we were quite shocked when we received our bill. but after asking the waitress, she knocked the price back to what we thought it was. the full tasting is 4 series of 4 beers. and if you drink them all, you get a t-shirt. james o. and i were sharing, so our server was really nice and let us each have a t-shirt. very cool. fair warning: the beers are mostly ipas, and you should share as, well, that's a lot of f-ing beer.\n\nthe frozen shots sounded intriguing to me, so i ordered the fireball whiskey one. it was not frozen. it was totally room temp in a cold shot glass. not at all what i was imagining.\n\nthe <mark>Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae</mark> was so fabulous. huge! get it! it comes with a ton of toppings and you basically create your own <mark>Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae</mark>. we had a blast with this. 5 stars.\n\non both visits, the servers were nice, friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, and attentive. \n\nall in all, i'll keep coming back. but i wonder if i can get the <mark>Vegas Fries</mark> tex wasabi-style? they are quite better that way.",

            "i hate to hate because i love ddd and guy fieri but this place is a total tourist trap. we went last wednesday night, had to wait 30 minutes on a table so we went to the bar, 2 cocktails later and our total was $32 and i didn't even like mine. i think it was called jamo and ginger but the ginger was overwhelming, made the drink extremely bitter. \n\nso now our meal. we decided to share the mac and cheese burger and <mark>Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae</mark>. <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark> looked amazing, and i really wanted to love it, but something was missing. in theory, mac and cheese would be delicious on a burger. i thought it would be melty and gooey and act like a cheese for <mark>The Mayor of Flavortown Burger</mark>...it didn't. when paying $20 for  a burger and fries, i'd expect it to make the top 5...it didn't. not even close. the fries were ok but i wasn't a fan of the seasoning they put on them. \n\nthe dessert, however, fantastic. i mean you probably can't go wrong with fried ice cream but this one was great. crunchy corn flakes surrounding a giant mound of vanilla ice cream then served with all the fixings. my favorite was the bananas and peanut butter.", 
            "i feel it necessary to update my previous review. we had a waitress named michelle this time.she was friendly and helpful and did a good job. service is still slow but that's from the kitchen. our drinks were kept full and she was efficient.\nhubby and grandson who is 9 ordered the motley q bbq sandwich to share and it was still yummy. i had the chili topped with cornbread and it was wonderful!! daughter had <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> and she said it was very tasty! we had the churros...again delicious..shared the <mark>Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae</mark> which is a big ball of ice cream rolled in frosted flakes..deep fried ...served on a bed of shredded coconut..on the side to do your own thing is chocolate syrup, caramel, peanut butter and banana, strawberries, pineapple and honey. my daughter said she would eat it everyday at every meal it was so good!!\nadditionally his version of the mojto (forgot the name) got good reviews from my daughter."

(fryer tuck eatery in portland, or had that sauce years ago with their wedge-like fries)\n\nunfortunately, we had a problem. the dessert. my wife and i loved the <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> dessert creation but my daughter had an allergic reaction. we had asked the waitress if there were any tree nuts in the dessert. she checked. the kitchen told her no. (i wonder if peanut oil uses any tree nuts.)\n\nbut reaction was just like a reaction she had before with tree nuts. her lips became swollen, throat itchy and bumps on her head. (several hours past till she was okay again.)\n\nthe waitress immediately got the assistant manager involved. she was a super waitress, and he was a super man as a manager.\n\nhe went way above and beyond the call of duty --- he went to store across the way and purchased benadyrl for my daughter! \n\nwow, the assistant manager treated us as if we were guy, his wife lori and this had happened to one of guy's sons hunter or ryder.\n\nthe manager comped us the $90 bill too! \n\nwe left a nice tip for our waitress despite the incident because service and food were excellent.\n\nwe will definitely go back for not only the great food but the awesome customer service.\n\nby the way, guy seems so real and unpretentious like we're part of his family --- and now we witnessed how that attitude spilled over into the attitude of his staff.\n\nfinally, here's a big and heartfelt thank you to guy, his family and his wonderful staff for taking care of our daughter though it was an unfortunate incident, it made it more palatable for us even if was for the rest of the evening.\n\nwe wish guy, his family and his staff much success with the new \"guy fieri's vegas kitchen and bar\"!\n\nsee you next time we're in vegas! we will definitely be eating at \"flavortown\" again!\n\nby the way, italians, food, and casinos go well together. bada bing, cha ching! \n\nguido, you know what i'm sayin'?", 
            "this place put me in a food coma, in the best way.   everything was melt in your mouth excellence.  even the dragon's breath tasted like candy.   mac and cheese burger was on point,  as well as the <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>.  i had to sit at the bar, but the experience was undwindled.  a definite recommend, but bring your appetite and your wallet.", 
            "i had very high expectations for guy fieri's restaurant at the quad.! unfortunately, i left feeling underwhelmed. customer service was very good. upon arrival, my group and i were immediately greeted by a group of hostesses. there had to be at least four of them standing there. they were nice but also very nonchalant. maybe that's because it wasn't really busy on a wednesday night and they all really didn't have anything to do. one escorted us to our table and we were almost immediately given water. about ten minutes after getting the water, our server approached us and gave us the menus. he also asked if we had any questions about anything on the menu or about the restaurant. he was very polite, informative, and attentive. \n\ni ordered the '67 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark> and my friends ordered the big dipper sandwich to share. i also ordered the \"lemon drop..not\" cocktail and the <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> dessert. the '67 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark> was just alright. i expected the bread to be soft, but i believe it was sourdough so it was a little harder than i prefer. the meats were seasoned well and the hot sauce added a nice tangy kick to <mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>. i really liked the fact that they serve different types of fries: crinkle, waffle, and string. with that being said, the fries were not hot and tasted like they had been sitting in a warmer waiting to be served. when served fresh, mcdonald's fries are better than these were.! yes, i said it.!! the lemon drop cocktail was sweet, lemony, and delicious. the s'mores dessert was very tasty and served with strawberry and chocolate syrups, although, i would've liked for it to be served warmer. my friends enjoyed there big dipper sandwich with au jus sauce and left happy. (partially because they didn't have to pay for dessert..lol.) \n\nso service was good and the food for me was just okay. it definitely was not the best \"american diner\" i've been to. i'll have to go back and try some other things on the menu and maybe update my rating, but for now 3 stars is all it's getting from me.!", 
            "i wanted to really like this place because the food looks amazing but it was just okay. the portions are also enormous and i normally wouldn't mind but i feel bad for wasting when the food just isn't that great! first off, the atmosphere is really fun and lively and our waiter was friendly. we came as a party of 5 and we had no wait going at 11pm on a sunday. our drinks were kept full and our food arrived in a timely manner. \n\n<mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark> $13- pretty good flavor and their cheese sauce had a nice tang to it.\n\nmac + cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark> $17- pretty dry and over cooked :( also nothing really popped in flavor, it was kind of under-seasoned. for how tall the whole burger was, the beef was probably only 1/4 an inch thick at most. i picked at the mac & cheese and that by itself was pretty bland. one thing i really liked was that your $17 burger comes with fries, you don't have to order it a la carte like most burger places on the strip. however, the fries were pretty stale and too crunchy, but wayy too seasoning! also, the serving board it comes on is ridiculous. it looks really nice but it's way too small, three of us that got burgers asked for extra plates otherwise it would end up on our laps.\n\noff da' hook burger $16- i didn't try this one but boyfriend basically said the same thing i said about the mac & cheese burger.\n\n<mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark> $17- i didn't try these as well but my friend said she really liked them even though she took all the toppings off lol.\n\n<mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> $10- this thing was rock hard!!!! i had to use my burger knife to cut through it and i could barely taste the chocolate and marshmallow :( way overfried. the raspberry dipping sauce it came with was really good so it saved it from being a complete fail. \n\n<mark>Guy's Cheesecake Challenge</mark> $12- another huge portion of eh. cheesecake tasted like something i could buy at smiths or albertsons. impressive looking but not impressive in flavor.\n\nmaybe it was an off night of everything being overcooked but overall, another case of where food looks way better than it tastes. $175 worth of mediocre food. the price isn't the issue since the portions are huge and comparable to other burger joints on the strip but the quality of flavor just wasn't there. i still think gordon ramsey's burgr and holsteins are my favorite. i would even prefer bachi burger.  my boyfriend and i didn't care for it, maybe we are spoiled here in vegas? but the other three that were visiting from solvang, ca really loved it. so idk...try it for yourself i guess!", 
            "i had the mac and cheese burger, and my girlfriend had the <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>.  she described it as the \"best <mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark> she has ever had\".  my burger was really good as well.  the fries that came with it were pretty cool... they gave you an assortment of types (waffle, shoestring, curly, etc). it was a lot of food... we also had the <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> .  not my favorite dessert... the description didn't say that it was deep fried (like a doughnut) but it was.  we didn't finish it.\n\nthe restaurant itself was really pretty cool... but i think most of the restaurants i vegas are... they certainly charge enough.  we had 2 specialty cocktails at the bar while we waited for our table (that we're really good and the bartender as really cool)  that cost us $24 plus tip and then our burgers,  1 more rail drink and a dessert for a little more then $60.\n\noverall, i would recommend this restaurant if you want a really good burger while your on the strip", 
            "we had the pleasure of eating here twice in the same day.  guy is the bomb, so we figured his joint would be, as well. \n\nthe restaraunt is very nice and the open kitchen rocks.  the wait staff was fun and attentative.  \n\nall of the decor, uniforms, menu and experience  totalled up to be very guyish.  dug it. \n\nour meals, however, were a bit up and down.  i'll describe each meal and dish seperately. \n\nlunch: \n\n2 people - 0 wait time\n\napp: \nultimate chicken wrap - this was very good.  consisted of a few small egg rolls, a few chicken skewers, and lettuce wraps with three sauces (spicy sweet/sour, soy, satay).  this was a great start to the meal. \n\nmeal: \n<mark>Tatted-Up Turkey Burger</mark>.  it is big and awesome.  great flavor. this comes with a medley of fries with a very good seasoning.  i, now, have a mission to find ancho bacon.  \n\nimpression: this was a great experience.  my wife and i loved our meal.  \n\ndinner: \n\n5 people - 20 minute wait time\n\napp: \nrojo rings:   both of these were brought out quickly.  the onion rings were good and crispy.  they had good seasoning on the batter and the sauce was great.   \n\nnachos del jefe: the nachos (holy batman!) were killer.  these little chips are a sublime mix of mild chorizo and cheese that bring flavortown down to it's knees praying.  they are that good.\n\nmeal:\n\n<mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>: friend had this and loved it.  \n\nvictors <mark>Victor's <mark>Carne Asada Street Tacos</mark></mark>: very average and small.  the tortilla's weren't really prepped at all. friend stated that this was bland and needed more salsa. \n\n<mark>The Motley Que Sandwich</mark>: this was were the rails came off.  this sandwich is an exact replica of the deli cowboy from jason's deli.  it is a very saucy pulled pork.  all you can taste is a bbq that i would expect any joe blow to be able to prep in their crock pot.  to make matters worse, the waitress stated that this sandwich was the absolute best thing on the menu.  i don't think the chick from vegas knows what real bbq should be.  when you have tp pay $20 bucks for it, it just makes you disappointed.  \n\ndessert: \n\n<mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>: this was ok.  it looks cool, but it came accross too greasy.  it is really big and all in all, too much grease and sweetness to eat all of it.... even for 5 of us sharing one dessert.  \n\ni would have marked this a 5 after lunch... but, a few pieces of the dinner made this a big dip.  that pulled pork sandwich should really, really be re-considered.", 
            "this is a great place high energy staff helpful. i had the <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark> love them followed by <mark>The Guy-talian Deli Salad</mark> this was great the mix of italian meats and the crown of prosciutto-wrapped smoked provolone! make this a must for the flavor town finale i had a s'more <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>  loved it will go back and try the <mark>Guy's Cheesecake Challenge</mark> soon highly recommend this place to everyone", 
            "went here twice! long story short, food was amazeballs. try it out if you're in vegas!\n\nlong story short made long:\n(first visit) - my boyfriend and i were walking from wynn's to grab some burgers at gordon ramsay's when we stumbled on this place. it was hot (what an understatement) and so we didn't want to walk any further so we decided to try this place out. best decision of the trip! we shared an original smash burger which came with their <mark>Quad Fries</mark>. pretty damn good. we were both happy with our midnight snack and happily walked back to our hotel in the blistering heat--content, to say the least. oh! and i brought my brother back a doggy bag of their parmageddon wings (i didn't try it myself but my brother said it was alright and wished it had more parmesan on it).\n\n(second visit)\nwe were determined to go back and try more of the menu before leaving las vegas so my boyfriend and i dragged my family along! the boyf and i got the smashburger again (only this time, the waiter asked us how we wanted it cooked). \"medium well please!\" my parents shared the smashburger as well (well done). and my brother got a '67 <mark>'67 Cajun Sandwich</mark>. we finished every bit of our entrees with the exception of the <mark>Quad Fries</mark> because we were too busy nomming on the <mark>Triple T Fries</mark> we ordered on the side. \n\nwait. i need to tell you all how these fries make me feel. \"<mark>Triple T Fries</mark>,\" i say to myself as i roll my eyes in pure foodgasm bliss followed by a mouthwatering longing to taste these beautiful things once again.\n\nokay. my party was fighting to get the most amount of these fries into our bellies. they were so good! order them! don't be like my boyf and i the first time and say, \"ooh, these sound good. we'll try them next time so we have a reason to come back!\" no, order them then and there.\n\nwe then ended the wonderful dining experience with a <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> for dessert. boy, believe me when i tell you to never say, \"we'll try it next time!\" when it comes to food. \"carpe diem\" should be rule number one in any foodie's rule book. actually, if my high school latin has actually stuck anything in my brain, it should be \"carpe cena!\" seize the meal. \n\nanyway, dessert was a great way to end the meal even though we were full. the chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces were the best part.\n\nyes to this place. yes to the food. yes to guy fieri. come through! totally worth every penny :)", 
            "great food and great service! but be prepared to wait..! we had their mac and cheese burger, <mark>Triple T Fries</mark>, deep grief ice cream and definetly get their smores <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>!!! so yummy!!!", 
            "the food was phenomenal!! hats off to the chef!!! our waiter did a superb. job!! i had the big dipper  sandwich and my husband had the <mark>Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos</mark>. we can't wait to go back and try a new dish! oh did i mention the <mark>Guy's Cheesecake Challenge</mark>,  <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>, and the <mark>Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae</mark> were over the top!! our table shared the guy-italian <mark>Guy-talian Fondue Dippers</mark>, righteous rojo rings and the best ever <mark>Sashimi Won-Tacos</mark> and we can't wait to try the other two sharables on the menu!! great time and superior food!!",

            "background/disclaimer: pretty big guy fieri fan, came with some other yelpers (thanks to michael u. for the invite and norm k. as well) to try some breakfast items.\n\nthis is my 420th review, in case that has any special significance. i'm sure it does but i just can't think of it right now...\n\ni was a little late to the occasion, but i still got to try a variety of items from the new breakfast menu. the maple bacon french toast was pretty good. i would have liked the brioche to have more of a crunch, but it was pretty fluffy. the candied bacon was a little more toward crunchy then chewy and if you like a sugar coating on your bacon, you're in for a treat. the brulee banana didn't really add that much contrasting texture or flavor for me, but maybe i've just been eating too much banana lately.\n\nshortbread pancake and berry \"pot pie\" didn't do it for me. thought that the pancakes were too soft and fell apart a little bit too much (could be personal preference) and didn't have too much flavor. the berry compote and accompanying syrup are far from overly sweet and are actually a little sour, so at least you know they're not hiding the actual flavor of the berries.\n\neach of the dishes apparently came with a shot of a vegetable juice. hopefully michael or norm have the full ingredient list down. i did like the juice, which didn't have any hints of foulness or additives. nice of them to give you something healthy.\n\nsince we stayed past breakfast (8-11am), we were able to split a dessert from the regular menu. it was the <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>. this was my favorite part of the meal, with the deep fry treatment crisping up the brioche from the french toast being and melting a bunch of marshmallow and chocolate (plus graham cracker butter, apparently). chocolate and raspberry syrups upped the indulgence factor a ton, and i enjoyed every bite.\n\nambiance: not too loud, classic american music like the doors and the beatles, apparently uses old tables and intentionally dinged menu covers (for the breakfast menu) to try to capture the been-around-a-while feel. can't complain. \n\nservice: good as far as i saw, as they relocated our party to a larger table, brought out plates and utensils as needed, and never were absent for too long. i think they really emphasize service and want to show that they're trying hard by having a manager walk around to ask if everything's fine and by letting you review the experience through an app on the ipod/iphone placed inside the checkbook.\n\ni was hovering around a 3.5 rating, but since i generally look at 4 star places as ones that i would prefer to eat at again, i can't give that rating to this restaurant. it's strip-priced and, based only on what i ate, i've been to better breakfast places around town in that price range or a slightly lower range. i did find it cool to see the open kitchen and to snap a picture of guy's white jacket from his unlv culinary school days, so fieri fanatics may enjoy this place solely for the guy branding.", 
            "loved this place. it is in a great spot- right past carnival court by harrah's. (it is in the quad though). very nice, country vibe on the inside. cow print stools and all. food was delicious. we ordered the sashimi tacos- o m g !! it was so weird we had to get them. they were so good. next my hubby got the motley que. pulled pork, slaw, and happiness on a pretzel bun. was very good. bbq sauce was the story. i got the mac n cheese <mark>Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger</mark>. huge, very impressive. came with 3 or 4 different kinds of fries all mixed together. getting all the differen<mark>Triple T Fries</mark> was very cool. didnt have to pick. steak fries, shoestrings, battered fries, etc. for dessert, you have several amazing options- they even had churros! lol. we had to get the <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>. yes people- a huge, deep fried s'mores sandwich. unreal. comes with berry jam and hot fudge to dip. so good. overall, great, casual, laid back feel. great staff and decent prices. i will be including photos. would def recommend and will go back next time we are in town.", 
            "i came here with two yelp friends, michael u. and chris v., to try the restaurant's new breakfast menu.  i was here opening night and wanted to make a return visit.  the new breakfast menu was a good reason to go.\n\nwe were seated promptly and was brought our coffee.  there was a question about the coffee they used and the server was a little flustered.  more on that later.  we were brought two cups of regular coffee.  we ordered four items that were to be brought as two separate courses.  that's exactly what was done.\n\nwe started with the chicken fried bacon biscuits and gravy and the dragon's breath chili cornbread benedict.  the chicken fried bacon was nothing special except for the different take on the normal breakfast dish.  the biscuits were flavored perfectly and the pepper flavored gravy was good.  the cornbread of the benedict was very soft and tasty.  for me, dragon's breath indicates a hot, spicy flavor.  while there was some heat, it was certainly no dragon.  but that's my taste buds.  i completely liked this dish.\n\nduring our eating, the executive chef, anthony leitera, came to the table to respond to our question about the stumptown coffee that had been asked of the server.  he couldn't answer the question and said he'd send the beverage person to answer.  before he left, he checked on how we were enjoying breakfast.\n\nthe server then brought out part 2 of our order, shortbread pancake and berry pot pie and maple bacon french toast.  i thoroughly enjoyed the pancake pot pie.  i agree with chris v.'s comments about it falling apart easily.  the pancakes were very soft and the berry filling tended to make cutting and sharing a bit difficult.  i didn't use any of the syrup with the pancake as i tend to eat them without syrups.  the maple bacon french toast was quite good.  once again the bacon was the weak point.  the candied bacon was nothing special but i really liked the french toast and the br\\u00fbl\\u00e9ed banana slices.  again, i used no syrup.  the french toast was very moist throughout although the ends were not cooked crisp.\n\nwith each dish we received a small glass of juice that was watermelon, orange, and grapefruit combination that was a nice palate cleanser.\n\nduring our time there, the gm, michael speagle, stopped by to see how we were doing and thank us for our patronage.  \n\nenough time had gone by that the lunch menu was now available so we decided to share one more dish--the <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>.  it's a <mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> made from brioche with a graham cracker butter and stuffed with marshmallow and chocolate and served with chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces.  we used the sauces not for dipping but for pouring over.  this was a excellent!\n\nwe had a glitch with the splitting of checks the way we planned but that was rectified.  \n\nwhile i'm probably not going to be here often, i can see myself returning with a friends to split like we did today.  the process are strip prices.  note to total rewards members--$1 off each menu item with your tr card.", 
            "items selected:\nstumptown roasters house blend\n\nchicken fried bacon biscuits & gravy - freshly baked, giant buttermilk sage biscuit with crispy chicken-fried bacon, soft scrambled eggs & black pepper breakfast sausage gravy.\n\ndragon's breath chili cornbread benedict - sweet cornbread topped with dragon's breath chili, house white cheddar cheese sauce, scallions & two soft poached eggs.\n\nshortbread pancake & berry \"pot pie\" -vanilla shortbread pancakes stuffed with a mixed berry compote & whipped cream.\n\nmaple bacon french toast -house baked brioche soaked in maple syrup custard & griddled in brown butter topped with dark maple syrup, candied bacon & br\\u00fbl\\u00e9ed banana\n\n<mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark> -brioche, graham cracker butter, marshmallow & chocolate with chocolate & raspberry dipping sauces\n\nin a city where the next big thing is always a week or two away and the majority of local 'critics' are essentially writing fluff-pieces based on comped meals arranged by the folks in marketing at major casinos i knew i needed to wait a while before visiting guy fieri's las vegas kitchen & bar and with a new brunch menu launched on august 1st without a whole lot of hype the time finally seemed right, myself and two others sitting down for four of chef leitera's newest creations plus one of fieri's outlandish desserts just after 10:00am on saturday with the restaurant just under 3/4 filled.  not particularly a fan of the spiky haired celebrity but able to appreciate his place in pop-culture it was with an open mind that i approached the doors of the linq-side locale and greeted by a hostess plus a surprising lack of 'branding' (compared to the likes of ramsay, puck, or even batali) we were quickly led to a table, the service to follow effusively friendly and surprisingly efficient with questions she could not answer deferred to visits from the gm and chef himself.  every bit the lively scene one would expect of a 'tatted-up' venue spilling from indoors to out yet far less loud than many thanks to high ceilings, reclaimed woods, and plenty of glass it was with the first of several cups of stumptown coffee in hand that our morning began and with the doors alternating to country tunes and 70s hits overhead it would not be long before our savory course arrived, each plate well-crafted with subtle nuances to be discovered amidst decidedly conspicuous portions as the biscuit proved amongst the best in vegas while the chili walked a fine line between heat and sweet, the white cheddar lending a sharp salinity at the top of each bite.  always a sucker for sweets it was onward to the griddle that our meal progressed and again investing in a duo i was immediately impressed by the toothsome cornmeal pancakes enveloping a core of butter cookies and fresh fruit only to then be let down by the french toast that was simply too 'wet' with custard to stand up to the heavily sugared bacon and sugar-torched fruit, the amalgam altogether too sweet and in need of some sort of textural variance - perhaps something along the lines of a trip to the deep-fryer in order to crisp the bread as was done in the case of a '<mark>S'mores Monte Cristo</mark>' more than happy to eschew any fa\\u00e7ade of healthiness as smoky marshmallow fluff encased in golden brioche found balance in cinnamon spread and rich chocolate, the housemade raspberry preserves a nod to the classic adding a fruity finish that lingered long on the palate.",
