            "ok, so i've been yelping my eats for almost a year now and have stayed away from posting myself but after blt, i simply had to start!\n\ni was on the strip yesterday and needed to grab lunch with a couple colleagues and we had heard that there was a new burger bar at the mirage and figured we would try.  all 3 of us prefer food to just about anything else so it was a leap of faith to go to a new place without yelping first (please hold the....serves you right comments)\n\nblt is a new boutique burger and shake restaurant at the mirage with an acclaimed chef, laurent tourondel. \n\nwe were seated pretty quickly but given a table toward the back of the restaurant by the kitchen so didn't really get a great feel for the d\\u00e9cor, but then again we came for the food. 3 hungry guys mid day for burgers and shakes, what could go wrong?\n\nthe waitress was attentive and helpful but based on some small talk; she is a bit disappointed in the crowd and mentioned the slow economy and hoped it would pick up.  after ordering drinks and burgers and some <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, we were all excited for the food. the shakes and soda took about 10 minutes but came and the shakes were decent. the <mark>Twinkie Boy</mark> was tasty but tasted like a vanilla shake with a touch of twinkie, wish i had gone with the pb&j shake that went by....that looked yummy.\n\nthe pickles came and wow! they were tasty; juicy, crispy and all around great when dipped in the spicy ranch dip. for $5, would have expected more than 8 pickles slices (about a half pickle total) but they were awesome which really helped my rating. \n\non to the main course.....our burgers and sides come and we are psyched. we made sure to get 3 different sides so we could experience them all... \n1)<mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>- greasy by any standard and way too much batter\n2)<mark>Waffle Fries</mark>- good but cold...must have been waiting for the burgers!\n3)<mark>Skinny Fries</mark>- hot, cooked perfectly, though a bit salty.\n\nnow the reason we came...the meat!\nburger 1- the kobe w/ swiss and grilled onions- not mine, but the headline from raf was \"pretty good but just a burger\"\n\nburger 2- <mark>The Classic</mark> w/ cheddar, bacon and their \"blt sauce\"- again...burger was fine, but the exact words paul uttered were.....\"would prefer a double-double from in-n-out\"\n\nburger 3-.....this was mine and the real reason for the post/rant\n\ni ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and their vermont cheddar.   now; my burger had been ordered medium so when it showed up with an \"mw\" toothpick in it, i began to get skeptical. it's a burger and since i don't think i have ever sent back a burger, i figure i will try it. one bite tells me that this thing is well done....gray all the way....the only red/pink i could find would be my ketchup....so, i showed the waitress and with her eyes she told me that \"it happens all the time and this place really sucks to work at!\" she took it back while my friends began their burgers and i snacked on the cold, salty, greasy fries. \n\nshe told me that they chef looked and said it was medium but would make me another.....was she kidding? not only did it have the wrong toothpick in it and no pink but this is customer service for a brand new place charging almost $20 for burger? whatever....\n\nso, everyone finished their burgers and mine shows up....boy did the chef show me.    how about some guesses for what toothpick held the bun together this time?????\n\nobviously, it wasn't the medium one i would have liked; it was mr, for their medium rare. i pointed it out as she served it and she shrugged.  so as i get ready to take a bite, i notice that it does have the grilled onions but also has raw red onions....really, if you order your onions grilled should you have to tell them to leave off the raw ones?\nwell, i can tell you that the toothpick with mr was wrong...should have said r, for raw, not for rare. no exaggeration here, it was still cold in the middle.  \n\nat this point, i clearly was done with this joint and had the manager come over. when she saw the burger, she actually agreed that it was undercooked for rare and not even close to medium and took it off the bill graciously. (they've been open for a month but she has already mastered the...\"i'm sorry, let me take this off the bill for you!\") again, this is the first time in 20 years of eating out at least 10 times a week that i refused to pay for something.   \n\nchances are \na)  this place has way too many issues to get it fixed quick enough\nb)  the waitress is probably already looking for a new job\nc)  the mananger seemed beaten in less than a month of being open. \nd)  the chef should thank the folks that acclaimed him in nyc and go back to the concepts that he must have found success in since this one will likely not cut it.\ne)   in a city with as many food choices as freaks, i can't imagine anyone eating at this place more than once.", 
            "the service and the burger were both five stars.\nthe sides and shakes really brought the place down.\n\ni ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> with bbq onion and vermont cheddar.  the onions were a sauteed mix of onions in bar-b-que sauce. it was so good. it was cooked perfectly to my request (i was warned they were cooked a bit under - so ordered medium well). really loved the burger.\n\nthe sides were such a disappointment. there were four of us and we ordered <mark>Fat Fries</mark> which were served cold and kind of mushy. the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were warm and crisp, but nothing special.  my least favorite was the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> that my group ordered.  they were doughy/breaded so thick and huge - but not breading. it was kind of sweet, like a donut. a pickle donut. so, sandwiched in the middle of this dough was a little hamburger-slice style of dill pickle. not my thing. at all. \n\nwent back at about midnight the next night to get shakes to go. was surprised to see the shake mix come out of a soft-serve style machine.  i got the <mark>Twinkie Boy</mark> which tastes exactly as it sounds - a twinkie all mixed up in a shake. it was average. i was on a sugar high for the rest of the night. probably won't do that again.", 
            "my only complaint about this place was our own fault.  we should've split a blue cheese burger instead of each getting our own.  after splitting the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> - yummy! - the <mark>Mocha Mudslide</mark> (or whatever it was called) shake - very good but too much chocolate whipped cream - and order of fries - nothing spectacular, one burger would've been plenty!  the burgers were good, but i don't know if they were $13 good.  other than that, i thought we got seated pretty quickly even though there was a bit of a line and our waitress was very nice and attentive.", 
            "this place really hit the spot for me on my last visit.  i don't eat burgers but i saw some salads and veggie burger-type items on the menu so i gave it a try.  i opted for the falafel burger.  first of all, it was huge.  the falafel patty was really big and it had a good flavor - just a bit spicy.  it came with lettuce, tomatoes, a creamy sauce and tons of avocado.  i definitely could not eat it all but i would order it again.  it also came with a nice pickle.\n\nspeaking of pickles, i did try a few of the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>.  personally, i would never order these on my own because i take a firm stance against the gratuitous frying of things that don't even need to be cooked, like pickles and candy bars.  however, i sampled a few from my friend's plate and they were tasty.  but still, this whole concept seems silly to me, and it made me sad to see the little pickle slice with all this blown up batter around it.  so, they did taste good yet i hate them on principle and i think it's mean to do this to pickle slices.\n\nsweet potatoes do need to be cooked so i did order the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  they were good, although not the best i've had, and i was a little disappointed that they came with ketchup only and not a special sauce.  but, of all the fried sides to choose from, i might order these again (or <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> because they had those, too).\n\nthe service here was good and i like that you can watch people walking in and out of the casino here.  i found the atmosphere to be pretty much in line with the whole rest of the mirage and i enjoyed the background music.  additionally, in the past i have ordered spiked milkshakes to go from here and they were darn tasty.  but, they're filling - i can easily forego a meal and just have the milkshake.  the prices overall are not too bad, either, all things considered.", 
            "after a late night at the clubs, nothing sums up the night better than a lot of greasy fried appetizers =p  we ended up here after finding out that cpk isn't open late night but i'm glad we stumbled across blt burger.  we ordered a bunch of appetizers to share, and my favorite had to be the jalapeno poppers.  i'm used to those small little jalapeno poppers served elsewhere but this place gives them jumbo sized with the seeds still left in there so the jalapenos are still spicy!  we also ordered the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, which were interesting... the texture is like biting into a fried zucchini but it has a slight pickly flavor to it.  we also ordered the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, buffalo wings and a strawberry shake.  i wasn't too fond of the buffalo wings becuase they were a little too tangy and the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> didn't really hit the spot but the others were really good!", 
            "cue samuel l jackson as jules: mmm this is a tasty burger!\n\ni really liked this place - ordered the american kobe burger, <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, wings, and regular ol' fries. and a pitcher of hoegaarden. overall the food was great! the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> were a little heavy on the batter but delicious nonetheless. the wings were forgettable. the burger was damn tasty..perhaps a bit on the salty side but really good.", 
            "my friend and i had racked up a whopping $45 on the penny machines while we waited for my friends who were hugging the toilets at the mirage.  so we thought that the best way to spend the money would be to eat after hours :)  cpk was closed so we decided to eat here.  my friend was catching a cold and asked for hot tea - they didn't have tea - so they offered her hot water- mmmm now doesn't that sound tasty - she took it anyway...  usually the foods you crave when intoxicated are not the healthiest - so what did we end up ordering: spicy <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>, <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, jalapeno poppers, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, a straw<mark>Berry Me</mark>, and <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>.  i was surprised how good the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> were - i am not a huge fan of pickles nor of fried food but this was particularly yummy.  also the jalapeno poppers were one of the better one that i have tried.  they use the whole jalapeno and they don't load it with cream cheese.  the food was filling!  what a great way to end the night!! [not so much a great morning though eating so much grease :) ]", 
            "went to blt burger for the first time for lunch on friday 12/26/2008. blt burger is located at mirage casino and hotel. walked up and there was a little bit of a line and waited for only a few minutes. looking into the restaurant i was surprised how nice it was inside. nothing special but nicer then i expected for a burger joint. nice atmosphere for a place like this for lunch. service was just average at best. had to give up my first born (if and when i have one) to just get my water refilled. the waiter was pretty nice he joked even though i'm sure he heard a thousand times i'll take a white tiger burger. he said they have been out of them for awhile..lol. the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> are pretty good but nothing to go to vegas for. my first complaint is you can only have a combo with <mark>The Classic</mark> burger and can't substitute it at all. so that is pretty stupid in my opinion. considering i wanted a cheaper burger then <mark>The Classic</mark> but willing to pay the higher price for the combo. we ordered the blt, tex-mex, and turkey burgers. my friend that had the blt seemed to like it however when i tried it it was pretty much like a big mac with bacon. i was not a fan at all! other friend got the tex-mex burger and he hated it! i thought it pretty much sucked when i tried it. the chili on the burger was plain at best and just lacking of any flavor. i got the turkey burger and i thought it was decent. had good spices and the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were good. for a burger here i would skip it. i've not had in n' out burger but i'm going to guess its a lot better and a lot cheaper. i did not get the milkshakes since i was pretty hungover from the night before already. the milkshakes are what you come for from what i understand. i would like to go back and just get a spiked milkshake in the future. for a turkey burger and <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> total was 18.32 before tip. amount of food was pretty good but not worth the price. i would eat here again if i had to and would pretty much only stick to the turkey burger. would not go out of my way to come here and would pick a thousand other places first.", 
            "lunch for 2 comes to around $70.00, but definitely worth going back!\n\ni've never had <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> before, but they are good!  the batter is so light and flavorful!\n\nboth the twinkie and campfire marshmellow milkshakes are out of this world! sweet, thick, and creamy, can't ask for more!\n\nthe signature blt burger and kobe burger are definitely \"gourmet\".  beef are cooked just right, the buns are soft and beautiful to look at too!\n\nthe <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are a little bit on the dry side for me.  i'm hoping they just overcooked it on accident (i have to believe that with everything else so delicious!)", 
            "we ate here the other night before going to a show. great friendly service starting with the hostess and our sever. \nno, they don't take reservations, but our wait was only 15 minutes at 6.\nseveral of us enjoyed their blue cheese & onion burgers. super yummy. we also had crispy <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>. yummy!\none huge milkshake was passed around the table for all the try. we didn't leave anything on our plates.", 
            "the wife and i had been looking forward to trying out blt burger at the mirage for some time and last night we finally gave it a shot.\n\ni ordered spicy buffalo wings and a tex mex burger with a \"<mark>Nut Job</mark> milkshake\" and wife had a vegetarian falafel burger with swiss and mushrooms, a side order of <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> and the same milkshake.\n\nthings started well with the milkshakes which were simply put, unbelievably delicious. i'm not normally a big fan of milk based drinks, but i could chug one of these down all day long.\n\nwife really enjoyed her fried pickle appetizer with chipotle ranch dipping sauce and i was encouraged after a bite of my wings. at this point we thought \"wow! what a great place we have discovered\".\n\nunfortunately things took a sharp downturn from that point on. by about my third wing (of eight) the taste had become overwhelming and unpleasant. also, i had deliberately asked for the \"spicy\" wings as opposed to the \"tangy\" ones, so why did they taste so strongly of lemon? wings were also very mushy without any sort of crispness about the exterior. eventually i gave up after about four - realising i had been forcing them down for the sake of it.\n\nburgers arrived and i was surprised to see something that really didn't look like a $13 burger on my plate. the meat was not cooked to my specifications (but it was close, so i was ok), but the whole thing was bland - the chili included in the burger was tasteless and so runny <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> part of the bun turned into a soggy mess. the \"sour cream\" and \"jalapenos\" supposedly in the burger simply got lost in all the chaos. in the end it was edible, but not something i would ever pay for again.\n\nwife pronounced her falafel burger burnt tasting on the outside with a tasteless interior. she got through perhaps 1/3 of the thing and left the rest on her plate. we were both quite surprised the staff member who took our plates didn't ask her if there had been a problem with her meal.\n\nonly the excellence of the shakes and the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> saves blt burger from a 1 star rating from me. it's a really high price for a great milkshake and mediocre food.", 
            "i felt that the food was a little pricey and the service spotty, but i would go back.  we got the waffle cheese fries and <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> which were delicious.  we shared a burger, which was just ok.  all the different shakes looked delicious!", 
            "a very fine burger establishment located inside the mirage. personally  i would have given this place a full 5-stars but their prices are geared more towards tourists with much deeper pockets then me. (yes, i know eating at a restaurant in the mirage automatically carries a 35% price increase)\n\nanyway, burgers were awesome, the nachos and <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> were amazing.... service is even good! if only the prices were a little lower and i did not have to battle the strip to get to it, i would become a regular.", 
            "great place for a late night bite and no where else is open.   fresh take on some traditional type dishes done burger style.   you can customize each one with a selection of diff toppings to make it all your own.  pair your burger with the deep <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>.  the chili powder ranch dressing is superb.", 
            "chocolate whipped cream, <mark>Skinny Fries</mark>, <mark>Fat Fries</mark>, <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> oh my! everyone in my party of 15 had a great time here for lunch! the shakes were excellent - and they do it right - chocolate whipped cream and a big wide straw. the burgers are perfect, i mean the bun to meat to condiment ratio was just right. the fries were crispy and golden, the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> had just the right amount of batter and were cooked perfectly. this is a very fun place for a lunch or dinner with your family or date. service is friendly and willing to split checks. great beer, shakes and burgers - a good life indeed!", 
            "before everyone attacks me for giving this place a one star, i'll have to mention that i ordered a salad (b/c i was full from drinking my yard dog from fat tuesdays). \n\nfood: i ordered the caesar salad but it came with these weird croutons that had gunk all over them. i'm sure it was edible but it just looked incredibly gross. other than that the salad was a salad and satisfied my cravings for <mark>Vegetable</mark> after an entire weekend of being starved from them. \n\nappetizers: bad. we ordered nachos, <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> and buffalo wings. the spicy buffalo wings were by far the worse. they were not so much spicy but just incredibly tangy. trying to finish my one wing was like torture because everytime i tasted the sauce, my face would have no control but to make a face from having eaten something very tangy/sour. <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> were probably how they were supposed to be but just not my cup of tea. to describe them for you readers though, it was warm and kind of mushy. i prefer my pickles crunchy and cold, and i think that's how most people do too. \n\non the bright side, the <mark>Fat Fries</mark> which were basically potato wedges that my boyfriend ordered were crispy and actually really good. \n\nbut he told me the burgers were just meh so i don't think i\"ll ever be back to give their burgers a chance.", 
            "two words <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>!! i've had hooters <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> but these <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> were amazing!! i loved loved them!! my friend got the blt burger and she said it was a pretty tasty burger!! next time i come to vegas...i most def wanna come here to get some <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>!!", 
            "the gooooooods:\n- blt burger\n- <mark>Lamb Tandoori</mark>\n- deep-<mark>Deep Fried Oreos</mark>\n- deep-<mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>\n- milkshakes/spiked shakes (mocha mud, <mark>Berry Me</mark>, <mark>The All Nighter</mark>, <mark>Nut Job</mark>, etc.) \n- fries, fries, fries (skinny, fat, waffle, sweet potato and rings)\n- krispy kreme bread pudding", 
            "two words: happy hour. in vegas, what's the cure for a long night of drinking and clubbing? greasy delicious and cheap foods! i stayed at the mirage where this place was located and after two nights in a row of clubbing and heavy drinking my friends and i stopped her both days to catch their half off happy hour foods. \n\nfirst off, the staff was friendly and really accommodating especially for some of my friends that couldn't handle their alcohol as well and got the 7 of us seated within a few minutes with waters already poured and placed around the table. for less $30 both nights we got a really large spread, one order of nachos, two boneless wings, two brisket sliders and one order of fries, all for under $30! and yes, enough to feed all 7 of us. \n\nlate night happy hour goes from 11pm to ~3am and there's other options such as <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> and popcorn shrimp, but i would have to say that the brisket sliders were really tender and filling and went really well as a cure alcohol in our systems. the fries were covered in this ranch/bbq mix sauce that could've tasted more amazing because most of us were inebriated, but i'm they simply were just that flavorful! the wings were alright, nothing too special as they were like hard chicken nuggets that were simply over bbq sauced. \n\noverall a great place to stop by for a post clubbing snack, especially for the cheap prices! however, the only downside is that after we got our check and paid we were ignored; something i felt was a little unprofessional; my friends and i were buzzing still, but we weren't obnoxious to the point where you'd ignore our requests for water and even the possibility to order more food. so, sorry, but that explains why i had good things to say about the food, but service is also an important factor in the restaurant business that i feel they shouldn't have ignored especially in a place like las vegas.", 
            "yes it's vegas, yes it's expensive (hello, it, have you tried turning it off and back on again?)\n\nwell well well. i had a kobe burger with bacon and cheese and, yeah, i ate it so fast the last bite was still hot. we had <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> (fuck yes) and some waffle cut fries with jalape\\u00f1o and cheese on. those were good, but i don't think i would get them again just based on simplicity and price.\n\nto wash it down, the chocolate shake with kahlua and chocolate liquor. will it mess you up? no. but with the price of a nonalcoholic one just a few dollars less, why the hell not?\n\nservice was prompt, people polite, especially for a busy night. this one goes in the rotation.", 
            "!!!!!!!!!!bacon!!!!!!!! \n\ngood service and a delicious selection of beers, shakes and fried items. the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> are the most delicious. the burger's my group had were all cooked perfectly and were delicious. i personally had a kobe burger with bacon. it was the best burger i have ever had. the kobe patty was delicious, juicy and unforgettable. the star of the show however was the bacon. it did not take over because to proportion was small enough, but double smoked bacon and cheddar made the kobe even better. double smoked bacon is a delicious german treat that smokes for around 24 hours which is significantly more time than regular bacon (4 hours give or take). this bacon will blow your mind when added in the right amounts. i cant wait to have the same meal again every opportunity that i am given.", 
            "it's a nice place to sit and eat, especially if you're staying at the mirage. i had a turkey burger which was full of flavor and pretty thick! their <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> were okay, but a little on the salty side. they were battered instead of breaded which was kinda cool, but i kept dipping in the sauce to cut the salty taste. their fries looked good but maaaybe left in the oil a little too long. however, they do have spiked milkshakes, which you don't come across at every diner. and they were pretty good too.", 
            "the food was 3.5 stars and the service was more like 2.5 so averaging to a 3 star experience.\n\nmy wife had heard great things about blt and so we decided to check it out for lunch.  we had a decent breakfast so we didn't want to over do it so we just got appetizers and milkshakes.  i got the kids meal chicken fingers (because they do not offer chicken fingers in the appetizers section of the menu) and i also got a small orange creamsicle shake (for $3 as part of the kids menu)  my wife got the waffle nachos however the waiter brought out <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> in stead.  so he left the fried prickles for us and brought out the nachos.  the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> were really good but it was a small basket for like $9 (i would have been upset of i actually ordered it and saw how small of a portion  you get).  \n\nthe waffle nachos were really good.  it was a waffle fry with melted cheese, sour cream, bacon and green onion.  it was just like a loaded potato skin but with a waffle fry.  my chicken fingers were not great and it was not bad either.  my wife got the campfire milk shake and that was pretty good.  i don't know i would order it again but it was pretty tasty.\n\nover ok experience however service was slow.", 
            "feed a hangover or starve for the pool? dilemma dilemma. \n\nand the hangover wins.....\n\nit was our second day in vegas and lets say it was a good first night. we were determined to make it to the pool especially since we had already paid for our reserve lounges at the pool at the mirage. \n\nper recommendation from a pedicurist at the spa in the aria, we decided to give blt burger a try and it was well worth it.\n\ndrinks: some of us went for the bloody mary. i had a sip of it and it was not good. i don't want to say awful but it was pretty close. i like a spicy bloody mary but i nearly choked on it bc it had a strong kick to it and wasn't a building heat. the tomato juice tasted to sour for my taste. i was not impress. \n\nappetizer: we got a plate of <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>. they were great. fried in a light almost tempura like batter. \n\nburgers: i had the <mark>Shaft's Blue</mark> burger. the bun was light and soft but strong enough to hold a juicy burger. the patty was just the right amount of fat and lean meat that gave it great favors and kept it juicy but not greasy. beware this is a strong blue cheese. only get if you are an avid lover of all cheese blue. \n\nfries: we choose the <mark>Fat Fries</mark>. it was crispy and seasoned well on the outside and very fluffy on the inside. \n\nservice was great and fast. i would totally recommend this place if you are looking for a quick place to grab a bite and are at the mirage.", 
            "this is just ok.  the burger was small and over priced and the taste was just ok, i would say red robin has a better burger.  the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> were good and the best part of the meal.  the chocolate shake was so so.  this shake is more whipped so the ice cream is really whipped with air, i was expecting a nice heavy ice cream tasting shake and again it was just ok.  i  would not return or recommend.", 
            "went here on a mission for <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> and was not disappointed. however, after drinks (the adult milkshakes are awesome), burgers and fries, the bill was far more than i expected for burgers and fries. i would definitely go again and double up on the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> and get subway or something after. if you're a fan of larger than life fork and knife type burgers, don't miss out, otherwise, i'd move on....",

            "i am a sucker for a good burger. i was meeting a friend who worked at the mirage and we wanted someplace that was casual, not too expensive and at the hotel. the service was decent. not bad but not amazing either. they had tvs playing the football game so it isn't a bad place to watch some sports. \n\nthe burgers were so so good though. i just got a classic cheeseburger and it was perfectly cooked and despite being a simple burger it was so tasty. everyone really enjoyed their burgers and the milkshakes were good. i also was recommended to order the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> but didn't end up doing it. \n\ni would come here again next time i am in vegas.",

            "met my gal pal for lunch.  we shared <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, a toasted marshmallow shake, and <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>, and we each ordered a burger.  bill was $45 - we were stuffed!\n\nthe <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> were the absolute best i have ever had - ever.  they were melt in your mouth, hot, juicy, and phenomenally excellent!  $6 and the portion was way more than fair!  i would go back just for a drink and <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> any ole time.\n\nshake was tasty.  blended chunks of perfectly blackened marshmallow inside.   they very kindly split the shake into two cups for us and garnished each with a toasted marshmallow and a big straw for sucking ease!  1/2 a shake was more than enough for this girl!\n\nmy burger was excellent.  i ordered a burger off the menu but made several changes/substitutions and it was no problem.  i ordered it medium rare and it came out perfect.  dripped iron flavored bloody meat juice onto my plate with every bite.  yum.  it had spicy tobasco crunchy onions, bacon, cheddar cheese and so on. \n\nour service was friendly and nice.  we didn't see very much of him but we got everything we needed.  \n\nit was expensive but that is to be expected.  i'd go again and i'm recommending it to others.  i'll add it to my list of super excellent burgers in vegas.", 
            "three words....deep <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>. i just came in for a late night snack, and this was amazing. you can't possibly imagine what this tastes like, but it's pretty freaking awesome. it's also a very cool upbeat diner, with authentic diner food and fat desserts. just imagine vanilla ice cream drenched in buttery syrup with chocolate mousse and brownies.", 
            "this was another one of the establishments located within our hotel (the mirage) so  we chose to frequent it when nothing else was either available or within walking distance.  \n\nthe food was that bad - we rolled with the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> as an appetizer because really....is there anything else better than <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> whilst drunk?  i kid and digress.....they were delicious as to be expected so no complaints there.  i believe i ordered the salmon burger once and the turkey burger the second time around and have no complaints.  the salmon burger was very good.  the turkey burger was ok but definitely did not trump the salmon.  \n\nthe service....well, it could use some love.  our first server was just ok - nothing spectacular....got the job done with minimal effort.  the second server was negligent and took forever to get refills and all the basics.  not impressed at all with that whole piece.\n\nthe place is pricey - no argument there.  the burgers go from $12-17 and most apps start around the $8-11 range.  the portion sizes were fine on both courses but still a bit steep all things considered....it is a burger joint after all.  \n\nthat being said - if you want a burger and don't feel like leaving the resort.... check it out.  otherwise, look around at other options while staying in vegas.  three stars is about as high as good as it gets for this place.", 
            "hostesses were busy talking and giggling with one another when we arrived.  took a couple of minutes before they acknowledged us.  we were the only ones in line at the time, so it isn't like they didn't see us due to a crowd in front in of them.\n\nservice was really slow.  took a good 10 minutes before we even saw our waiter. waiter was competent and pleasant. others seemed more trying to impressing the other for a hookup later on.\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> $9.00, and each had the #1 burger combo $16.50 with cheese for an additional $1.00.  combo basket consists of 7oz burger, fries and soda.\n\nthe <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> were okay. nothing to write home about. about 9 pieces, so a buck a chip.  they're fried chips with a batter coating in case your wondering. \n\nburgers were good. i'll admit it.  however, i've had just as good for a hell of a lot cheaper. fries were nothing special.\n\nthe kicker, and two star rating, was when we got the check.  we were charged $3.50 apiece for 8oz refills of flat diet coke. the wife did not even ask for a refill.  it just showed up. really? seriously? in fact the price for sodas didn't even appear to be listed on the menu.  i was willing to pay extra for 'black angus' special ground burgers, but the slow service and $3.50 for a refill of flat diet code ruined everything. \n\nwe will not be back.", 
            "this place sits literally in the doorway of the side entrance of the mirage casino and is really just your average mediocre burger joint. ordered some food here when i was drinking across the way at the rhumbar which allows you to bring food in while you are drinking. the menu is a collection of forgetful selections and drinks and shakes etc. typical greasy bar food and average burgers. the appetizers include baja tacos and <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>. opted to order some of those and it was just okay. nothing to write home about with steep prices and a place to skip to go 200 feet to the carnegie deli down the hall.", 
            "i have been here three times, but i think i'm over my blt burger obsession now. \nthis place gets mixed reviews, and i think it's really because some of the menu items are hit-or-miss. 5 stars for a lamb burger, <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, and any of their milkshakes. 2 stars for most of the other burgers, i'd say. fries are not bad... a bit too greasy for me. \n\nfirst of all, the lamb burger is the thing to order here. it is amazing. delicious. spectacular. from what i've gathered, the other burgers miss the mark. they just aren't as good, and are a tad disappointing. \n\nthe <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> are so fantastic, they really hit the spot. i consider myself a connoisseur of <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, and i put these somewhere in the top 3. \n\nit is also very hard to go wrong with alcoholic milkshakes... \n\ni will say that if you want a good old fashioned beef burger, holstein's might be a better option.", 
            "i went to this place on a recommendation from a friend and was not disappointed. i had the deep <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, the tex mex burger, and a vanilla milkshake.\n\nfirst of all, i know what you're thinking: why just a plain vanilla milkshake when there are so many other options on the menu (nutella milkshake, for example)?\nwell, sometimes i just want a good old fashioned vanilla shake. when they're done right, that's really all you need. let me tell you, it was done right. perfect thickness and sweetness!\n\nthe tex mex burger was scrumptious. i couldn't stop commenting on it while we were eating. the chili on the burger was good by itself: just the right amount of kick, and a little corn for texture. the slice of avocado were freash and creamy, and the beef itself was juicy and flavorful (i ordered mine medium).\n\nas far as price goes, it is pretty pricey. you can get combo of one of three simple burgers, a shake, and fries for $21. the tex mex isn't a simple burger...so plan on spending around $30 with tip.\n\ni would go back to try a couple other burgers on the menu that my friends enjoyed.", 
            "i give it 2 stars because the food was good. we had the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> and the <mark>BBQ Nachos</mark>. they were both appetizers. \nthat being said, those appetizers took 25 minutes to get to us. we sat at the bar for a couple beers and a quick bite and were greeted by a bartender who seemed less than pleased that we were there in the first place, and also didn't seem to care at all that we were waiting so long for food.\nthere were people around us who ordered entrees that came out before our appetizers so i'm not sure if our ticket was lost or if the bartender forgot to ring it in, but he didn't even acknowledge the long wait time until we brought it up. \nnothing was done to rectify the situation, no manager spoke to us, and the bartender just sort of walked away when we were telling him how long it was taking. very rude. he could have at least humored us or showed some sympathy. \n\nneedless to say, there are plenty of good restaurants in vegas with the same quality of food, so definitely skip this place when you're in town.", 
            "eek! i originally ordered the tandoori lamb burger but they said they were out. :sad face: so i got the tex-mex. i ordered it medium but when i got my hamburger my patty was super dry and tasteless. the chili was bland and i only got 2 pieces of small avocado. i wouldn't recommend it at all! \n\non the other hand, the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> were really good and our server was friendly and out going. \n\nwish i could say more about the joint but that was my experience. i'll prob go again to try the lamb burger because my server said it was delicious and to get that next time.", 
            "my boyfriend and i came here super late night for grub after a ton of drinking and gambling....only to discover that they had pitchers of <mark>Stone IPA</mark>. we had been on the hunt at the mirage for good beer and didn't find any  until the end of the night. \n\nwe were seated immediately and ordered a pitcher and food. my boyfriend and i decided to take a vacation from being pescatarians this thanksgiving so we splurged and shared <mark>The Cowboy</mark> burger, <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, and some chili cheese fries. the burger was perfect. the beef patty was moist and juicy...just the way i imagined it would be after not having a real burger in years. it was also really neat to eat. the burger held together really well and wasn't falling apart. the chili cheese fries were off the menu and they were wicked good. don't even get me started on the frickles.\n\nthanking blt burger for hitting the spot. we struck gold when we found good beer here!!", 
            "awful. awful. awful. came in at 11:30pm on a friday night with a large group. we asked to sit at all separate tables as we didn't mind not sitting together and it was more important that we get in and out in a timely manner. instead we were sat altogether.  our server came over to greet us and we informed him we would need separate checks, to which he responded, \"it will take a lot longer to separate your checkout. it would be better if you could just all throw cash in.\" ....um duh. if we could all throw in cash, we would. he continued to give us attitude and was rude throughout our entire meal. now, the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> and milkshake were amazing. but when our burgers came, the patties and fries were cold. like cold cold.  not even a couple warm bites or warm in the center. because our food had taken so long already and all we wanted to do was leave, we kept our mouths shut, but under any other circumstances, we all would have sent out entrees back. our checkout process was an absolute mess to boot. hector was our server.  maybe he had a bad day, and i don't mean to judge, but geez louise he was a disaster of a server in all areas. if you're a hot mess, the least you could do is pretend to be accommodating and friendly.  needless to say, not one member of our group will ever be returning, but i'm sure the place does well enough without us, considering most of their patrons are drunk and can't tell the difference.", 
            "great burger. easy atmosphere.  i had the gouda burger which is sitting in a pool of melted cheese. delish. the <mark>Buffalo Fries</mark> were awesome. service was good. i was alone and the waitress was sociable. burger meat was medium cooked perfectly. slightly on the salty side. but overall great.\nwent back later in our trip for late night <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>. different, but good.", 
            "we are constantly on the search for the best burger in town. during our last vegas visit, we checked out blt burger given the rave reviews it had gotten. it was okay... i mean prices are always high in vegas, folks, so let's not even discuss that. let's talk about the important thing - food!\n\nthe shake was really good, we had the oreo cookie shake and it was plenty to share. the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> also hit the spot and the breading was really tasty. our burgers came out and unfortunately the bacon was wayyyy to well done and that turned us off a bit. other than that, they were tasty. i didn't like that there was no lettuce, tomato, onion served alongside the burger. that should always be available in my opinion in case you want to add some of that fresh crisp to your fried goodness. \n\nthe service was slow, but waiter was very friendly and seemed to enjoy his job, which is always a nice change from the disgruntled, hungover waitstaff you can run into at some vegas places :)\n\ni might return to try it out again, but would most likely opt for burger bar instead.", 
            "i can take a party of 10 here and get great service.  server got all our orders correctly and was attentive throughout.  he also made great suggestions and was detailed when describing the menu.   the manager michael was very nice when checking on our table.  i made a comment about not liking sesame seeds.  he insisted to send my burger back for a wheat bun instead.  i will always show my friends the restaurants that i know will take good care of them. \n\ni love truffle. the american wagyu is great with the truffle aioli and brie cheese. \ni like the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> also.",

            "sunday night and there was no wait  we were greeted right away and sat right away. very friendly host. jennifer was our waitress, she was very energetic and helped make the experience worth the trip. we ordered the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> for an appetizer all i can say is yum. and the burgers 2 blt burgers and the trio. very good tasty and done perfectly. we enjoyed our experience", 
            "this place started off great simply by being open past 11pm! if you're looking for a great place to eat after a majority of places close on the strip, this is one of them. \nmy friend and i both started off our meal with a <mark>Fuzzy the Bear</mark> milkshake: peach milkshake spike with peach schnapps! it was a fantastic appetizer. decent size shake with lots of whipped cream and an oversized straw so nothing gets caught. you do only get the glass, unlike some places that give you the \"leftovers\" in the metal tumbler. \ni ordered the <mark>Southern Fried Chicken Cobb</mark> and my friend the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>. the cobb had some different toppings than usual and i wasn't a fan of the endive in it which gave it a somewhat bitter taste. other than that, i enjoyed the salad. it had a spicy dressing and the fried chicken had a light and airy batter surrounding it, somewhat like a light donut or funnel cake. it was different. the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> came in the same batter which was nice since they weren't too heavy after drinking a milkshake. they came with a spicy dressing as well, probably the same that was on my salad. \nservice was friendly and pretty quick. we were very grateful that the waiter left the water jug on our table after filling up our glasses! \nprice is about what you would expect on the strip.", 
            "they have such cleaver marketing and many options as far as burgers. not a lot of variety if you want anything other than burgers, fries and milkshakes. \n\nthe service was fast and we enjoyed our food with time to pick up our tickets and get to our show on time. <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> were yummy!", 
            "if you decide to stop at blt burger for any one thing, it should be their spiked shakes.  they are delicious and dangerous!  \n\nwe were here for fourth meal around 11 pm during the middle of the week.  we originally wanted to go to california pizza kitchen which is next door, but they were closed.  there were four of us, and although we probably thought we were awesome, i'm sure we were obnoxious.  so kudos to our waiter for being friendly, attentive and for putting up with our awesome jokes.   \n\nwe ordered waters and shared the <mark>Night Rider</mark> spiked shake.  it's a magical concoction of kahlua, chocolate liqueur, oreos and chocolate ice cream.  you could easily have a sugar overload on it, so i'm glad we all shared it.  we also ordered their <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> as an appetizer and they were delicious.  i'm used to <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> just having a slight breading on them, but they were almost fluffy with the breading and were very tasty.  i ordered the american wagyu burger (portabello, spinach and truffle aioli) with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. the burger was cooked perfectly, but just underwhelming compared to the pickles, fries and shake.   i ended up taking the toppings off and just eating the bun and patty.  the others ordered breakfast sandwiches and the kobe beef sliders which they all enjoyed.  i think our bill came to just over $100 for four people which isn't too bad for vegas.  \n\nthey weren't too busy that late, so we had pretty good seats close to the bar and it wasn't loud at all (well, except for us).",

            "the first night in vegas i refused to go here, not wanting to spend over $10 on a burger. fancy as they were, proudly claiming the 100% certified black angus beef (or cab, as the menu referred to them) at the center of many sandwiches, i wanted something different than a burger. i mean, i was in vegas and, really, how special can one make a burger?\n\ni gave this place a shot on the next night when we had just an hour before a show in the mirage. we had to wait in line, but it moved quickly. while waiting, i saw amazing-looking milkshakes served from the side bar. we could see people dining, but when the roles were reversed and i sat, i didn't feel impatient eyes watching me eat. the decor of the place is actually interesting and modern. i really liked the exposed grill and kitchen area set in the back of the restaurant. you could see the chefs and wait staff interacting, hard at work. it felt open with no unnecessary divide.  \n\nnot realizing it, i unintentionally often test my waiter or waitress at restaurants when i order water with lemon as my beverage. i'm not trying to be picky but a lot of wait staff forget the lemon. the waiter at blt burger brought me a small plate of them promptly. we told him that we had a show to catch and he understood. he and all the wait staff moved so quickly yet with precision. i felt like i was with pros. \n\nokay, so was the over $10 burger worth it? i actually ended up ordering the bbq brisket. i enjoyed it but found it a bit dry and just a bit more sauce would have solved that problem. my mom really enjoyed her salmon burger, which was fresh and tasty. the others split a \"blt\" burger (someone had to get it) and i must admit that the bite i had was filled with bacon and burger goodness. the carnivore in me sometimes enjoys that. we also shared <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> and started with the <mark>Waffle Bites</mark>, which were very much like loaded potato skins. \n\nnot a healthy meal by any means, but it satisfied us and got us to our show on time. i'd go again, but next time i'm trying a milkshake.", 
            "since we were staying at the mirage, before going out, my girlfriends and i got a quick bite from blt. my friends got the <mark>Kobe Slider Trio</mark> and those were soo adorable and smelled really good. now i didn't try a burger (i don't eat meat) but i did try <mark>Waffle Bites</mark>. i loved those; lots of seasoning, melted cheese and sour cream and jalapeno (it came with bacon which i just picked off). all the ingredients complemented each other really well and i couldn't stop eating them... all seven or eight of them.\n\n... yes, seven standard sized <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> for like $7. eh. i was kind of expecting to get a plate full of them lol when they brought it out, i was like \"womp womp womp waaah!\" if i had known thats what the order was, i would've just ran across the street to denny's and gotten double that for the price. i must say that even though there weren't that many fries, each one was ridiculously good.\n\nthumbs up for taste and service but thumbs down for the portions they serve.\n\nfyi: the floor is slippery (it looked like sealed cork) so be careful, especially if you're an idiot on heels like i am; i was surprised i didn't fall hahaha",

            "ok, so i've been yelping my eats for almost a year now and have stayed away from posting myself but after blt, i simply had to start!\n\ni was on the strip yesterday and needed to grab lunch with a couple colleagues and we had heard that there was a new burger bar at the mirage and figured we would try.  all 3 of us prefer food to just about anything else so it was a leap of faith to go to a new place without yelping first (please hold the....serves you right comments)\n\nblt is a new boutique burger and shake restaurant at the mirage with an acclaimed chef, laurent tourondel. \n\nwe were seated pretty quickly but given a table toward the back of the restaurant by the kitchen so didn't really get a great feel for the d\\u00e9cor, but then again we came for the food. 3 hungry guys mid day for burgers and shakes, what could go wrong?\n\nthe waitress was attentive and helpful but based on some small talk; she is a bit disappointed in the crowd and mentioned the slow economy and hoped it would pick up.  after ordering drinks and burgers and some <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, we were all excited for the food. the shakes and soda took about 10 minutes but came and the shakes were decent. the <mark>Twinkie Boy</mark> was tasty but tasted like a vanilla shake with a touch of twinkie, wish i had gone with the pb&j shake that went by....that looked yummy.\n\nthe pickles came and wow! they were tasty; juicy, crispy and all around great when dipped in the spicy ranch dip. for $5, would have expected more than 8 pickles slices (about a half pickle total) but they were awesome which really helped my rating. \n\non to the main course.....our burgers and sides come and we are psyched. we made sure to get 3 different sides so we could experience them all... \n1)<mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>- greasy by any standard and way too much batter\n2)<mark>Waffle Fries</mark>- good but cold...must have been waiting for the burgers!\n3)<mark>Skinny Fries</mark>- hot, cooked perfectly, though a bit salty.\n\nnow the reason we came...the meat!\nburger 1- the kobe w/ swiss and grilled onions- not mine, but the headline from raf was \"pretty good but just a burger\"\n\nburger 2- <mark>The Classic</mark> w/ cheddar, bacon and their \"blt sauce\"- again...burger was fine, but the exact words paul uttered were.....\"would prefer a double-double from in-n-out\"\n\nburger 3-.....this was mine and the real reason for the post/rant\n\ni ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and their vermont cheddar.   now; my burger had been ordered medium so when it showed up with an \"mw\" toothpick in it, i began to get skeptical. it's a burger and since i don't think i have ever sent back a burger, i figure i will try it. one bite tells me that this thing is well done....gray all the way....the only red/pink i could find would be my ketchup....so, i showed the waitress and with her eyes she told me that \"it happens all the time and this place really sucks to work at!\" she took it back while my friends began their burgers and i snacked on the cold, salty, greasy fries. \n\nshe told me that they chef looked and said it was medium but would make me another.....was she kidding? not only did it have the wrong toothpick in it and no pink but this is customer service for a brand new place charging almost $20 for burger? whatever....\n\nso, everyone finished their burgers and mine shows up....boy did the chef show me.    how about some guesses for what toothpick held the bun together this time?????\n\nobviously, it wasn't the medium one i would have liked; it was mr, for their medium rare. i pointed it out as she served it and she shrugged.  so as i get ready to take a bite, i notice that it does have the grilled onions but also has raw red onions....really, if you order your onions grilled should you have to tell them to leave off the raw ones?\nwell, i can tell you that the toothpick with mr was wrong...should have said r, for raw, not for rare. no exaggeration here, it was still cold in the middle.  \n\nat this point, i clearly was done with this joint and had the manager come over. when she saw the burger, she actually agreed that it was undercooked for rare and not even close to medium and took it off the bill graciously. (they've been open for a month but she has already mastered the...\"i'm sorry, let me take this off the bill for you!\") again, this is the first time in 20 years of eating out at least 10 times a week that i refused to pay for something.   \n\nchances are \na)  this place has way too many issues to get it fixed quick enough\nb)  the waitress is probably already looking for a new job\nc)  the mananger seemed beaten in less than a month of being open. \nd)  the chef should thank the folks that acclaimed him in nyc and go back to the concepts that he must have found success in since this one will likely not cut it.\ne)   in a city with as many food choices as freaks, i can't imagine anyone eating at this place more than once.",

            "whenever i walk by this joint, it always looks poppin. there's usually a line outside and everyone eating looks happy munching down burgers and shakes. on a night before drinking at the rhumbar, we decide to stuff our stomachs somewhere close and convenient. short line and 5 minutes later, we're about to order:\n\nturkey burger with bacon and a fried egg. that's my go to burger at these customized burger places. maybe throw some grilled onions on there too. this burger was a good sized meal. the turkey was somewhat overcooked. the flavors were there. nothing overly spectacular.\n\n<mark>Skinny Fries</mark> - they're regular sized fries but lower in calories most likely. they were decent.\n\nit's above average food for above average prices. but location is convenient and, hours are good, and it's a better option than the hotel food court.", 
            "this was the first restaurant we ate at in las vegas, it was convenient for lunch as we were staying at the mirage. it wasn't particularly busy for lunch on a sunday. the atmosphere was good, lots of televisions, a basic sports bar. it was a little loud, but this is expected for a casino restaurant.\n\nwe were seated quickly, but it took a while for the server to take our drink order and then even longer to take our food order. we had the blt burger, <mark>The Classic</mark> and we each had <mark>Skinny Fries</mark>. the burgers were cooked exactly as we ordered. they were a good size but still easy to eat and both were delicious! the fries were average, but tasted good. the pickle that came with the burger did not taste like a pickle at all. it was not good, one bite was enough for me.\n\noverall the food was much better than i expected, other than the pickle, everything was great. the service was slow and refills were hard to get, but our server knew the menu and had suggestions. like most places in vegas, it's a little pricey for a burger and fries, but overall i was pleased with everything, i would definitely stop by for another burger on our next trip.", 
            "this place was great! so great that this was our end of the night caffeine fix or soak up <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> food.\n\ngrabbed a quick bite here before a show and the burger was perfectly cooked. juicy without being greasy. the bun tasted great, but i think it needed to be a little more toasted. ordered the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>...fantastic. crunchy with a little kick. very good. they were super nice to modify one of their milkshakes so i could enjoy it and it was superb! thick and rich, very delicious!\n\nanother night we stopped in to eat a snack and drink some caffeine before going back to the tables. ordered a basket of all their fries. they were fabulous! my favorites were the <mark>Fat Fries</mark>. it was almost like eating a baked potato...very nice! the <mark>Skinny Fries</mark> were so good and crispy without being overly crispy.",

            "not the most exciting dinner experience i've ever had, but i guess most people are here to gamble, not eat. we were seated by a hostess with absolutely no personality...not a smile, even. and slow as a tortoise, to boot. but upon getting seated, we definitely got stuck with the dud waiter. it took him forever to come back and take our orders, and then another 10 minutes to flag him down to get cutlery. but on to the food...\n\ni shared a vegetable salad and the route 80 burger (bacon, cheese, caramelized onions), with a side of <mark>Buffalo Fries</mark> (<mark>Curly Fries</mark> smothered in buffalo sauce and blue cheese). the salad was delightful - crispy veggies, a few exotic ones that i looked and went \"what are you?\", and a tasty but light oregano dressing. the burger, which we ordered medium as suggested, was only ok. i guess i expected more than run of the mill, but it wasn't terribly exciting. it wasn't bad, necessarily, just not great. but the <mark>Buffalo Fries</mark> is where they fell down - while i loved the concept, the combo of buffalo sauce and blue cheese was incredibly salty, and not even the side of ranch dressing could make it edible after a few bites. it was too bad, because the spicy flame on the fries was great before the salt hit.", 
            "we/i thought that this would be a great place to enjoy the super bowl.  i reserved a table for the nominal (relatively nominal - as it was much more expensive elsewhere) fee of $125 per person which bought us reserved seats, unlimited menu food, and an open bar that afforded us water, soda, well liquors, milk shakes and an impressive assortment of beers.  i thought this was a great idea until i did the math and came to find out that there was no way i would eat or drink $125 worth of food within the 4 hour game window.  that being said, on to the review:\n\nthis is a stylized burger joint.  two bars.  it offers 11 televisions and your choice of bar, booth or table seating.  \n\nthe menu consists of burgers (of course) and a wide variety of pupus.  we ordered <mark>BBQ Nachos</mark> (by fair the best), <mark>Curly Fries</mark>, <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>, hot wings (these were no joke, hot as hades), chili cheese fries, and an asian salad.  unfortunately we never were able to order anything else.\n\nthe service, although pleasant, was mediocre at best.  i understand that they may have been overwhelmed at the sudden onslaught of orders, but damnit please bring my food in a timely manner.  not only was it slow (45 minutes!), once we received the food there were 3 extra orders of wings, 1 additional nacho, 1 additional <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> and they tried to give us a blt burger, too.  crazy right?  with a table full of carbs (that we didn't order and that we could never finish), our waiter never once asked if we were ready for the protein portion of the meal.  although our friend, who ordered the asian salad, wretched after taking two bites and sent it back.  sad really.\n\nmy wife enjoyed her two milkshakes ordered to cool off her mouth from the wings.  <mark>Mocha Mudslide</mark> i think.\n\neven though the service was suspect, they still added on an automatic gratuity.  are you f'n kidding me?\n\ni had a few drinks but, i swear, after the second one, there wasn't a drop of alcohol in the rest.  probably a good thing, maybe he was watching my back, no idea.\n\ngenerally very disappointed with the entire experience ......  the restaurant, the service, the food, the drinks, and yes especially the game.", 
            "i went here about four days ago with my boyfriend for our burger craving since i've had it bookmarked for a while. it seemed a little small inside but it had modern appeal, a bar area and several tvs.\nas for food, we shared the money business shake which was banana flavored with reese's peanut butter cup pieces. it wasn't as sweet as i thought it would be and had a homey taste to it. it tasted of fresh banana, none of that artificial stuff. i got the american wagyu burger which had truffle aioli, brie, spinach, portabello  mushrooms and of course wagyu beef! it was delicious! it reminded me of the funghi burger at holsteins except for in this burger, you could taste much more of the meat and the truffle flavor wasn't as extreme (which doesn't bother me but anyways). i would definitely eat that again! my boyfriend got the i-80 burger which had peppercorn crusted bacon, bbq sauce, sharp cheddar, and caramelized onions. delicious also! you could really tasted the peppercorn which made it a little different from the typical bbq bacon cheeseburgers. both were good portions, about the size of gordon ramsey's burgr, and the meat had more distinct flavor in it compared to holstein's and burgr.  the only thing about our food that i didn't care for were the two orders of fries we got. i got regular <mark>Curly Fries</mark> and they seemed a little stale, like they were cooked in advance and were just sitting for an hour or two under the heat lamps. pass on those. next, my boyfriend got <mark>Buffalo Fries</mark> which are fries drenched in buffalo sauce topped with feta and green onions. it's a good concept just not executed great. the fries were super soggy! it would have been a little better if the sauce was just drizzled on.\nour service was nothing special, she was friendly enough, and checked on us twice to make sure our water was filled and didn't take forever to bring out the check so it was still good even though she was really quiet.\noverall the food was delicious, but i still think i would choose burgr and holstein's over this place mainly because i liked the shakes and fries much better in those other two locations. if this place wasn't in vegas, where it has soo much competition, i think ratings would be much higher.",

            "ok, so i've been yelping my eats for almost a year now and have stayed away from posting myself but after blt, i simply had to start!\n\ni was on the strip yesterday and needed to grab lunch with a couple colleagues and we had heard that there was a new burger bar at the mirage and figured we would try.  all 3 of us prefer food to just about anything else so it was a leap of faith to go to a new place without yelping first (please hold the....serves you right comments)\n\nblt is a new boutique burger and shake restaurant at the mirage with an acclaimed chef, laurent tourondel. \n\nwe were seated pretty quickly but given a table toward the back of the restaurant by the kitchen so didn't really get a great feel for the d\\u00e9cor, but then again we came for the food. 3 hungry guys mid day for burgers and shakes, what could go wrong?\n\nthe waitress was attentive and helpful but based on some small talk; she is a bit disappointed in the crowd and mentioned the slow economy and hoped it would pick up.  after ordering drinks and burgers and some <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, we were all excited for the food. the shakes and soda took about 10 minutes but came and the shakes were decent. the <mark>Twinkie Boy</mark> was tasty but tasted like a vanilla shake with a touch of twinkie, wish i had gone with the pb&j shake that went by....that looked yummy.\n\nthe pickles came and wow! they were tasty; juicy, crispy and all around great when dipped in the spicy ranch dip. for $5, would have expected more than 8 pickles slices (about a half pickle total) but they were awesome which really helped my rating. \n\non to the main course.....our burgers and sides come and we are psyched. we made sure to get 3 different sides so we could experience them all... \n1)<mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>- greasy by any standard and way too much batter\n2)<mark>Waffle Fries</mark>- good but cold...must have been waiting for the burgers!\n3)<mark>Skinny Fries</mark>- hot, cooked perfectly, though a bit salty.\n\nnow the reason we came...the meat!\nburger 1- the kobe w/ swiss and grilled onions- not mine, but the headline from raf was \"pretty good but just a burger\"\n\nburger 2- <mark>The Classic</mark> w/ cheddar, bacon and their \"blt sauce\"- again...burger was fine, but the exact words paul uttered were.....\"would prefer a double-double from in-n-out\"\n\nburger 3-.....this was mine and the real reason for the post/rant\n\ni ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and their vermont cheddar.   now; my burger had been ordered medium so when it showed up with an \"mw\" toothpick in it, i began to get skeptical. it's a burger and since i don't think i have ever sent back a burger, i figure i will try it. one bite tells me that this thing is well done....gray all the way....the only red/pink i could find would be my ketchup....so, i showed the waitress and with her eyes she told me that \"it happens all the time and this place really sucks to work at!\" she took it back while my friends began their burgers and i snacked on the cold, salty, greasy fries. \n\nshe told me that they chef looked and said it was medium but would make me another.....was she kidding? not only did it have the wrong toothpick in it and no pink but this is customer service for a brand new place charging almost $20 for burger? whatever....\n\nso, everyone finished their burgers and mine shows up....boy did the chef show me.    how about some guesses for what toothpick held the bun together this time?????\n\nobviously, it wasn't the medium one i would have liked; it was mr, for their medium rare. i pointed it out as she served it and she shrugged.  so as i get ready to take a bite, i notice that it does have the grilled onions but also has raw red onions....really, if you order your onions grilled should you have to tell them to leave off the raw ones?\nwell, i can tell you that the toothpick with mr was wrong...should have said r, for raw, not for rare. no exaggeration here, it was still cold in the middle.  \n\nat this point, i clearly was done with this joint and had the manager come over. when she saw the burger, she actually agreed that it was undercooked for rare and not even close to medium and took it off the bill graciously. (they've been open for a month but she has already mastered the...\"i'm sorry, let me take this off the bill for you!\") again, this is the first time in 20 years of eating out at least 10 times a week that i refused to pay for something.   \n\nchances are \na)  this place has way too many issues to get it fixed quick enough\nb)  the waitress is probably already looking for a new job\nc)  the mananger seemed beaten in less than a month of being open. \nd)  the chef should thank the folks that acclaimed him in nyc and go back to the concepts that he must have found success in since this one will likely not cut it.\ne)   in a city with as many food choices as freaks, i can't imagine anyone eating at this place more than once.", 
            "after a very long flight from seattle infested with \"like oh my god!\" \"like totally!\" \"oh he's sooooo cute!\" \"do you know that song, oh my god i totally like love that song!\" from 2 dozen 14 year old girls on a soccer team plus parents, and a flight landing that had us hugging the seats in front of us for dear life, we were very relieved to be sitting in the soft lighting of blt burger.  yes the music is a little loud but hey, who doesn't love hearing thriller by mj and watching the elders in the next booth over bebopping around to it?  it was around midnight and we were beat and dying for a good burger and shakes.\n\nthe service:  friendly staff, waitress was attentive and nice and made sure we liked what we ordered.\n\nthe shakes:  wow!  i had a berry shake that was just so pretty i didn't want to mess it up by drinking it but i did anyway.  i'm not the biggest fan of shakes but that one had me sucking it down in one fell swoop.  my husband ordered a mocha type shake that even had chocolate whipped cream.  chocolate?  whipped cream?  who doesn't love that?\n\nthe burger:  ordered just a plain ole regular burger w/cheese and fries and <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> with potato skin type toppings.  the burger was just mouth wateringly out of this world.  it was juicy, cooked perfectly, flavorful without all the seasoning salt and paired perfectly with a toasted sesame bun.  wow.  i don't think i've ever had a burger this good.  the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were interesting.  nicely fried with cheese, bacon, sour cream and a jalepeno on each fry.  \n\nbottom line:  for $20, you get a burger, fries and milkshake.  by vegas hotel standards, that's positively cheap!  they also have spiked shakes that sounded delicious.  will def go back again.", 
            "lunch for 2 comes to around $70.00, but definitely worth going back!\n\ni've never had <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> before, but they are good!  the batter is so light and flavorful!\n\nboth the twinkie and campfire marshmellow milkshakes are out of this world! sweet, thick, and creamy, can't ask for more!\n\nthe signature blt burger and kobe burger are definitely \"gourmet\".  beef are cooked just right, the buns are soft and beautiful to look at too!\n\nthe <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are a little bit on the dry side for me.  i'm hoping they just overcooked it on accident (i have to believe that with everything else so delicious!)", 
            "as part of a comp package i received from the mirage, i was able to get a free meal here, so price wasn't really a concern.  that being said, if i were to pay for my meal, my review might be different.  it is pricey, however, the kobe burger i had (most expensive on the menu) was the best hamburger i ever had in my life.  it was juicy, flavorful (but not overpowering) and simple.  if it wasn't for $18 price tag, i would probably give this place 5 stars.  i also ordered a milkshake which was excellent as well.  would have like to have tried an alcoholic milkshake but that wouldn't have been comped, so i opted to stick with the traditional shakes.  i had the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> and they were just like any other fries, nothing special.  my recommendation is bite the bullet, splurge a little and have a lunch or dinner here....just go into knowing you are going to be overpaying, but that the food will be good.  service was also very prompt and efficient and got the order right the first time.", 
            "i finally got to eat at blt burger on a recent trip to lv.  i had originally tried to go there back in july 2008 when we had tickets to love, but there was some sort of incident that closed the restaurant down and we had to find another option.  it had remained on my radar ever since though.\n\nwe went on a monday evening, arriving something between 8:30 - 9:00 p.m.  i was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait.  we also got a nice table right by the breezeway, which led to some nice people watching and a game i like to call 'real or fake'.  \n\nthe service was good all-around, quick, friendly and the server even was kind enough to fake laugh at some of my jokes.  i ordered the #2 combo, which is a basic burger (with cheddar), fries (waffle style) and a milkshake (<mark>Nut Job</mark>).  the burger was good, but nothing particularly stood out about it.  the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were below average, a little too much seasoning i though.  the milkshake tasted pretty good, but the one problem with it was that it came with two huge straws (if you've ever been to panera bread and gotten a frozen drink, like that, but i think bigger).  i didn't try, but i'm pretty sure i literally could have fit three regular sized straws within this straw.  anyways, the straw sucked, and not in the good way, i wasn't even able to get all the milkshake from the glass.  i also tried one of the wife's <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> and it was average at best.\n\nthe remainder of the party was basically 'meh' about this place.  i didn't think it was a great value, but we were in vegas, so what can you expect.  i can't imagine going back there when there are so many other restaurants i'd like to try in vegas.  solid three.", 
            "yes, it's expensive. yes, burgers should automatically come with fries. but...the burgers are some of the best i've had. this time, i had the blt and the husband had <mark>The Classic</mark>. <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were ordered too.\n*burgers - delicious!!! 5 stars.\n*fries - a bit overdone and not piping-hot, but tasty none the less.\n*service - not spectacular, but decent and friendly.\n* ambience - vegas=people watching and we were at an outer table. can't beat that.\n* overall, this is a great burger and in line with vegas prices. i can't complain.", 
            "i ate at blt burger a couple times this year during a stay at the mirage.  there was never a wait and the atmosphere is a fun and easy.  i had the tex-mex burger and the <mark>Shaft's Blue</mark>.  i also got a side of <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> once and <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> the other time i was there.  overall the food was fresh, cooked to order and tasty.  i did think it was a bit too expensive for what it was, but it wasn't totally out of line with vegas prices.  i still like burger bar at mandalay better, but if you in the middle of the strip and want a darn good burger i wouldn't hesitate to hit up blt b.", 
            "this place screwed up my order and still gets five stars. \n\nwe ordered carry out because we wanted to lounge in the room and not have to deal with the crowds.\n\ntheir burger was incredible! the meat was smoky, the bacon was bomb and it was so juicy and glorious. \n\nnow the downfall was we ordered cheddar and got some kind of weird ass cheese on there. it was a strange phenom to be gagging as youre eating such an incredible burger. hmm...\n\nand we also ordered the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> with the bacon and cheese on top. out of this world.\n\nrelatively cheap at $5 for about 5 big yummy fries and i nearly wanted a second order they were so awesome.\n\nhuge crispy <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> covered in loads of cheese, bacon bits, green onion and jalapeno with sour cream to dip them in...if there was better than fat girl heaven, this would certainly be it.\n\ni didnt think it was that expensive compared to many other places so i definitely, definitely eat there again.", 
            "omg i am having shakes just thinking about this place!\n\nso good! i heard angels sing to me as i bit into my burger. my husband looked at me like i was crazy, but i didn't care. this was my first food \"o\" and dang it i wasn't going to be disturbed. \n\ni stopped for a moment and took a bite of my <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>. then it happened. i saw the light. when my sight returned all i saw was an empty plate and my hubbies perplexed face. this place is a must if you are in vegas.", 
            "blt! gotta rave about the <mark>Lamb Tandoori</mark> burger! it was the first burger i tried here when i first went here in april and when i went back in early september in did not disappoint! it is juicy and flavorful. the pickles are amazing. probably  because i am biased because they don't taste like jarred or regular pickles. as one review said it tastes more like a cucumber (but that's how i like it). the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> are good. my boyfriend had the kobe burger and he said it truly melt in his mouth. good place to stop by if you're in the area.", 
            "i had such high hopes that the burgers here would knock my socks off in the same way seattle's <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> laboratory (http://www.yelp.com/biz/<mark>The Lunch Box</mark>-laboratory-seattle#hrid:va-9fdae-fu2orpehbfweq ) did.... but sadly this did not take place.\n\nwhile the burger menu is inventive what ends up on your plate is nothing more than a high price mickey ds burger.... even the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> tasted like _________ (insert random cardboard like substance here).\n\nbut the milkshakes on the other hand are a smash! get the <mark>Twinkie Boy</mark> (vanilla ice cream blended with caramel and a twinkie) and be in heaven for as long as it takes you to suck it down. enjoy!", 
            "i've eaten here twice and i have to say that the first time was a better dining experience. i had the turkey burger... yum! and a twinkie milkshake... this last time, i had the <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> burger... it came with avocado slices, but  it wasn't a slice, it was like a whole half of an avocado... i ended up just taking it out because it was too difficult to eat. the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were good though, probably the best part of that meal.\n\nthe restaurant is trendy and the staff was accommodating.\n\nthey say that three times a charm and in true vegas style, i will just have to take my chances next time.", 
            "so we found this place because a group of friends were staying at the mirage. we came here on sunday morning when it turned into daylights savings time and they turned us away because they said the kitchen closes at 3:15am (mind you, it just turned 3 because of the time change and they still didn't offer a seat after their 3:15 explanation).\n\nanyhow, we all got seated relatively quickly for a sunday lunch. we all got different burgers. i had a bite of the salmon burger, quite interesting but wouldn't be surprised if it was just canned salmon with some fancy shmancy sauce. i got a burger that had onions, mushrooms and bleu cheese. i also added a fried egg for 1.50. it was definitely a 3.5/5 tasting burger--i probably couldn't get over the fact that all of our burgers, though medium rare came out in different shades of pink to brown. the taste was good... but 14 something bucks for this burger seems on the pricey side + because mine came with cheese, i didn't have to add it like the other burgers. it was a reasonable size but for 14 bucks i think i could get a better burger elsewhere.\n\nwe tried some of the different sides. they were all about 5-6 bucks.\n<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>: 3/5 - average, still would put boiling crab and father's office over this place\n<mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>: 5/5 - really good combination of batter to onion\njalapeno poppers: 4/5 - pretty good here\n<mark>Waffle Fries</mark>: 2/5  - you think cheese and sour cream would save this side, but it doesn't.\n\ni did enjoy the decor of the place, looks pretty hip. the kitchen is in the center of the restaurant and they have this cool artwork of what looks to be like the road to vegas (from california).\n\nfor 4 burgers, and 4 sides, it came out to about $25. i think i'll check something out next time, this place was more out of convenience.", 
            "the first night in vegas i refused to go here, not wanting to spend over $10 on a burger. fancy as they were, proudly claiming the 100% certified black angus beef (or cab, as the menu referred to them) at the center of many sandwiches, i wanted something different than a burger. i mean, i was in vegas and, really, how special can one make a burger?\n\ni gave this place a shot on the next night when we had just an hour before a show in the mirage. we had to wait in line, but it moved quickly. while waiting, i saw amazing-looking milkshakes served from the side bar. we could see people dining, but when the roles were reversed and i sat, i didn't feel impatient eyes watching me eat. the decor of the place is actually interesting and modern. i really liked the exposed grill and kitchen area set in the back of the restaurant. you could see the chefs and wait staff interacting, hard at work. it felt open with no unnecessary divide.  \n\nnot realizing it, i unintentionally often test my waiter or waitress at restaurants when i order water with lemon as my beverage. i'm not trying to be picky but a lot of wait staff forget the lemon. the waiter at blt burger brought me a small plate of them promptly. we told him that we had a show to catch and he understood. he and all the wait staff moved so quickly yet with precision. i felt like i was with pros. \n\nokay, so was the over $10 burger worth it? i actually ended up ordering the bbq brisket. i enjoyed it but found it a bit dry and just a bit more sauce would have solved that problem. my mom really enjoyed her salmon burger, which was fresh and tasty. the others split a \"blt\" burger (someone had to get it) and i must admit that the bite i had was filled with bacon and burger goodness. the carnivore in me sometimes enjoys that. we also shared <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> and started with the <mark>Waffle Bites</mark>, which were very much like loaded potato skins. \n\nnot a healthy meal by any means, but it satisfied us and got us to our show on time. i'd go again, but next time i'm trying a milkshake.", 
            "staggered into this place and was knocked off my feet. delicious burger! make sure to get it medium. <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were awsome.", 
            "blt burger is a-ok. we were looking for a place for some grease to absorb the evening before's alcohol consumption and this place definitely did the trick. \n\nwe all had burger combos, which included burgers, fries (<mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>, respectively) and a soda...and they were all very good! the service was fantastic, but i just have a really big issue paying $22 for all of that.", 
            "needed a place to have a decent lunch before heading to the airport. wasn't the first choice (we were a little bit over quota on beef), but there wasn't a line and time was a factor. burgers were good as were the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> (but $5 for the rather small serving seemed excessive). friendly and efficient service. can't complain.", 
            "this could've been a 5 star experience, but the pricey, but not potent drinks brought it down. don't get me wrong- the mojitos were okay, but this is a miami girl you're talking to, so bring on the rum!\nthe salmon burger and the pork-n-shrimp burger were absolutely delicious-great alternatives to your usual burger.\nthe tex mex looked pretty yummy but was too messy for me to try. i loved the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> and asked for a side of sriracha mayo to dip them in- talk about spicy, yummy, goodness! \nthere's no room for anything else now, but i will have to come back for an adult milkshake later! they look fantastically indulgent - perfect for a warm vegas day!", 
            "blt burger is located in the mirage where my boyfriend and i were staying for our vegas trip so we decided to check it out. \n\nas with any place that has a turkey burger i decided to order that and my boyfriend got himself the tex-mex burger with <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>. the turkey burger was delicious and from <mark>The Lunch Box</mark>'s review the tex-mex burger tasted good but is a messy eater. fries are just that, nothing special about them and they give you a small amount. \n\nthe reason this place gets 3 stars is because there was nothing impressive about the service and the prices (as everything is on the strip) were a tad expensive. for example for a side of fries it would set you back five dollars. \n\ngood turkey burger, pricey if you don't keep track of what you're ordering.", 
            "expect to wait a little bit if you come here for dinner on a friday night. cute little burger joint in the mirage. all the burgers on the menu looked really good. i ordered <mark>The Stripper</mark>...which is basically a burger without the bun. it was filling and very tasty. the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were really yummy too. my friend order the chicken fingers and the \"all-nighter\" which was a spiked milkshake. the chicken fingers were pretty standard. the milkshake was crazy good! you could barely taste the alcohol in it. service was ok and prices were pretty good considering its vegas.", 
            "loves it! a \"stripper burger\" (burger with no buns, ha) with a fried egg and <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>..... the most amazing meal at 2am (at least, i think it was 2... i lost all concept of time in that town, i swear). this meal saved my life two nights in a row... if i hadn't gone and enjoyed this meal, the next day would have been a lot more painful to endure! i never got a chance to try the milkshakes, but they sounded positively scrumtrulescent (points to anyone who knows what \"scrumtrulescent\" is). short story: just go.", 
            "i was taken here for my birthday.  because my family knows my affinity for cheese burgers.  the place is nice looking.  smaller than i expected and wide open.  <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> are very comfy which i like.  i have been in some uncomfortable boots, and it sometimes can ruin a meal in my opinion.\n\nthe waitress was friendly and attentive.  i had the american kobe with oregon cheddar, and it was good, but didn't blow me away.  although the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were really good.  this place is a good spot if your maybe staying at the hotel and don't wanna spend too much cash.  even though it's a bit more expensive then maybe it should be.  with several different gourmet type burger places on the strip i don't know when i will be back.  my biggest regret is not having one of there spiked milkshakes they looked really good.  i will be back to try one of those for sure.", 
            "now i love blt burger back in nyc so i decided to take my family to dinner here one evening. i love the burgers and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. (not to mention the alcoholic milkshakes.) something about this location just didn't rub me right. it could have been how the restaurant is located right by the entrance of the mirage and across the way from a fat tuesdays wannabe. you have to deal with all the screaming, drunk tourists. (some of them actually coming up to your table along the way.) since it is located on the strip the prices are always a few dollars more. i love all the different kinds of burgers though. <mark>The Stripper</mark> burger is my favorite. (and healthiest choice!) the servers were very nice and attentive even though they have to deal with the loud screaming people on the daily. very on point too and the wait for the food was pretty quick. i say to go during a week night earlier in the evening. make sure to get the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (or <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> if you're not the sweet potato type!)", 
            "i keep coming here and keep wanting to love it, but it is just not happening. the best things at blt burger are actually not the burgers (especially for the price).\n\nnow, don't get me wrong, the burgers are solid. in fact, if quality burgers aren't a regular thing for you, this place may blow your mind. but alas, the burgers just aren't as juicy and flavorful as other burger places in town. \n\nthere are a lot of burger options to choose from, though, including lamb, vegetarian, etc. - so there are legitimately more options here than other burger places.\n\neverything else on the menu has been great (<mark>Waffle Fries</mark>, <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, chili, etc.). the two best things about blt burger are the jalapeno poppers and adult milkshakes.\n\nthe jalapeno poppers are long and thick. they deliver a powerful punch of spicy and come with a spicy salsa-type dipping sauce to dip them in (double spicy!).\n\nthe adult milkshakes are an absolute must (a.k.a. milkshakes with alcohol). i have repeatedly taken tourists here just for the milkshakes. i personally recommend the <mark>Malibu Barbie</mark> (coconut fruity goodness). the milkshakes are tall and thick and so deliciously yummy. beware, though, the shakes are incredibly filling. \n\nthe atmosphere is well-suited for a burger place. it's on the smaller side and open. it's casual, but burger-chic.",

            "yes i know this place is expensive i read the reviews prior to eating here. it cost around $56.00 for two classic hamburgers, two orders of fries and two specialty shakes.  but what the hell...it's vegas!\n\nthe shakes were amazing.  we got <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> and the <mark>Twinkie Boy</mark>!  the twinkie one was actually much better but both were good.  the hamburger was great...we also added avocado and cheese.  the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were great and the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were good...not the best i've had but decent.  \n\nthe service was good and the restaurant itself was really cute.  i would come here again if not for anything else but the shakes!!!",

            "it's been three months since my vegas trip, and i still think of the amazing burger i had a blt burger, so i'm going to wrap up this review i had saved from december:\n\nwe ate a late lunch here during our stay. when we arrived, we waited maybe 5-10 minutes for a table. if there is a line, don't fret, because tables turn over quickly. my friend had a #1 combo (burger, <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>, and a soda for $18). the combos are a better value, but lately, i have been trying to only order enough to satiate my hunger, so i only ordered a <mark>Lamb Tandoori</mark> burger with fries. i thought my burger was outstanding--a perfect combination of ground lamb with indian-inspired as well as traditional toppings. the fries were a miss--i've certainly had better and preferred my friend's <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>. i would probably forgo fries and order a milkshake or dessert on my next visit. just one burger was enough for me and even thought i was tempted by the milkshakes and desserts, i was simply too stuffed to order anything else.\n\nas far as price goes, i felt it was the price point was fair. we have gourmet burger bars in dc where just a burger would set you back $12-18. this is on par with the competition. and did i mention i still think about this burger every time i log into yelp and see my saved review from eons ago? that in itself is testament enough to make blt burger a value in my book.", 
            "since we were staying at the mirage, before going out, my girlfriends and i got a quick bite from blt. my friends got the <mark>Kobe Slider Trio</mark> and those were soo adorable and smelled really good. now i didn't try a burger (i don't eat meat) but i did try <mark>Waffle Bites</mark>. i loved those; lots of seasoning, melted cheese and sour cream and jalapeno (it came with bacon which i just picked off). all the ingredients complemented each other really well and i couldn't stop eating them... all seven or eight of them.\n\n... yes, seven standard sized <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> for like $7. eh. i was kind of expecting to get a plate full of them lol when they brought it out, i was like \"womp womp womp waaah!\" if i had known thats what the order was, i would've just ran across the street to denny's and gotten double that for the price. i must say that even though there weren't that many fries, each one was ridiculously good.\n\nthumbs up for taste and service but thumbs down for the portions they serve.\n\nfyi: the floor is slippery (it looked like sealed cork) so be careful, especially if you're an idiot on heels like i am; i was surprised i didn't fall hahaha", 
            "my trip to vegas was a slew of different burgers. \n\ncame here after having visited i love burgers at the palazzo. \n\nblt burger is alright in my book. the menu seemed to have some appealing options, but none i could decide on. i debated between the lamb burger and falafel burger. the lamb burger came with olives and cucumbers, and not being a fan of either, decided i should just go for the falafel. \n\nnot to mention our waitress was pretty unhelpful at making suggestions. when both me and my friend asked her for her recommendation she would just say, \"it just depends on what you like!\" well, of course it does, i guess, but we're asking for at least a half-assed fake, \"most people order this\" at the very least. meh. \n\nthe falafel burger, sure enough came with a very large falafel patty which i couldn't finish at all. it is hella falafel, is all i'm saying. it's a good falafel, but lots of falafel. almost an overdose of falafel. i enjoyed it, but wished the patty might have been thinner or something... hm. perhaps that's just me.\n\nalso ordered the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, which were as good as any <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> in my book. if i were to go back in time i might want to try the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>, just because i haven't had <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> in a long time. \n\nblt burger was fine. i don't think it's a must-have in vegas, but if in a crunch or if in the mirage then it's also not a bad option.", 
            "i loved this place!!!!!  we came here twice in our five day stay in las vegas--once for lunch and once just for dessert because it was that delicious.\n\nthe first time we came, i had <mark>The Classic</mark> cheeseburger, and my friend had the blt burger.  both of them were amazing.  the meat was so tender and juicy, and you could really tell it was high quality beef.  she had <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> that were awesome, but the real star of the meal was my <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>.  they were so crispy, and they held onto the ketchup nicely, which is very important to me :)  also, they had a delicious crunch when you bit into them, but the insides were really fluffy.  soooo delicious!!  on this particular trip, our waiter was awesome and attentive and had great suggestions.\n\nthe second trip we made was at about 10pm because we were craving something sweet for dessert.  our waiter was not good.  he was surly, sullen, didn't introduce himself (i still don't know his name) and was clearly not happy to be there.  he seemed put off if we asked for things like spoons for our ice cream.  horrible waiter.\n\nbut anyway, we ordered a peanut butter chocolate milkshake and the krispy kreme bread pudding.  both were amazing, but my favorite was the milkshake!  it was delicious, and with the giant straw, i was able to drink it lickity split! :)\n\nso my overall impression with this restaurant is a positive one, and if you are going to get anything, be sure to order it with the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> :)", 
            "came here twice when i was staying at the mirage hotel. first time i ordered the american wagyu burger. got it cooked medium and came out perfect with a slice of monterey jack cheese and a side of <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>.\nsecond time before i left to come home was the kobe sliders, ordered those medium as well and came out perfect. they each had different flavors to them. one was blue cheese, one had sauteed onions and last one had smokey bacon which was my favorite.", 
            "we stayed at the mirage for the weekend.  just wanted some quick cheaper food, but they don't have a fast food court.  so we just decided on blt since it was a simpler cuisine.  my group didn't want to spend so much, and was just going to order some appetizers but hey were in vegas, went with the <mark>Lamb Tandoori</mark> burger w/ <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>.  burger is $13 fries are $5.  jesus christ was that burger juicy.  i would say this was the best burger i have ever had, or forsure top 3 burgers.  the prices were a little high for some basic burgers, but the portions are just perfect.", 
            "yummmmmmmmm!!!  don't look at the prices - it's a restaurant on the strip.  expect to drop some cash (duh, you're in vegas).\nthey have crispy <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>!!  the best!\nfull bar a+\nmilkshake bar!!!  awesome if that's your thing.  my dad said his fruity milkshake was delicious and finished it in probably 4 seconds.\nmy dad kept talking about his burger and how good it was.  i got the special chicken sandwich with avocados, bacon, and special sauce.  it was so good.  the bun was toasted perfectly on the inside and soft on the outside.  \nit was almost as gourmet as burgers and sandwiches can be.", 
            "when in vegas, i often stay at the mirage.  i've been to blt burger about 4 times.  tasty burger, though a bit expensive (not surprising given its location). the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> and <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> are solid.  i will say, however, that the milkshakes are to die for.  seriously, they are evil.  to the point where i am like, \"i need a blt shake as soon as i land in vegas\" evil.  luckily, i only make it to vegas once or twice a year, so it's a manageable addiction thus far.", 
            "we meet some out of town friends at blt burger today for lunch, and to fix some of their hangovers.  we were sat quickly, even with a party of 7.  then..... we sat, and waited for our server for at least 10 minutes; (and not a i'm impatient 10 min, a real 10 min)  finally, a very impersonal  serer came over to pour us some water.  no hello, no name, no welcome.  as someone who manages restaurants and trains servers and has been one, our server was super disappointing.  the entire meal she could have cared less about us.  most of the order was right when it came, just a few fry miss orders, which the food runner fixed immediately.  \n\non to the food.  my \"classic\" burger was cooked mw as i ordered.  the bun was soft and the produce fresh.  i added oregon cheddar and crispy bacon which i got (yeah, i hate soggy bacon)  they defiantly skimped on the cheese though.  the patty its self had no flavor or seasoning, at least it wasn't over cooked.  i ordered the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> (which i had to ask for when my burger came).  the fries were good, not super hot but seasoned well  everyone at the table ate all their food but had no rave reviews.  my bf got a black and white shake, which is a mix of vanilla and chocolate, it was good, a little too chocolate but the whipped cream on to was amazing!!  all of our sodas were flat when they came to the table, so we informed our server.  she brought more flat soda, so we stuck with water.  she still charged us for the sodas even though we informed her twice and no one drank them.\n\nover all i wouldn't bring others there with so many other great burger places in town.  mostly because of service, by the look of it non of the servers had that \"vegas\" needed customer service.", 
            "50 bucks for two burgers, 2 orders of fries and a milkshake. in vegas, if the food is decent, i actually don't mind dropping this kind of money, especially after i cleared 6/6 on my sports betting!\nhowever, at 2 in the morning and a little tipsy i can still tell this place is not very good. the <mark>Skinny Fries</mark> are worse than mcdonalds but twice as expensive. their <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> are worse than carl's jr's criss cut fries by a large margin. they were so stale. the waiter insisted we get dipping sauce... i think he knew it would help with downing the disgusting french fries. \nthe burgers aesthetically looked pretty awesome. too bad thats the only plus. for the price of a cheeseburger at blt you can get 5 in n out burgers and it doesn't taste as good. the thing with burgers is that they are everywhere. so you have more reference points. i cook burgers at home and blt looked like they forgot to add salt and pepper when they were mixing the meat to make the patties. totally bland, a huge disappointment. if i had to compare the taste of this to a burger you all know, i would say its better than the mc donald's double cheeseburger, but worse than a whopper from burger king. \nthe milkshake '<mark>Berry Me</mark>' was pretty yummy. big serving with fresh fruit was the only highlight of this sad sad meal. \n\nnext time you are in vegas, do not gamble on this restaurant, take your chances elsewhere!",

            "we were in the area and needed something to eat. rather than consult yelp and then figure out which hotel an eatery is located at (especially in the midday heat), we looked around for a place with a long line and decent looking food and blt fit the bill. \n\ndespite the moniker including the word \"burger\", we only opted to try both a salad and a burger - specifically the vegetarian falafel burger and the citrus salmon salad. we went with the server's recommendation of the <mark>Fat Fries</mark>. the falafel burger was literally a crunchy falafel patty tucked inside a burger. generally speaking, it was pretty good though i think they could find a new burger bun supplier as that fell a little short. this is very filling and somewhat heavy, so we were glad we went 50-50 and split the salad and the burger. the salad was surprisingly good since this is a burger joint. the salmon was seasoned well and had a nice char to it without being overcooked. the salad was dressed well and the lettuce and avocadoes were fresh and light. \n\nthe fries were definitely fat and seasoned; since i don't really care for seasoned fries, i only had a few pieces. i noticed most people just split an order of fries (or whatever fried item) since the portion is fairly sizeable. for what it's worth, it seemed like only the <mark>Skinny Fries</mark> were not seasoned. i would also caution against the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> as some of the orders i saw around me were clearly burnt with black patches on the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> themselves. this is the first time i've ever seen burnt <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>. i think the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were also on the very well-done side since they were very brown and hard (like a board), based on what i saw at other tables. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> looked okay, however. \n\nservice was okay and not particularly attentive, though in their defense, this place is very busy. we had to flag people down for more water and it took about 10 minutes before anyone came to take our order, even though we had closed our menus and were clearly looking around for a server. pricing is about average for vegas, meaning high compared to similar places elsewhere in the u.s.", 
            "met my gal pal for lunch.  we shared <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, a toasted marshmallow shake, and <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>, and we each ordered a burger.  bill was $45 - we were stuffed!\n\nthe <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> were the absolute best i have ever had - ever.  they were melt in your mouth, hot, juicy, and phenomenally excellent!  $6 and the portion was way more than fair!  i would go back just for a drink and <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> any ole time.\n\nshake was tasty.  blended chunks of perfectly blackened marshmallow inside.   they very kindly split the shake into two cups for us and garnished each with a toasted marshmallow and a big straw for sucking ease!  1/2 a shake was more than enough for this girl!\n\nmy burger was excellent.  i ordered a burger off the menu but made several changes/substitutions and it was no problem.  i ordered it medium rare and it came out perfect.  dripped iron flavored bloody meat juice onto my plate with every bite.  yum.  it had spicy tobasco crunchy onions, bacon, cheddar cheese and so on. \n\nour service was friendly and nice.  we didn't see very much of him but we got everything we needed.  \n\nit was expensive but that is to be expected.  i'd go again and i'm recommending it to others.  i'll add it to my list of super excellent burgers in vegas.",

            "ok, so i've been yelping my eats for almost a year now and have stayed away from posting myself but after blt, i simply had to start!\n\ni was on the strip yesterday and needed to grab lunch with a couple colleagues and we had heard that there was a new burger bar at the mirage and figured we would try.  all 3 of us prefer food to just about anything else so it was a leap of faith to go to a new place without yelping first (please hold the....serves you right comments)\n\nblt is a new boutique burger and shake restaurant at the mirage with an acclaimed chef, laurent tourondel. \n\nwe were seated pretty quickly but given a table toward the back of the restaurant by the kitchen so didn't really get a great feel for the d\\u00e9cor, but then again we came for the food. 3 hungry guys mid day for burgers and shakes, what could go wrong?\n\nthe waitress was attentive and helpful but based on some small talk; she is a bit disappointed in the crowd and mentioned the slow economy and hoped it would pick up.  after ordering drinks and burgers and some <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, we were all excited for the food. the shakes and soda took about 10 minutes but came and the shakes were decent. the <mark>Twinkie Boy</mark> was tasty but tasted like a vanilla shake with a touch of twinkie, wish i had gone with the pb&j shake that went by....that looked yummy.\n\nthe pickles came and wow! they were tasty; juicy, crispy and all around great when dipped in the spicy ranch dip. for $5, would have expected more than 8 pickles slices (about a half pickle total) but they were awesome which really helped my rating. \n\non to the main course.....our burgers and sides come and we are psyched. we made sure to get 3 different sides so we could experience them all... \n1)<mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>- greasy by any standard and way too much batter\n2)<mark>Waffle Fries</mark>- good but cold...must have been waiting for the burgers!\n3)<mark>Skinny Fries</mark>- hot, cooked perfectly, though a bit salty.\n\nnow the reason we came...the meat!\nburger 1- the kobe w/ swiss and grilled onions- not mine, but the headline from raf was \"pretty good but just a burger\"\n\nburger 2- <mark>The Classic</mark> w/ cheddar, bacon and their \"blt sauce\"- again...burger was fine, but the exact words paul uttered were.....\"would prefer a double-double from in-n-out\"\n\nburger 3-.....this was mine and the real reason for the post/rant\n\ni ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and their vermont cheddar.   now; my burger had been ordered medium so when it showed up with an \"mw\" toothpick in it, i began to get skeptical. it's a burger and since i don't think i have ever sent back a burger, i figure i will try it. one bite tells me that this thing is well done....gray all the way....the only red/pink i could find would be my ketchup....so, i showed the waitress and with her eyes she told me that \"it happens all the time and this place really sucks to work at!\" she took it back while my friends began their burgers and i snacked on the cold, salty, greasy fries. \n\nshe told me that they chef looked and said it was medium but would make me another.....was she kidding? not only did it have the wrong toothpick in it and no pink but this is customer service for a brand new place charging almost $20 for burger? whatever....\n\nso, everyone finished their burgers and mine shows up....boy did the chef show me.    how about some guesses for what toothpick held the bun together this time?????\n\nobviously, it wasn't the medium one i would have liked; it was mr, for their medium rare. i pointed it out as she served it and she shrugged.  so as i get ready to take a bite, i notice that it does have the grilled onions but also has raw red onions....really, if you order your onions grilled should you have to tell them to leave off the raw ones?\nwell, i can tell you that the toothpick with mr was wrong...should have said r, for raw, not for rare. no exaggeration here, it was still cold in the middle.  \n\nat this point, i clearly was done with this joint and had the manager come over. when she saw the burger, she actually agreed that it was undercooked for rare and not even close to medium and took it off the bill graciously. (they've been open for a month but she has already mastered the...\"i'm sorry, let me take this off the bill for you!\") again, this is the first time in 20 years of eating out at least 10 times a week that i refused to pay for something.   \n\nchances are \na)  this place has way too many issues to get it fixed quick enough\nb)  the waitress is probably already looking for a new job\nc)  the mananger seemed beaten in less than a month of being open. \nd)  the chef should thank the folks that acclaimed him in nyc and go back to the concepts that he must have found success in since this one will likely not cut it.\ne)   in a city with as many food choices as freaks, i can't imagine anyone eating at this place more than once.",

            "the service and the burger were both five stars.\nthe sides and shakes really brought the place down.\n\ni ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> with bbq onion and vermont cheddar.  the onions were a sauteed mix of onions in bar-b-que sauce. it was so good. it was cooked perfectly to my request (i was warned they were cooked a bit under - so ordered medium well). really loved the burger.\n\nthe sides were such a disappointment. there were four of us and we ordered <mark>Fat Fries</mark> which were served cold and kind of mushy. the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were warm and crisp, but nothing special.  my least favorite was the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> that my group ordered.  they were doughy/breaded so thick and huge - but not breading. it was kind of sweet, like a donut. a pickle donut. so, sandwiched in the middle of this dough was a little hamburger-slice style of dill pickle. not my thing. at all. \n\nwent back at about midnight the next night to get shakes to go. was surprised to see the shake mix come out of a soft-serve style machine.  i got the <mark>Twinkie Boy</mark> which tastes exactly as it sounds - a twinkie all mixed up in a shake. it was average. i was on a sugar high for the rest of the night. probably won't do that again.", 
            "went here for dinner september 26, 2008. delicious burgers, good beer/liquor selection.\n\ni guess my real issues are that i can't drink beer and they were out of several of the wines they offered on their menu (and they only had like four red varietals and four white varietals).\n\ni had a salmon burger and my boyfriend had the burger with mushrooms, etc. (can't remember what its called), which he had been warned to get medium-cooked because when he said med-rare, the server warned that med-rare was pretty rare. he thought that medium was too well-done for his taste. my salmon burger was fine. but nothing to write home about. \n\ni know that vegas inflates prices, but i still found this place a bit over-priced for the diner theme. other gourmet burger places in different casinos offer more for less. \n\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> we ordered extra (at ridiculous mark-up, to be sure!) were good, but again, the quantity was minuscule for the money we paid.\n\nhonestly, i went to in-n-out burger later in our trip, and was more satisfied with my $2 burger and $1.50 fries than with my burger and fries here that cost me $20.", 
            "this place really hit the spot for me on my last visit.  i don't eat burgers but i saw some salads and veggie burger-type items on the menu so i gave it a try.  i opted for the falafel burger.  first of all, it was huge.  the falafel patty was really big and it had a good flavor - just a bit spicy.  it came with lettuce, tomatoes, a creamy sauce and tons of avocado.  i definitely could not eat it all but i would order it again.  it also came with a nice pickle.\n\nspeaking of pickles, i did try a few of the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>.  personally, i would never order these on my own because i take a firm stance against the gratuitous frying of things that don't even need to be cooked, like pickles and candy bars.  however, i sampled a few from my friend's plate and they were tasty.  but still, this whole concept seems silly to me, and it made me sad to see the little pickle slice with all this blown up batter around it.  so, they did taste good yet i hate them on principle and i think it's mean to do this to pickle slices.\n\nsweet potatoes do need to be cooked so i did order the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  they were good, although not the best i've had, and i was a little disappointed that they came with ketchup only and not a special sauce.  but, of all the fried sides to choose from, i might order these again (or <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> because they had those, too).\n\nthe service here was good and i like that you can watch people walking in and out of the casino here.  i found the atmosphere to be pretty much in line with the whole rest of the mirage and i enjoyed the background music.  additionally, in the past i have ordered spiked milkshakes to go from here and they were darn tasty.  but, they're filling - i can easily forego a meal and just have the milkshake.  the prices overall are not too bad, either, all things considered.",

            "so we found this place because a group of friends were staying at the mirage. we came here on sunday morning when it turned into daylights savings time and they turned us away because they said the kitchen closes at 3:15am (mind you, it just turned 3 because of the time change and they still didn't offer a seat after their 3:15 explanation).\n\nanyhow, we all got seated relatively quickly for a sunday lunch. we all got different burgers. i had a bite of the salmon burger, quite interesting but wouldn't be surprised if it was just canned salmon with some fancy shmancy sauce. i got a burger that had onions, mushrooms and bleu cheese. i also added a fried egg for 1.50. it was definitely a 3.5/5 tasting burger--i probably couldn't get over the fact that all of our burgers, though medium rare came out in different shades of pink to brown. the taste was good... but 14 something bucks for this burger seems on the pricey side + because mine came with cheese, i didn't have to add it like the other burgers. it was a reasonable size but for 14 bucks i think i could get a better burger elsewhere.\n\nwe tried some of the different sides. they were all about 5-6 bucks.\n<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>: 3/5 - average, still would put boiling crab and father's office over this place\n<mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>: 5/5 - really good combination of batter to onion\njalapeno poppers: 4/5 - pretty good here\n<mark>Waffle Fries</mark>: 2/5  - you think cheese and sour cream would save this side, but it doesn't.\n\ni did enjoy the decor of the place, looks pretty hip. the kitchen is in the center of the restaurant and they have this cool artwork of what looks to be like the road to vegas (from california).\n\nfor 4 burgers, and 4 sides, it came out to about $25. i think i'll check something out next time, this place was more out of convenience.", 
            "i really enjoyed this!  reasonable prices and they have local beers on tap.  decided to try the falafel burger with <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>.  washed it down with a couple local <mark>Sin City Amber</mark> ales.  its not too fancy, but the food is top notch if you are in for a quick bite.   located in the mirage.", 
            "never judge a book by its cover.  this place looks so appetizing, fun, and cool. but hey! its not.  we came here for a late night dinner on a thursday night, and the place was semi-crowded, but not over crowded.  there wasn't a wait or anything.  and i was so disappointed with this place! \n\nfood: the food looks so much better than it actually is.  the pictures make the burgers appear bigger, juicier, and yummier than they are.  the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> are kind of soggy, the fries were alright, and the pickle that is served with the burger is gross! it tastes like a rotten cucumber. \n\nservice: the waitress was nice, but man the food took so long to come out.  and they didn't even bring everything at once.  they even forgot to bring out a side dish that someone at my table ordered.  \n\nambiance: the place looks fun and the decor is nice for the type of restaurant it is.  \n\nprice: too expensive for what you get.  \n\ndon't come here! there are so many better places to check out in the mirage. lots of places are open super late, so dont come here because you feel like this place would be convenient.  \nservice:", 
            "the burgers were very average,  nothing spectacular and for 13 bucks i want a good burger.  it was dry with little flavor.  fries or <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were extra.\n\nit is worth going there if you like milk shakes.  wow!  the shakes are amazing.  \n\noverall - being a local and down there to visit family - better hamburgers other places for less money.", 
            "move over big mac, outta the way whopper... blt burgers are the best burgers in vegas!  your mouth will water just standing in front of the blt burger sign...its the aroma, the open grill right smack in the middle, and the menu of various types of burgers and meats that will make you forget the vegas buffets (for a limited time that is, i gotta have my buffets)!  i ordered the lamb burger, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, and hazelnut shake...sooo good that i felt a burger high, uh until dinner that is!    i ordered my burger medium well so as to not bite into a dry burger, i wanted my meat nice and juicy...blt does not disappoint when it comes to taste and well cooked meat.  i actually saw this place on the food network's \"chefs vs. city,\" and i was immediately hooked.  so don't just settle for a burger, surrender to a blt burger!",

(i normally hate <mark>Horseradish Cole Slaw</mark>, but this one was really good.  the best thing was the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>.  when you take your first bite, you can savor the crispiness of it, and the sweetness of the onions, combined with a little bit of ketchup, and i was in love.  \n\nblt burger is not the cheapest place in town, which is why the 4 stars instead of 5.  for the 2 of us, it came out to about $50.00 with tip.",

            "i keep coming here and keep wanting to love it, but it is just not happening. the best things at blt burger are actually not the burgers (especially for the price).\n\nnow, don't get me wrong, the burgers are solid. in fact, if quality burgers aren't a regular thing for you, this place may blow your mind. but alas, the burgers just aren't as juicy and flavorful as other burger places in town. \n\nthere are a lot of burger options to choose from, though, including lamb, vegetarian, etc. - so there are legitimately more options here than other burger places.\n\neverything else on the menu has been great (<mark>Waffle Fries</mark>, <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, chili, etc.). the two best things about blt burger are the jalapeno poppers and adult milkshakes.\n\nthe jalapeno poppers are long and thick. they deliver a powerful punch of spicy and come with a spicy salsa-type dipping sauce to dip them in (double spicy!).\n\nthe adult milkshakes are an absolute must (a.k.a. milkshakes with alcohol). i have repeatedly taken tourists here just for the milkshakes. i personally recommend the <mark>Malibu Barbie</mark> (coconut fruity goodness). the milkshakes are tall and thick and so deliciously yummy. beware, though, the shakes are incredibly filling. \n\nthe atmosphere is well-suited for a burger place. it's on the smaller side and open. it's casual, but burger-chic.", 
            "oo.m.g, i just had a burgasm.  one that not even the steep sticker price could extinguish.  \n\nfirst of all, to all complaining about price: this is vegas, and this is a gourmet burger bar, get over it and enjoy your burger i say! mcdonalds is right across the street, you can get your big mac meals there, but i don't see why the heck you would when you're in vegas! (and for those who are price conscious, they do have menus posted on the outside of their restaurant here.....so by the time you walk in, you should already have some idea of what to expect price wise..... they give you plenty of heads up before you enter....)\n\nso we had returned from a show at the aria and were looking for a place to eat.  after considering all our culinary options @ the mirage, we ended up at blt burgers.   they had plenty of burgers on their list that looks delicious, i opted to try their kobe beef burger and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, my husband had the tex mex burger with <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>.\nneither of us tried the milk shakes, as it was getting late and we didn't feel like filling up with milk shakes at that hour, however i did see some milkshakes \"walking by\" our table and oh man do those look delicious!  i'll have to return back for one of those some day.\n\nanyway, my burger was fantastic!! i opted not to add anything to it, i figured that if i was going to taste a kobe beef hamburger, i didn't want anything interfering with the taste of beef so i ate it with onion and tomato, plain as it comes, and it was a great decision on my part, the burger alone was so flavorful, it would've been a shame to spoil it by adding something to it.\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were delicious, they were lightly seasoned with chili powder (i think?) and were ohhh so good!\n\nmy husband's tex mex burger was good also, their chili there is very smooth and flavorful and the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were great... the kind you can actually bit into without the entire string of onion following.... that's always a plus! \n\nthe service here was really good, the waiter we had was attentive and frequently refilled our drinks.  \n\ni'm close to giving this joint a 5 star review, but although such prices are to be expected when you dine out in vegas, and at a gourmet burger place, i'd still like to knock off a star for the steep pricing.  i'm also withholding 1 star due to the fact that they do infact have a combo option, but it doesn't allow for you to choose any burger but <mark>The Classic</mark> one.   i've been to other gourmet burger bars where you are able to substitute the burgers in their combos, they just adjust the price accordingly.... so .... that is why i'm not giving 5 stars.\n\nthat's it though, no minus for service or food, i highly recommend this one, just be prepared to pay somewhere between $12-17 per burger, an additional $5 or so for a side and then theres the drinks.\n\ngo, eat, have fun & be merry.  chances are that if you're in vegas to begin with, you're not here to save money so instead of dropping another $20 on a slot machine which yields nothing in return, bring it to blt burgers instead and invest in a burger ;-)", 
            "came here on a monday night for dinner. prices seemed reasonable compared to the shi-shi restaurants around it. i ordered a cider and a falafel burger.  it was a little dry but overall it was good. sucks that a $12 burger doesn't come with fries.  my friend got the <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> burger and a beer. overall it was good.  looked over at the other table with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> and shoe string fries. couldn't really justify paying an extra five bucks for something that  normally comes with a burger.", 
            "another reason to stay at the mirage.  after winning at the craps tables, head to blt for the trio of kobe sliders.  simply the move.  if you can handle a chocolate shake (i could only handle a sip) with that you will be in a food induced coma, which will keep you from giving back your winnings.  <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were just okay as they were cut too thin and could not stand up to the batter.  overall a great vegas strip choice.  just go for it!",

            "i totally had no plans on having anything negative to say about a late night burger joint that has a full bar available until around 2 am on a weeknight. based on my first experience, it would appear that i was wrong in my thinking. \n\ni decided to go in around 11pm one night with a friend on the recommendation of a buddy that had tried out blt recently for the first time as well. \n\ni am a sucker for a good martini and a great burger, (or steak but in this case a burger.) i ordered a vodka martini and some <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> for my friend and i. they had 3 sauces available and i asked the server to mix it up with a few of each kind. he said \"no we can't do that\". he said.. no we cant do that. lol... i know that being a vegas local, i am used to most restaurant's giving you want you want to an extent. it's not like i was changing a recipe.. i wanted a bit of three different styles of wings, all the same price, no change in the portion size. at that, he didn't offer an explanation... just no. so i'm like, cool.. we will just take them spicy. no big deal.\n\nthe martini arrives. the server literally kicked a few pieces of trash on the way to the table when delivering the drink. looking around, there was trash everywhere. i  mean alot of trash, not like a little bit. many dirty tables and the floor was ridiculous. i'm guessing it was due to being understaffed, because the server took off after delivering my drink before i could order. \n\nlong story short, the second martini was a different size (less), i mentioned it and the server said they were trying to close up the bar. the wings didn't taste right, and when i asked the waiter why they tasted burnt.. he said they are \"double cooked\".. when i mentioned that i think the oil  they were frying them in was old, he said \"oh really\". \n\nhaha.. listen guys, i'm not that bad of a food snob, this is wings, burgers and martinis.. if it doesn't taste right i'm not going to just eat it. \n\nburgers show up, over cooked but still tasty.. <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>... burnt tasting and apparently fried in the same oil as the wings as they did not taste right.. like rancid oil was the flavor. the server dissapeared, most likely afraid of me asking him more questions. \n\nfinally he came back with the bill, and even as it was just after midnight he seemed to be rushing us. i asked about the '<mark>Deep Fried Oreos</mark>' as i had not had them before and he ordered them for us. listed on the menu they were to be served with a berry sauce. they showed up with a ramekin of melted vanilla ice cream. when i asked about the berry sauce, he said \"it's not served with that'. i showed him the menu, and he said the menu was wrong. lmao. this guy is a piece of work, and i actually had to laugh out loud. i just let it go and ate the oreo's, paid the bill and left. \n\ni'll go back for one of these shakes someday.. the spiked ones every one talks about. it will be earlier in the evening when there is a full staff, a manager and when they aren't trying to close down the place for the night.\n\nhappy eating!", 
            "blt cooks their burgers medium unless otherwise requested.  if your server still asks how you want it cooked don't let this fool you stick with medium you will not regret it.  if you really love crispy <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> them order them here.",

            "we were in the area and needed something to eat. rather than consult yelp and then figure out which hotel an eatery is located at (especially in the midday heat), we looked around for a place with a long line and decent looking food and blt fit the bill. \n\ndespite the moniker including the word \"burger\", we only opted to try both a salad and a burger - specifically the vegetarian falafel burger and the citrus salmon salad. we went with the server's recommendation of the <mark>Fat Fries</mark>. the falafel burger was literally a crunchy falafel patty tucked inside a burger. generally speaking, it was pretty good though i think they could find a new burger bun supplier as that fell a little short. this is very filling and somewhat heavy, so we were glad we went 50-50 and split the salad and the burger. the salad was surprisingly good since this is a burger joint. the salmon was seasoned well and had a nice char to it without being overcooked. the salad was dressed well and the lettuce and avocadoes were fresh and light. \n\nthe fries were definitely fat and seasoned; since i don't really care for seasoned fries, i only had a few pieces. i noticed most people just split an order of fries (or whatever fried item) since the portion is fairly sizeable. for what it's worth, it seemed like only the <mark>Skinny Fries</mark> were not seasoned. i would also caution against the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> as some of the orders i saw around me were clearly burnt with black patches on the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> themselves. this is the first time i've ever seen burnt <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>. i think the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were also on the very well-done side since they were very brown and hard (like a board), based on what i saw at other tables. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> looked okay, however. \n\nservice was okay and not particularly attentive, though in their defense, this place is very busy. we had to flag people down for more water and it took about 10 minutes before anyone came to take our order, even though we had closed our menus and were clearly looking around for a server. pricing is about average for vegas, meaning high compared to similar places elsewhere in the u.s.", 
            "nice place with pretty good service and food. the two times we went to blt our order was screwed up somehow. staff was friendly and took care of it both times without issue. the burgers, <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, and shakes are very tasty.", 
            "the visit to blt burger was on the night of my 1 year anniversary and a quick stop for drinks and possibly a burger.  upon entering this establishment it seemed promising.  the host which we found out was a ufc fighter, but above all the only pleasant employee in blt burger.  \n\nsince we were pressed for time, i decided to just have a couple drinks while dave had a turkey burger and we both agreed that we were going to sit at the bar for faster service.  \n\nthe bartender i think her name was jessica, not too sure she was the only one not wearing a name tag came over to us and with the grouchiest face and attitude asked us what we wanted to drink.  being from michigan, i was debating between a michigan beer or a guinness and as she stood there arms folded, rocking between her left leg and right leg, huffing, and making me feel like i was wasting her precious time, i finally said \"i am sorry can you please give me a moment\"  she very loudly huffed a huge sigh and walked away......never to return again.  \n\ni had to flag down a guy and we gave him our entire order, after placing our roder with him he proceeded to wash down the counter and either he smelled like major b.o. or the rag he was using was extremely dirty!!  it was the most disgusting thing i have smelled in a restaurant....we also ended up sitting next to the condiment tray, you know with the fruit and what not, every time it opened fruit flies came out.  \n\nwhile waiting for our order i did notice that not one single employee in the entire restaurant had a smile on, not one person tried talking to customers after their meals were dropped off, and while sitting at the bar not one person ever bothered to talk to us.  our food was dropped off, dried up burger and burnt <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>.  \n\ni am not impressed at all.....finally jessica came up after the meal and asked us this time with a smile, \"would you like some dessert?\"  my response....\"i would never order anything from you or this place again!\"  we left and i will never eat here again, bad service, bad food, and just overall bad atmosphere!  \n\nthere are better places to spend that kind of money where people will be more than happy to provide better service.....the only bad part of my 1 year anniversary.", 
            "we had a group of 5. we each got a different burger, a little pricey for a burger and it was fair. my brother got the 'american kobe beef' and his patty was way over-seasoned. my burger was cooked to order. we each got a side order: thin fries, <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>. the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were okay... chic-fil-a is still better (lol), my <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were over-seasoned, by the end i was scraping off the seasoning before eating them. i do have to say that they were cooked correctly, i've had them over-cooked and dry and under-cooked and floury/chalky tasting. the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were salty. it was a good amount of <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, but they were salted on the outside, which i thought was weird... never had salty <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>.. we did enjoy the chocolate milk shake, tasted like chocolate ice cream with chocolate whipped cream (yum!).\n\nservice: we waited for 5-10 mins before our waitress acknowledged us, then after ordering, our food came out 30 mins if not more later, the waitress never came back to ask if we needed anything else until she wanted us to cash out... and the restaurant wasn't really full or anything.\n\ni probably wouldn't go back to eat at this place, pricey burgers... i've definitely had better.",

            "saturday morning, not wanting to eat in our hotel, jeff and i took the tram over from ti to the mirage.  \nwe stumbled upon blt, when we saw the line for the carnegie deli.  \nblt has cool decor.  the floor and ceilings are made from ends of different sized pieces of wood, think 2x4s cut off at different ends.  it makes for interesting textures on the ceiling. the floor has a similar motif, but all the same size and polished to look like tile.  in the rear, there is a grill area with brick red shiny tile, flanked by huge black and white murals of the desert.  \n\nwe were seated in a booth.  the table with kinda low for the height of <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> seats.  \n\nour waitress was excellent.  she was helpful and pleasant.  her recommendations were spot on.  \n\njeff and i split an order of <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> and a bleu cheese burger.  the burger had carmelized onions and bleu cheese.  they were in the right proportion for the burger.  i didn't eat my part of the bun, but i really enjoyed it.\nthe <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were terrible.  the waitress admitted that they were frozen.  i get that, but serving cold fried things is just gross. \n\ni also ordered a bowl of chili.  at first, i wasn't impressed.  i make a mean pot of chili.  but, the more i ate it, the more i liked it.  the little slice of cornbread that came with it was pretty good, too.  \n\nthe wait staff all wore really funny t-shirts.  if they had my size, i would have bought a few.  \n\ni want to go back for the late night breakfast special!", 
            "dinner while surrounded by tables of rodeo fans, with country music in the air, bull riding championship and football airing on tv, and a beefy burger in hand.  i have to say - i couldn't help feeling a little manlier after eating at blt burger!\n\nsimilar to holstein's in the cosmopolitan, blt burger serves up a variety of specialty burgers and alcohol-infused shakes in a casual yet trendy atmosphere.  the menu also includes alternatives like salads and a variety of starters/appetizers (and desserts!), but let's be honest - the burgers and drinks are all you really need!\n\nalthough the menu offered more unique varieties (like the <mark>Lamb Tandoori</mark> burger),  i kept it simple with the blt burger (double smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, and blt burger sauce...$13), and added monterey jack cheese (+$1.00) and a fried egg (+$1.50).  however, looking back on it now, i suspect my order was flipped with my friend's since i don't remember getting any lettuce or tomato in mine.  in any case, whatever burger i had was still pretty good (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blt-burger-las-vegas?select=vz1vhnldqzavwhnhd2toba#15vvfhsg8yps4b9ouo17dg).  it was cooked exactly as ordered, had a decent char, and it was still fairly moist (though not quite juicy).  the patty could have used a little more seasoning, but it was fine given the egg, cheese, and bacon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blt-burger-las-vegas?select=vz1vhnldqzavwhnhd2toba#b-hfvbjeqjszwbjzed4zqa).  i wasn't a big fan of the buns though.\n\nsince the burgers don't include fries, our table decided to share orders of the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> and the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  on both counts, they were fine, but not \"must try\" items either.  the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were wrapped with a thick, crunchy batter (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blt-burger-las-vegas?select=vz1vhnldqzavwhnhd2toba#ldhqumhwzfwsqrlfxtwbiq), while the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were nicely thin and crispy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blt-burger-las-vegas?select=vz1vhnldqzavwhnhd2toba#gc1m4o_xomtixeksirbika).\n\nwhile i certainly wouldn't have a problem coming back to blt burger, i rounded down my three and a half stars if only because i'm not sure the value is there.  it's really not that expensive overall (especially for the strip), but i'd rather go back to holstein's since the fries are already included and their menu offerings are a bit more appealing.", 
            "an incredible hand-crafted burger.  the beef tasted incredibly fresh and the side of <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were equally fantastic.  basically a wonderful place to start a night.  in fact our night included the love cirque du soleil which is being reviewed separately.",

            "tl;dr - this is how you make a chicken avocado burger.  best chicken burger i've ever had.  ever.  note: for personal preference i drop the cheese and add bacon.\n\n<mark>Curly Fries</mark> were also pretty solid.  meant to get <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> (whoops).  i'll order those next time.\n\n<mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> are pretty good but personally i'll stick with the (waffle / curly) fries.  the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> have a sort of sweet taste to them if that's your jam.", 
            "if you remove yourself from the concept that you're entitled to fries because you ordered a burger then you have no reason to complain about being charged for fries.  like a good steakhouse, you are not guaranteed a side when you order a steak.\n\ni ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> with swiss, it was fantastic.  when a burger place asks you what temperature you want it cooked, you know you're at least getting some better level of service than at fatburger or five guys.\n\nif you're an onion ring fan, then you'll love these.  right about of sweet and crunch.  i rarely order <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, since i don't like them limp and stringy (like the blooming onion/onion loaf you find at outback or tony roma's), so i was blown away when these arrived. \n\ni ordered a hoegaarden from the menu which they served with a lemon slice which is wrong, but whatever.  the beer menu list was surprising given that in vegas, there's a predilection for limited options for beer at most restaurants, but this place wants to cater to an upscale burger-crowd?  i'm not complaining.\n\nrecommended if you're wanting a nice good quality burger.  if you're wanting a burger just as a filler meal, there's a mcdonald's literally five minutes walking distance from there that will suit your needs better.", 
            "i would give this 5 stars but yelp tends to pull those. \n\nbest burger i have ever had. meat was cooked exactly as ordered. bacon was crispy like asked and bun was toasted so it didn't fall apart. \n\n<mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were crispy and the onion itself didn't pull apart when you bit into them. <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were huge! but by far the best side was the <mark>Buffalo Fries</mark>!! if you like blue cheese and franks red hot sauce... go for these. you won't be disappointed. \n\nsaturday night and we waited all of 5 minutes to walk in. drinks and food all came within 15 minutes of sitting down. \n \nwell worth it!!", 
            "i am not sure why, but i am always drawn to this place. i guess it is because i stay at the mirage and after a good day of carousing at carnival court or, on this past trip, a malted hop frenzy at bare pool.\n\nthe staff are friendly and there isn't a line up at 11 pm at night. as a solo diner, i sat at the wood. the bartender looked after me with a quick beer which was unnecessary, but appreciated! \n\ni don't know about the actual burger prep, but i like the concept of how they have a central grill where you can watch the \"action!\" i love the blue cheese burger and it always seems good! i say \"seems\" because i have a little trouble remembering the next day what happened the night before.\n\nregardless, the burger is fresh. the blue cheese sharp and tasty. paired with fresh <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, this burger meal makes for a great later evening meal! \n\n\"this meal package can be yours  (beer, burger and rings) for $25.\" maybe a little expensive, drunk and hungry is no way to go to bed in vegas!", 
            "i had ordered 2go blt burger (slider) with <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>. i thought it was ok. it was $8 for the slider and $4 for the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>. i love burgers in general but i thought the hype was more than the taste."

            "blt burger just opened today. it's a high-end burger restaurant with a big-name chef behind it like the burger bar in mandalay bay. \n\nthe kitchen is open with a squad of sous-chefs furiously flipping meat like they were cirque du soleil jugglers; the decor is as thoughtful and deep as a hallmark card; the staff are energetic and earnest as if  they were about to auditon for \"american idol\".\n\nthe meat is ground by a butcher in the back; a combination of black angus sirloin, short ribs and chuck. the buns are made to order by la brea bakery. \n\nthe regular burger is very good ($9), but under-seasoned (you might want to add some salt). the various cheeses are $1 each. i had the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> which were excellent with just the right degree of crispness. there is a good selection of draft beers; and a few choices of wines by the glass (there should be more than 3 in a restaurant with this pedegree). not to mention that they serve it in italian-bistro glasses instead of proper wine glasses.\n\nwhen i asked for dijon mustard, the very eager and agreeable barman brought me some packets of grey poupon (they had better fix that!).\n\nthey also have an american kobe burger ($17), a lamb burger, a chicken burger and a few other concoctions that didn't capture my attention.\n\ni was disappointed to see that there was a line behind a velvet rope, waiting to get in, even though there were many empty tables. one of the managers told me it was because it was opening night and they were just getting their bearings. \ni hope that's the case, and that they haven't fallen prey to the \"manufactured exclusivity\" hustle that other places indulge in, including the burger bar. i've got some advice for all those places that think diners will enjoy their food more if they are forced to wait for it:  you're a restaurant, dammit, not an after-hours club!\n\nin any case, blt is a good addition to the vast vegas burger scene. it's not the best burger i've had here, but it's better than the burger bar, and way better than burger brasserie or stipburger. \n\nso unless you're willing to go off-strip to an unadorned little joint like the burger stop where the outstanding kobe burger is half the price, blt will do just fine.", 
            "we arrived at 1155 am for lunch and waited 20 mins despite half the restaurant was empty. our hostess led us to the table, and there were six of us ,so it took us a few seconds more to settle down. she left w/o waiting for us, and just left the menus on the table. no good. our bald server from phoenix came, never introduced himself, i thought he was the busboy since he poured water and left w/o a word. we saw all the tall glass milkshakes on almost every table while waiting , so all of us ordered them. hubby loves lamb, so he had the <mark>Lamb Tandoori</mark> burger. i don't want just another burger, so i had the kobe beef burger. friends ordered the blt, 2 classic, texas. we ordered <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. for shakes, we had vanilla, chocolate, black and white, a marshmallow flavor(forgot name), mudslide, strawberry. it took a good half hour for the food to arrive. i think hubby's lamb is the best. very juicy, flavorful, had the lamb taste but not overpowering. even his hamburger buns are different than ours. my kobe was ok, not as good as burger bar, but after i took a bite of the other burgers, i was so glad i had my kobe. theirs were horrible, dry, hard, not even close to the ones at carl's jr. and all our burgers were very small! mine was just a bit bigger than the happy meal hamburger, the rest are a little bigger than mine. the shakes, please order the marshmallow one, that was the only one worth $8 for. the other flavor, save yourself some $ and go to mcd. the  burgers are about $9-13, kobe $18, shakes $7-8. fries $4.  i definitely expected a lot more for a $9+ burger.", 
            "went here for dinner september 26, 2008. delicious burgers, good beer/liquor selection.\n\ni guess my real issues are that i can't drink beer and they were out of several of the wines they offered on their menu (and they only had like four red varietals and four white varietals).\n\ni had a salmon burger and my boyfriend had the burger with mushrooms, etc. (can't remember what its called), which he had been warned to get medium-cooked because when he said med-rare, the server warned that med-rare was pretty rare. he thought that medium was too well-done for his taste. my salmon burger was fine. but nothing to write home about. \n\ni know that vegas inflates prices, but i still found this place a bit over-priced for the diner theme. other gourmet burger places in different casinos offer more for less. \n\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> we ordered extra (at ridiculous mark-up, to be sure!) were good, but again, the quantity was minuscule for the money we paid.\n\nhonestly, i went to in-n-out burger later in our trip, and was more satisfied with my $2 burger and $1.50 fries than with my burger and fries here that cost me $20.", 
            "this place really hit the spot for me on my last visit.  i don't eat burgers but i saw some salads and veggie burger-type items on the menu so i gave it a try.  i opted for the falafel burger.  first of all, it was huge.  the falafel patty was really big and it had a good flavor - just a bit spicy.  it came with lettuce, tomatoes, a creamy sauce and tons of avocado.  i definitely could not eat it all but i would order it again.  it also came with a nice pickle.\n\nspeaking of pickles, i did try a few of the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>.  personally, i would never order these on my own because i take a firm stance against the gratuitous frying of things that don't even need to be cooked, like pickles and candy bars.  however, i sampled a few from my friend's plate and they were tasty.  but still, this whole concept seems silly to me, and it made me sad to see the little pickle slice with all this blown up batter around it.  so, they did taste good yet i hate them on principle and i think it's mean to do this to pickle slices.\n\nsweet potatoes do need to be cooked so i did order the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  they were good, although not the best i've had, and i was a little disappointed that they came with ketchup only and not a special sauce.  but, of all the fried sides to choose from, i might order these again (or <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> because they had those, too).\n\nthe service here was good and i like that you can watch people walking in and out of the casino here.  i found the atmosphere to be pretty much in line with the whole rest of the mirage and i enjoyed the background music.  additionally, in the past i have ordered spiked milkshakes to go from here and they were darn tasty.  but, they're filling - i can easily forego a meal and just have the milkshake.  the prices overall are not too bad, either, all things considered.", 
            "after a late night at the clubs, nothing sums up the night better than a lot of greasy fried appetizers =p  we ended up here after finding out that cpk isn't open late night but i'm glad we stumbled across blt burger.  we ordered a bunch of appetizers to share, and my favorite had to be the jalapeno poppers.  i'm used to those small little jalapeno poppers served elsewhere but this place gives them jumbo sized with the seeds still left in there so the jalapenos are still spicy!  we also ordered the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, which were interesting... the texture is like biting into a fried zucchini but it has a slight pickly flavor to it.  we also ordered the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, buffalo wings and a strawberry shake.  i wasn't too fond of the buffalo wings becuase they were a little too tangy and the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> didn't really hit the spot but the others were really good!", 
            "my friend and i had racked up a whopping $45 on the penny machines while we waited for my friends who were hugging the toilets at the mirage.  so we thought that the best way to spend the money would be to eat after hours :)  cpk was closed so we decided to eat here.  my friend was catching a cold and asked for hot tea - they didn't have tea - so they offered her hot water- mmmm now doesn't that sound tasty - she took it anyway...  usually the foods you crave when intoxicated are not the healthiest - so what did we end up ordering: spicy <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>, <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, jalapeno poppers, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, a straw<mark>Berry Me</mark>, and <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>.  i was surprised how good the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> were - i am not a huge fan of pickles nor of fried food but this was particularly yummy.  also the jalapeno poppers were one of the better one that i have tried.  they use the whole jalapeno and they don't load it with cream cheese.  the food was filling!  what a great way to end the night!! [not so much a great morning though eating so much grease :) ]", 
            "i ended up eating here twice since i was staying at the mirage. i had a turkey burger one night and a <mark>Veggie Falafel</mark> burger another night. good burgers. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are excellent and the spiked milkshakes are also delicious. prices are reasonable for vegas. they also have some good local beer on tap if you wanna sit at the bar for a while. only complaint? the pickles. i love pickles, but those pickles were subpar indeed.", 
            "a friend and i shared our first meal at blt burger, after a 6.5 hour flight that involved leaving the house at 5am.  thus, a plate of bran flakes would've probably gotten a decent number of stars for the chance to be on the ground in vegas after the trip.\n\nclearly, blt burger provided a better meal than bran flakes. we got one of the 'combo meals' of burger + regular fries + shake, and a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and another shake (malibu/ pineapple/ something for her, espresso/ kahlua for me).  this was plenty of food for two people, and saved a bit of money that we could later spend on the slots.  the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were much better than the regular, and the burger was properly juicy with a nice, soft bun.  nothing super special, but still good.\n\nthe shakes were the highlight.  they were thick, rich, and topped with plenty of whipped cream.  i wish the straw had a slightly larger diameter, but that's a tiny criticism.  there was some vigorous sucking involved in getting all that goodness up the tiny little straw.\n\nservice was good, water service was reasonable, price was what you'd expect from vegas, and shakes get the place to about a 3.5, and i'll round up for the happiness that i had from getting off that plane and into a nice, comfy booth.", 
            "i didn't want to eat a burger at all when i came here but many months before, as i was leaving the mirage i glanced at blt's menu before walking out. i saw something that sounded unbelievably delicious: krispy kreme donut bread pudding... wow there is such a thing!? i looove krispy kreme donuts and i love love bread pudding. unfortunately i wasn't hungry that day so i wasn't able to try it out until last week. \n\ni always feel weird ordering just one thing when i go out so my bf and i split a combo #2 that included:\n\nclassic burger - $1 more for cheese. some of the yelp pictures (including mine) make the burgers look way bigger than they are. they're just a bit bigger than in-n-out burgers but those are only like $3! ugh...at least it was tasty. \n\nfries - we chose to get the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and these were damn good. so crispy, sweet, and satisfying! why would anyone ever get regular fries? oh and don't ruin it with ketchup. just enjoy...\n\nmilkshake - another extra charge ($1) for an upgrade to a special milkshake. we got the <mark>Nut Job</mark>, made with hazelnut ice cream, nutella and topped with slivered almonds. i really liked this. the nutty flavors were great with the ice cream. the milkshake wasn't super thick which i liked because you can't drink it otherwise. i wasn't a fan of the whip cream though. it just tasted like air! no hints of sweetness or even creaminess. normally this thing costs $7. it was good but it wasn't that good. that's just pushing on crazy.\n\nfinally after the good but too pricey split meal we ordered the dessert. officially on the menu it's called \"krispy kreme\" doughnut bread pudding' so i'm wondering if they actually use the real thing. no matter because it tasted perfect! it was everything i imagined it would be. it came out hot and bubbling. the cool rum raisin ice cream was great with the hot pudding. i've had the hot/cold combo hundreds of times but it never gets old. i could still taste the icing on the donuts even though they were mashed up. so delicious! it was $6 and i would order this over and over again. now i can't ever come to vegas and leave without one of these in my tummy. i've been thinking about it ever since i left!", 
            "on my recent visit to las vegas i stayed at the mirage and  after trying the salmon burger at blt, i was haunted by this delectable treat.  it was not the processed bread crumby type of salmon burger.  it was a juicy, tasty, real fresh salmon burger with slices of avocado and watercress and and something that gave it just the right \"zing\".  every time i passed the restaurant, the memory of that burger compelled me to visit blt once again.  this time i added the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and they were excellent as well.  on another occasion i splurged on a vanilla shake and i can honestly say that it was the best i've ever had!  the place itself has a modern ambiance with great music and an open kitchen in the center.", 
            "lunch for 2 comes to around $70.00, but definitely worth going back!\n\ni've never had <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> before, but they are good!  the batter is so light and flavorful!\n\nboth the twinkie and campfire marshmellow milkshakes are out of this world! sweet, thick, and creamy, can't ask for more!\n\nthe signature blt burger and kobe burger are definitely \"gourmet\".  beef are cooked just right, the buns are soft and beautiful to look at too!\n\nthe <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are a little bit on the dry side for me.  i'm hoping they just overcooked it on accident (i have to believe that with everything else so delicious!)", 
            "after trying this place last night, i'm having a lot of trouble declaring whether i prefer burger bar or blt or even lbs! so many awesome burgers in this town make this a difficult decision! \n\nburger bar (or lbs) win out if you like the make your own burger thing. these places have a much better selection of toppings (my 2 favorites - brie cheese and cinnamon bacon were missing at blt!). \n\nhowever, i do love blt for the sheer variety of \"pre-designed\" burgers. lamb burgers? ban-mi burgers? crazy i tell you. i had the <mark>Kobe Slider Trio</mark> cooked medium rare - 1 was bbq, 1 was blt and 1 was blue cheese. all rocked! the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were superb - better than burger bar's rendition. we were all way too stuffed to try the shakes, but they did sound awesome.", 
            "totally unimpressed with blt burger, as i was with burger bar. perhaps it's because they're pretty hyped places and because i order classic burgers, but i would expect a flavorful, juicy patty of the finest beef at a place with these kinds of prices and such a famous chef. blt burger's classic burger was a thin, flavorless patty. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were okay, but i've had far better, and they came with no dipping sauce like most places serve. the only good thing was the unique campfire marshmallow shake, with vanilla ice cream and chunks of toasted marshmallows. service was just okay. the atmosphere is very nice - a cool space - but i won't be back to blt burger when i can get far better everything at places like the counter in la or delux in phoenix for far less money.", 
            "i went to the mirage in vegas and i found this cool burger joint. i loved the atmosphere right away. lots of great energy. the place was full of people who looked happy to be there. i thought it would be a great place for me since i was catching a flight soon. i sat at the counter. the counter was a great place to people watch. i was watching the eaters and the people coming in and out of the mirage. very entertaining! i had a friendly waiter. he was great. i love the shirts they wear. black t-shirts with writing on the back that says \"tip waiters, not cows. i had <mark>The Classic</mark> burger with cheese and the yummy <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. i was very satisfied with my meal.it hit the spot. if you are craving a burger i would say go! i would give blt burger a thumbs up!!!", 
            "i was starving after my plane arrived and rolled into this joint for a big juicy burger--- well it filled my hole up but was not the best i've had..\ngot a cheddar/bacon burger with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and a cold corona.. the corona takes the prize!!    my burger took forever! and then it had an odd taste to it-- either due to or in tandem with the liquid smoke that was doused all over it! . i tasted smoke flavor the rest of the day even after brushing!   the fries were overcooked/thin slivers and then the were jammed into a paper cup!  yummm.. not!  no respect for presentation -- i literally had to dig the fries out of the cup to eat thier mangled peices.    service was average - not bad and not exceptional either..   prices were not in line with the value - over priced in my book..  there was a special that day on bison burgers which i didnt hear about until  i was biting into my burger!  as the folks next to me got to hear about the specials when they sat down. \nif you want a good burger bar -- go to mandalay bay!!", 
            "amen to all the people harping about the shitty service! \n\ndiego had a special place in my heart when i saw that he was from guadalajara, mexico (name tag), but then instantly was removed from that special place when only 75% of the orders came out...we waited what seemed like 10 mins for the last order, which then was wrong! diego was avoiding me by then, he knew i would unleash the furry.\n\nbut...the food is actually solid. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and lamb burger. yum.", 
            "i wish, wish, wish there were one of these places in phoenix.\n\ni split the toasted marshmellow shake (a vanilla shake filled with teeny pieces of toasted marshmellows!), a kobe beef burer and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> for dinner.\n\nmy god\neverything was so great, the portions were nicely sized, and man o man did everything taste good.\n\ni love.", 
            "sunny: on one of our nights in vegas we came across this place in the mirage. it looked really busy and since we love burgers we decided to go in. i ordered tex mex, with side of <mark>Berry Me</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. i love <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and these thin crispy fries were amazing. my burger was ok: a bit messy since it had loose chili stuff inside. flavorful, but messy. the shakes were pretty good. overall, i would give this place 4 stars.\n\nnolan: this was by far my favorite meal while we were in vegas, i am a huge fan of <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> sandwiches and theirs is pretty awesome.  the bleu cheese dressing they put on it was sooo delicious!  the sandwich was so good i was a little bit sad when i got to the last bite.  the <mark>Berry Me</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were great additions to the meal and tasted great.  if this place were local for me i would definitely go again!  i would give this place 5 for the <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark>, however the rest of the food i tried were solid 4's.", 
            "i came to blt with my boyfriend to have lunch with my cousin from l.a. he was staying at the mirage, and told us that he wanted to try blt burgers. the establishment is decent, but a bit cramped. perhaps to give the atmosphere of a burger bar of some sorts. \n\nthe menu offers regular burgers, cheeseburgers, their signature blt burger, and some atypical burgers (if you are feeling the urge to try something  else than a regular beef patty with a bun). i had ordered the blt burger, which was good, but i'm not totally sold on the price.  the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are also just ok. i have had better at lucille's bbq (if anyone has tried that establishments <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>). i suppose everything is pretty pricey on the las vegas strip, but i just was not sold on this establishments pricing. \n\nalso, reason why i may have not been totally sold on pricing was that the service is that of a tgif or applebees. its not a problem, but you probably would expect more service for the price you are paying for a burger & fries. \n\ni honestly think that red robin has just as good of burgers for better price.", 
            "i was really excited to try blt burger because i am a burger fanatic and i loved the blt steak house on sunset blvd. in los angeles. this place also had some pretty good reviews on yelp a few months back. i ordered my usual which is a bacon cheese burger with avocado, lettuce, tomato, and onion. i also ordered a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. i asked for the burger well done and it was dry, the fries were kinda burnt and cost $5 which is way to much for fries. the side pickle tasted more like a cucumber than a pickle. i have had better burgers from my grill, islands, ruby's diner, and my favorite at claim jumper! i would have to say out of all the places to eat in vegas i would pass and try something different.", 
            "we ate here the other night before going to a show. great friendly service starting with the hostess and our sever. \nno, they don't take reservations, but our wait was only 15 minutes at 6.\nseveral of us enjoyed their blue cheese & onion burgers. super yummy. we also had crispy <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>. yummy!\none huge milkshake was passed around the table for all the try. we didn't leave anything on our plates.", 
            "as we try to waste time prior to going to the airport, we stumble upon this nice find in what i believe used to be the \"tiger den\" for sigfried and roy.  and wow, what a find.  can you say yummy alcoholic milkshakes?!?  i had grandmas treat = maker's mark, caramel and vanilla ice cream....all sprinkled with some toffee bits with whipped cream. delicious.  the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were tasty and the jalapeno poppers were fresh, yummy and crispy - it definitely didn't taste like it came from the freezer.  did i mention the milkshakes???", 
            "mediocre. burger was average...<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were not crisp enough... beer was cold...nothin special.", 
            "i was shit faced when i ate this burger, so my opinion is somewhat biased. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are a really fantastic thing, yes sir. i really enjoyed my burger, but i can't say that its as good as a fathers office burger\n\ni think this place is probably a little inconsistent, my burger was ordered medium rare but i swear it was still mooing when they brought it to me. i didn't care though, i was trashed and hungry. \n\ni would have eaten at the pink taco restaurant at the hard rock had it been open after the muse concert, but it wasn't so i cabbed it back to the mirage and grubbed here.", 
            "so it's pricier than in n out but what did you expect? just look at the establishment, you know you're not about to buy two cheeseburgers for $1. they have the menu right in front of the restaurant, so you should peep at it before you make your decision. if it's too much for a burger, then go directly across the street to mcdonald's.\n\nour waiter was on the ball. i never had to ask for a refill on my soda. he would bring me a new glass before i made that funny noise through the straw when there's no more drink left in the cup/glass. he didn't do this just once but twice without me saying a word. he repeatedly checked up on us. this is an example of how service in vegas should be like. you don't want to send anyone home a loser. least you can do for stripping their kid's college fund or taking their home's mortgage is give them good service and make them feel somewhat better about themselves.\n\ni was tempted to try their kobe beef burger for $17. however, i just went with the combo: soda, classic, burger and fries which was not much less but it did come with a soda and fries. i substituted my regular fries for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> which was not a problem at all. i'm a sucker for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. they were alright here. \n\nmy classic burger was made just about right. medium - slight pink in the middle. tender meat and all the condiments and toppings complimenting one another. all this sided with a pickled cucumber which i'm not usually a fan of but it goes together after every burger bite. wash it down with tasty beverage and everything plays out like a\nperfect harmony.\n\nmy cousins ordered the chocolate milkshake to share. the shake looks like it's 1000 calories, the drink is massive (no joke, i'll put up a picture soon). between the two girls they were not even able to finish it. maybe it was too sweet for their blood. it was more of a full on dessert than a drink.\n\nour tab for three people came out to $40ish probably close to $50 after i put down the tip because i thought our waiter deserved it. pricey but it was a pretty darn good burger and i'm not much of a burger person myself. once in a while a joint like this isn't a bad idea. i'm not eating $15 burgers daily anyways. besides, you're in vegas, live a little.\n\nthroughout the course of our meal, they had a lot of classic 80's jams on. no complaints there, can never get tired with that musical selection.\n\nlast note: i believe they close late too because my friends dined here after hitting up the clubs.", 
            "this place has great burgers. super juicy, made to order. i had the bacon blue cheese and onion burger each time. their <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> are pretty tasty as well. i'd stay away from the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>... i've had far better ones in other places.\n\nthey only receive a three star due to their price. they're basically a fast food joint... but you can expect to pay more than $20. not a good deal.\n\nenjoy the food as they enjoy raping your wallet.", 
            "after reading up on the hype behind this place, i had to try it for myself.  overall review, the menu looks better than the food.  aside from the creative recipes and food items, the food is mediocre. \n\nbahn-mi burger has some good flavor, and is worth tasting, but i would not order it a second time.  the <mark>Lamb Tandoori</mark> burger, on the other hand, was delicious.  something i would definitely order again.  \nskip the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and maybe give the shoestrings a try.  the portion was small and they were soggy.  \n\nthe best thing we had was the <mark>Nut Job</mark> milkshake, which is pretty much a nutella milkshake.  you can never go wrong with nutella, so this was a success.  altought quite pricey at about $7.\n\nthis place is nothing spectacular, especially for having the blt name.  we spent $50 for 2 people after tip and left to get some snacks from the cvs store across the street.  the best burger joint on the strip remains to be burger bar at mandalay bay.", 
            "do. not. get. the. burger. with. blue. cheese.\n\nit was inconsistent among the 4 that we ordered--some more pungent than others, to the point of inedible. i ordered it mainly for the caramelized onions that i was unable to taste at all. i had to drown my burger in ketchup to help the flavor. i couldnt finish the last bite.\n\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were on point. i should've just had a meal of that.", 
            "so we found this place because a group of friends were staying at the mirage. we came here on sunday morning when it turned into daylights savings time and they turned us away because they said the kitchen closes at 3:15am (mind you, it just turned 3 because of the time change and they still didn't offer a seat after their 3:15 explanation).\n\nanyhow, we all got seated relatively quickly for a sunday lunch. we all got different burgers. i had a bite of the salmon burger, quite interesting but wouldn't be surprised if it was just canned salmon with some fancy shmancy sauce. i got a burger that had onions, mushrooms and bleu cheese. i also added a fried egg for 1.50. it was definitely a 3.5/5 tasting burger--i probably couldn't get over the fact that all of our burgers, though medium rare came out in different shades of pink to brown. the taste was good... but 14 something bucks for this burger seems on the pricey side + because mine came with cheese, i didn't have to add it like the other burgers. it was a reasonable size but for 14 bucks i think i could get a better burger elsewhere.\n\nwe tried some of the different sides. they were all about 5-6 bucks.\n<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>: 3/5 - average, still would put boiling crab and father's office over this place\n<mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>: 5/5 - really good combination of batter to onion\njalapeno poppers: 4/5 - pretty good here\n<mark>Waffle Fries</mark>: 2/5  - you think cheese and sour cream would save this side, but it doesn't.\n\ni did enjoy the decor of the place, looks pretty hip. the kitchen is in the center of the restaurant and they have this cool artwork of what looks to be like the road to vegas (from california).\n\nfor 4 burgers, and 4 sides, it came out to about $25. i think i'll check something out next time, this place was more out of convenience.", 
            "the family and i accidentally found blt burger and boy was it a good find.  we were here around 2pm and there wasn't a wait.  the service was good and the decor was a western theme.  \n\nwe ordered a classic burger combo, tex-mex burger, and blt burger.  <mark>The Classic</mark> combo was a basic cab (certified angus beef) patty burger and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> had the perfect sweet and savory combo.  the tex-mex had a cab patty, jalapenos, chili, avocado, salsa, jack cheese, onion, and sour cream.  i know it sounds like a little too much going on but it wasn't.  it had just enough of each ingredient to taste the flavors but not overwhelm you.  the blt had a cab patty, double smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, and blt burger sauce.  simple compared to the tex-mex but still delicious.  the double smoked bacon was so yummy.  bacon makes everything better ;o)\n\nthe price was average for vegas ($13 burgers and the combo was $17).  it was a good meal and i have to admit blt burger has some of the best burgers i've ever eaten.  i would definitely make a stop here on my next vegas trip.", 
            "move over big mac, outta the way whopper... blt burgers are the best burgers in vegas!  your mouth will water just standing in front of the blt burger sign...its the aroma, the open grill right smack in the middle, and the menu of various types of burgers and meats that will make you forget the vegas buffets (for a limited time that is, i gotta have my buffets)!  i ordered the lamb burger, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, and hazelnut shake...sooo good that i felt a burger high, uh until dinner that is!    i ordered my burger medium well so as to not bite into a dry burger, i wanted my meat nice and juicy...blt does not disappoint when it comes to taste and well cooked meat.  i actually saw this place on the food network's \"chefs vs. city,\" and i was immediately hooked.  so don't just settle for a burger, surrender to a blt burger!", 
            "this was my second time coming here...the first time i enjoyed a nice turkey burger...so juicy and delicious and of course with a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>! \n\non my second visit here i ordered a hamburger that tasted very very gamy not sure if it was beef!! i was a little buzzed so maybe that help put it down! the size of the burgers are really small and i think i could have managed to put down 2!!",

            "we stayed at the mirage and went to blt burger twice.   \n\nthe first time, the food was ok.   i ordered a burger, fries, and shake combo.  i ordered my burger medium rare and it came out medium.  the fries were good.  the milk shake was really good!   the only complaint was that the service was really slow!\n\nwe went back again before we had to head to the airport.   this time i ordered <mark>The Stripper</mark> medium rare (burger without a bun), <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and a root beer.  my friend ordered the angus burger medium.  again the service was super sloooow!    it took so long to get the food.  and when i questioned the waitress about how long it was taking to get our meal, she seems annoyed.    my friends burger was very rare (odd....because it took so long to get the food...what the heck were they doing?) so we complained and the manager took it off the check.   \n\nall in all just an o.k experience.  the food is ok but the service was not.",

            "i was in the mood for a gourmet burger during my last trip to vegas and having such a positive experience at the burger bar in mandalay, i wanted a repeat performance.  perusing the restaurants list (which changes constantly in this town like the hotels) i noticed a listing for a place at the mirage with the familiar acronym 'blt'.  having tried the  bistro laurent tourondel steak place in hollywood back home, i was intrigued enough and seeing the number of positive yelp reviews i convinced my friends this would be our lunch spot sometime before the end of the weekend.\n\nso to cap off our sunday lunch we made our way to the mirage resort to find a nice open air, indoor burger joint with hip club lighting, decor and audible but not overly loud r&b and hiphop music playing over the speakers.  our waitress was friendly and cheerful and service was nice and fairly quick.  all of us ordered different burgers, me going for the <mark>Lamb Tandoori</mark> which i ordered med rare.  my friends ordered a couple different more traditional beef burgers which i can't remember but all of them were cooked really well, fat, juicy with some of the best <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> on the side that i've ever had.  even fo's fries back home in la weren't as crispy and well seasoned as these and honestly i'm not a big fan of the 'sweet potato' taste and these were much more subtle and almost tasted like regular potatos with a hint of the sweetness making them stand out.\n\nalcoholic milkshakes also made their way around the table, my friend ordered a kahluha oreo cookie mudslide and i got the <mark>Malibu Barbie</mark> which i found a better choice than the heavier chocolate rich drink.  almost like drinking a pina colada ice cream sundae in a glass it was the perfect way to finish off a great lunch and a fun weekend.  \n\ni suspect i will be coming back here some day especially given they run til 2 am, making them a quality late night food haven after clubbing or taking a break between venues.", 
            "went to blt on a weekday mid-afternoon and there was no waiting. nice easy location and a good people watching place as it's open to a main pathway in the mirage. i had the blt burger with it's double smoked bacon. it was like an explosion of smoky flavor when i took my first bite. pretty tasty over all but i would like to see a better bun. also had a side of <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> which were very ordinary and must have been preprocessed. my wife has the <mark>Shaft's Blue</mark> cheese burger with balsamic caramelized onions, and mushrooms. the sweet onions against the blue cheese was really nice. i liked this burger quite a bit and was my favorite of the two we had. she also had <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> which were decent too. i was expecting bigger burgers for the price too. i could see myself eating there again but it wouldn't be my first choice. i liked the burger place at the paris better.", 
            "i just got a combo that included their classic burger, french fries that i switched for <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and a milk shake. their classic burger was okay, the other burgers on the menu looked more tasty. \n\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were amazing!! i definitely recommend them! and their milkshakes were heavenly. \n\ni wouldnt go out of my way to eat here but if you're already staying at the mirage its a good place to grab some lunch.", 
            "good late night eats. we had the fried mac and cheese and the buffalo shrimp off the happy hour menu for an app and then i had their specialty blue cheese burger for dinner. the mac and cheese was good . crispy outside and cheesy inside. it did fall apart once you took your first bite and it was served with a pomadoro sauce i suppose to play off it's similarities to fried mozz. the buffalo shrimp were amazing until they very last one. my last bite had bits of shrimp shell and grit that i fear was from a shrimp that had not been cleaned properly. the burger was great however. cooked to a juicy medium crispy bacon with tart blue cheese. we also got a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> which were the big debbie downer of the meal. don't get them. unseasoned cardboard sticks. maybe i got a bad batch but i won't be trying them again. how do you mess up fries other than sandbagging then and leaving then under the heat lamp? anyway, good place for late night grub just stick to the burgers.",

(some of them actually coming up to your table along the way.) since it is located on the strip the prices are always a few dollars more. i love all the different kinds of burgers though. <mark>The Stripper</mark> burger is my favorite. (and healthiest choice!) the servers were very nice and attentive even though they have to deal with the loud screaming people on the daily. very on point too and the wait for the food was pretty quick. i say to go during a week night earlier in the evening. make sure to get the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (or <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> if you're not the sweet potato type!)",

            "after spending an ungodly amount of time in the cirque love gift store, <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> and i needed a quick bite to eat before heading back to our room and quickly chose blt burger when we saw they had a veg option, a falafel burger! \n\nthe only reaction i can really give to this place is... \"meh.\" this is my personal reaction, as my boyfriend got something he enjoyed, an egg \"mcmuffin\" kind of sandwich with hash browns, but even this, and all the side dishes, were super pricey for such a laid back place. i guess they can get away with this because its in the mirage and its vegas, but nothing about this place ever really clicked for me. service was poor, we had to flag down our server for everything and the place wasn't even slightly busy. music was in-saaaaaaanely loud and i had to lurch over the table to have a conversation.\n\nthe falafel burger was massive, a little dry, but had a topping of veggies and hummus to make it a little tolerable. i  also ordered a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> which were good but not worth 5 bucks. my favorite part was the bbq sauce i asked for which we ended up swooping up in our take-home bag. \n\ni regret not trying a shake but we had just had some at in-n-out earlier, and didn't want to over do it!",

            "oo.m.g, i just had a burgasm.  one that not even the steep sticker price could extinguish.  \n\nfirst of all, to all complaining about price: this is vegas, and this is a gourmet burger bar, get over it and enjoy your burger i say! mcdonalds is right across the street, you can get your big mac meals there, but i don't see why the heck you would when you're in vegas! (and for those who are price conscious, they do have menus posted on the outside of their restaurant here.....so by the time you walk in, you should already have some idea of what to expect price wise..... they give you plenty of heads up before you enter....)\n\nso we had returned from a show at the aria and were looking for a place to eat.  after considering all our culinary options @ the mirage, we ended up at blt burgers.   they had plenty of burgers on their list that looks delicious, i opted to try their kobe beef burger and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, my husband had the tex mex burger with <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>.\nneither of us tried the milk shakes, as it was getting late and we didn't feel like filling up with milk shakes at that hour, however i did see some milkshakes \"walking by\" our table and oh man do those look delicious!  i'll have to return back for one of those some day.\n\nanyway, my burger was fantastic!! i opted not to add anything to it, i figured that if i was going to taste a kobe beef hamburger, i didn't want anything interfering with the taste of beef so i ate it with onion and tomato, plain as it comes, and it was a great decision on my part, the burger alone was so flavorful, it would've been a shame to spoil it by adding something to it.\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were delicious, they were lightly seasoned with chili powder (i think?) and were ohhh so good!\n\nmy husband's tex mex burger was good also, their chili there is very smooth and flavorful and the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were great... the kind you can actually bit into without the entire string of onion following.... that's always a plus! \n\nthe service here was really good, the waiter we had was attentive and frequently refilled our drinks.  \n\ni'm close to giving this joint a 5 star review, but although such prices are to be expected when you dine out in vegas, and at a gourmet burger place, i'd still like to knock off a star for the steep pricing.  i'm also withholding 1 star due to the fact that they do infact have a combo option, but it doesn't allow for you to choose any burger but <mark>The Classic</mark> one.   i've been to other gourmet burger bars where you are able to substitute the burgers in their combos, they just adjust the price accordingly.... so .... that is why i'm not giving 5 stars.\n\nthat's it though, no minus for service or food, i highly recommend this one, just be prepared to pay somewhere between $12-17 per burger, an additional $5 or so for a side and then theres the drinks.\n\ngo, eat, have fun & be merry.  chances are that if you're in vegas to begin with, you're not here to save money so instead of dropping another $20 on a slot machine which yields nothing in return, bring it to blt burgers instead and invest in a burger ;-)",

            "we had a group of 5. we each got a different burger, a little pricey for a burger and it was fair. my brother got the 'american kobe beef' and his patty was way over-seasoned. my burger was cooked to order. we each got a side order: thin fries, <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>. the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were okay... chic-fil-a is still better (lol), my <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were over-seasoned, by the end i was scraping off the seasoning before eating them. i do have to say that they were cooked correctly, i've had them over-cooked and dry and under-cooked and floury/chalky tasting. the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were salty. it was a good amount of <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, but they were salted on the outside, which i thought was weird... never had salty <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>.. we did enjoy the chocolate milk shake, tasted like chocolate ice cream with chocolate whipped cream (yum!).\n\nservice: we waited for 5-10 mins before our waitress acknowledged us, then after ordering, our food came out 30 mins if not more later, the waitress never came back to ask if we needed anything else until she wanted us to cash out... and the restaurant wasn't really full or anything.\n\ni probably wouldn't go back to eat at this place, pricey burgers... i've definitely had better.",

            "being from los angeles, we have so many trendy burger places popping up that use all sorts of random, fancy ingredients.  these places tend to be 'hit or miss' with me, as i never know if i am going to like their secret ingredients that make their burgers so special.  what i liked about eating at blt burger was that most of their selection was made up of standard ingredients that you can find at most burger places.  blt burger separates itself from other places by using high quality products instead of obscure ingredients to create unique, tasty flavors.  \n\nmy meal here consisted of a blt burger and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  the burger was very good.  all of the ingredients tasted fresh and very flavorful.  the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were a bit too shriveled, and i would have preferred for them to be chunkier.  however, they were still very good, and my wife kept raving about them.  \n\ni also noticed a lot of people ordering shakes, and i probably would have done the same if it wasn't such a cold day.  they looked amazing, and seemed to be a very popular item.  the next time i go back, i will get a shake for sure.\n\ni really enjoyed my meal at blt burger.  it was nice to have a really good burger with out all of the trendy hype.  i can't wait to have blt burger again the next time i am in vegas!", 
            "this is a nice place for a no fuss group lunch/dinner. a group of 7 of us went on a sunday around 7:30 and we didn't even have to wait for a table. the menu provides a few salads, a variety of burgers, and sides. it's a little pricey for what it is, but by vegas standards i would say it's decent; with most burgers ranging from $12-$14. i also like that they have fun milkshake flavors including nutella, oreos, etc and they even have spiked ones with rum, baileys, etc.\n\ni tried a few of the things my friends got like the tex mex burger, <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>, and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. those were just okay. i really really enjoyed what i got, but i did have to do a little customization. i ordered the black n' chicken burger, but i substituted chicken for a burger patty. i also got it without a bun to offset the damage i did at buffets. the burger was cooked medium rare like i asked and the toppings were delish. it came with provolone, <mark>Horseradish Cole Slaw</mark>, and tobacco flavored crispy onions.", 
            "dinner while surrounded by tables of rodeo fans, with country music in the air, bull riding championship and football airing on tv, and a beefy burger in hand.  i have to say - i couldn't help feeling a little manlier after eating at blt burger!\n\nsimilar to holstein's in the cosmopolitan, blt burger serves up a variety of specialty burgers and alcohol-infused shakes in a casual yet trendy atmosphere.  the menu also includes alternatives like salads and a variety of starters/appetizers (and desserts!), but let's be honest - the burgers and drinks are all you really need!\n\nalthough the menu offered more unique varieties (like the <mark>Lamb Tandoori</mark> burger),  i kept it simple with the blt burger (double smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, and blt burger sauce...$13), and added monterey jack cheese (+$1.00) and a fried egg (+$1.50).  however, looking back on it now, i suspect my order was flipped with my friend's since i don't remember getting any lettuce or tomato in mine.  in any case, whatever burger i had was still pretty good (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blt-burger-las-vegas?select=vz1vhnldqzavwhnhd2toba#15vvfhsg8yps4b9ouo17dg).  it was cooked exactly as ordered, had a decent char, and it was still fairly moist (though not quite juicy).  the patty could have used a little more seasoning, but it was fine given the egg, cheese, and bacon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blt-burger-las-vegas?select=vz1vhnldqzavwhnhd2toba#b-hfvbjeqjszwbjzed4zqa).  i wasn't a big fan of the buns though.\n\nsince the burgers don't include fries, our table decided to share orders of the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> and the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  on both counts, they were fine, but not \"must try\" items either.  the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were wrapped with a thick, crunchy batter (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blt-burger-las-vegas?select=vz1vhnldqzavwhnhd2toba#ldhqumhwzfwsqrlfxtwbiq), while the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were nicely thin and crispy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blt-burger-las-vegas?select=vz1vhnldqzavwhnhd2toba#gc1m4o_xomtixeksirbika).\n\nwhile i certainly wouldn't have a problem coming back to blt burger, i rounded down my three and a half stars if only because i'm not sure the value is there.  it's really not that expensive overall (especially for the strip), but i'd rather go back to holstein's since the fries are already included and their menu offerings are a bit more appealing.",

            "it was our first night at the mirage, we were super hungry after having both a delayed flight and delayed shuttle, and we were eager to use our $50 room credit. that said, this hit the spot for us. i got the blt burger with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> got the <mark>Kobe Slider Trio</mark> with <mark>Buffalo Fries</mark>. i learned a very important lesson here: always ask how big the burgers are, especially in vegas. at home, i'm used to medium sized \"big\" burgers and and expecting an average size every time, so i forgot that everything is bigger in vegas, literally. welp. my burger was so high that it would've required two mouth-lengths (for lack of a better term) to even bite into all at once. that's not to say that it wasn't good. it was delicious, just very intimidating and i couldn't even finish it all. and with the prices that were charged, i felt very badly for not finishing the whole burger. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were good (as always, i am a sweet potato fiend). i did not try my boyfriend's <mark>Kobe Slider Trio</mark> (in hindsight, i should've gone with that instead - much more manageable portions), but we did share the <mark>Buffalo Fries</mark> and omg! amazing, amazing, amazing! i am daydreaming about them right now. buffalo wing sauce, blue cheese dressing (mmm, mmm), and (i think) chopped green onions to top them off - just simply wonderful. i would and could make a meal out of just those. so, to recap - the food is great, the service was friendly and not overbearing, but the prices are a little shocking. luckily, we had our dining credit and paid the difference, so that took some of the sting out. i think we'd go back again, now that i know what their portion sizing is like and what their pricing is like.",

            "chocolate whipped cream, <mark>Skinny Fries</mark>, <mark>Fat Fries</mark>, <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> oh my! everyone in my party of 15 had a great time here for lunch! the shakes were excellent - and they do it right - chocolate whipped cream and a big wide straw. the burgers are perfect, i mean the bun to meat to condiment ratio was just right. the fries were crispy and golden, the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> had just the right amount of batter and were cooked perfectly. this is a very fun place for a lunch or dinner with your family or date. service is friendly and willing to split checks. great beer, shakes and burgers - a good life indeed!", 
            "before everyone attacks me for giving this place a one star, i'll have to mention that i ordered a salad (b/c i was full from drinking my yard dog from fat tuesdays). \n\nfood: i ordered the caesar salad but it came with these weird croutons that had gunk all over them. i'm sure it was edible but it just looked incredibly gross. other than that the salad was a salad and satisfied my cravings for <mark>Vegetable</mark> after an entire weekend of being starved from them. \n\nappetizers: bad. we ordered nachos, <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> and buffalo wings. the spicy buffalo wings were by far the worse. they were not so much spicy but just incredibly tangy. trying to finish my one wing was like torture because everytime i tasted the sauce, my face would have no control but to make a face from having eaten something very tangy/sour. <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> were probably how they were supposed to be but just not my cup of tea. to describe them for you readers though, it was warm and kind of mushy. i prefer my pickles crunchy and cold, and i think that's how most people do too. \n\non the bright side, the <mark>Fat Fries</mark> which were basically potato wedges that my boyfriend ordered were crispy and actually really good. \n\nbut he told me the burgers were just meh so i don't think i\"ll ever be back to give their burgers a chance.", 
            "the <mark>Shaft's Blue</mark> cheese burger ($13) was delicious. granted, i switched blue cheese for cheddar, but i'm not a fan of blue. the meat was juicy and cooked medium rare so the inside was red. balsamic caramelized onions added an amazing sweetness to the savory burger. it was seriously good. <mark>Fat Fries</mark> were tasty and well seasoned. one order looks small ($5) but is enough for two people to split.", 
            "i almost always love me some burger. but i do not love me some blt burger.\n\ncame here on saturday to catch the end of the uconn/butler game. since the place is called blt burger, i decided to get their blt burger with swiss & a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>--legit classic riight? the burger was so dry and over done for medium; there was only a small spackle of shredded lettuce and enough tomato for a few bites. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were good, but i wish i got the <mark>Fat Fries</mark> (i usually hate <mark>Fat Fries</mark>, but these were seasoned up something delish). \n\nservice was ok at best. not exactly friendly or attentive--i had to ask for water several times. and although the waiter's shirt was cleverly adorned with, \"tip waiters, not cows,\" he merited nothing beyond the 20%. \n\nafter reading everyone's reviews, i wish i had just gone with the fries and a milkshake. next time, blt burger, next time.", 
            "feed a hangover or starve for the pool? dilemma dilemma. \n\nand the hangover wins.....\n\nit was our second day in vegas and lets say it was a good first night. we were determined to make it to the pool especially since we had already paid for our reserve lounges at the pool at the mirage. \n\nper recommendation from a pedicurist at the spa in the aria, we decided to give blt burger a try and it was well worth it.\n\ndrinks: some of us went for the bloody mary. i had a sip of it and it was not good. i don't want to say awful but it was pretty close. i like a spicy bloody mary but i nearly choked on it bc it had a strong kick to it and wasn't a building heat. the tomato juice tasted to sour for my taste. i was not impress. \n\nappetizer: we got a plate of <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>. they were great. fried in a light almost tempura like batter. \n\nburgers: i had the <mark>Shaft's Blue</mark> burger. the bun was light and soft but strong enough to hold a juicy burger. the patty was just the right amount of fat and lean meat that gave it great favors and kept it juicy but not greasy. beware this is a strong blue cheese. only get if you are an avid lover of all cheese blue. \n\nfries: we choose the <mark>Fat Fries</mark>. it was crispy and seasoned well on the outside and very fluffy on the inside. \n\nservice was great and fast. i would totally recommend this place if you are looking for a quick place to grab a bite and are at the mirage.", 
            "went here for dinner on our first night in vegas. that's important to note, as we were all feeling a little worn out from traveling.\n\nwe were staying at the mirage, so it was convenient and it came highly recommended.\n\nour party ordered the following:\n- turkey burger & <mark>Skinny Fries</mark> (all white meat natural turkey breast ground with fresh herbs) - $12\n- <mark>Chili Bowl</mark> - $8\n- <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> sandwich & <mark>Fat Fries</mark> - (fried chicken, red hot sauce, avocado, chopped lettuce, maytag blue, buttermilk dressing) - $12\n- vegetable salad & <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> - $12 + $5\n- chicken caesar salad - $15\n- blt burger & <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> (7oz. grilled certified angus beef, double smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, blt burger sauce) - $13 (add cheese for $1)\n\nit was awesome! no one had any complaints.\n\nwe tried every fry variety at our table of five - sweet potato, waffle, skinny and fat. i really liked the fries in particular (sweet potato and waffle)... <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> are just not something you see in canada very much. yum! and i've rarely met a yam frite i didn't agree with!\n\nour waiter was friendly and fast, though i felt like he was trying a bit too hard to be funny. whatever... it's better than being surly.\n\ncompared to the other restos we ate at in the mirage, it was a bit trendier and more family-oriented.", 
            "by the time our plane got into vegas, it was already after midnight and we were exhausted so we headed downstairs and the only place open was blt burger. i had the salmon burger with lettuce, tomato, avocado, and dill sauce. the salmon was cooked perfectly and the dill sauce balanced out the tangy spices of the salmon. we also had ordered the \"<mark>Fat Fries</mark>\" (thought it was gonna be like steak fries but it was potato wedges) and the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, which had too much batter. overall, it was an average meal for a pretty extravagant price and it didn't make my \"must go when in vegas\" list.\n\nthe only reason why this place doesn't get one more star is because the customer service was pretty horrible. upon arriving, the manager (?) and the hostess were having a conversation that seemed more interesting than seating customers then, there was only one waiter working so we only saw him about twice in the meal (once to bring drinks/take the order and once to bring the food). \n\nohh blt burger, with a name like that, i had high expectations for you.", 
            "this place was a bit of a surprise for me. i couldn't help but think \"another burger bar in vegas.\" \n\nfirst off, they've got a great beer, mixed drink and 'adult' shake selection. i'm a beer guy and i don't think there's much to do to improve it. boy, i was wrong again. i had a blue moon float with orange ice cream. anyone who likes wheat beer, knows that it goes great with an orange wedge in it. combining the beer with an orange ice cream was brilliant.\n\nthe fries are awesome here. they have skinny or <mark>Fat Fries</mark>. the <mark>Fat Fries</mark> are like the kfc potato wedges of old. (not sure if kfc still serves them, because i haven't been in one, in a solid decade.) crispy and delicious. a little thinner than kfc. they also offer you multiple dipping sauces, at no extra charge. i love condiments.\n\nburgers, of course, are also very good. while they are not cooked the way i would 100% prefer (char broiled or bbq grilled) they are still quite good. i ordered mine medium rare and it was done perfect. i had both the blt and the blue cheese burger, on two separate days. both were excellent. \n\none day, we were in a big hurry and they went out of their way to get us in and out. i appreciate that. service was friendly and helpful, both days. the music was a little loud, but i'm not a huge fan of the music they were playing (mostly classic rock, yuck.) but it did make it a little hard for conversation in a restaurant. i could understand that, in a bar. prices were reasonable, although the burgers do not include fries. typical vegas pricing, to say the least. anyway, i highly recommend this place and plan to return.", 
            "i can't fault this place, the burgers were to die for, especially the \"blt\". go with the <mark>Fat Fries</mark>, they are far nicer than the standard ones. the only thing i wished i'd tried were the milkshakes which looked divine. the service was exceptional and the only thing that was variable on a number of visits was the speed at which the food arrived. i guess that's only to be expected at busy times.\n\ni have no trouble in recommending this venue.", 
            "a mean hangover made all made better with a blt burger.  cooked the way i asked (medium) with <mark>Fat Fries</mark>.  i had pretty high expectations because a place named blt burger better have a good burger and they came through.  service was good too.  bloody mary was $14 and not great, but i drank it.\nthe vibe in this place was cool.  the only music they played was classic rock, awesome.  after late nights of loud club music and sounds of slot machines, i'd go back (even if i wasn't hungry) just for the music and a couple beers.\ngood place for lunch in vegas", 
            "after the love show in the mirage, we came to grab a bite as a late dinner. blt's and burgers are two of my favorite things, so why not stop by blt burger?\n\nmy friends shared the <mark>Kobe Slider Trio</mark>, and all of them looked delicious! i was feeling a little healthy, so decided on the <mark>Veggie Falafel</mark> burger. it had hummus, avocado, veggies, on a whole wheat bun! even my friends were shocked! but of course, we added on the fries. you have a choice of <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>, <mark>Skinny Fries</mark>, and <mark>Fat Fries</mark>. of course, we decided to share <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>. yummm!\n\noverall, we were really happy with our food, although service was not as great as we had wished. would come back again if i was in that area and feeling hungry!", 
            "excellent food, fun atmosphere, reasonable prices - we'll be back.   husband and i wanted a light dinner at 6pm on a friday night.  surprised there was no line but very glad about it :)  hubby ordered a <mark>Double Barrel</mark> float to start with (jack daniels, root beer, vanilla ice cream.  we split <mark>The Cowboy</mark> burger and <mark>Fat Fries</mark> as our meal.  i was really wanting to try the <mark>Smoked Gouda Double Dip</mark> (cinnamon-cardamom sugar & orange blossom glaze doughnuts) for dessert but was just too full.  fresh ingredients and everything cooked to order.  we'll definitely be back!", 
            "we were in the area and needed something to eat. rather than consult yelp and then figure out which hotel an eatery is located at (especially in the midday heat), we looked around for a place with a long line and decent looking food and blt fit the bill. \n\ndespite the moniker including the word \"burger\", we only opted to try both a salad and a burger - specifically the vegetarian falafel burger and the citrus salmon salad. we went with the server's recommendation of the <mark>Fat Fries</mark>. the falafel burger was literally a crunchy falafel patty tucked inside a burger. generally speaking, it was pretty good though i think they could find a new burger bun supplier as that fell a little short. this is very filling and somewhat heavy, so we were glad we went 50-50 and split the salad and the burger. the salad was surprisingly good since this is a burger joint. the salmon was seasoned well and had a nice char to it without being overcooked. the salad was dressed well and the lettuce and avocadoes were fresh and light. \n\nthe fries were definitely fat and seasoned; since i don't really care for seasoned fries, i only had a few pieces. i noticed most people just split an order of fries (or whatever fried item) since the portion is fairly sizeable. for what it's worth, it seemed like only the <mark>Skinny Fries</mark> were not seasoned. i would also caution against the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> as some of the orders i saw around me were clearly burnt with black patches on the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> themselves. this is the first time i've ever seen burnt <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>. i think the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were also on the very well-done side since they were very brown and hard (like a board), based on what i saw at other tables. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> looked okay, however. \n\nservice was okay and not particularly attentive, though in their defense, this place is very busy. we had to flag people down for more water and it took about 10 minutes before anyone came to take our order, even though we had closed our menus and were clearly looking around for a server. pricing is about average for vegas, meaning high compared to similar places elsewhere in the u.s.",

            "i love this restaurant!  this time, we had the 80 burger and <mark>The Classic</mark> burger (plus cheddar and avocado).  they came slightly more well done than we ordered (the burger ordered med-rare arrived medium, and the burger ordered med-well arrived well), but were still juicy.  we ordered the <mark>Fat Fries</mark> and the <mark>Curly Fries</mark>, both of which were great.  our server, missy, was fantastic - the perfect mix of chatty but not overwhelming, and was totally on top of service.", 
            "first thing we ate in vegas after checking in to the venetian across the street. \n\nambiance - 4 stars: we liked the decor. cool edison style light bulbs, wood ceiling, and the kitchen area behind the bar was pretty cool as well. \n\nservice - 4 stars: it's a burger place, so nothing over the top to be expected. service was on par, waitress wasn't overly pesky nor was she invisible. \n\nfood - 4 stars: i ordered the blt burger w/ american cheese and the <mark>Fat Fries</mark> with a <mark>Night Rider</mark> milkshake. the milkshake came out first, and i almost wish this is all i had! it was super delicious. the burger was quite good as well, not the best i've ever had but definitely top 5. i wasn't a huge fan of the <mark>Fat Fries</mark>, but got them by recommendation from the waitress. fiance had the i-80 burger, <mark>Curly Fries</mark>, and tucan shake. these were all super delicious, and she really enjoyed it. \n\na bit expensive, but as we later found out - all the food is inflated quite a bit. i was sort of shocked when the cost of a burger and fries was around 20 bucks, not including the milkshake. our bill was around $80 for two, which is a large amount for 2 burgers. \n\nif you're looking for something better than the food court for lunch, i would certainly recommend blt burger.",

            "not the most exciting dinner experience i've ever had, but i guess most people are here to gamble, not eat. we were seated by a hostess with absolutely no personality...not a smile, even. and slow as a tortoise, to boot. but upon getting seated, we definitely got stuck with the dud waiter. it took him forever to come back and take our orders, and then another 10 minutes to flag him down to get cutlery. but on to the food...\n\ni shared a vegetable salad and the route 80 burger (bacon, cheese, caramelized onions), with a side of <mark>Buffalo Fries</mark> (<mark>Curly Fries</mark> smothered in buffalo sauce and blue cheese). the salad was delightful - crispy veggies, a few exotic ones that i looked and went \"what are you?\", and a tasty but light oregano dressing. the burger, which we ordered medium as suggested, was only ok. i guess i expected more than run of the mill, but it wasn't terribly exciting. it wasn't bad, necessarily, just not great. but the <mark>Buffalo Fries</mark> is where they fell down - while i loved the concept, the combo of buffalo sauce and blue cheese was incredibly salty, and not even the side of ranch dressing could make it edible after a few bites. it was too bad, because the spicy flame on the fries was great before the salt hit.",

            "i went here about four days ago with my boyfriend for our burger craving since i've had it bookmarked for a while. it seemed a little small inside but it had modern appeal, a bar area and several tvs.\nas for food, we shared the money business shake which was banana flavored with reese's peanut butter cup pieces. it wasn't as sweet as i thought it would be and had a homey taste to it. it tasted of fresh banana, none of that artificial stuff. i got the american wagyu burger which had truffle aioli, brie, spinach, portabello  mushrooms and of course wagyu beef! it was delicious! it reminded me of the funghi burger at holsteins except for in this burger, you could taste much more of the meat and the truffle flavor wasn't as extreme (which doesn't bother me but anyways). i would definitely eat that again! my boyfriend got the i-80 burger which had peppercorn crusted bacon, bbq sauce, sharp cheddar, and caramelized onions. delicious also! you could really tasted the peppercorn which made it a little different from the typical bbq bacon cheeseburgers. both were good portions, about the size of gordon ramsey's burgr, and the meat had more distinct flavor in it compared to holstein's and burgr.  the only thing about our food that i didn't care for were the two orders of fries we got. i got regular <mark>Curly Fries</mark> and they seemed a little stale, like they were cooked in advance and were just sitting for an hour or two under the heat lamps. pass on those. next, my boyfriend got <mark>Buffalo Fries</mark> which are fries drenched in buffalo sauce topped with feta and green onions. it's a good concept just not executed great. the fries were super soggy! it would have been a little better if the sauce was just drizzled on.\nour service was nothing special, she was friendly enough, and checked on us twice to make sure our water was filled and didn't take forever to bring out the check so it was still good even though she was really quiet.\noverall the food was delicious, but i still think i would choose burgr and holstein's over this place mainly because i liked the shakes and fries much better in those other two locations. if this place wasn't in vegas, where it has soo much competition, i think ratings would be much higher.",

            "restaurant week 2015\nlunch: $20.15\ndonation level: silver platter ($4)\n\nfirst\n<mark>Buffalo Fries</mark>: <mark>Curly Fries</mark> topped with bleu cheese crumbles and herbs with sides of buffalo sauce and ranch dressing. much better than i was expecting! the best part is that the sauces are on the side, so the fries were still crispy throughout the meal.\n\ngarlic fries: the fries are really fantastic and the amount of garlic was perfect. yum. i'd eat these fries again in a heartbeat. these are definitely on the top of my list now.\n\nsecond\ni-80 burger: peppercorn crusted bacon, smokey sweet bbq sauce, caramelized onions, sharp cheddar, pickle. great combination of ingredients to make a very tasty burger. the burger itself was nice and cooked to order.\n\nsalmon burger: atlantic salmon, avocado, red onion, watercress, zesty cayenne tartar sauce. the server didn't ask for cooking temperature, but the stick indicated medium. the salmon was actually a bit overcooked and dry. either way, the toppings were great.\n\n<mark>California Chicken</mark> burger: grilled chicken breast, arugula, sundried tomato, avocado, red onion, mozzarella, pesto. i really enjoyed this burger! the chicken breast was moist and everything played so well together.\n\nthird\nchocolate sundae: chocolate ice cream with fudge. nothing special. plain ol' chocolate ice cream and fudge.\n\n<mark>Deep Fried Oreos</mark> served with frozen custard and chocolate sauce. these were pleasantly surprising. this may have been my first time having <mark>Deep Fried Oreos</mark> and oh my, i see why they're so popular! the oreos are softened like cake and the batter is nice and doughy. it was also not overwhelmingly sweet, which is why they were even better with the frozen custard and chocolate sauce. total yum.\n\noverall, the food was fantastic! all of our burgers were delicious and the fries and dessert were also pleasing. i know that the burger prices could be a deterrent, however, you're getting great quality and they're large burgers!\n\nservice was just okay. our server didn't seem very happy to wait on us and it seemed a bother when we asked for anything. also, toward the end of our meal, i asked for sprite (or whatever lemon-lime soda they offered) and it was completely flat. i mean, literally, there were no bubbles in the glass and it tasted horrible. so, i asked for a replacement and i received the exact same flat, horrible soda. i couldn't believe it. why would you not check the soda if you knew the problem? there were no bubbles!! anyone could see that it was flat. the server obviously didn't care. so, i said i didn't want to take another chance and canceled my soda altogether.", 
            "what a pleasant surprise. i would want to give it about a 3.5 but it is not an option so i'll round it down since it is good enough food, however, not every dish is amazing. it appears like any regular burger lounge or red robin but much better. \nthe american wagyu burger is amazing which i would rate it at about a 4.5.  i love the truffle flavor in addition to portobella mushrooms and spinach. the burger is cooked to a good medium with just enough truffle flavor to elevate and add flavor to the burger. it is not overwhelming and seems to be perfectly balance. i also got the trio sliders to share, however, they were not that good and nothing special. i also like the <mark>Buffalo Fries</mark> which is <mark>Curly Fries</mark> with blue cheese and bufflow sauce dip. what a great idea to have fries and buffalo sauce together...yum. i didn't get a chance to try the milk shakes but it appears that everyone got one and seems to enjoyed it.", 
            "i would give this 5 stars but yelp tends to pull those. \n\nbest burger i have ever had. meat was cooked exactly as ordered. bacon was crispy like asked and bun was toasted so it didn't fall apart. \n\n<mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were crispy and the onion itself didn't pull apart when you bit into them. <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were huge! but by far the best side was the <mark>Buffalo Fries</mark>!! if you like blue cheese and franks red hot sauce... go for these. you won't be disappointed. \n\nsaturday night and we waited all of 5 minutes to walk in. drinks and food all came within 15 minutes of sitting down. \n \nwell worth it!!", 
            "stopped before we saw love.\n\nit was all just underwhelming. what is this city's obsession with burgers?! it's an american staple, but this \"gourmet\" burger thing is getting overly and widely used.\n\natmosphere was odd. it was loud and we were sat basically on top of the couple next to us. service was short and unpersonable.\n\ni'm a vegetarian... so hate me, because apparently every restaurant in vegas does. ha. i'm extremely flexible but this city makes it hard. i got quite excited when i saw the falafel veggie burger on the menu. a burger joint should nail it right, especially if they're going for a unique thing kind like that. i've been a vegetarian off and on for 4 years.... this was the worst veg burger i've ever encountered. dry as cardboard, so crispy on the outside it was possibly burnt?  it looked like it was a patty that they possibly deep fried? like a hush puppy? the avocado and hummus on top could not even help make it edible. my mouth is sand papery writing about it.\n\nwas never checked on to possibly change my order in time for our show. i should have just gotten a basket of <mark>Buffalo Fries</mark>. my friend got the signature \"blt burger\"... which she said \"well, as the menu stated... it's a burger with bacon lettuce and tomato and nothing much more than that\". pretty dissappointing for what they consider their signature menu item.\n\nthe milk shakes looked incredible. maybe my falafel would have been better if i'd been washing it down with one of those.", 
            "blt exceeded my expectations! got the <mark>Buffalo Fries</mark> to start off which is their specialty and let me tell you it did not disappoint! they were perfectly seasoned with blue cheese and you can't beat the ranch! i ordered the <mark>California Chicken</mark> burger and it also did no wrong! my mom was also raving about the salmon burger! so happy we chose to eat here since it's so convenient since we stayed at the mirage! i recommend! next time i will have to get a spiked milkshake!"

(i normally hate <mark>Horseradish Cole Slaw</mark>, but this one was really good.  the best thing was the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>.  when you take your first bite, you can savor the crispiness of it, and the sweetness of the onions, combined with a little bit of ketchup, and i was in love.  \n\nblt burger is not the cheapest place in town, which is why the 4 stars instead of 5.  for the 2 of us, it came out to about $50.00 with tip.",

            "ok, so i've been yelping my eats for almost a year now and have stayed away from posting myself but after blt, i simply had to start!\n\ni was on the strip yesterday and needed to grab lunch with a couple colleagues and we had heard that there was a new burger bar at the mirage and figured we would try.  all 3 of us prefer food to just about anything else so it was a leap of faith to go to a new place without yelping first (please hold the....serves you right comments)\n\nblt is a new boutique burger and shake restaurant at the mirage with an acclaimed chef, laurent tourondel. \n\nwe were seated pretty quickly but given a table toward the back of the restaurant by the kitchen so didn't really get a great feel for the d\\u00e9cor, but then again we came for the food. 3 hungry guys mid day for burgers and shakes, what could go wrong?\n\nthe waitress was attentive and helpful but based on some small talk; she is a bit disappointed in the crowd and mentioned the slow economy and hoped it would pick up.  after ordering drinks and burgers and some <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, we were all excited for the food. the shakes and soda took about 10 minutes but came and the shakes were decent. the <mark>Twinkie Boy</mark> was tasty but tasted like a vanilla shake with a touch of twinkie, wish i had gone with the pb&j shake that went by....that looked yummy.\n\nthe pickles came and wow! they were tasty; juicy, crispy and all around great when dipped in the spicy ranch dip. for $5, would have expected more than 8 pickles slices (about a half pickle total) but they were awesome which really helped my rating. \n\non to the main course.....our burgers and sides come and we are psyched. we made sure to get 3 different sides so we could experience them all... \n1)<mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>- greasy by any standard and way too much batter\n2)<mark>Waffle Fries</mark>- good but cold...must have been waiting for the burgers!\n3)<mark>Skinny Fries</mark>- hot, cooked perfectly, though a bit salty.\n\nnow the reason we came...the meat!\nburger 1- the kobe w/ swiss and grilled onions- not mine, but the headline from raf was \"pretty good but just a burger\"\n\nburger 2- <mark>The Classic</mark> w/ cheddar, bacon and their \"blt sauce\"- again...burger was fine, but the exact words paul uttered were.....\"would prefer a double-double from in-n-out\"\n\nburger 3-.....this was mine and the real reason for the post/rant\n\ni ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and their vermont cheddar.   now; my burger had been ordered medium so when it showed up with an \"mw\" toothpick in it, i began to get skeptical. it's a burger and since i don't think i have ever sent back a burger, i figure i will try it. one bite tells me that this thing is well done....gray all the way....the only red/pink i could find would be my ketchup....so, i showed the waitress and with her eyes she told me that \"it happens all the time and this place really sucks to work at!\" she took it back while my friends began their burgers and i snacked on the cold, salty, greasy fries. \n\nshe told me that they chef looked and said it was medium but would make me another.....was she kidding? not only did it have the wrong toothpick in it and no pink but this is customer service for a brand new place charging almost $20 for burger? whatever....\n\nso, everyone finished their burgers and mine shows up....boy did the chef show me.    how about some guesses for what toothpick held the bun together this time?????\n\nobviously, it wasn't the medium one i would have liked; it was mr, for their medium rare. i pointed it out as she served it and she shrugged.  so as i get ready to take a bite, i notice that it does have the grilled onions but also has raw red onions....really, if you order your onions grilled should you have to tell them to leave off the raw ones?\nwell, i can tell you that the toothpick with mr was wrong...should have said r, for raw, not for rare. no exaggeration here, it was still cold in the middle.  \n\nat this point, i clearly was done with this joint and had the manager come over. when she saw the burger, she actually agreed that it was undercooked for rare and not even close to medium and took it off the bill graciously. (they've been open for a month but she has already mastered the...\"i'm sorry, let me take this off the bill for you!\") again, this is the first time in 20 years of eating out at least 10 times a week that i refused to pay for something.   \n\nchances are \na)  this place has way too many issues to get it fixed quick enough\nb)  the waitress is probably already looking for a new job\nc)  the mananger seemed beaten in less than a month of being open. \nd)  the chef should thank the folks that acclaimed him in nyc and go back to the concepts that he must have found success in since this one will likely not cut it.\ne)   in a city with as many food choices as freaks, i can't imagine anyone eating at this place more than once.", 
            "the service and the burger were both five stars.\nthe sides and shakes really brought the place down.\n\ni ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> with bbq onion and vermont cheddar.  the onions were a sauteed mix of onions in bar-b-que sauce. it was so good. it was cooked perfectly to my request (i was warned they were cooked a bit under - so ordered medium well). really loved the burger.\n\nthe sides were such a disappointment. there were four of us and we ordered <mark>Fat Fries</mark> which were served cold and kind of mushy. the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were warm and crisp, but nothing special.  my least favorite was the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> that my group ordered.  they were doughy/breaded so thick and huge - but not breading. it was kind of sweet, like a donut. a pickle donut. so, sandwiched in the middle of this dough was a little hamburger-slice style of dill pickle. not my thing. at all. \n\nwent back at about midnight the next night to get shakes to go. was surprised to see the shake mix come out of a soft-serve style machine.  i got the <mark>Twinkie Boy</mark> which tastes exactly as it sounds - a twinkie all mixed up in a shake. it was average. i was on a sugar high for the rest of the night. probably won't do that again.", 
            "this was suppose to be a late night treat but it wasn't. i ordered the 1st combo which is <mark>The Classic</mark> burger, fries and soft drink. i ordered it with no onion and no pickle and paid extra for cheese. it came with the pickle and onion. my friend, being in a difficult mood, told them about it and they took the burger back. they brought it to me with all the lettuce off and most of the cheese scraped off. my burger tasted like pickle.  it was disgusting. \n\nthe fries weren't cooked all the way through and my soda was so watered down it looked like iced tea. the bread was wierd too, as soon as i pick up the burger it starts to crumble and fall apart.\n\nthe waiters were nice, the food just sucked.",

            "went to blt burger for the first time for lunch on friday 12/26/2008. blt burger is located at mirage casino and hotel. walked up and there was a little bit of a line and waited for only a few minutes. looking into the restaurant i was surprised how nice it was inside. nothing special but nicer then i expected for a burger joint. nice atmosphere for a place like this for lunch. service was just average at best. had to give up my first born (if and when i have one) to just get my water refilled. the waiter was pretty nice he joked even though i'm sure he heard a thousand times i'll take a white tiger burger. he said they have been out of them for awhile..lol. the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> are pretty good but nothing to go to vegas for. my first complaint is you can only have a combo with <mark>The Classic</mark> burger and can't substitute it at all. so that is pretty stupid in my opinion. considering i wanted a cheaper burger then <mark>The Classic</mark> but willing to pay the higher price for the combo. we ordered the blt, tex-mex, and turkey burgers. my friend that had the blt seemed to like it however when i tried it it was pretty much like a big mac with bacon. i was not a fan at all! other friend got the tex-mex burger and he hated it! i thought it pretty much sucked when i tried it. the chili on the burger was plain at best and just lacking of any flavor. i got the turkey burger and i thought it was decent. had good spices and the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were good. for a burger here i would skip it. i've not had in n' out burger but i'm going to guess its a lot better and a lot cheaper. i did not get the milkshakes since i was pretty hungover from the night before already. the milkshakes are what you come for from what i understand. i would like to go back and just get a spiked milkshake in the future. for a turkey burger and <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> total was 18.32 before tip. amount of food was pretty good but not worth the price. i would eat here again if i had to and would pretty much only stick to the turkey burger. would not go out of my way to come here and would pick a thousand other places first.", 
            "i went to the mirage in vegas and i found this cool burger joint. i loved the atmosphere right away. lots of great energy. the place was full of people who looked happy to be there. i thought it would be a great place for me since i was catching a flight soon. i sat at the counter. the counter was a great place to people watch. i was watching the eaters and the people coming in and out of the mirage. very entertaining! i had a friendly waiter. he was great. i love the shirts they wear. black t-shirts with writing on the back that says \"tip waiters, not cows. i had <mark>The Classic</mark> burger with cheese and the yummy <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. i was very satisfied with my meal.it hit the spot. if you are craving a burger i would say go! i would give blt burger a thumbs up!!!",

            "3.5 stars for blt!\n\ni had the blt burger. it was a well seasoned burger with a slightly sweet bun topped with crispy bacon. the patty was a bit on the dry side because i accidentally asked for medium well instead of medium (don't ask me why)\n\nthe bf had <mark>The Classic</mark> burger which he thought was pretty good as well just not amazing.\n\nwe did take out because we stayed in the mirage and just needed some late night grub (note: they only take take-out orders in person). 2 burgers put us at $30. probably won't come back unless i stay at the mirage again, there's just too many other great places in eat in vegas!", 
            "my kid and i tried this restaurant mainly for its twinkie milkshakes.\nthe twinkie milkshake was awesome. it had a distinct twinkie flavor that made my kid feel like he was in heaven (he said that). the <mark>Skinny Fries</mark> were pretty good too. but <mark>The Classic</mark> hamburger with cheese was less than average. i expected better quality, flavor and bigger size for $13. the service was good. and their shirts said funny stuff like:\"i'm juicy\" , \"don't tip the cow, tip the waiter\" and my favorite \"if you are what you eat, i'm fast, cheap and easy\", lol.\ni think i'll still be going to in-n-out burger.", 
            "i ordered some stuff to go. decided on the kobe burger trio appetizer, lamb burger and <mark>The Classic</mark>, the place seemed busy so they told me the food would be ready in 30-40 minutes. so since i am in a casino what better way to kill time than to go play some blackjack! well thanks to that, my burger ended up costing $200 haha. oh well, but at least the food tasted good. would definitely suggest the <mark>Kobe Slider Trio</mark> appetizer, but the lamb burger wasn't that great, the sauce was a little funky and unpleasing to the palate.",

            "it was the middle of the night, around 1 a.m. to be exact, and we just got into vegas.  we had been walking around for a bit already and we were desperately looking for a place to have dinner.  yes, dinner at 1 a.m.  oh it felt like college for a moment.  we walked into the mirage and just saw this place and decided to eat at blt burger.  \n\nas far as the menu nothing really jumped at me, but the list of milkshakes caught my eye.  names from \"<mark>Twinkie Boy</mark>\" to \"<mark>The Lunch Box</mark>\", there were some clever names for their shakes that coincided with the ingredients of the shakes.  not a lot of places have a big choice of shakes.   \n\ni ended up ordering the combo, which included <mark>The Classic</mark> burger combo with chili.  the combo came with choice fries and choice of milkshake; i got the \"<mark>Nut Job</mark>\".  the milkshake with the silly name had hazelnut ice cream, nutella! and \"slivered\" pieces of almonds.  nutella in a shake is actually a good idea, and it ended up the best part of my meal.  \n\nto be fair the portions were to be expected and i enjoyed the food that night.  as i really liked this place a lot at first, reflecting back i think i was just really hungry.  the burgers were good, but not spectacular and a bit overpriced as well.  i'll give this place credit for their shakes, but the burgers itself could be better.", 
            "great burger place, i had <mark>The Classic</mark>. the food and the service were good. check it out if you are in vegas.", 
            "i wanted to try one of their specialty burgers but it wasn't worth the price, so i went with <mark>The Classic</mark> burger combo deal for $20. we also ordered their spicy buffalo wings which was perfectly, lightly crisped. \n\ni felt a little silly at this fancy-burger place...let's not forget what an american-burger is. (it's fast food, i see right through you blt burger!) the service was a bit slow and the place was packed, there should be a bigger staff running around. overall, i had a decent lunch and was stuffed!", 
            "oo.m.g, i just had a burgasm.  one that not even the steep sticker price could extinguish.  \n\nfirst of all, to all complaining about price: this is vegas, and this is a gourmet burger bar, get over it and enjoy your burger i say! mcdonalds is right across the street, you can get your big mac meals there, but i don't see why the heck you would when you're in vegas! (and for those who are price conscious, they do have menus posted on the outside of their restaurant here.....so by the time you walk in, you should already have some idea of what to expect price wise..... they give you plenty of heads up before you enter....)\n\nso we had returned from a show at the aria and were looking for a place to eat.  after considering all our culinary options @ the mirage, we ended up at blt burgers.   they had plenty of burgers on their list that looks delicious, i opted to try their kobe beef burger and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, my husband had the tex mex burger with <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>.\nneither of us tried the milk shakes, as it was getting late and we didn't feel like filling up with milk shakes at that hour, however i did see some milkshakes \"walking by\" our table and oh man do those look delicious!  i'll have to return back for one of those some day.\n\nanyway, my burger was fantastic!! i opted not to add anything to it, i figured that if i was going to taste a kobe beef hamburger, i didn't want anything interfering with the taste of beef so i ate it with onion and tomato, plain as it comes, and it was a great decision on my part, the burger alone was so flavorful, it would've been a shame to spoil it by adding something to it.\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were delicious, they were lightly seasoned with chili powder (i think?) and were ohhh so good!\n\nmy husband's tex mex burger was good also, their chili there is very smooth and flavorful and the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were great... the kind you can actually bit into without the entire string of onion following.... that's always a plus! \n\nthe service here was really good, the waiter we had was attentive and frequently refilled our drinks.  \n\ni'm close to giving this joint a 5 star review, but although such prices are to be expected when you dine out in vegas, and at a gourmet burger place, i'd still like to knock off a star for the steep pricing.  i'm also withholding 1 star due to the fact that they do infact have a combo option, but it doesn't allow for you to choose any burger but <mark>The Classic</mark> one.   i've been to other gourmet burger bars where you are able to substitute the burgers in their combos, they just adjust the price accordingly.... so .... that is why i'm not giving 5 stars.\n\nthat's it though, no minus for service or food, i highly recommend this one, just be prepared to pay somewhere between $12-17 per burger, an additional $5 or so for a side and then theres the drinks.\n\ngo, eat, have fun & be merry.  chances are that if you're in vegas to begin with, you're not here to save money so instead of dropping another $20 on a slot machine which yields nothing in return, bring it to blt burgers instead and invest in a burger ;-)", 
            "i love a good hearty burger - thick and meaty and flavorful is all i ask.  to experience the true taste of the beef, i put next to nothing on it.  just a small amount of mustard and some onions.  and if all goes well - i'm satisfied.  well, blt fits that bill splendidly!  i visited blt in february of this year.  there are plenty of specialty burger joints all over vegas and my choices were down to strip burger and blt.  blt won out.\n\ni'd heard and read great reviews about blt burger. i took a seat at the bar.  brendan was my attendant.  i like the atmosphere at blt and the visible cooking area at the bar.  i ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> combo (classic burger, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and a beer).  they didn't have red stripe, but brendan suggested <mark>Sin City Amber</mark> ale.  he gave me a taste in a shot glass and i did choose it for my beer.  it was smooth and cold.  i sat, ate and watched some of the rerun of the nba all star game.  it was a great meal.", 
            "wow. my friend and i arrived in vegas during lunchtime. we checked into our hotel and was hungry having skipped breakfast. \n\nfriend: what should we eat?\nme: i don't know, what does yelp say?\nfriend: there's a burger place, blt burger\nme: how many stars? how many reviews?\nfriend: tons compared to others\nme: let's go.\n\nthe first thing we did was hop on yelp, stumbled upon blt burger. \n\nthere was a line outside the restaurant but it moved pretty quickly. we were seated within 10-15mins. \n\nit was pretty busy but the wait wasn't too long considering the restaurant was packed. i ordered the tandoori lamb burger and sweet potatoe fries. it was sooo good. my friend ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> burger, <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> and an oreo shake. she loved hers as well. at first i thought the prices were crazy expensive because our bill came out to about $55 but it's vegas! i'm sure every where else is probably about the same but with half decent burgers. we left very satisfied and in hunt for a watered down margarita in a yardstick.", 
            "i loved this place!!!!!  we came here twice in our five day stay in las vegas--once for lunch and once just for dessert because it was that delicious.\n\nthe first time we came, i had <mark>The Classic</mark> cheeseburger, and my friend had the blt burger.  both of them were amazing.  the meat was so tender and juicy, and you could really tell it was high quality beef.  she had <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> that were awesome, but the real star of the meal was my <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>.  they were so crispy, and they held onto the ketchup nicely, which is very important to me :)  also, they had a delicious crunch when you bit into them, but the insides were really fluffy.  soooo delicious!!  on this particular trip, our waiter was awesome and attentive and had great suggestions.\n\nthe second trip we made was at about 10pm because we were craving something sweet for dessert.  our waiter was not good.  he was surly, sullen, didn't introduce himself (i still don't know his name) and was clearly not happy to be there.  he seemed put off if we asked for things like spoons for our ice cream.  horrible waiter.\n\nbut anyway, we ordered a peanut butter chocolate milkshake and the krispy kreme bread pudding.  both were amazing, but my favorite was the milkshake!  it was delicious, and with the giant straw, i was able to drink it lickity split! :)\n\nso my overall impression with this restaurant is a positive one, and if you are going to get anything, be sure to order it with the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> :)", 
            "it's my own fault, i suppose. i should have ordered something besides <mark>The Classic</mark> combo with a black and white milkshake. for $20, i definitely wasn't expecting  a scrawny little burger, and a sprinkling of fries. \n\nthe milkshake and the phenomenal service were the saving graces. \n\nso, if you want a standard burger, i suggest in-n-out. seriously.", 
            "food was excellent and atmosphere was cool. had the deep <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> for an appetizer and <mark>The Classic</mark> cheeseburger. portions are huge and the cost isn't bad. just a cool vibe in the place (it's in the mirage)", 
            "the last time i was here, i heard about the spiked milkshakes and grabbed one and left, not knowing that the burgers here absolutely delicious.\n\nmy gf also ordered the spiked chocolate milkshake, which i wasn't too much of a fan, probably because it was very chocolatey for me. on the other hand, the spiked all-nighter shake hit the spot.  \n\nwe both ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> burger, and i liked it so much i ate it with the tomato slice inside of it. i don't normally eat tomatoes in burgers, but the way this one was made really sealed the deal for me.\n\ni guess i never would've known about this place if serendipity wasn't so damn busy all the time.", 
            "went here for dinner before <mark>Fuzzy the Bear</mark> love show at the mirage.  we read the reviews and were expecting great things and we were not disappointed.  the burgers were deliciious!  i had the combo with <mark>The Classic</mark> burger (added cheese and bacon).  the burger was cooked exactly as i ordered it (well done) and tasted amazing.  the bacon had this wonderful smoky flavor to it that was to die for.  the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were out of this world.  i had a black and white milk shake that was the absolute best milk shake i have had at a restaurant ever.  too much whipped cream on top but other than that, so good!  the only negative thing i can say is it's crazy pricy but we definitely weren't disappointed in the quality of food.  some of the waiters were wearing shirts that said \"if we are what we eat then i'm fast, cheap, and easy.\"  that cracked me up!", 
            "me and my family visited this past weekend and loved it! we ordered a variety of items to get the full effect of the menu. 3 folks ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> burger, cooked to perfection, juicy and flavorful! i ordered the trio of sliders (bbq & carmelized onion, bleu cheese & blt) along with the covered <mark>Waffle Bites</mark> (awesome) and the wings. oh, the wings...very spicy! they bake them first then deep fry. the sauce is hhoott, you will have a tingle on your lips, so enjoy! (see photos) looking forward to future visits.", 
            "my husband and i enjoyed blt burger on our last visit, and we were just as happy with it this time!  we both got <mark>The Classic</mark> with different toppings - i got cheddar, he got american and avocado.  i ordered mine medium-well, and it was basically well, but it was still very flavorful and not at all dry.  we ordered a straw<mark>Berry Me</mark>, which was good.  we shared an order of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, which were great.  i ordered a drink with strawberries, orange juice, and gin (not sure why, as i am not normally a gin drinker), but it was very good.  \n\none minor complaint- i asked for no tomato on my burger, and they had obviously put a tomato on top of the onion and then removed it prior to bringing it to the table.  it didn't really bother me, but if you have allergies, you may want to be careful with special requests. \n\ni think this was the least expensive dinner we had while in vegas, but we loved it!", 
            "while traveling all over we seek out exceptional burger places this establishment is now in our top two! goodness the place just didn't stop delivering exceptional quality! from the moment we entered our waitress, stephanie, was incredible-funny, patient, kind, generous with information and stories, efficient, etc. then there's the food. are you kidding me?!?!?  the menu was aolmost over the top with possibilities! my husband decided to try <mark>The Classic</mark> for a \"true result of a quality burger\". i had the <mark>Shaft's Blue</mark> burger which has <mark>Shaft's Blue</mark> cheese, mushrooms and caramelized onions. the blue cheese was just perfect-not too much or too little but gave a perfect punch! the true subject matter however is the quality of the burger--cooked to perfection, juicy, flavorful, absolute quality! i also got the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> which were again cooked perfectly-crisp and tender, seasoned just right-yum!  this won't be our last visit to blt burgers and was a great way to enjoy our stay at the mirage!\n\nother menu items: <mark>Kobe Slider Trio</mark>, <mark>BBQ Nachos</mark>, <mark>Waffle Bites</mark> (topped with cheddar, sourt cream, bacon and pickled jalapenos), 5-spice chinese chicken salad, blt burger (7 oz burger with double smoked bacon), american kobe burger, <mark>Lamb Tandoori</mark> burger, turkey burger, <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> burger, <mark>Veggie Falafel</mark> burger, salmon burger and a bbq brisket plus about 15 milkshakes!!! (this is only a partial list of the ordering options)", 
            "despite looking like a modern twist on a burger place, blt burger was the most disappointing thing about our trip to vegas.    the staff is rude and just too cool to pay you any mind whatsoever.  after sitting for 10 minutes, our waiter (who barely spoke english) took our order.\n\nmy wife got the bleu cheese burger while i got <mark>The Cowboy</mark> burger.  she ordered hers medium well and i got mine medium.  the waiter got that backwards and we had to send them both back.\n\nwhen we finally did get served, hers was nearly inedible with the amount of bleu cheese that was on there.  it also had no texture: soft all the way through with no lettuce or tomato for some crunch.  my cowboy burger was better, although the barbecue sauce they use is way too spicy. \n\ni got the skinny (shoestring) fries which were so overdone as to be nearly teeth-breaking potato chips.  she got the thick fries (wedges) which were covered in that orange special seasoning some places use.\n\nwe sent her burger back again and she didn't eat.  they took her burger off the bill - acting like they were doing us a great favor - so the final tab with my burger, two fries and two diet cokes was over $30 (soft drinks $3.50 each!).\n\nthey advertise 'combos' on the menu, but that only covers <mark>The Classic</mark> burger and the turkey burger.\n\nbest thing about the place - the bench seats were the most comfortable i have ever sat on.  other than that, avoid at all costs (and it will cost).", 
            "if i could have added a half star i would have. it wasn't that blt burger was bad....it was just ok. my husband and i took the kids to see the tigers at the mirage and decided to take them to dinner as well. we chose blt burger because it looked and sounded kid friendly (it was loud and there were other kids inside) we were taken to a table as soon as we walked in but it took a good 10 minutes for our waiter to come over. they had a kids menu, which was great, but there was no burger on the kids menu (all they had was chicken fingers, corn dog and grilled cheese) but my son wanted a burger (hence the name blt burger) and we had to pay the adult price for <mark>The Classic</mark> burger and extra for the cheese he wanted.\ni ordered the chili and it was amazing (i give it 5 stars) a great portion and perfect amount of spice. my husband had bbq chicken nachos and he said they were good as well.\nhis burger came out incorrectly made...he had added sauteed onions and mushrooms but they were no where to be found.\nall in all the service was a little slow and the food was just ok and for the prices on the burgers i expected more.....not sure if i will return or just stick to good old in n out burger.", 
            "i freakin' love this place! considering that most places in vegas and especially ones in the casinos are expensive, blt is actually inexpensive compared to everything else around it yet it serves a couple of the best tasting burgers i have ever had in my life.\n\ni tend to venture around looking for good food with even better deals but during this time in vegas, my friend and i went to blt three times throughout our stay cause the food was just that good.\n\ni would go classic/traditional for your first time (if you're a lay burger-connoisseur like i am) and if they can nail it with something traditional, pretty much anything else on the menu would be to your liking.  they're pretty creative with their recipes and they don't mess up or slack off with <mark>The Classic</mark>. go with the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> ;) ;)\n\nthe service is also great and accommodating and the t-shirts the staff wears are pretty funny with their burger-related puns.",

            "after seeing blt on top chef i thought i should give it a try.  soooo disappointed!  service was also terrible.  the burger tasted like it had liquid smoke.  don't waste your time or money here.  try the burger bar instead!  my friend got the <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> sandwich, they even messed that up!", 
            "on friday night after checking in at ti, we wandered over to the mirage for a casual dinner at blt burger. blt burger is just past the casino near carnagie deli, rhumbar, and california pizza kitchen. my husband and i have ate at blt steak in scottsdale, arizona, so we thought it would be fun to check out another of the blt concepts, so blt burger it was!\n\nthe interior is two levels and has a slightly upscale diner feel to it. service was mediocre - our server was nice but not that attentive which was annoying as the restaurant was maybe only half full at 7 pm on a friday evening.\n\nour group of four tried:\n*the all-nighter, <mark>Malibu Barbie</mark>, and <mark>Night Rider</mark> spiked milkshakes - they were all delicious, but i think the favorite was the <mark>Malibu Barbie</mark>. the <mark>Night Rider</mark> was my second favorite, but the whipped cream was a bit too thick.\n*<mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> sandwich - my husband is very picky about <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> sandwiches and while he liked it, he was not wowed\n*caesar salad - i don't eat beef, so i opted for a salad as my meal. the salad was large and i enjoyed the large crouton that came on it, but it was not the best salad i have ever had. it needed a bit more dressing to give it more flavor.\n*blt burger - our friends really enjoyed this burger. while it was simple, it hit the spot.\n*asian bahn mi burger - one of our friends ordered it as it was not a traditional beef burger and while he liked it, it seemed that he liked his wife's blt burger more.\n*<mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> - cooked perfectly and i liked how the breading was not too heavy.\n\nthe burgers do not come with a side, so if you want fries or <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, you need to make sure to order them as a side. our bill came to about $65 per couple (includes tax and tip), so it's a tad pricey for a burger and milkshake joint. however, if i were at the mirage, i might stop by for a spiked milkshake and some fries if i wanted a snack while watching a sporting event - the spiked milkshakes are definitely the best part about blt burger!", 
            "i've eaten here twice and i have to say that the first time was a better dining experience. i had the turkey burger... yum! and a twinkie milkshake... this last time, i had the <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> burger... it came with avocado slices, but  it wasn't a slice, it was like a whole half of an avocado... i ended up just taking it out because it was too difficult to eat. the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were good though, probably the best part of that meal.\n\nthe restaurant is trendy and the staff was accommodating.\n\nthey say that three times a charm and in true vegas style, i will just have to take my chances next time.", 
            "hands-down, this is one of my favorite places to eat in vegas. i went with my girlfriend. we shared an order of fries, she had <mark>The Classic</mark> with american cheese, i had the \"blt\" with oregon cheddar, and we shared a straw<mark>Berry Me</mark>. \n\nthe shake was, by far, the best milkshake i have ever had. we got strawberry because it is my girlfriend's favorite, but they have many more interesting flavors, like <mark>Twinkie Boy</mark> (made with twinkies), campfire marshmallows (made with toasted marshmallows), <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> (made with peanut butter and jelly), or the nut jub (made with hazelnut ice cream and nutella). being in las vegas, they even have a section on their menu devoted specifically to spiked milkshakes! both of the burgers were a good size, big enough that i wasn't annoyed at the size, but small enough that i wasn'y amazed by it. my girlfriend's burger was very good, but not special because she didn't add anything to it. the \"blt\", on the other hand, was amazing. the double-smoked bacon was crisp, but not at all burnt or overdone, and the \"double-smoked\" flavor was fantastic. also, there was something special about the oregon cheddar and i enjoyed its flavor much more than other cheddars. i didn't notice until after i ordered, but they offer fried eggs as an optional topping. that really made this place for me, because fried eggs are awesome on burgers (if you haven't tried one on a burger, you are seriously missing out). i can't decide if i want to try the \"blt\" again, with chili, a fried egg, and oregon cheddar, or if i want to try the <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> burger next time. either way, i'm positive i won't be disappointed. to top it off, though, the fries were delicious. they were cooked to a slight crunch, but not over done, and the inside was light and fluffy. also, they didn't obliterate the fries with salt before bringing them out, allowing you to add the amount of salt you like, which was great for me because i hate salt on my fries.\n\nthe service here was good. we didn't have to wait very long for lunch and our server was friendly. she was very good at knowing what time to check on us and took good care of us. i especially liked that she didn't get annoyed when we needed a few extra minutes to decide what we wanted (like at the carnegie deli down the hall) and just came back in a few minutes, instead of checking every 30 seconds for the first 2 minutes and then ditching us for 20 minutes (which is what happened at carnegie)\n\nto all the complainers about the high price, this is vegas. yes, the price is high, but don't pretend like you didn't see it coming. everything on the strip is expensive. for the strip, i found this place reasonable, especially for the quality and size of the food, along with the service. if you don't like the prices, you picked the wrong place for your vacation and you should just go home so the rest of us don't have to wait.\n\nanyways, i'll definitely be back here next time i am on the strip. can't wait to try those shakes!", 
            "had the <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> sandwich - very impressed!  bleu cheese crumbles are added (and very strong), so be sure to ask to have these removed if you're not a fan of bleu cheese.\n\nthey offer three different styles of fries - thin, thick or <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>.  i had the thin - they weren't bad, but i've had better.  definitely not worth 5 bucks.\n\nspent 41 bucks on two sandwiches, one order of fries, and one coke.  but you can't expect anything cheap in las vegas... where the taxes were nearly 20%... eek.",

            "good....not great. \n\noverall ok food but rather average for the price. <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> burger was good, but not $12 good when it doesn't come with anything on the side. also, my chicken burger was skimpy on the toppings. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> on the other hand were quite delish! they were enough to share between two people. i didn't get a chance to try the milkshakes but they looked amazing. \n\nthe service was slow. the place crowded consistently. i'd come back but would probably be inclined to try something different.",

            "went here for dinner on our first night in vegas. that's important to note, as we were all feeling a little worn out from traveling.\n\nwe were staying at the mirage, so it was convenient and it came highly recommended.\n\nour party ordered the following:\n- turkey burger & <mark>Skinny Fries</mark> (all white meat natural turkey breast ground with fresh herbs) - $12\n- <mark>Chili Bowl</mark> - $8\n- <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> sandwich & <mark>Fat Fries</mark> - (fried chicken, red hot sauce, avocado, chopped lettuce, maytag blue, buttermilk dressing) - $12\n- vegetable salad & <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> - $12 + $5\n- chicken caesar salad - $15\n- blt burger & <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> (7oz. grilled certified angus beef, double smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, blt burger sauce) - $13 (add cheese for $1)\n\nit was awesome! no one had any complaints.\n\nwe tried every fry variety at our table of five - sweet potato, waffle, skinny and fat. i really liked the fries in particular (sweet potato and waffle)... <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> are just not something you see in canada very much. yum! and i've rarely met a yam frite i didn't agree with!\n\nour waiter was friendly and fast, though i felt like he was trying a bit too hard to be funny. whatever... it's better than being surly.\n\ncompared to the other restos we ate at in the mirage, it was a bit trendier and more family-oriented.", 
            "the good:  another upscale burger joint?  yep, but they have other choice besides beef, like lamb, chicken, fish, and veggie. since i had a killer burger at smashburger i went with the <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> - fried chicken, red hot sauce, avocado, chopped lettuce, maytag blue, buttermilk dressing.  along with a order of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, chili spice seasoning.\n\nthe bad:  pretty pricey for a burger meal that i don't think delivers.  only certain burgers can be combo'd.  i'm not sure why, when some of the burgers are the same price as the ones that qualify for it.  the combos are a burger, fries and a drink for i believe $21 or a milkshake for $23.  save the money, go to smashburger, get better food for half the price.\n\nthe ben:  i don't think the food was worth the price.  i think that smashburger has ruined my burger taste buds for awhile.", 
            "we stopped here before seeing a show at the mirage. \ni thought the food was good, but the same stuff you can get at most burger places. i had the <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> burger, which was great because they somehow make the buffalo sauce part of the chicken's breading, so it wasn't very messy to eat as these burgers normally are, but it tasted just like you would expect. i also got the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> with mine and they were the standard fries you can get at any other restaurant. my husband got the blt burger and loved it. very thick cut bacon and cooked exactly as he ordered (medium rare), he also got the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> and both of us agreed that they are the better of the two sides we tried.\nthe atmosphere was also nice, we sat right on the edge, so we had a great view for people watching, and in vegas that is always a treat.",

            "i totally had no plans on having anything negative to say about a late night burger joint that has a full bar available until around 2 am on a weeknight. based on my first experience, it would appear that i was wrong in my thinking. \n\ni decided to go in around 11pm one night with a friend on the recommendation of a buddy that had tried out blt recently for the first time as well. \n\ni am a sucker for a good martini and a great burger, (or steak but in this case a burger.) i ordered a vodka martini and some <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> for my friend and i. they had 3 sauces available and i asked the server to mix it up with a few of each kind. he said \"no we can't do that\". he said.. no we cant do that. lol... i know that being a vegas local, i am used to most restaurant's giving you want you want to an extent. it's not like i was changing a recipe.. i wanted a bit of three different styles of wings, all the same price, no change in the portion size. at that, he didn't offer an explanation... just no. so i'm like, cool.. we will just take them spicy. no big deal.\n\nthe martini arrives. the server literally kicked a few pieces of trash on the way to the table when delivering the drink. looking around, there was trash everywhere. i  mean alot of trash, not like a little bit. many dirty tables and the floor was ridiculous. i'm guessing it was due to being understaffed, because the server took off after delivering my drink before i could order. \n\nlong story short, the second martini was a different size (less), i mentioned it and the server said they were trying to close up the bar. the wings didn't taste right, and when i asked the waiter why they tasted burnt.. he said they are \"double cooked\".. when i mentioned that i think the oil  they were frying them in was old, he said \"oh really\". \n\nhaha.. listen guys, i'm not that bad of a food snob, this is wings, burgers and martinis.. if it doesn't taste right i'm not going to just eat it. \n\nburgers show up, over cooked but still tasty.. <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>... burnt tasting and apparently fried in the same oil as the wings as they did not taste right.. like rancid oil was the flavor. the server dissapeared, most likely afraid of me asking him more questions. \n\nfinally he came back with the bill, and even as it was just after midnight he seemed to be rushing us. i asked about the '<mark>Deep Fried Oreos</mark>' as i had not had them before and he ordered them for us. listed on the menu they were to be served with a berry sauce. they showed up with a ramekin of melted vanilla ice cream. when i asked about the berry sauce, he said \"it's not served with that'. i showed him the menu, and he said the menu was wrong. lmao. this guy is a piece of work, and i actually had to laugh out loud. i just let it go and ate the oreo's, paid the bill and left. \n\ni'll go back for one of these shakes someday.. the spiked ones every one talks about. it will be earlier in the evening when there is a full staff, a manager and when they aren't trying to close down the place for the night.\n\nhappy eating!",

            "loved the texture and taste of the straw<mark>Berry Me</mark> shake, and quite enjoyed the medium-well <mark>Lamb Tandoori</mark> burger.\n\nkeep in mind that every topping you add will be an extra charge to your bill: cheese, avocado, etc.\n\nservice was fast and friendly, and the seats filled up by the time noon came around.",

            "i didn't want to eat a burger at all when i came here but many months before, as i was leaving the mirage i glanced at blt's menu before walking out. i saw something that sounded unbelievably delicious: krispy kreme donut bread pudding... wow there is such a thing!? i looove krispy kreme donuts and i love love bread pudding. unfortunately i wasn't hungry that day so i wasn't able to try it out until last week. \n\ni always feel weird ordering just one thing when i go out so my bf and i split a combo #2 that included:\n\nclassic burger - $1 more for cheese. some of the yelp pictures (including mine) make the burgers look way bigger than they are. they're just a bit bigger than in-n-out burgers but those are only like $3! ugh...at least it was tasty. \n\nfries - we chose to get the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and these were damn good. so crispy, sweet, and satisfying! why would anyone ever get regular fries? oh and don't ruin it with ketchup. just enjoy...\n\nmilkshake - another extra charge ($1) for an upgrade to a special milkshake. we got the <mark>Nut Job</mark>, made with hazelnut ice cream, nutella and topped with slivered almonds. i really liked this. the nutty flavors were great with the ice cream. the milkshake wasn't super thick which i liked because you can't drink it otherwise. i wasn't a fan of the whip cream though. it just tasted like air! no hints of sweetness or even creaminess. normally this thing costs $7. it was good but it wasn't that good. that's just pushing on crazy.\n\nfinally after the good but too pricey split meal we ordered the dessert. officially on the menu it's called \"krispy kreme\" doughnut bread pudding' so i'm wondering if they actually use the real thing. no matter because it tasted perfect! it was everything i imagined it would be. it came out hot and bubbling. the cool rum raisin ice cream was great with the hot pudding. i've had the hot/cold combo hundreds of times but it never gets old. i could still taste the icing on the donuts even though they were mashed up. so delicious! it was $6 and i would order this over and over again. now i can't ever come to vegas and leave without one of these in my tummy. i've been thinking about it ever since i left!",

            "i finally got to eat at blt burger on a recent trip to lv.  i had originally tried to go there back in july 2008 when we had tickets to love, but there was some sort of incident that closed the restaurant down and we had to find another option.  it had remained on my radar ever since though.\n\nwe went on a monday evening, arriving something between 8:30 - 9:00 p.m.  i was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait.  we also got a nice table right by the breezeway, which led to some nice people watching and a game i like to call 'real or fake'.  \n\nthe service was good all-around, quick, friendly and the server even was kind enough to fake laugh at some of my jokes.  i ordered the #2 combo, which is a basic burger (with cheddar), fries (waffle style) and a milkshake (<mark>Nut Job</mark>).  the burger was good, but nothing particularly stood out about it.  the <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> were below average, a little too much seasoning i though.  the milkshake tasted pretty good, but the one problem with it was that it came with two huge straws (if you've ever been to panera bread and gotten a frozen drink, like that, but i think bigger).  i didn't try, but i'm pretty sure i literally could have fit three regular sized straws within this straw.  anyways, the straw sucked, and not in the good way, i wasn't even able to get all the milkshake from the glass.  i also tried one of the wife's <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> and it was average at best.\n\nthe remainder of the party was basically 'meh' about this place.  i didn't think it was a great value, but we were in vegas, so what can you expect.  i can't imagine going back there when there are so many other restaurants i'd like to try in vegas.  solid three.", 
            "the wife and i had been looking forward to trying out blt burger at the mirage for some time and last night we finally gave it a shot.\n\ni ordered spicy buffalo wings and a tex mex burger with a \"<mark>Nut Job</mark> milkshake\" and wife had a vegetarian falafel burger with swiss and mushrooms, a side order of <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> and the same milkshake.\n\nthings started well with the milkshakes which were simply put, unbelievably delicious. i'm not normally a big fan of milk based drinks, but i could chug one of these down all day long.\n\nwife really enjoyed her fried pickle appetizer with chipotle ranch dipping sauce and i was encouraged after a bite of my wings. at this point we thought \"wow! what a great place we have discovered\".\n\nunfortunately things took a sharp downturn from that point on. by about my third wing (of eight) the taste had become overwhelming and unpleasant. also, i had deliberately asked for the \"spicy\" wings as opposed to the \"tangy\" ones, so why did they taste so strongly of lemon? wings were also very mushy without any sort of crispness about the exterior. eventually i gave up after about four - realising i had been forcing them down for the sake of it.\n\nburgers arrived and i was surprised to see something that really didn't look like a $13 burger on my plate. the meat was not cooked to my specifications (but it was close, so i was ok), but the whole thing was bland - the chili included in the burger was tasteless and so runny <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> part of the bun turned into a soggy mess. the \"sour cream\" and \"jalapenos\" supposedly in the burger simply got lost in all the chaos. in the end it was edible, but not something i would ever pay for again.\n\nwife pronounced her falafel burger burnt tasting on the outside with a tasteless interior. she got through perhaps 1/3 of the thing and left the rest on her plate. we were both quite surprised the staff member who took our plates didn't ask her if there had been a problem with her meal.\n\nonly the excellence of the shakes and the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> saves blt burger from a 1 star rating from me. it's a really high price for a great milkshake and mediocre food.",

            "food: 4/5\nclassic burger: very tasty. the bun is done well, the cheese is delicious, and you get a good chunk of beef. it was incredibly under-seasoned in my opinion, but some might enjoy that, as it enables the flavor of the meat to push through to your palate. clearly fresh meat, and cooked to perfection (my medium was a true medium [pink and tender on the inside], not a medium-well, as so many places mistakenly make them into).\n\n<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>: by far -- by far -- the best i've ever had. good texture (not crunchy, not mushy) and extraordinary seasoning. i'd come back just for these.\n\ndrink: 5/5\n<mark>Nut Job</mark> milkshake: delicious! it really tasted just like nutella and almonds. there were even almond shavings on top. the texture was terrific, and the whipped cream was the best i've ever tasted -- truly home-made.\n\n\nservice: 1/5\nthe good: not the worst i've had, as our server wasn't out-and-out rude and did bring us the correct orders.\n\nthe bad: she was incredibly slow and inattentive; i'm not sure i've ever seen someone more bored with their job. when we'd try to catch her eye at various points, we'd find her behind the bar, chatting with other employees and getting giggly back rubs from the bartender. it took her nearly twenty-five minutes to glance over at us and bring us our bill once we'd finished our meals.\n\n\natmosphere: 5/5\nspace: nice, open little area. tables and booths are spacious. you can watch passers-by as you dine.\n\ndecor: very well decorated. red and gold might sound like a recipe for a gaudy disaster, but blt's actually managed to make it work quite well.\n\ncleanliness: didn't find anything wrong with the dishware, silverware, floor, or tables/seats. absolutely clean.\n\n\nprices: 4/5\nthere's a lot of complaining on here about prices, but come on, people -- it's blt burger! the name alone carries some prestige. sometimes, food is simply worth an extra few bucks, and if you're scared of higher prices, it's your responsibility to judge whether a restaurant's bypassed your comfort level by looking at a menu before you take a seat. if you want a super cheap burger, there's a mcdonald's right across the street.\n\nthat said, for the quality, i think the prices are maybe a dollar too high, or two dollars at most. it's not the best burger i've ever had, and $5 for a side of fries is a bit much, even considering how spectacular they are. but all in all, i'd say blt mostly warrants its prices.",

            "we/i thought that this would be a great place to enjoy the super bowl.  i reserved a table for the nominal (relatively nominal - as it was much more expensive elsewhere) fee of $125 per person which bought us reserved seats, unlimited menu food, and an open bar that afforded us water, soda, well liquors, milk shakes and an impressive assortment of beers.  i thought this was a great idea until i did the math and came to find out that there was no way i would eat or drink $125 worth of food within the 4 hour game window.  that being said, on to the review:\n\nthis is a stylized burger joint.  two bars.  it offers 11 televisions and your choice of bar, booth or table seating.  \n\nthe menu consists of burgers (of course) and a wide variety of pupus.  we ordered <mark>BBQ Nachos</mark> (by fair the best), <mark>Curly Fries</mark>, <mark>Waffle Fries</mark>, hot wings (these were no joke, hot as hades), chili cheese fries, and an asian salad.  unfortunately we never were able to order anything else.\n\nthe service, although pleasant, was mediocre at best.  i understand that they may have been overwhelmed at the sudden onslaught of orders, but damnit please bring my food in a timely manner.  not only was it slow (45 minutes!), once we received the food there were 3 extra orders of wings, 1 additional nacho, 1 additional <mark>Waffle Fries</mark> and they tried to give us a blt burger, too.  crazy right?  with a table full of carbs (that we didn't order and that we could never finish), our waiter never once asked if we were ready for the protein portion of the meal.  although our friend, who ordered the asian salad, wretched after taking two bites and sent it back.  sad really.\n\nmy wife enjoyed her two milkshakes ordered to cool off her mouth from the wings.  <mark>Mocha Mudslide</mark> i think.\n\neven though the service was suspect, they still added on an automatic gratuity.  are you f'n kidding me?\n\ni had a few drinks but, i swear, after the second one, there wasn't a drop of alcohol in the rest.  probably a good thing, maybe he was watching my back, no idea.\n\ngenerally very disappointed with the entire experience ......  the restaurant, the service, the food, the drinks, and yes especially the game."

            "saturday morning, not wanting to eat in our hotel, jeff and i took the tram over from ti to the mirage.  \nwe stumbled upon blt, when we saw the line for the carnegie deli.  \nblt has cool decor.  the floor and ceilings are made from ends of different sized pieces of wood, think 2x4s cut off at different ends.  it makes for interesting textures on the ceiling. the floor has a similar motif, but all the same size and polished to look like tile.  in the rear, there is a grill area with brick red shiny tile, flanked by huge black and white murals of the desert.  \n\nwe were seated in a booth.  the table with kinda low for the height of <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> seats.  \n\nour waitress was excellent.  she was helpful and pleasant.  her recommendations were spot on.  \n\njeff and i split an order of <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> and a bleu cheese burger.  the burger had carmelized onions and bleu cheese.  they were in the right proportion for the burger.  i didn't eat my part of the bun, but i really enjoyed it.\nthe <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were terrible.  the waitress admitted that they were frozen.  i get that, but serving cold fried things is just gross. \n\ni also ordered a bowl of chili.  at first, i wasn't impressed.  i make a mean pot of chili.  but, the more i ate it, the more i liked it.  the little slice of cornbread that came with it was pretty good, too.  \n\nthe wait staff all wore really funny t-shirts.  if they had my size, i would have bought a few.  \n\ni want to go back for the late night breakfast special!", 
            "i came here last time i was in vegas, and i came back again cause it is that good!! i don't actually eat burgers lol, so my review is really focusing on the milk shakes.  i've had the <mark>Mother Fluffer</mark> both times i came now and it is so freaking delicious.  my husband had <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> milkshake and he loved it too.\n\ni had the caesar salad for actually food - it was good, nothing unbelievable.  my husband had <mark>The Classic</mark> burger and also said it was good but not the best ever.\n\nthe milk shakes are so good though, and so are the fries, so go for those and you will be happy!!",

            "burgers and shakes oh my!\n\ni had the lamb burger which tasted like a lamb shawerma which was delicious. also had <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> milkshake and that was awesome.  we started with the <mark>Waffle Bites</mark> which was a little over priced for the amount of food but it was wonderful.  everyone in my party was extremely happy with their meals.", 
            "highly overpriced but yum!  (will run you about $30/ person for burger/fries/shake) i always make a stop here when i'm in town.  there's a line so get there early.  <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> shake is money.  everything is largely portioned so be prepared to eat!\n\ncon: there is no gluten free bun option.  wtf?!  at $15+/ burger, come on guys.  get with it.", 
            "it was our first night at the mirage, we were super hungry after having both a delayed flight and delayed shuttle, and we were eager to use our $50 room credit. that said, this hit the spot for us. i got the blt burger with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> got the <mark>Kobe Slider Trio</mark> with <mark>Buffalo Fries</mark>. i learned a very important lesson here: always ask how big the burgers are, especially in vegas. at home, i'm used to medium sized \"big\" burgers and and expecting an average size every time, so i forgot that everything is bigger in vegas, literally. welp. my burger was so high that it would've required two mouth-lengths (for lack of a better term) to even bite into all at once. that's not to say that it wasn't good. it was delicious, just very intimidating and i couldn't even finish it all. and with the prices that were charged, i felt very badly for not finishing the whole burger. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were good (as always, i am a sweet potato fiend). i did not try my boyfriend's <mark>Kobe Slider Trio</mark> (in hindsight, i should've gone with that instead - much more manageable portions), but we did share the <mark>Buffalo Fries</mark> and omg! amazing, amazing, amazing! i am daydreaming about them right now. buffalo wing sauce, blue cheese dressing (mmm, mmm), and (i think) chopped green onions to top them off - just simply wonderful. i would and could make a meal out of just those. so, to recap - the food is great, the service was friendly and not overbearing, but the prices are a little shocking. luckily, we had our dining credit and paid the difference, so that took some of the sting out. i think we'd go back again, now that i know what their portion sizing is like and what their pricing is like.", 
            "this review is based on our visit tonight. the ceasar salad was wilted and the croutons were soggy and lacked flavor. we had to return <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> of chili, it was loaded with corn. we ate here in august and there was no corn in it. the food server said he would talk it off our bill, he did not offer to get us something else. i noticed another party was returning their burger. he had told the food server to make it well done, which it wasn't. we observed our food server tell the manager about our chili, but never did the manager come to our table to apologize. unacceptable! earlier in the afternoon we did have a shake to go. their shakes are yummy!  strawberry a little runny, chocolate rich and thick.",

            "went here as a recommendation to go to a place with great burgers, shakes, and service and fell quite short. \n\nthe good: the shakes were phenomenal. literally the best i've ever had which is saying quite a bit cause i've had them from many places. prices are $7-$9 i would go here just for the shakes and the <mark>Berry Me</mark> is out of this world.\n\nthe meh or ok: being a burger place in a beautiful hotel like the mirage, you expect great food especially for the price. however the burger fell somewhat short of that expectation. it was more towards the greasy side and literally had a pool sitting on the plate. note: not juicy as there is a difference between the two,  i tried my partners burger and it was outstanding. maybe i just made a bad choice or had a burger that had a bad day. would be enough to still make me come back and try another in hope for a better taste.\n\nthe horrible: having a career in hospitality and working in retail, hotel, and restaurant hospitality, the service here was disappointing, nonexistent, and surprisingly appalling. once seated it took a good 15 minutes to have a waiter come by and take our order (food and drinks) as we had plenty of time to figure out what we wanted. after waiting 30 minutes for the food to come out (which is ok) a different waiter brought our food out and walked away without even asking if we needed anything else. <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> of ketchup was empty and we couldn't find a waiter, so i had to go to another table and swap out bottles. our waiter showed up at the end of our meal asking if there was anything else he could get us and when we said no, he magically protruded a check already printed out. the service at a restaurant is very important to me and this experience was enough to not make me want to come back\n\nthe restaurant wasnt very busy so i feel like the dining experience should have been better. maybe we will try this place again in the future...or just stop by for a shake. .", 
            "i've been here three times on three separate vegas trips and this place never fails me! the burgers and fries are <mark>The Lunch Box</mark>! the price is pretty good for a vegas spot.... and the spiked milkshakes are delicious!"

            "ok, so i've been yelping my eats for almost a year now and have stayed away from posting myself but after blt, i simply had to start!\n\ni was on the strip yesterday and needed to grab lunch with a couple colleagues and we had heard that there was a new burger bar at the mirage and figured we would try.  all 3 of us prefer food to just about anything else so it was a leap of faith to go to a new place without yelping first (please hold the....serves you right comments)\n\nblt is a new boutique burger and shake restaurant at the mirage with an acclaimed chef, laurent tourondel. \n\nwe were seated pretty quickly but given a table toward the back of the restaurant by the kitchen so didn't really get a great feel for the d\\u00e9cor, but then again we came for the food. 3 hungry guys mid day for burgers and shakes, what could go wrong?\n\nthe waitress was attentive and helpful but based on some small talk; she is a bit disappointed in the crowd and mentioned the slow economy and hoped it would pick up.  after ordering drinks and burgers and some <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark>, we were all excited for the food. the shakes and soda took about 10 minutes but came and the shakes were decent. the <mark>Twinkie Boy</mark> was tasty but tasted like a vanilla shake with a touch of twinkie, wish i had gone with the pb&j shake that went by....that looked yummy.\n\nthe pickles came and wow! they were tasty; juicy, crispy and all around great when dipped in the spicy ranch dip. for $5, would have expected more than 8 pickles slices (about a half pickle total) but they were awesome which really helped my rating. \n\non to the main course.....our burgers and sides come and we are psyched. we made sure to get 3 different sides so we could experience them all... \n1)<mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>- greasy by any standard and way too much batter\n2)<mark>Waffle Fries</mark>- good but cold...must have been waiting for the burgers!\n3)<mark>Skinny Fries</mark>- hot, cooked perfectly, though a bit salty.\n\nnow the reason we came...the meat!\nburger 1- the kobe w/ swiss and grilled onions- not mine, but the headline from raf was \"pretty good but just a burger\"\n\nburger 2- <mark>The Classic</mark> w/ cheddar, bacon and their \"blt sauce\"- again...burger was fine, but the exact words paul uttered were.....\"would prefer a double-double from in-n-out\"\n\nburger 3-.....this was mine and the real reason for the post/rant\n\ni ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and their vermont cheddar.   now; my burger had been ordered medium so when it showed up with an \"mw\" toothpick in it, i began to get skeptical. it's a burger and since i don't think i have ever sent back a burger, i figure i will try it. one bite tells me that this thing is well done....gray all the way....the only red/pink i could find would be my ketchup....so, i showed the waitress and with her eyes she told me that \"it happens all the time and this place really sucks to work at!\" she took it back while my friends began their burgers and i snacked on the cold, salty, greasy fries. \n\nshe told me that they chef looked and said it was medium but would make me another.....was she kidding? not only did it have the wrong toothpick in it and no pink but this is customer service for a brand new place charging almost $20 for burger? whatever....\n\nso, everyone finished their burgers and mine shows up....boy did the chef show me.    how about some guesses for what toothpick held the bun together this time?????\n\nobviously, it wasn't the medium one i would have liked; it was mr, for their medium rare. i pointed it out as she served it and she shrugged.  so as i get ready to take a bite, i notice that it does have the grilled onions but also has raw red onions....really, if you order your onions grilled should you have to tell them to leave off the raw ones?\nwell, i can tell you that the toothpick with mr was wrong...should have said r, for raw, not for rare. no exaggeration here, it was still cold in the middle.  \n\nat this point, i clearly was done with this joint and had the manager come over. when she saw the burger, she actually agreed that it was undercooked for rare and not even close to medium and took it off the bill graciously. (they've been open for a month but she has already mastered the...\"i'm sorry, let me take this off the bill for you!\") again, this is the first time in 20 years of eating out at least 10 times a week that i refused to pay for something.   \n\nchances are \na)  this place has way too many issues to get it fixed quick enough\nb)  the waitress is probably already looking for a new job\nc)  the mananger seemed beaten in less than a month of being open. \nd)  the chef should thank the folks that acclaimed him in nyc and go back to the concepts that he must have found success in since this one will likely not cut it.\ne)   in a city with as many food choices as freaks, i can't imagine anyone eating at this place more than once.", 
            "the service and the burger were both five stars.\nthe sides and shakes really brought the place down.\n\ni ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> with bbq onion and vermont cheddar.  the onions were a sauteed mix of onions in bar-b-que sauce. it was so good. it was cooked perfectly to my request (i was warned they were cooked a bit under - so ordered medium well). really loved the burger.\n\nthe sides were such a disappointment. there were four of us and we ordered <mark>Fat Fries</mark> which were served cold and kind of mushy. the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> were warm and crisp, but nothing special.  my least favorite was the <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> that my group ordered.  they were doughy/breaded so thick and huge - but not breading. it was kind of sweet, like a donut. a pickle donut. so, sandwiched in the middle of this dough was a little hamburger-slice style of dill pickle. not my thing. at all. \n\nwent back at about midnight the next night to get shakes to go. was surprised to see the shake mix come out of a soft-serve style machine.  i got the <mark>Twinkie Boy</mark> which tastes exactly as it sounds - a twinkie all mixed up in a shake. it was average. i was on a sugar high for the rest of the night. probably won't do that again.", 
            "i had the salmon burger and it was okay.  my husband had the turkey burger and said it was one of the best he's ever had.  the fries were really good.  i wish they gave out samples or tasting cups of their shakes because the <mark>Twinkie Boy</mark> looked and sounded awesome but after having our filling meal of burgers there was no way we could eat more.  also, the krispie cream bread pudding sounded awesome.  next time i'm just going to try the shakes.", 
            "i stumbled across blt burger by accident a few months ago on a business trip to vegas, and was very happy that i did. \n\nthe menu offers a  lot of well prepared standards and some interesting takes on old favorites.  \n\nthe <mark>Lamb Tandoori</mark> burger was a nice choice, and the <mark>Twinkie Boy</mark> milkshake was delicious, though a little strange (it had blended twinkies added to the mixture). \n\ni'm pretty over lv anymore, but if/when i make it back, this will definitely be a stop.", 
            "can't say anything about the burgers here, but whenever we're in vegas we stop by for one of their awesome milkshakes. my favorites:\n\n<mark>Twinkie Boy</mark>: vanilla ice cream, milk, caramel syrup, 1 twinkie\n\n<mark>Malibu Barbie</mark>: malibu rum, coconut milk, vanilla ice cream, pineapple juice\n\nkind of on the pricey side -- $7 for the ones without booze, $11 for ones with <mark>The Lunch Box</mark>, but sooo worth it.",

            "hands-down, this is one of my favorite places to eat in vegas. i went with my girlfriend. we shared an order of fries, she had <mark>The Classic</mark> with american cheese, i had the \"blt\" with oregon cheddar, and we shared a straw<mark>Berry Me</mark>. \n\nthe shake was, by far, the best milkshake i have ever had. we got strawberry because it is my girlfriend's favorite, but they have many more interesting flavors, like <mark>Twinkie Boy</mark> (made with twinkies), campfire marshmallows (made with toasted marshmallows), <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> (made with peanut butter and jelly), or the nut jub (made with hazelnut ice cream and nutella). being in las vegas, they even have a section on their menu devoted specifically to spiked milkshakes! both of the burgers were a good size, big enough that i wasn't annoyed at the size, but small enough that i wasn'y amazed by it. my girlfriend's burger was very good, but not special because she didn't add anything to it. the \"blt\", on the other hand, was amazing. the double-smoked bacon was crisp, but not at all burnt or overdone, and the \"double-smoked\" flavor was fantastic. also, there was something special about the oregon cheddar and i enjoyed its flavor much more than other cheddars. i didn't notice until after i ordered, but they offer fried eggs as an optional topping. that really made this place for me, because fried eggs are awesome on burgers (if you haven't tried one on a burger, you are seriously missing out). i can't decide if i want to try the \"blt\" again, with chili, a fried egg, and oregon cheddar, or if i want to try the <mark>Buffalo Chicken</mark> burger next time. either way, i'm positive i won't be disappointed. to top it off, though, the fries were delicious. they were cooked to a slight crunch, but not over done, and the inside was light and fluffy. also, they didn't obliterate the fries with salt before bringing them out, allowing you to add the amount of salt you like, which was great for me because i hate salt on my fries.\n\nthe service here was good. we didn't have to wait very long for lunch and our server was friendly. she was very good at knowing what time to check on us and took good care of us. i especially liked that she didn't get annoyed when we needed a few extra minutes to decide what we wanted (like at the carnegie deli down the hall) and just came back in a few minutes, instead of checking every 30 seconds for the first 2 minutes and then ditching us for 20 minutes (which is what happened at carnegie)\n\nto all the complainers about the high price, this is vegas. yes, the price is high, but don't pretend like you didn't see it coming. everything on the strip is expensive. for the strip, i found this place reasonable, especially for the quality and size of the food, along with the service. if you don't like the prices, you picked the wrong place for your vacation and you should just go home so the rest of us don't have to wait.\n\nanyways, i'll definitely be back here next time i am on the strip. can't wait to try those shakes!", 
            "it was the middle of the night, around 1 a.m. to be exact, and we just got into vegas.  we had been walking around for a bit already and we were desperately looking for a place to have dinner.  yes, dinner at 1 a.m.  oh it felt like college for a moment.  we walked into the mirage and just saw this place and decided to eat at blt burger.  \n\nas far as the menu nothing really jumped at me, but the list of milkshakes caught my eye.  names from \"<mark>Twinkie Boy</mark>\" to \"<mark>The Lunch Box</mark>\", there were some clever names for their shakes that coincided with the ingredients of the shakes.  not a lot of places have a big choice of shakes.   \n\ni ended up ordering the combo, which included <mark>The Classic</mark> burger combo with chili.  the combo came with choice fries and choice of milkshake; i got the \"<mark>Nut Job</mark>\".  the milkshake with the silly name had hazelnut ice cream, nutella! and \"slivered\" pieces of almonds.  nutella in a shake is actually a good idea, and it ended up the best part of my meal.  \n\nto be fair the portions were to be expected and i enjoyed the food that night.  as i really liked this place a lot at first, reflecting back i think i was just really hungry.  the burgers were good, but not spectacular and a bit overpriced as well.  i'll give this place credit for their shakes, but the burgers itself could be better.",

            "i don't know why everyone is being a dick to this place when rating it. maybe, when they write a review, they start cackling over some sort of fucking power trip by giving this place low stars and making everybody on yelp look at it. \n\nwhat an asshole.\n\nbecause everything that they said about this place, \"rude service\", \"undercooked or low quality food\", \"burnt fries\", are a whole load of bullshit. \n\nthis place is great. i have been here about 6 times so far, tonight being my 7th and i love their service and the items on their menu.\n\ntake for example, the \"<mark>Twinkie Boy</mark> shake\". somehow, and i don't know how, they managed to blend the white part of the twinkles with a vanilla ice cream milkshake, and then overstuffed the cup with whipped cream and left a half of a twinkie sitting on the top. it tastes and looks so delicious that it reminds me of the hash house agogo's cappuccinos, drizzled with mocha sauce and melted marshmallows. it is so overloaded with twinkie creamy awesomeness, that bits of the cream starts dripping over the side of the glass if you don't drink it fast enough. \n\nand you can use it to cover up the \"blue cheese breath\" if you order one of their nommy burgers. tastes good, and makes your breath smell sugary and sweet for your date. \n\nthe waitresses and waiters in every one of our visits are talkative and friendly. they know what they are working and busting their ass for, our tips. so maybe it isn't their \"rude service\", its that you are a narcissistic douche that wants to find flaws in everything. \n\ni hate butthurt reviewers. \n\nthe only gripe i have against this place is that the bill adds up pretty fast. burgers are about $10-15 bucks, but if you order a coke, beer, or shake that bill goes up to $22 a person. don't forget, those \"spiked shakes\" with alcohol inside run for about $12 a piece.", 
            "really good burger! we shared a blt burger (bacon, lettuce, and tomato with a blt special sauce) and an interstate 80 burger (peppered bacon, caramelized onions, and a tangy sweet bbq sauce). i would recommend the blt. the burger itself is so flavorful, sauces just cover up the great flavor. \n\nalso, do not order this burger done over medium. if i could have it to do over, i would order the burger medium rare. it is really flavorful meat and would be really good cooked on the rarer side.\n\nwe added fries (sweet potato and <mark>Curly Fries</mark>) and a milkshake (<mark>Twinkie Boy</mark>) to the burger. both fries were good...not great. the shake had a nice, caramelly flavor, but was extremely sweet.\n\nso, a great place for a great burger!"

            "eh.\n\ni think i had higher expectations for this place. you would think that a restaurant that serves booze milkshakes would get 5 stars right off the bat, right? wrong.\n\nwell, i came here during the week in the early afternoon. there was no issue finding seating at the bar. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Shaft's Blue</mark> burger (blue cheese, caramelized onions, mushrooms) and the <mark>Night Rider</mark> boozeshake (kahlua, chocolate liqueur, oreo cookies, chocolate ice cream). for dessert, the \"krispy kreme\" doughnut bread pudding with rum raisin ice cream. \n\nthe burger was good. not great, but good. <mark>The Lunch Box</mark> shake was good too. definitely got a little buzzed from it. the krispy kreme bread pudding was disgusting. it was just sugary and gross. i'm surprised i didn't get diabetes after eating a few spoonfuls of it. \n\noverall, can't say i was impressed with this place. i would pass.", 
            "one of the reasons why i wanted to come here was not because of the burgers, but because of their milkshakes. there were a lot of different types of milkshakes to choose from, but out of all i decided to try one of their spiked <mark>Night Rider</mark> that had kahlua and chocolate liqueur. as for the meal i ordered their <mark>BBQ Nachos</mark> because they sound good. \n\n   the milkshake was great! it came in a tall glass topped with whipped cream and some malted chocolate balls. it was extremely heavy, a little too sweet, but could have added a little bit more chocolate. since it was heavy i ended up not finishing my nachos, but it didn't matter anyways because the nachos weren't so great. \n\n  <mark>BBQ Nachos</mark> came with shredded pork. the shredded pork was dry, it was all bundled up below the chips and cheese. as a result it made it hard to scoop it up with tortilla chips, so i ended up using my fork. after using my fork the shredded pork was still tangled, so i used a knife to cut it up. no it was so difficult to cut it so i ended up using my fingers. the bbq sauce however was very flavourful, tangy and reallly spicy. \n\n  waitress was very nice, she took our orders in the nick of time. however afterwards the service just got slower and just when we received our drinks, the food came. i was having a peaceful time enjoying my food, etc until this crazy obnoxious \"monkey\" man sitting behind me sorta moving around on his booth, slapping/banging the table a few times, and yelling random things like \"weeeeeeeeeeeeooooooww\". ya so to the monkey man in the red shirt sitting behind me, thanks a lot for the dining experience!", 
            "blt burger is such a great restaurant, my boyfriend and i ate there twice in our five-day vacation in vegas!  it is located in the mirage, and i am sure we will be back!\n\ni was glad our server recommended the patty melt burger from their daily special menu... it was a burger beef patty with apple wood smoked bacon, swiss cheese melted perfectly, their blt sauce, all between two pieces of thick cut rye bread.  and i just love a burger place that asks me how i would like my burger, to which i responded medium, and that is exactly what the server recommended.\n\nit was a perfect, melty, juicy burger.  i am confident everything on their menu has to be fantastic.  my boyfriend had the original burger, and enjoyed his.  we shared a hard milkshake which was amazing. it was called the \"<mark>Night Rider</mark>,\" chocolate milkshake with oreo cookie crumbles and kaluha.  the shake alone was so amazing that i came back the next day and ordered one to-go from their convenient to-go counter.  although i think you get more of the shake if you dine-in, i thoroughly appreciated the portability.\n\nthe other occasion we came to <mark>BLT</mark>, i ordered a wagyu beef burger... it was like eating a steak it was so good.  i ordered it with cheddar cheese and it was wonderful.  \n\nthey also offer <mark>Deep Fried Oreos</mark> on the menu... didn't get a chance to try them! i also like the clever saying on the waiters'/waitresses' shirts that said \"tip waiters not cows.\"  great service and awesome food.", 
            "first thing we ate in vegas after checking in to the venetian across the street. \n\nambiance - 4 stars: we liked the decor. cool edison style light bulbs, wood ceiling, and the kitchen area behind the bar was pretty cool as well. \n\nservice - 4 stars: it's a burger place, so nothing over the top to be expected. service was on par, waitress wasn't overly pesky nor was she invisible. \n\nfood - 4 stars: i ordered the blt burger w/ american cheese and the <mark>Fat Fries</mark> with a <mark>Night Rider</mark> milkshake. the milkshake came out first, and i almost wish this is all i had! it was super delicious. the burger was quite good as well, not the best i've ever had but definitely top 5. i wasn't a huge fan of the <mark>Fat Fries</mark>, but got them by recommendation from the waitress. fiance had the i-80 burger, <mark>Curly Fries</mark>, and tucan shake. these were all super delicious, and she really enjoyed it. \n\na bit expensive, but as we later found out - all the food is inflated quite a bit. i was sort of shocked when the cost of a burger and fries was around 20 bucks, not including the milkshake. our bill was around $80 for two, which is a large amount for 2 burgers. \n\nif you're looking for something better than the food court for lunch, i would certainly recommend blt burger.", 
            "if you decide to stop at blt burger for any one thing, it should be their spiked shakes.  they are delicious and dangerous!  \n\nwe were here for fourth meal around 11 pm during the middle of the week.  we originally wanted to go to california pizza kitchen which is next door, but they were closed.  there were four of us, and although we probably thought we were awesome, i'm sure we were obnoxious.  so kudos to our waiter for being friendly, attentive and for putting up with our awesome jokes.   \n\nwe ordered waters and shared the <mark>Night Rider</mark> spiked shake.  it's a magical concoction of kahlua, chocolate liqueur, oreos and chocolate ice cream.  you could easily have a sugar overload on it, so i'm glad we all shared it.  we also ordered their <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> as an appetizer and they were delicious.  i'm used to <mark>Fried Dill Pickles</mark> just having a slight breading on them, but they were almost fluffy with the breading and were very tasty.  i ordered the american wagyu burger (portabello, spinach and truffle aioli) with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. the burger was cooked perfectly, but just underwhelming compared to the pickles, fries and shake.   i ended up taking the toppings off and just eating the bun and patty.  the others ordered breakfast sandwiches and the kobe beef sliders which they all enjoyed.  i think our bill came to just over $100 for four people which isn't too bad for vegas.  \n\nthey weren't too busy that late, so we had pretty good seats close to the bar and it wasn't loud at all (well, except for us).", 
            "the food = awesome. the service = not so much. i got the interstate 80 burger, which was huge. i could only eat half of it. i also got a <mark>Night Rider</mark> spiked shake, which was amazing. our waiter was attentive at first, but then began to flirt with the girl at the to-go counter and forgot all about us. i'd go back, but only if i could have a different waiter."

            "after visiting downtown vegas and the outlet mall, it was 2:00 pm and we needed to grab a quick lunch.  we stumbled upon blt burger and were happy to find that 1) there was no wait for a table and 2) that they had the nfl playoffs shown on tv's throughout the restaurant!\n\nthe menu is basically just a bunch of unique burgers, wings, sides and milkshakes.  my mom and i decided to share the lamb burger, which was topped with tzatki sauce and fresh fixings.  it was cooked perfectly, nice and pink in the middle, and was a fun spin.  my dad tried the <mark>Kobe Slider Trio</mark>; he ordered them medium rare and they were practically mooing still!  he thought that they were the best sliders he had ever had, and they really do cook to order!\n\nwe also tried the <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>, and the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> (yummy), but our favorite part had to be the <mark>Malibu Barbie</mark> milkshake!  it was under the \"spiked\" milkeshake section and had malibu rum in it....yummy!\n\nnext time i am in vegas looking for a mid-priced meal (burgers were around $12 with no side), i will go back to blt burger for sure.\n\nfunny side note, after we ate, my mom and my sister went to go and  see the white tigers....only to find out, the restaurant is now located where the white tigers used to be kept!  they moved them into the dolphin habitat and now you have to pay to go and see them...boo!", 
            "can't say anything about the burgers here, but whenever we're in vegas we stop by for one of their awesome milkshakes. my favorites:\n\n<mark>Twinkie Boy</mark>: vanilla ice cream, milk, caramel syrup, 1 twinkie\n\n<mark>Malibu Barbie</mark>: malibu rum, coconut milk, vanilla ice cream, pineapple juice\n\nkind of on the pricey side -- $7 for the ones without booze, $11 for ones with <mark>The Lunch Box</mark>, but sooo worth it.", 
            "i was in the mood for a gourmet burger during my last trip to vegas and having such a positive experience at the burger bar in mandalay, i wanted a repeat performance.  perusing the restaurants list (which changes constantly in this town like the hotels) i noticed a listing for a place at the mirage with the familiar acronym 'blt'.  having tried the  bistro laurent tourondel steak place in hollywood back home, i was intrigued enough and seeing the number of positive yelp reviews i convinced my friends this would be our lunch spot sometime before the end of the weekend.\n\nso to cap off our sunday lunch we made our way to the mirage resort to find a nice open air, indoor burger joint with hip club lighting, decor and audible but not overly loud r&b and hiphop music playing over the speakers.  our waitress was friendly and cheerful and service was nice and fairly quick.  all of us ordered different burgers, me going for the <mark>Lamb Tandoori</mark> which i ordered med rare.  my friends ordered a couple different more traditional beef burgers which i can't remember but all of them were cooked really well, fat, juicy with some of the best <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> on the side that i've ever had.  even fo's fries back home in la weren't as crispy and well seasoned as these and honestly i'm not a big fan of the 'sweet potato' taste and these were much more subtle and almost tasted like regular potatos with a hint of the sweetness making them stand out.\n\nalcoholic milkshakes also made their way around the table, my friend ordered a kahluha oreo cookie mudslide and i got the <mark>Malibu Barbie</mark> which i found a better choice than the heavier chocolate rich drink.  almost like drinking a pina colada ice cream sundae in a glass it was the perfect way to finish off a great lunch and a fun weekend.  \n\ni suspect i will be coming back here some day especially given they run til 2 am, making them a quality late night food haven after clubbing or taking a break between venues.", 
            "i keep coming here and keep wanting to love it, but it is just not happening. the best things at blt burger are actually not the burgers (especially for the price).\n\nnow, don't get me wrong, the burgers are solid. in fact, if quality burgers aren't a regular thing for you, this place may blow your mind. but alas, the burgers just aren't as juicy and flavorful as other burger places in town. \n\nthere are a lot of burger options to choose from, though, including lamb, vegetarian, etc. - so there are legitimately more options here than other burger places.\n\neverything else on the menu has been great (<mark>Waffle Fries</mark>, <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, chili, etc.). the two best things about blt burger are the jalapeno poppers and adult milkshakes.\n\nthe jalapeno poppers are long and thick. they deliver a powerful punch of spicy and come with a spicy salsa-type dipping sauce to dip them in (double spicy!).\n\nthe adult milkshakes are an absolute must (a.k.a. milkshakes with alcohol). i have repeatedly taken tourists here just for the milkshakes. i personally recommend the <mark>Malibu Barbie</mark> (coconut fruity goodness). the milkshakes are tall and thick and so deliciously yummy. beware, though, the shakes are incredibly filling. \n\nthe atmosphere is well-suited for a burger place. it's on the smaller side and open. it's casual, but burger-chic.", 
            "i have been here a bunch of times and each time the service is great and the food/drinks are even better. my last time in vegas i went twice and my only complaint is that it is a little steep, but i wouldn't expect anything different for a place in vegas.\n\nthis time while eating there i decided to be a little different and get the <mark>California Chicken</mark> and it was so good that i got it the second time i went there. one of the best parts of eating here are the adult milkshakes! i got <mark>Fuzzy the Bear</mark> and <mark>Malibu Barbie</mark>, which were two different choices for me as well (i usually get the all-nighter, which is awesome) but they were both delicious and will definitely find their way into my rotation.\n\nthis place will definitely remind on my must stop at while i'm in vegas!\n\noh yeah and i almost forgot i love their pickles. i cannot find another pickle like theirs anywhere and i just want to buy a jar and bring it back home!", 
            "the burgers and milk shakes are amazing. my favorite shake is <mark>Malibu Barbie</mark>. but if you are looking for beer orange sorbet with bluemoon is the way to go."

            "so i finally read a review/article by the lvrj food critic that interests me - sliders !! so i decide to go on a vegas slider pilgrimage and hit up most of the places mentioned in her article.  1st stop blt burger.\n\nso here we go, another high end burger place ( and if the rumors are true that trump's restaurant, djt, is converted to a burger place, i just might drive by and egg his building !!  how many of these places do we need !! )\n\nso back to sliders, hit blt on a weekday ( forget which one ! ) sit at the bar - nice place, the usual - pretty people servers / bartenders.  i get the sliders, <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark>, a chocolate shake and a <mark>New Belgium Brewery Fat Tire</mark> ale - how's that for a combo ?!?!?!  minus a star because they don't serve malts !!  come on !!! shakes but no malts - that's just wrong !!  the shake comes with a chocolate whip cream - i liked that !   the <mark>Vidalia Onion Rings</mark> - not very hot, as in temperature - kinda boring.  the sliders - tasty - 3 different types, one has a blue cheese topping, the next has a bbq topping, the last one has bacon.  all had a nice pinkish hue but one thing missing  - juice.  i find this to be true with kobe anything - it's tender, flavorful, but i want some juice dribbling on my hands and chin - nope !!\n\ni give the nod to the blue cheese slider.  actually, the <mark>New Belgium Brewery Fat Tire</mark> gets the nod !\n\nthe sliders cost - $18?  $16?  something like that ! total cost $43 - it ain't a cheap meal !"
