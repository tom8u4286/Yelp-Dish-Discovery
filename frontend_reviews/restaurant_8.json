            "located in the venetian's venezia hall, bouchon is a great restaurant tucked away from the glitz and cheesiness of the strip with amazing food. \n\nwe sat on the patio which overlooked the pool area. the patio had a nice cozy atmosphere and seemed quieter than inside (which was noisy from all the bustling). the epi bread is freshly baked and their butter is amazing. the butter tasted to so fresh and light that i wanted to eat it plain.\n\n\nwe ordered a few cocktails, the moscow mule and i can't remember the second (wasn't that good). the moscow mule is a must have! gingery and fresh, i could have had my bf's whole mug - and yes, the drink is really served in a mug. so cute!\n\nwe started with the pork belly special served with barley and sauteed veggies. holy moly. the pork belly was soooo melt-in-your-mouth tender and tasty. the veggies were cooked perfectly (loved the brussell sprouts) and the barley added a nice texture contrast to the dish. we also had a <mark>Mixed Greens Salad</mark> with goat cheese which was nothing special, not good, not bad.\n\nthe bf had the croque madame. crap that thing was so buttery and creamy, it was like a pillow of heaven. the egg was perfectly cooked, the bechamel was killer and not oily, and the brioche was so buttery that i wanted to take it home with me. the croque madame was served with fries and they were skinny and crispy, but a bit too salty. i ordered the flat iron steak with spinach and garlic. the steak was so tender; i couldn't believe a flat iron steak could be so tender! the spinach and garlic were drenched in oil/butter so i didn't care for it much.\n\nfor dessert, we had the bouchons, which were brownies and ice cream. nothing special. i wish they had better dessert!!!\n\ngreat dining experience, casual and elegant setting, good service, and deelish food. now if only they could fine tune their food skills and offer better desserts. not on your way to vegas? not to worry, bouchon is coming to beverly hills next month!", 
            "every single time i have visited las vegas for business or pleasure, probably 10 times in the past 3 years, bouchon is on my list of \"must visit no matter what\" places. in fact, i enjoy the casual yet upscale atmosphere of this brasserie (and the original in yountville, ca which fairly makes my heart sing) so much that i would venture to say that my last meal on earth might very well occur at bouchon if i have a choice in the matter!\n\noften i travel alone for business, and this restaurant has a fantastic old school marble topped bar which is beautifully conducive to dining solo and enjoying the people watching and friendly banter of the bartenders as i slurp decadent perfectly seasoned and piping hot french onion soup crowned with gooey melted gruyere cheese along side a <mark>Mixed Greens Salad</mark> with a simple vinaigrette and a round of toasted goat cheese. simple, yes, but perfectly executed. the epis bread, baked in house, is a delightful accompaniment as it has a shatteringly crisp crust but a soft, chewy, warm interior.\n\nwhen i have dined with colleagues or a date, i usually order steak frites as my entree and it comes slathered (just a tiny bit too heavily slathered, honestly) with a shallot and garlic studded red wine butter sauce. mmmmmmmmm.... so delicious though!\n\nthe \"bouchons\"  for dessert are the best choice: little cork shaped chocolate cakes served with housemade fresh mint chocolate chip ice cream last time i had them. a refreshing way to end the meal!\n\ncocktails are professionally crafted and there is a well chosen wine list featuring a variety of price points.  they are also known for their shellfish \"fruits de mer\" towers and breakfast is not only excellent, but a surprising value too. no lunch is served, however, so be sure to get up early enough, even after a late night of gambling, to make it to the delicious breakfast!", 
            "i've always heard great things about bouchon and since i'd been to mon ami gabi the last time i was in vegas, i thought i'd try bouchon this time. i have to say that everything our group had was just amazing! we ordered their petite seafood platter for the guys - the oysters were so good we ended up ordering another dozen. they were small - just the way i like them (i think raw oysters taste better when they're young) and fresh omg delicious! i just ordered the pate and the <mark>Mixed Greens Salad</mark> for dinner but i thoroughly enjoyed every bit of both. everyone at our table loved the food (we ordered everything from fish, scallops, pork belly, and even gnocchi) everything was top notch. as is the tradition with all french restaurants, it took a while to get our food, but we took our time and enjoyed our meal. i have to say that their service is amazing too. while waiting for the rest of our party, the girls and i were sitting in the waiting area and one of the servers offered us drinks - when i told him my stomach wasn't feeling well, he brought me an orange concoction that made me feel so much better! it really meant a lot to me that he went out of his way to make me feel better so that i could enjoy my meal and the rest of our fun-filled evening. i would absolutely recommend bouchon to anyone that wants to enjoy a nice and delicious dinner. now i'll have to try the bouchon here in santa barbara!", 
            "i recently had the pleasure of spending a great weekend in vegas, and my visit to bouchon was a highlight.  i've eaten at quite a few high end restaurants, but bouchon stands out as having some of the tastiest food i've ever eaten.  we had a reservation for six people and were seated within minutes of arrival.\n\nwe started the meal out with cocktails -- if you haven't maxed out on free casino drinks, i would definitely recommend ordering one here, as they have exceptional bartenders.  i had a sazerac on the recommendation of the waiter, and was very pleased.  we also ordered the foie gras appetizer, which was amazing.  it was incredibly creamy, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness, and the portion was very generous: it comes in a five oz glass jar, and even with six gluttons eating it, it was more than enough.  a must-order if you have four or more members of your party (and surprisingly thrifty!).  we also split a small order of gnocci, which is not your typical italian potato dumpling. this gnocci was flour-based, and fried in butter.  it was incredibly rich, so i definitely would advise against ordering it as a main dish; however, as an appetizer it was nice to try.\n\ni split a <mark>Mixed Greens Salad</mark> with my boyfriend, and this was the only low point in the meal.  by the way, the waiter did the sneaky business of asking \"and what salad would you like with that?\" as you ordered your entree, making you feel semi-awkward if you didn't order one.  i would definitely skip the salads: at around $10 a pop, they are not very tasty.  our <mark>Mixed Greens Salad</mark> had a very very sour vinaigrette that made eating the dish rather unpleasant.  the accompanying medallion of goat cheese was so-so, and was too overpowering.  other people at our table ordered the beet salad which was very pretty, but lacking in flavor.\n\nhowever, the main course more than made up for the subpar salads.  i ordered the lamb, and it was incredibly tender and flavorful.  it came on a bed of peas and mini tokyo turnips, which were not only cute but delicious.  the lamb was quite gamey, but since i'm a fan of that, it didn't bother me.  after finishing our entrees, we were far too full to think of dessert -- but if i ever came back here again, i would skip the salad and get a dessert instead.\n\noverall, the total bill came to about $70 a person (one cocktail, split small gnocci and foie gras 6 ways, half a salad, one entree, plus tax and tip). despite the salad being only okay, i left very satisfied with the food, the service, and the restaurant in general.  i would absolutely recommend this place as a splurge during your next vegas adventure!", 
            "i am the biggest fan of bouchon bakery. their food is high-quality, unique, and very decadent. however, when dining at the bouchon restaurant at venetian, i was disappointed in my meal and will not be returning.\n\nthe staff was nice, as expected at a higher-end brunch spot. however, the food is incredibly sub-par. my party ordered: \n-cobb salad: completely ordinary; the chicken was fairly dry, the dressing was very standard, as if out of a bottle; the avocado was extremely limited, and the portion was quite far from generous (even for a higher-end restaurant)\n-<mark>Mixed Greens Salad</mark>: once again ordinary\n-<mark>Fruit Salad</mark>: fresh fruit, can't go wrong!\n\nunfortunately, the food did not spark my interest at all. and despite the polite staff, their menu was below expectations."

            "my biggest problem with vegas restaurants, well specifically those on the strip, is execution. i'm simply tired of overpriced and poorly executed celebrity chef restaurants that look dressed up and ready for the prom, but deliver a night at home in front of the playstation. \n\nthere are however a few exceptions that consistently bring it because they focus on the basics. now before all you vegas snobs get your underwear in a knot; i base my vegas dining on what i know, what's recommended and what i read. i'm willing to branch out and try new places, but i can't justify spending $400 on a 16 course degustation menu at joel robuchon on current budget.\n\nwith that said, i was fortunate enough to be staying at the venetian during my last trip and upon arrival, immediately dumped my bags and headed downstairs to bouchon for a seat at the bar. bouchon is the vision of world-renowned chef thomas keller of napa's french laundry fame. fashioned after the original bouchons of lyon after which it was modeled, bouchon just delivers great rustic bistro classics with only the best seasonal ingredients. the food, which i will get to in a minute, is awesome, but the bread and butter. holy bleep. i wanted to curl up in bed with it - so good. my app featured pork belly sausage with anise, new crop <mark>Potato Salad</mark>, medjool dates & roasted shallot vinaigrette. dinner was roasted leg of lamb with a ragout of coco beans, piquillo peppers, merguez sausage and lamb jus. everything was spot on and i washed it all down with several glasses of hall 05' cab. \n\nbasically bouchon was so good, i ended up there for breakfast the next three days in a row. it won best breakfast in las vegas for a reason. breakfast eats included: corned beef hash with two eggs over medium and brioche toast; white sausage with scrambled eggs, croissant and beurre noisette; and a spinach and bacon quiche. and the aforementioned bread and butter was also taken down at breakfast with crazy good in-house cherry preserves. \n\nbouchon is about as good as vegas dining gets. big fan. will go back again and again when in town.", 
            "dinner:\n\nmoelle rotie  *\nmy first time trying roasted bone marrow and i loved it!  i had no idea there was so much flavor in the marrow of bone.\n\nsalade de pommes de terre  *\nthis was <mark>Potato Salad</mark> but pumped up a notch.  it was good but what really made this was the egg yolk on top.\n\nescargot a la bourguignonne  *\nso buttery & delicious and topped with a super light, fluffy, puff pastry\n\nconfit de canard  *\nthe duck leg confit was so delicious and flavorful and the lentils were the best lentils i've ever tasted!\n\nconfit d'esturgeon\nthis was a bit of a disappointment.  after starting off with 4 great starters, this dish was a just okay.\n\nbouchon\nchocolate brownies shaped like corks but better than ordinary brownies.  as you would expect from a restaurant known for it's pastries, these were the perfect balance between rich, chewy goodness but not too chewy with a bit of that crunchy edge that everyone loves.  these are a must!\n\ni can't recall the name of the other dessert we ordered.  perhaps it's because i could have easily forgotten this dessert.  it was described as almost like a fancy pop tart.  i guess that should have been a clue but i expected more.\n\ni was also disappointed that they didn't have beignets on the menu for dessert but returned the following morning to get my beignet fix.\n\nbreakfast:\n\nbeignets  *\nfantastic!!  we were lucky enough to get a special treat!  after meeting the pastry chef, after our delicious dinner, we got a special order of beignets.  three types, filled with chocolate, raspberry and a delicious vanilla custard.  the vanilla one's were my favorite but all were oh so delicious!\n\ncorned beef hash\nthis was surprisingly disappointing.  it was mostly corned beef and very little potato.  i prefer my corned beef and potato bits to have more crispy edges.  i also asked for my eggs to be 'sunny side up' but they were more 'over medium'.  my yolk did not ooze out over my corned beef, the way i like it to.\n\nmoules au safran et a la moutarde  *\nthis was so delicious!  better than the mussels i experienced in brussels but then i think i somehow managed to find the worst place to have them when i was in belgium.  anyways, these were so buttery, garlicky and tasty!!  we hardly touched the fries, although they were thin, crispy and perfectly fried.  the rest of the food was just too good to fill up on fries.\n\nsummary:\ni put a star next to each of the items i had that i would recommend.   :)", 
            "i've waited a little while before reviewing bouchon because i have often been critical of restaurant reviews from people who just don't dig the particular style of cuisine. do you rate according to the experience, or whether or not the food was exactly your cup of tea?\n\nthe wife and i have wanted to try some celebrity chef places before we leave vegas for good and bouchon, being one that is willing too look the other way on.... well, let's just say we put the \"casual\" in \"business casual\" and they seemed like an option for us.\n\ni'll get this right out there and say that i am generally not a huge fan of french cuisine. with the exception of the marvelous concoctions served up by olivier at his baguette cafe (hi olivier!), which routinely blows my socks off, and many wonderful encounters with crusty bread across the globe, the flavour profiles just don't do it for me very often. bouchon was up against it from the beginning.\n\ni ordered a new <mark>Potato Salad</mark> with egg confit, the steak bouchon with a black truffle demiglace, and a chocolate marquise for dessert. all were good on various levels. the salad was fascinating and i was surprised how much i liked the way the raw egg yolk that crowned the whole affair oozed all over the dish. \n\nsteak was cooked to perfection and tasted good, but of course i just wasn't that into the glaze. i'm not one of those philistines who smothers steaks in gloopy brown sauce from a bottle; however, i'd have preferred my steak unadorned or in a nice peppercorn sauce. mushrooms and fungi, it turns out, don't just turn me off because of their texture -- the taste plays a part too. as i alluded to in my intro, this is personal taste preference rather than having anything to do with the quality of the dish.\n\nthe desert was suitably chocolatey and tasty, nothing i'd go running out again and again for, but pleasant and a nice way to round off an elegant meal.\n\noverall, the meal was tasty. the experience was amazing. so why only four stars? well, it was nearly $200 for the pair of us without any alcohol and i find that i'd prefer to be spending that money on a week's worth of panini and <mark>8' Chocolate Tart</mark> from around the corner at the baguette cafe. \n\nbouchon was an experience that i am pleased to have had and i would recommend it to friends, but it's not calling me back.", 
            "this place is great. i wrote a blog post on my experience here. if you're truly interested, you can go read it...\n\nbut in a nutshell, this place is a must for breakfast, lunch or dinner! we gluttons hit up this place for dinner and breakfast! lol!\n\nhttp://mintyfoodfanpage.wordpress.com/2012/07/01/poppin-the-bouchon-cork-on-a-popular-bistro/\n\nhighly recommend: \n\nbreakfast: \n* moules-frites (for breffas???? yessssss doooo it! you won't regret it!).\n* beignets...or as my friend and i call them, beign-yays!!!!\n\ndinner:\n* bone marrow (dude...like, is best! is best.)\n* escargot!\n* <mark>Potato Salad</mark> (really? yes really....)\n\nwould i come back? oh my my, oh hell yes... ;)"

            "overall, i wasn't too impressed, but it's a little hard to place exactly why. \n\nwe came with a fairly large party of 8. i never quite felt comfortable, as the environment was so claustrophobic, crowded, cluttered, and loud. i guess for a classy restaurant i expect something more peaceful and less raucous. our server was good, but he was pretty over the top and fancied himself quite the comedian. \n\ni ordered appetizers for the entire table, and this was the best part of the meal, in my opinion. we got 2 orders of salmon rillettes, 2 orders of blt (sous-vide), a charcuterie plate, and 2 dozen mussels. the salmon rillettes was incredible, the blt was good but a little underwhelming considering the sous-vide hype, the mussels were boring (i just had better mussels the past 2 nights in a row at casual restaurants here in long beach), and the charcuterie plate was a joke, with only a couple of slices of meat that might as well have come out of a bag at trader joe's. anyway, the salmon rillettes were so good that overall things were still going well at this point, and our server suggested a bottle of chardonnay that actually worked with the food (i'm always skeptical of a chardonnay suggestion, but this wasn't bad). \n\nperhaps where i went wrong was with my choice of entree. everyone who likes this place raves about the steak frites and moules frites. that just sounded so dull, though, compared to venison. alas, the venison was nothing special. i had a bit of everyone's food, including striped sea bass, rack of lamb, steak frites, and trout, and while everything was good, nothing really stood out. \n\nwith all this we went through a bottle of burgandy and a bottle of bordeaux, and i do appreciate that proper attention was paid to the wine and the correct glassware, etc. (you'd think that would be expected, but i've been to plenty of very expensive restaurants where you have to beg for the right glass, if they even have it.)\n\nunfortunately at this point, the bride-to-be had a bit of digestion malfunction. at first we thought she might be choking and so the manager came over and everyone was very concerned. she turned out ok, but to make up for it, the server brought out a round of complimentary desserts. they were pretty outstanding: <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark>, pistachio pot cremes, creme brulee and cookies. looking back, i do really appreciate how well they took care of us in the circumstances. \n\nwe topped it all off with a round of drinks, and vince got a very nice side-by-side port tasting. hell, if you're going to go to a place like this, i say go all out. the wine and drinks alone cost as much as a month's rent, let alone the food. but hey, it's not every day your brother gets married. \n\nso, overall, while there were some things that were excellent, the entire experience was just ok, nothing that made me go wow.", 
            "i enjoyed dinner here with my girlfriends as the capstone to our weekend in vegas.  i was delighted with the entire experience.  our server was clearly attached but was receptive to flirting and joking.  he was also a fantastic salesman...sous vide short ribs?  yes, please!  (holy cow, btw, it was so good with fresh baby corn and shiitake mushrooms and a sauce that i could barely restrain myself from licking the plate...) the look and feel is authentic bistro, yet just having come back from paris, this place could stand up among the best there easily.  \n\ndessert was probably the best part.  we shared a sourdough waffle that was accompanied by cherry compote, hazelnut ice cream, nutella (or a reasonable facsimile thereof), and vanilla bean whipped cream.  apparently said waffle is a regular breakfast item.  i wanted to come back the next morning. the second choice (because four people clearly demands two desserts, no?) was <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark> (really, a perfectly fudgy brownie thing) with vanilla ice cream.  freaking amazing.  \n\ni was honestly a tad wary of trying to eat at any celeb chef joint in vegas, but because thomas keller won't put his name on just any business proposition that comes along, i figured bouchon was a good bet.  and, oh my, it was.  it's pricey, but still in line with practically every other nice place on the strip. i wanna go back!!", 
            "holy shiz, that was a lot of food.  as a friend of thomas' we were treated to a fantastic assault of food.  this place has a very similar feel to bouchon in yountville but a much larger layout and a little busier feeling due to the number of tables.  our waiter was \"jewish paul\" as opposed to \"spanish paul\" the sommelier.  paul was a very cool cat with a lot of personality who made sure the dining experience was fun and entertaining.  we started out with a tower of chilled shellfish from the raw bar.  5 different types of oysters, a dozen clams, a half dozen mussels, a split lobster, and a split crab.  what a way to start.  next was a pumpkin soup (it might have been butternut squash, hope i got it right) done very nicely and topped with a meringue.  then a myriad of appetizers, the charcuterie platter, smoked salmon rillettes (my favorite), and haricorts-verts.  for my entree i had the sous-vide wagyu skirt steak with apple-parsnip puree.  a pretty good dish, i had hoped the skirt steak would have been butter-tender from the sous-vide but it had been seared aftewards which gave it a nice crust (not a bad thing but different from what i had expected).  the apple-parsnip puree was wonderfully smooth, sweet, and balanced the meat nicely.  for dessert paul brought us everything on the menu and a little more.  7 desserts all together, i think.  a creme brulee, flan, the signature <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark> with ice cream, <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>, coffee pot-de-creme, chocolate pot-de-creme, and ice cream filled profiteroles.  we also had a champagne to start and 3 wines paired with our courses.\n\nprice breakdown:  bouchon can be tough to gauge depending on your appetite and food selection.  you can start with the seafood tower like we did for $100 or have foie gras and caviar which will run you the same or more just to start your meal.  or you can opt for the less expensive dishes like the charcuterie platter or salmon rillettes which are closer to $15-20.  entrees go from $20-40, desserts are roughly $9 each.  closed for lunch on the weekdays, maybe open on weekends?  breakfast is also served here every day, though i'm not sure how much that is.  anyhow, a light meal might run $25 per person while an extravagant one like ours might be closer to $100-150 each.  on average i'd feel comfortable bringing $100 for two people which should cover an appetizer, two entrees, dessert, and wine.", 
            "perfection.\nlooks very pretentious... but could not be further from the truth.\nthe service was friendly and our server was very helpful, taking time to explain the menu. \nfirst, this place has the best food i have ever put in my mouth. seriously i am a french fry snob and they make the most deliciously perfect pomme frite you will ever eat. second, bouchon has ruined waffles for me, i can no longer eat waffles, because they made me the best waffle i will ever eat. it was a sourdough waffle, crispy on the outside and airy, not doughy on the inside... i want to cry out of joy and longing just writing about it. during breakfast they also give you a homemade marmalade to eat with their home made bread which is a meal worth $$$ for, but it's free!!!!!!!!!! their marmalade and bread is like everything else here, amazing.\ni recommend everything, and for dessert try the <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark>.\ni am planning another trip to vegas, just to eat a bouchon again. oh, how i miss you bouchon.", 
            "i love this place. thomas keller will rarely let you down.the entrees are great - one of the best steak frites i've had (the fries here are just delicious, and they stack 'em high), and the leg of lamb is great too. one of the daily specials they have sometimes is a braised lamb shank which is just delicious as well.\n\nfor dessert, the <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark> and profiteroles are great; the only problem is that it's hard to decide between the two!", 
            "this is maybe my 7th time eating here. i took a group there last night and it was superb! we had kumomoto oysters to start as well as shrimp. the raw bar is impressive to look at and eating from it, even better.  one guest had the laitue salad, a mix of bibb lettuces and fine herbs and the house vinaigrette. she is very picky and usually likes iceberg and ranch - she ate every bite!\nfor main courses we all shared. steak frites, salmon and lentils and crispy skinned striped bass with gnocchi, forested mushrooms and black truffle mousseline.  divine. everything was cooked to perfection and every guest was happy and impressed. our server amy d was very knowledgeable, very gracious and the perfect server. not to \"waity\" and she was right there when we needed her (all the while maintaining her section).  our desserts ranged from profiteroles, <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>, <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark> w/ strawberry, orange and mint ice cream + some kind of hazelnut gateau with housemade hazelnut ice cream. they also had hazelnuts and fresh honey on the side. amy sent an additional dessert, housemade tarte tatin w/ vanilla ice cream. i was in heaven and then some. \nthe wine list is very extensive and since my guests are used to paying $16+ for a glass of wine, i chose simple, macon, mehlville pinot and for myself a splurge of billecart brut salmon bubbles. \nwe had a blast!", 
            "i've been dying to eat at bouchon for years and always because of budget and time, it has never happened.  finally the perfect oppourtunity presented itself.  after a fantastic time at phantom, everyone was down for a nice meal and being right upstairs of the theatre, bouchon was a natural choice.\n\nto begin, the staff was oh so attentive.  we were introduced to the maitre-d, the oyster guy and of course our server.\n\nwhile we were walking in we were excited by the food being displayed all around us.  \n\nus three hungry girlies got the foie gras pate to share, the grand plateau, a huge assortment of seafood, shortribs and lamb.\n\nthe foie gras, what can i say.  five ounces of pure heaven with crispy crunchy brioche to share.  sure it was quite pricey, $50 to be exact, but well worth every penny.  the serving was more than enough for the three of us.  \n\nthe seafood was fresh and delicious but very standard.  next time i wouldn't order just because you can get seafood anywhere.\n\nnow i normally don't like shortrib much, but this was melt in your mouth tender with crunchy bits of parsnip, carrots and god knows what else, probably crack.  the best best best best part of the dish was two deep fried morsels on the top.  deep fried what you ask?  deep fried bone marrow.  omg.  i thought i had died and gone to foodie heaven.\n\nthe lamb was also very good, tender, juicy, on a bed of white beans i want to say.  \n\nwe couldn't breath after the meal but we finished off with some <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark> and a chocolate mousse.\n\nwhat an amazing meal.  i think i need to have dinner here everytime i go to vegas now.  slurp!", 
            "maybe my expectations were too high coming into bouchon, especially since it was from thomas keller.\n\nmy friends and i had made reservations for 6:30pm on a sunday night so the place was pretty empty. we were seated after about 5 minutes of waiting, which still surprised me i guess since we had already reserved a table.\n\nthe decor and ambiance of the place is very appropriate; dimly lit and nice chairs/booths.\n\nthe menus surprised me a bit: they were made out of tissue paper and were used to wrap the napkins. is that typical for a really nice restaurant? \n\nafter ordering, we were given bread, which was plopped straight onto the table along with some butter and pistachios. i thought that was a bit awkward. we also had no bread plates. i guess bouchon can't afford enough plates? \n\nafter a bit, we were also served some marinated olives, which confused us a bit since we didn't order any olives. they turned out to be really salty and i only ended up spitting one out after trying it.\n\nthe wait for food wasn't too bad and our orders all came out at once. i had ordered the leg of lamb (about $33). the portions aren't especially big but it filled me up. the lamb was very good and flavorful and it definitely ended all too quickly. the thing that looked the most appetizing of all my friends was the chicken, which had a much bigger portion than the other dishes and smelled delicious.\n\nfor dessert, everyone had ordered one of everything on the menu (caramel custard, <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>, chocolate mousse, meringue, and <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark>) and we went around tasting all the desserts. overall, all the desserts were really good.\n\nwe were having a pretty good experience until the bill came and it turns out that those olives they served us were not complimentary. somehow they ended up serving us olives (which we did not order) and charged us for it. we told our waiter and he was very apologetic and immediately took it off our bill.\n\nother than that mishap, i would say overall i had an ok experience at bouchon. the waiters were nice, the decor was nice, and the food was nice. but with all the little details that were missed, bouchon did not wow me, especially for a thomas keller restaurant and for the price we paid.", 
            "my favorite las vegas restaurant.  why you ask?  no pretense, relaxed yet sophisticated atmosphere, amazing menu, great wine list, and you can walk out not spending an arm and a leg.\n\nthe meal i enjoyed consisted of:\n- daily special app - crab rillette: a chunkier rillette than i am used to, but great flavor, paired with toast points.\n- french onion soup: very good, traditional version topped with french bread and gruyere cheese.  a bit on the salty side.\n- steak frites : perfectly cooked steak, topped with a flavorful ma\\u00eetre d'h\\u00f4tel butter and carmelized shallots, served alongside some of the best, crispiest french fries.\n- forest mushrooms (side dish for table): mix of various \"forest\" mushrooms sauteed in butter/garlic.\n- dessert special - <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark>: small servings of moist, dense, chocolate cake shaped like wine cask corks, with chocolate or caramel sauce, paired with ice cream.\n\noh, and their bread and butter is awesome.\n\nour server was great too, very funny - cracking jokes with us.", 
            "our group sat on the patio at lunch time, and the atmosphere was lovely.  service was friendly but a bit slow.  note that their lunch menu is quite small and simple.  it consists of a few sandwiches and salads.  i tried the steak sandwich, which was good but not mind-blowing by any means.  the sandwich came with <mark>North Fork Kettle Chips (2 Oz.)</mark>, and fries are extra.  dessert consisted of double chocolate cookie, chocolate chip cookie, <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark>, and a \"fat boy\" ice cream \"sandwich\".  i place quotes around \"sandwich\" because our waitress said it was a sandwich, the menu says it's a sandwich, but when it arrived at the table, it was an ice cream bar on a stick - the kind you get from an ice cream truck.  vanilla with chocolate and chopped peanuts.  it was also cracked, like someone sat on it.  so, i don't understand this at all.  on a brighter note, the <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark> were heavenly - like molten chocolate cake bites.\n\nas far as french bistros go, i would prefer to go to boulud at wynn.", 
            "not a must stop when i'm in vegas, but definitely a treat. the croque madame is super rich with melted cheese and a wonderful, oozy egg on top. the hash is prepared with tiny ham squares, not at all oily, but during the meal i was wishing for a hamsteak. the chicken and waffle was all right--the chicken was just a tad dry, and the waffle didn't have that satisfying crunch, but the syrup was yum. i like the <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark> and the red velvet cupcake. and, since it's located in vegas, i love that the place will serve me a double jameson neat with my breakfast.", 
            "it's a branch of thomas keller's french bistro inside the venetian.  we've been here before and always enjoyed the first-class service and beautiful ambiance.  the food is amazingly consistent and well priced i think.\n\nfor appetizers, our party of three split the barley salad with baby artichokes and the duck confit.  the salad was interesting - interesting texture similar to rice but with a good amount of acidity from the tomatoes.  the duck is basically a leg quarter that's cooked to a super juicy consistency with a crispy skin on the outside.  it's served on a bed of buttery polenta.  this dish will make you a fan of duck!\n\nfor main course, i always get the roast chicken - basically bouchon elevates this dish like no other.  it's roasted to perfect consistency and like the duck has a crisp, buttery skin.  they offer some roasted potatoes and brussels sprouts too.  the chicken meat is perfectly cooked and the sauce is amazing too.\n\nmy wife had the mussels in saffron broth with truffle fries, which were generous portions.  our 14-yr old niece had the grilled ham and cheese (topped with a fried egg) with fries.  it looked pretty tasty since she scarfed it all down.  note that bouchon is fairly generous in portion size - so no need to order extra sides of fries.\n\nfor desserts, it's hard to do better than the <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark> (3 brownies per order) with peppermint ice cream.  sweet balanced by minty refreshing flavor.  the other dessert was the eggnog pot a creme, with two shortbread cookies.  this was also amazing - similar to a panna cotta with a unique flavor.", 
            "i came to bouchon last night for their bastille day special menu.  it was a grand meal.  i was brought their pain d'epi with some butter and the small bowl of pistachios.  i love this bread and i have to take care i don't overdo it.\n\nmy server was amy and she was a gem!!  i asked her about the size of the bastille day menu dishes and she explained they were all appetizer size.  i ordered a half dozen oysters, an order of pommes frites aux truffes, and the saucisson platter.  \n\nthe oysters came 2 each of three different areas from which they were harvested.  next up was the sausage assortment that came on a board.  there was one horizontally sliced piece of their bratwurst on a small bed of sauerkraut, 2 rounds of merguez, a slice of garlic sausage en croute, and one link of their boudin blanc.  the sausages were accompanied by some whole grain mustard, some yellow mustard, a couple of cornichons, and some pickled onion slices and other small vegetables pieces.  with the platter, i was brought more bread (3 kinds), and then came the pommes frites.\n\nit was a feast.  the sausages were all very good.  it would be a fantastic platter to serve any day but this is special for bastille day.\n\nafter this, i ordered <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark> for dessert.  these were one of their dessert specials for the night.  i didn't see macarons as was stated online when i read about their special menu for the day.  the bouchons were small, vertical brownies with a small scoop of ice cream with coconut, one fresh cheerry dipped in chocolate and chilled before serving.  there was also some raspberry syrup on the plate.  the bouchons were great.\n\ni have an affair with bouchon.  i have been there several times and i just like the bistro atmosphere and looking out the window and seeing that lovely park area with pools on the 10th floor of the building that's so private and away from the rest of the venetian/venezia/palazzo resort.  bouchon has been the place i've reviewed the most.  it's one of those places that just puts a smile on my face and i look forward to going there.  service is always first rate and the food is very good.\n\ni think i have a new bastille day tradition that started last night!"

            "i've waited a little while before reviewing bouchon because i have often been critical of restaurant reviews from people who just don't dig the particular style of cuisine. do you rate according to the experience, or whether or not the food was exactly your cup of tea?\n\nthe wife and i have wanted to try some celebrity chef places before we leave vegas for good and bouchon, being one that is willing too look the other way on.... well, let's just say we put the \"casual\" in \"business casual\" and they seemed like an option for us.\n\ni'll get this right out there and say that i am generally not a huge fan of french cuisine. with the exception of the marvelous concoctions served up by olivier at his baguette cafe (hi olivier!), which routinely blows my socks off, and many wonderful encounters with crusty bread across the globe, the flavour profiles just don't do it for me very often. bouchon was up against it from the beginning.\n\ni ordered a new <mark>Potato Salad</mark> with egg confit, the steak bouchon with a black truffle demiglace, and a chocolate marquise for dessert. all were good on various levels. the salad was fascinating and i was surprised how much i liked the way the raw egg yolk that crowned the whole affair oozed all over the dish. \n\nsteak was cooked to perfection and tasted good, but of course i just wasn't that into the glaze. i'm not one of those philistines who smothers steaks in gloopy brown sauce from a bottle; however, i'd have preferred my steak unadorned or in a nice peppercorn sauce. mushrooms and fungi, it turns out, don't just turn me off because of their texture -- the taste plays a part too. as i alluded to in my intro, this is personal taste preference rather than having anything to do with the quality of the dish.\n\nthe desert was suitably chocolatey and tasty, nothing i'd go running out again and again for, but pleasant and a nice way to round off an elegant meal.\n\noverall, the meal was tasty. the experience was amazing. so why only four stars? well, it was nearly $200 for the pair of us without any alcohol and i find that i'd prefer to be spending that money on a week's worth of panini and <mark>8' Chocolate Tart</mark> from around the corner at the baguette cafe. \n\nbouchon was an experience that i am pleased to have had and i would recommend it to friends, but it's not calling me back.", 
            "when my husband and i were planning our trip to las vegas last month, i was placed in charge of finding places to eat. i had heard thomas keller opened up a place, but didn't know where and it honestly didn't take me long to find bouchon in the listing of restaurants along the strip. how could i not make this a priority? i quickly booked a reservation for a sunday dinner and were were definitely not disappointed.\n\nwe ended up being a little early, but considering it was a rather slow sunday and our reservations were on the early side, they had no problem seating us right as we walked in. i was a little surprised at how quiet it was, but i think it made for a much more enjoyable experience. the ambiance was very much a parisian bistro, down to the tile floor, dark wood bar, and white table cloths. the 2-top tables were set rather close to one another, but that didn't bother me much. it was a tiny bit distracting when the single man next to us was ordering, but that's only because i honestly wanted to know what he was ordering. it also gave me an opportunity to ask how he liked the chicken, which i was eyeing on the menu earlier.\n\nour waiter greeted us as soon as we sat down. he asked for our preference for water and allowed us some time to peruse the menu. water delivered, he gave a thorough explanation of the various specials they had that night. my husband and i both skipped on cocktails from the bar and went with wine for the evening. unfortunately, their wine selection, while lovely, is outrageously expensive. i managed to find something reasonably priced and lucky for us it turned out to be a good find (sans liege '10 \"the offering\" - it was surprisingly good, totally recommend it). the sommelier who poured our wine was very nice and complimented our choice without being judgmental. overall, the waitstaff were warm, friendly, and very professional.\n\nwe started our meal sharing the hors d'oeuvres special for the evening: fois gras pate, duck confit, and huckleberry gel\\u00e9e terrine. this was simply exquisite. that's the only way to describe it. the layer of fois gras at the top melted on the tongue, making way for the incredibly savory and rich duck confit. the huckleberry gel\\u00e9e was brightly tart and just a bit sweet and essentially cleaned up the palate. i am so happy we ordered this. it certainly was a one-of-a-kind experience.\n\nwe both ordered a salad: i had the farro salad with kale, fresh tarragon, and preserved lemon segments and my husband had a green salad (the type of salad is escaping me at the moment). i was slightly disappointed in my salad. it was much more of a grain salad than a kale salad, which is what i was expecting. had i the opportunity to change my order, i would have as this was definitely a meal salad. it was very heavy and filling. my husband's salad was a standard mixed greens with a lovely vinaigrette.\n\nfor our entrees, my husband went old-school traditional with the steak frites (roasted flat iron cut) and i went with the salmon. the steak frites was delicious: the steak itself was perfectly cooked to order and the frites were plentiful and yummy. the salmon was perfectly cooked (medium-rare) with a lovely seared crust on all sides. it was served with a side of farro and little cubes of winter squash. since i had had my fill of farro with my salad, i stayed away from the farro with the salmon and enjoyed the fish and squash. as i write this, i'm curious as to why the waiter didn't question my order, seeing as i was ordering pretty much the same thing for 2 courses. i know that the customer is always right, but in this instance, i honestly would've liked some guidance and perhaps a nudge to order a different salad. besides this little diner-error, everything was delicious and fresh.\n\ni made darn sure i saved room for dessert and neither of us were disappointed. my husband went with the flourless <mark>8' Chocolate Tart</mark> and i went with their special for the evening egg nog pot de cr\\u00e8me. i loved this custard. it was not too over-the-top spicy, but perfectly sweet and creamy. my husband's <mark>8' Chocolate Tart</mark> was incredibly rich and delicious, too. both of us were very pleased with our choices.\n\nconsidering the french laundry is on my bucket list, i'm happy that i was able to at least enjoy one of thomas keller's establishments early and one that doesn't require a reservation 6 months in advance. we very much enjoyed ourselves here and will happily come again. i hear their brunch is lovely, too...", 
            "bouchon would not be my favorite high end steak place.... because it isn't a high end steak place. some of the negative reviews for bouchon are pretty funny, it's as if they should add another word to their name after bouchon to indicate to people exactly what kind of restaurant this is... alas, maybe in an ideal world... i mean come on-you get warm pistachios to start- which are fabulous by the way. \n\nhere are the things i tried there\n\nsoup du jour- this was a lentil soup that was actually pretty mediocre. i wanted to pull out my key ring salt container and season it up but alas i left it at home :(. was not a great start to the meal\n\nsteak frites- and you won me back. this was great- the steak was cooked perfectly, it came with a large portion of butter on top, and the fries were excellently seasoned with truffley goodness. \n\npork belly- this was a special entree that i shared with a friend. it came with more lentils as the vegetable which were unimpressive but the pork belly itself was ridiculously good. nice and crispy on the outside, very fatty and tender on the inside. \n\n<mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>- this was also awesome. as my dinning companions noted it was also like 3x the size of the <mark>8' Chocolate Tart</mark> for the poor soul who was foolish enough to order that. it was super lemony tasting so if you don't like that bitter bite than this probably isn't for you. \n\nthe service was good throughout and no one in the party had any complaints about the meal.", 
            "let me start by saying if you can eat dinner here....i would highly recommend it.  by far this was one of the best meals in vegas for me next to sage at the aria.  \n\nfirst, we started out with the mussels (moules).  they were amazing.  this was the first time i had mussels that there chilled.  they were delicious.  simple but so good.  (oh....first you really start out with this amazing bread and butter...plus pistachios....just perfect way to start your french bistro meal)\n\nwe both ordered the steak frites.  by far, one of the best steaks i have eaten however, for me, the superstar were the frites (aka fries).  these were by far, the best fries i have ever eaten.  that may not seem like a big deal to many but that just means they have not had properly made fries.  the kicker to this was the aioli.  its not provided without request but we asked and let me just say it made the fries even better than they already were...truly.  \n\nnext....dessert.  well, we both got different items.  i ordered the <mark>8' Chocolate Tart</mark>.  again, amazing.  it was the perfect crust with the perfect consistency of dark chocolate as the tart along with a touch of citrus which sets off the flavor of the chocolate beautifully.  truly a lovely meal."

            "i cannot believe that thomas keller put his name anywhere near this restaurant. doesn't he run two of the top restaurants in the world???? i would expect the best service, the best ambiance and the best food from him.\n\nour waiter was sweaty and had to read from a notepad to tell us the specials. he never once asked me if i wanted a refill on our wine. in fact, he never checked in one us (during our hour and half meal) to see if we needed anything. kudos to the busboy and the other wait staff for stepping up a bit b/c he sucked. the place was messy - there was food on the floor and the dessert menu was actually dirty! i opted against ordering dessert not only b/c there was leftover god-know-what on the menu, but b/c the options were so bland. i could have gone to denny's and had better options - i think i could have flan , ice cream with chocolate sauce, <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark> or chocolate mousse. hmmm - real high class options!?!?!?!\n\nthe food, i have to admit, was good. i'm not saying great - but good. i sure as hell cannot believe we paid $38 for a slab of pork...but that's the price of taking a chance and ordering a special from a sweaty red-faced waiter who kinda splittles when he talks (i think he mighta been high or drunk). \n\nto give you some perspective - martini house is one of my favorites - the food, ambiance and staff are always impecible. chez pannise is a miracle as far as restaurants go. i can go there and order anything off their menu and want to lick the plate. i will never go anywhere near bouchon again...and if this is what i can expect from the french laundry...then...fuck their three month wait list. why would i even go there?",

            "holy shiz, that was a lot of food.  as a friend of thomas' we were treated to a fantastic assault of food.  this place has a very similar feel to bouchon in yountville but a much larger layout and a little busier feeling due to the number of tables.  our waiter was \"jewish paul\" as opposed to \"spanish paul\" the sommelier.  paul was a very cool cat with a lot of personality who made sure the dining experience was fun and entertaining.  we started out with a tower of chilled shellfish from the raw bar.  5 different types of oysters, a dozen clams, a half dozen mussels, a split lobster, and a split crab.  what a way to start.  next was a pumpkin soup (it might have been butternut squash, hope i got it right) done very nicely and topped with a meringue.  then a myriad of appetizers, the charcuterie platter, smoked salmon rillettes (my favorite), and haricorts-verts.  for my entree i had the sous-vide wagyu skirt steak with apple-parsnip puree.  a pretty good dish, i had hoped the skirt steak would have been butter-tender from the sous-vide but it had been seared aftewards which gave it a nice crust (not a bad thing but different from what i had expected).  the apple-parsnip puree was wonderfully smooth, sweet, and balanced the meat nicely.  for dessert paul brought us everything on the menu and a little more.  7 desserts all together, i think.  a creme brulee, flan, the signature <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark> with ice cream, <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>, coffee pot-de-creme, chocolate pot-de-creme, and ice cream filled profiteroles.  we also had a champagne to start and 3 wines paired with our courses.\n\nprice breakdown:  bouchon can be tough to gauge depending on your appetite and food selection.  you can start with the seafood tower like we did for $100 or have foie gras and caviar which will run you the same or more just to start your meal.  or you can opt for the less expensive dishes like the charcuterie platter or salmon rillettes which are closer to $15-20.  entrees go from $20-40, desserts are roughly $9 each.  closed for lunch on the weekdays, maybe open on weekends?  breakfast is also served here every day, though i'm not sure how much that is.  anyhow, a light meal might run $25 per person while an extravagant one like ours might be closer to $100-150 each.  on average i'd feel comfortable bringing $100 for two people which should cover an appetizer, two entrees, dessert, and wine.",

            "thomas keller's inimitable relationship with his fish purveyors warranted at least one fish dish, so i went with the salmon rillettes, which had a consistency similar to a crab cake, bursting with both smoked and fresh fish pieces. the duck confit appetizer was served with brussels sprouts to lighten the dish. the last starter we ordered was the charcuterie - a generous offering - including meats cured in yountville, as well as a few imported from italy. \n\nfor the mains, we went with the black pudding, lamb leg, and short rib. the succulent banger did not have an off-putting irony aftertaste one normally associates with black pudding. the lamb leg was cooked perfectly pink. the prodigious short rib, defined by its fork tenderness, sent us all into a blissful state; the polenta-cranberry cake, however, was unappetizing. \n\nfor dessert, we split the meyer <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark> and per our server's suggestion ordered the bouche de noel, an ornate christmas special replete with gingerbread, meringue, peppermint, truffles, a glazed sugar cookie, smoked almonds, and a valrhona torte. meyer lemons have a distinctly robust acidity; with the dense pork's peppery finish still lingering on my palette, the tart was a judicious selection. as for the bouche de noel, it was huge, too big to conquer, but we enjoyed its playfulness.",

            "bouchon is one of those restaurants that perplexes me. the service is impeccable, the oysters are fresh, and the food is really good. however, i cannot give it that 5th star because nothing about the restaurant's food stands out per se (no pun intended mr. keller).\n\ni've been to bouchon twice and both times i sat at the bar. i also happened to get the same bartender and this guy is so on top of his game that you would think he has been doing this his whole life. he is a courteous chap with a pleasant demeanor and offers good recommendations all around.\n\nthe first time i went, i had the french onion soup, the moules frites, and the pot de creme. each dish was delicious and the french onion soup was especially good. the second time, i had a half dozen oysters (really, really good), duck confit, and pork belly. \n\nthe confit was a bit disappointing though it was cooked as well as any confit i have ever seen yet it was still a tad dry on the inside and a bit flavorless. i wasn't a big fan of the pool of nectarine juice it was swimming in either and that did not make up for the dryness.\n\ni highly recommend the moules frites. it is simply a bowl of mussels with a very flavorful white-wine/saffron sauce and a batch of really good french fries.\n\nthe <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark> was not so great. it was too tart and the texture wasn't anything special. this is something that i know folks can make better at home.\n\noverall the experience was great. i love thomas keller and his creations. i love the service and atmosphere of the restaurant itself. it isn't overly crowded and sitting at the bar is always fun when you have a good bartender. however, i cannot offer that fifth star to bouchon because i'm sure it's food can be so much more (and this is a restaurant review no?). maybe next time...", 
            "went there for dinner.  our food was very good.  kind of a french-fusion restaurant.  the service was excellent.  however, we went early (around 5:30) and there were only three other customers, so i don't know what the service is like with a full house.  \n\nthe biggest stand out for us was their deserts.  the <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark> was to die for, and some chocolaty, raspberry cake, goodness.  i can't recall the name, but it was wonderful.", 
            "this is maybe my 7th time eating here. i took a group there last night and it was superb! we had kumomoto oysters to start as well as shrimp. the raw bar is impressive to look at and eating from it, even better.  one guest had the laitue salad, a mix of bibb lettuces and fine herbs and the house vinaigrette. she is very picky and usually likes iceberg and ranch - she ate every bite!\nfor main courses we all shared. steak frites, salmon and lentils and crispy skinned striped bass with gnocchi, forested mushrooms and black truffle mousseline.  divine. everything was cooked to perfection and every guest was happy and impressed. our server amy d was very knowledgeable, very gracious and the perfect server. not to \"waity\" and she was right there when we needed her (all the while maintaining her section).  our desserts ranged from profiteroles, <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>, <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark> w/ strawberry, orange and mint ice cream + some kind of hazelnut gateau with housemade hazelnut ice cream. they also had hazelnuts and fresh honey on the side. amy sent an additional dessert, housemade tarte tatin w/ vanilla ice cream. i was in heaven and then some. \nthe wine list is very extensive and since my guests are used to paying $16+ for a glass of wine, i chose simple, macon, mehlville pinot and for myself a splurge of billecart brut salmon bubbles. \nwe had a blast!",

            "the food was generally outstanding. i had the lamb as a main and the <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark> for desert. both were absolutely outstanding. a lot of people at our table had the steak frites and the fries, as advertised, where the best i've ever had. while we had a large group (12) we did have a reservation but the service was fairly slow.  it took us about 3 hours total and we were there an hour before the starters arrived.", 
            "maybe my expectations were too high coming into bouchon, especially since it was from thomas keller.\n\nmy friends and i had made reservations for 6:30pm on a sunday night so the place was pretty empty. we were seated after about 5 minutes of waiting, which still surprised me i guess since we had already reserved a table.\n\nthe decor and ambiance of the place is very appropriate; dimly lit and nice chairs/booths.\n\nthe menus surprised me a bit: they were made out of tissue paper and were used to wrap the napkins. is that typical for a really nice restaurant? \n\nafter ordering, we were given bread, which was plopped straight onto the table along with some butter and pistachios. i thought that was a bit awkward. we also had no bread plates. i guess bouchon can't afford enough plates? \n\nafter a bit, we were also served some marinated olives, which confused us a bit since we didn't order any olives. they turned out to be really salty and i only ended up spitting one out after trying it.\n\nthe wait for food wasn't too bad and our orders all came out at once. i had ordered the leg of lamb (about $33). the portions aren't especially big but it filled me up. the lamb was very good and flavorful and it definitely ended all too quickly. the thing that looked the most appetizing of all my friends was the chicken, which had a much bigger portion than the other dishes and smelled delicious.\n\nfor dessert, everyone had ordered one of everything on the menu (caramel custard, <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>, chocolate mousse, meringue, and <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark>) and we went around tasting all the desserts. overall, all the desserts were really good.\n\nwe were having a pretty good experience until the bill came and it turns out that those olives they served us were not complimentary. somehow they ended up serving us olives (which we did not order) and charged us for it. we told our waiter and he was very apologetic and immediately took it off our bill.\n\nother than that mishap, i would say overall i had an ok experience at bouchon. the waiters were nice, the decor was nice, and the food was nice. but with all the little details that were missed, bouchon did not wow me, especially for a thomas keller restaurant and for the price we paid.", 
            "i came here recently on a trip to vegas with some friends. we made reservations that day when we checked into our room at the venetian and were seated promptly when we arrived. the waiters were very friendly and everything was done according to etiquette (e.g. serving the ladies first, serving food only from your left side, etc.).they started us off with bread and butter which was very delicious. they also gave us a free appetizer of marinated olives, which was a very light appetizer so it was perfect before our big meal. i ordered the roasted chicken and it was incredibly tender and the meat fell off the bones. the side of celery and candied apples were also delicious. the size was very good for what we paid. we got a bottle of merlot that went very well with the meal and they served us several times in our glasses so we wouldn't even have to touch the bottle. after dinner we each got a different dessert and shared them all and they were all incredible and compliment each other well. the <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark> was huge and easily the biggest dessert there. very tangy so only get it if you like the sourness of lemon. the chocolate dessert was incredibly rich as was the meringue over cream. the custard caramel was extremely smooth and the right amount of creamy and sweet. i would definitely going there if you're looking for a nice dinner.", 
            "this was my one and only real meal in vegas during an intense weekend outing. even though i felt extremely sick during my meal, i still really liked it (i love food in general)!! we went for \"brunch\" at noon and left at 3pm!\n\ni got chicken and waffles. it's not a great thing to get when you're hung-over but it really is delicious. its a little heavy (the gravy you pour on the chicken is heavy) and the waffles have little salty pieces of bacon on it, but it is delicious. i especially like the combo flavor of sweet syrup and salty chicken. the chicken was also super tender, probably some of the most tender i've ever had...\n\ni tried my friend's croque madame and it was delicious as well. the brioche bread was buttery and delicious and the ham was a good salty contrast. the french fries were amazing as well (probably some of the best fries i've ever had).\n\ni got a chocolate croissant which was amazing (honestly everything was amazing) and the bread they serve you is great too. desert was even better! we got 7 deserts and i think i tried all of them. the best were a creme puff / ice cream pastry thingy, chocolate cake thingies (so good!!), and the <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>. the flan was good, but i didnt have a lot. i didnt like the custard that much.\n\nthis meal was amazing and i was feeling realy sick (so this should underscore how amazing the meal was). i honestly wish i felt better so i could have enjoyed it more. must come back!!", 
            "some great examples of bistro fare, but there were some misses as well. of course, bouchon is a bit pricey, but this is vegas, after all. the seating was nice outdoors, but almost didn't feel like outdoors high on the 10th floor, surrounded by the towers of the venetian. nothing like the fabulous vibe and street scene at mon ami gabi at paris las vegas that we experienced the night before. on the other hand, our server julie was totally charming and professional. even though the poor girl was working on her birthday (she didn't tell us this, but her coworker did spill). \n\nwe started with fabulous cocktails. a special salad with duck breast and grapefruit was a light and tasty start, but the french onion soup that my partner ordered really wasn't all that impressive, to be honest. we both ordered fish for our main course. i loved the monkfish, though the lobster spaetzle it came with was a bit more chewy than i expected. also, my partner's salmon was perfectly cooked and delicious, though he didn't care for the lemon couscous on the side. i like it though. he also didn't care that much for the <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>, which is made according to chef thomas keller's grandma's recipe. i thought it was okay, but i think my own lemon curd tart is more flavorful. i know - i'm biased. on the other hand, i got to experience the ile flottante for dessert. omg! that was just about the most spectacular dessert i've ever eaten. a delicate meringue cloud floating over a vanilla creme anglaise, drizzled with caramel and almond. it is because of this heavenly dessert that i am more than willing to give bouchon another chance, despite the inconsistencies mentioned above. maybe we'll opt for the steak frites next time.", 
            "amazing. food-gasm. thomas effing keller to the rescue. words cannot describe my experience at bouchon. i had the chicken, for god's sakes, and it was incredible. the baguette? like i had in paris (yep, threw in the pretentious paris card). even the butter was amazing. ended the meal with the <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark> and could have died i was so happy. do yourself a favor--go to bouchon. just go.", 
            "went for dinner on a friday night, we were able to get in without a problem.  reservations (for two) were probably not even required.  spinach salad was great, yellowtail carpacio was good (i'm more of a traditional sushi eater), steak was great, and the <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark> was fantastic.", 
            "i thought thomas keller had a good reputation, but it looks like he has resorted to trading on his name like so many of his contemporaries.\n\nnot a very good place, the type that serves mediocre food and survives on their name, undeserved reputation from when maybe they used to be good, and the expectation that their clientele are ignorant and either don't realize or are too proud to admit they were suckered in to getting ripped off at a place like this.\n\nthe seafood platter starter was pretty good. nothing to complain about although not nearly as epic in presentation as, say, mastro's which really makes it feel like a night out.\n\nfor my courses i decided to judge them on a couple of bistro classics, the onion soup and croque madame (a croque monsieur with a poached egg on top). i can make better onion soup than bouchon--straight up. if thomas keller would accept the challenge i would go on food network for a cook-off and bury his ass. the soup tasted a bit burnt and too strong overall, my first impression was that someone dumped a double-dose of instant bouillon into the pot by accident. and not enough cheese, which is a major pet peeve. at a nice place, why cut costs by withholding the last ounce or two of cheese that would put the soup ever the top?\n\ncroque madame was served cold, almost completely. once i started eating i found a little warm spot in the center, but it had definitely been sitting for a while, so i suppose that's why the food took so long to arrive; i should have sent it back but didn't feel like waiting another hour. it was pretty good, definitely would have been better served hot but even so nothing remarkable. the bread was a bit thick and the ham wasn't anything special. the fries were unremarkable, and not consistently cooked which is kind of an unusual problem. a lot of them were a bit undercooked, the rest were fine, but visually they all looked like they came from the same batch. not as good as mcdonald's.\n\nthe <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark> dessert was probably the highlight of the meal, but even so, i occasionally caught a slight stale taste.\n\ndon't bother, go to chinatown or anywhere else they still feel like they have to work for it.", 
            "a thoroughly memorable dinner in a beautiful and inviting space. i had the croque madame and it was amazing. very fresh with a creamy rich topping. the soft egg on top was perfection as well. \n\nmy dinner companion had the short rib and mashed potatoes and it was also delicious. the portion was huge and beautifully presented.\n\nwe were seated immediately and our waiter, james, was knowledgeable and helpful. he didn't seem to mind that i only had a sandwich for dinner and happily substituted a huge fresh salad for the french fries. it made for a perfect compliment to the rich sandwich. perfect vinaigrette dressing.\n\nmy only regret is missing the <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>. this will be the first thing on my list for a return visit.", 
            "from the moment we arrived at bouchon everything was perfect.  we were lucky to have been seated in james section, i would venture to say that james is among the best servers in vegas. we started with the charcuterie and foie gras-both we're mind blowing!  our mains included the salmon, short rib, and lamb.  it's impossible to capture the expert preparation and presentation of each dish, leave it to say each dish was savored and enjoyed.  deserts included the bouchon brownies, <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark> and bread pudding.  if you're in las vegas, make dining at bouchon a priority!  you won't be disappointed!", 
            "5-star reviews at bouchon are a dime a dozen, but i really want to share my experience because it was just that great.\n\nwe made a reservation here for a late anniversary celebration, at 6pm to avoid the crowds, and because we were seeing mystere later. great choice, the restaurant was emptyish and it was nice and quiet. \n\nwe decided the apps and sides looked more interesting than the entrees, so we ordered a bunch of things to taste, like:\n-oysters\n-bone marrow \n-quiche du jour\n-salade des tomates\n-tiger shrimp risotto\n-marinated olives\n\na standout for me was the bone marrow. having never tried this before, i was excited to see that it came with thick grilled bread. we scooped the marrow out and spread it on the bread, and drizzled some of the garlic/parsley/shallot/sherry vinegar sauce over it. just out of this world. so decadent...i definitely can't eat that all the time, but was glad to try it this once!\n\nwe also were presented the dessert menu, which we pondered for a few minutes before quietly deciding on sharing a <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>. now, this is where it gets interesting. before we could order, our waiter, rico, walked up to the table with a plate of dessert-a <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>, which was compliments of the chef. how did he--? maybe it's the standard celebratory dessert, but i'd much rather think that the tables were mic'd up or that the waitstaff have the ability to read minds. keeping the mystery alive! \n\nwhat a fantastic dinner here, can't wait to come back and try the croque madame, which sounds incredible.",

(although the foie gras saute looked equally as good)  the small was plenty for two people - i actually think we left a smidge in there.  the bread that came with it was perfection.  i believe tk is the largest procurer of foie gras in the country, so if i'm going to eat it, i want to have it at one of his spots, because i know it will be the very best i can get.  and it was.  yummy yum yum.\n\nwe settled on the evening special:  braised beef cheeks (i.e. beef bourguignon) with fresh papparadelle pasta on the side. omg, amazingness.  totally the best i've ever ever had.  it was like pot roast, just amped up with perfect herbs, onions, mushrooms, and other veggies.  and that pasta - groan.  i almost asked for a 2nd plate of it.  delicious beyond words.  and again, the portion size was perfectly split between two people.  i don't know what we would have done had i actually ordered my own entree.  mercy.  i did order a side of the garlic spinach, mainly because i adore sauteed spinach about as much as i adore spaghetti and i just couldn't help myself.  delicious.  \n\nsince we stayed at the palazzo, we were offered a winter specials app for the complex.  i happened to notice that this meant a free dessert at bouchon, which i happily redeemed for the <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>.  it was tart, omg.  i mean, tart.  my lips still pucker up thinking about it!  hubby got some delicious chocolately dessert that made him happy as can be; i just can't remember what it was.\n\nwine was amazing, of course.  my french champagne was perfection and hubby's bourbon cocktail was too.  our waitress patiently guided us through the various red wine offerings, letting us sample this and that before we found the perfect partner for our braised beef cheeks.  yummy.\n\nall in all, terrific service and delicious food and wine made for a super pleasant relaxing dinner, even if i was almost falling asleep in my food since it was essentially after midnight at home.  \n\nand bonus!  the opentable gift certificate was happily applied to our bill, along with the credit for the <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>.  no snootiness at all!  yay!\n\ni would definitely recommend bouchon for dinner, but man oh man, the breakfast, brunch, and even poolside menus look just as divine, so if you're having trouble squeezing in for dinner, definitely make an appearance for one of their other serving times.  yay tk!",

            "after much deliberation of where my parents and i should celebrate my 25th birthday, we decided for classic french fare at bouchon. i had already pored over the menu online and knew i wanted a smattering of oysters, foie gras, cheese, terrine, etc. and i didn't know how i was going to choose. \n\nlogistically, the restaurant is incredibly hidden away, and all the signs on the main casino floor take you to bouchon bistro which is a casual cafe. we had to ask the concierge where to go and he told us to take the elevator upstairs to the guest floor and then walk down a long hallway? yikes. after a short wait we were taken to a table by the service station... not ok. asked to move to a nicer booth (the restaurant was not packed, and it was my birthday after all ;) ) and we were surrounded by couples and other birthday celebrations. \n\ni started with an excellent glass of sparkling wine and 1/2 dozen oysters, 2 of differing varieties. my mom and i shared the 2.5 oz. foie gras terrine which was soo smooth and delicious it was basically like eating meat flavored butter (which someone should invent). we all ordered a salad, i had the salade mara\\u00eech\\u00e8re au ch\\u00e8vre chaud, and my dad had the salade de cresson et d'endives au roquefort et noix, watercress with roquefort and walnuts, except it didn't come with any roquefort so we had to flag our waitress down to ask for it on the side. he had a ribeye special for his entree, my mom had a huge bowl of the most delicious moules frites i've ever had, and i had an appetizer portion of the duck confit because i was stuffed to the gills at that point already! we wanted the bone marrow as well but sadly they were out of it that evening. we also ordered a 1/2 carafe of a california pinot, they have a great wine list in all sizes btw, and they brought out a complimentary <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark> for my birthday. \n\nthe food was great, rustic but refined french cuisine, but the service could have been better. i would still jump at the chance to go back again, and for a nice restaurant on the strip, it doesn't break the bank compared to some other options.", 
            "i hovered between 3 and 4 stars.  i went here three times on this trip, first time, wine at the bar, a quiet night with four people, was a good spot.  second time wine and truffle fries at the bar, nice and quiet, the truffle fries are indeed heavily truffled and i could not eat them, my date swore they were frozen fries as they were just all to perfectly cut but i like to think not. third time here was a maelstrom ces night.  we started at the bar 5 of us and closed the barbill around $600.  there was a seafood platter in there somewhere for $115, grossly overpriced for what it was and not very appetizing.  we sat to dinner and rocked another $600.  with clients i had not worked with for 15 years, it was a heck of a reunion.  foie gras was delish and kevin's streak was perfection, for $57 it ought to be.  the <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark> is the best ever.  service was excellent but i do prefer smaller and more intimate places, the volume was crazy.", 
            "finally made it to bouchon, on valentine's day nonetheless.  \n\nour meal was delightful and our service was great and we cannot wait to return.  \n\nalthough it is a lovely room, it is a bustling bistro style atmosphere so i wouldn't hesitate to return with my well behaved child.  next time, i would certainly request a patio seat.  absolutely gorgeous outside by the flowers and fountains.  \n\nwe enjoyed the lobster and mussel bisque, seared foi gras, steak frites and <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>. they serve fresh knotted pull apart bread right on the table with french butter and warm pistachios.  the bread was crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy in the middle.  absolute bread and butter perfection. our served kindly split the bisque for us at no charge.  it was rich, buttery, decadent and piping hot.  the foie gras was seared and served on butter soaked brioche and surrounded by a strawberry rhubarb compote.  i do wish the compote was a chunkier texture instead of the smooth puree.   of course, the dish was very reminiscent of breakfast buttered toast and jam. yum. it was under seasoned, but a few salt sprinkles fixed it right up.  the steak frites was doused in butter (shocking).  it was served with a hearty helping of pretty perfect fries.  they were. hot, crispy, and perfectly seasoned. the flat iron was cooked perfectly, and was wonderfully tender.  \n\nat this point, our arteries were surely hardening, but we felt we could not skip dessert.  we chose a <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark> for something light and fresh vs. a rich chocolate number.  it was the perfect texture; zingy and the un-sweetened pine nut crust was excellent.   \n\nwe were pleasantly surprised by the prices at bouchon.  we received chocolate covered strawberries with our check for the holiday.  a delicious meal.  we will go back, and soon.  it is so easy to access for locals.  a quick jump from one parking garage elevator to another.  we never even had to step in the casino.", 
            "we came in late after a show, but were seated promptly next to an informative couple who were happy to review their dishes for us. i had an excellently prepared steak frites, cooked to perfection with a savory-tangy butter sauce on top. loved the steak, while fries were passable. meal started with an escarole salad with lardon and egg on top. tender and flavorful. for dessert we split a <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>. excellent - tangy with a crunchy crust. while service was passable, the waiter was not inclined to elaborate on the menu. when asked about the croque madame, he replied \"it's a ham and cheese sandwich.\" in a french bistro, the authentic preparation, including mornay sauce and homemade brioche, probably warrants more of a discussion. my friend's entree was a lackluster preparation of lamb. all in all, while in las vegas, i would consider this thomas keller restaurant if you never plan to visit the napa location.", 
            "bouchon would not be my favorite high end steak place.... because it isn't a high end steak place. some of the negative reviews for bouchon are pretty funny, it's as if they should add another word to their name after bouchon to indicate to people exactly what kind of restaurant this is... alas, maybe in an ideal world... i mean come on-you get warm pistachios to start- which are fabulous by the way. \n\nhere are the things i tried there\n\nsoup du jour- this was a lentil soup that was actually pretty mediocre. i wanted to pull out my key ring salt container and season it up but alas i left it at home :(. was not a great start to the meal\n\nsteak frites- and you won me back. this was great- the steak was cooked perfectly, it came with a large portion of butter on top, and the fries were excellently seasoned with truffley goodness. \n\npork belly- this was a special entree that i shared with a friend. it came with more lentils as the vegetable which were unimpressive but the pork belly itself was ridiculously good. nice and crispy on the outside, very fatty and tender on the inside. \n\n<mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>- this was also awesome. as my dinning companions noted it was also like 3x the size of the <mark>8' Chocolate Tart</mark> for the poor soul who was foolish enough to order that. it was super lemony tasting so if you don't like that bitter bite than this probably isn't for you. \n\nthe service was good throughout and no one in the party had any complaints about the meal.", 
            "heaven!  we had an absolutely delicious meal here for my birthday!  here is a quick rundown of each item and our overall opinions:\n\n1) cheese plate- fabulous and large portions of several cheeses including cow and goat.  served with delicious grain crackers and raw honey.\n2) foie gras- buttery and delicious, paired with toasted baguettes.\n3) steak and frites- delicious cut of meat, cooked to an exact medium rare and paired with a huge side of tasty fries!\n4) roasted chicken- perfectly crisped skin and tender meat with a savory sauce. \n5) <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>- was rich, creamy, and very well balanced.  \n\nall of the portions are huge at bouchon and the service is outstanding.", 
            "let's start with dessert... four diners chose four desserts.... figs n berries with thyme ice cream , creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e , <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark> with pinion crust, and something with chocolate sauce!!!  no fault with this sweet array of perfection! was surprised waiter made no after dinner beverage recommendations.\n\nwaiter was friendly and staff attentive! refills were abundant, first rate attention to every detail!\n\nwhile the choice of swordfish was mine... it was the trout that stole the show where fish was concerned! it's so delightful to dine with foodies who live to share bites! chicken was succulent also putting my dry swordfish to shame. it was a shame i didn't eat more of the laurel bread n butter... sweet cream butter... laid out directly on the tablecloth...interesting... and why not???now let's talk lamb! moist, tender rich in flavor...four nice medallions made mouths water. the contents of that plate evaporated swiftly! sooo yummy! \n\nbeer list is nice, waitstaff is knowledgeable on pairings and speak confidently as to menu items ingredients and methods of preparations. inquires re: diners allergies raise awareness that the kitchen staff is able to help avoid even inadvertent cross allergen exposure! bravo/ brava!", 
            "was expecting better. \n\ni'm not sure if it was bc we were a large party but the food was not up to par. when we arrived they already had the cold seafood apps on the table. everything tasted ok but the raw oysters were a little smaller than expected.\n\nfor the entree i ordered the steak. it was cooked medium rare and it has got to be the toughest piece of meat i've ever tried. i had to ask the waiter to bring me a different knife bc i couldn't cut through the meat. \n\nthe macaroons were amazing. not too sweet. disappointed with the <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark>. it was way too sour. \n\ni have to compliment the waiter. he was amazing and very efficient even when our party was difficult. great service!!", 
            "never been one to like french food but the home-made pasta i had was so rich and delicious. and the wine selection was great. i went for a friends birthday and they brought out a <mark>8' Lemon Tart</mark> cake for her which was also delicious.  the venue was nice and it's located in the venetian (one of my favorite hotels in vegas!)"

            "i really wanted to find a great breakfast during this last trip to las vegas. one can get very tired of the standard eggs/bacon/toast combination offered in any of the casino properties.\n\nwhen you think thomas keller or <mark>Bouchon Breakfast</mark> isn't really what comes to mind. located on the 10th floor venezia tower in the venetian hotel, bouchon delivered exactly what i was looking for. as expected the decor was country french however there was a little bit of vegas mixed in through vibrant colors in the tile and murals. \n\nwhile standard breakfast fare was certainly available, the menu including the quiche du jour , sourdough waffles and croque madam. i went for an omlette with sausage, button mushrooms & comte. the perfect fluffy omlette had a great earthy flavor that was truly delightful. it was accompanied by brioche toast with house made cranberry jam, hobbs bacon and a side of pomme frites. i am looking forward to my return here in a few months.", 
            "came in the other week for brunch. experienced a minor wait. host and staff helped immediately to seat. \n\nthere is plenty to look around at walls, ceilings, and decor. not a seat missing out on the sights. \n\nservice was consistent through the meal. food and beverage order was taken. server was well articulated on the specials for the day. i ordered the quiche of the day. also ordered was the <mark>Bouchon Breakfast</mark>. quiche for the day was florentine. the breakfast was a good variety of breakfast classic dishes with protein, egg, potatoe croquette. toast with homemade preserves. all items were hot, seasoned. the quiche was full of fresh spinach and offered with arugula. the crust was nice and fluffy. the egg spinach was plenty more spinach to egg. plenty of flavor. not lacking a thing.\n\noverall good experience leaving me wanting to visit again."

            "among the thomas keller restaurants are the bouchon bistros in yountville, beverly hills and las vegas. i'd been to keller's french laundry in yountville years ago, but this was our first time in bouchon las vegas, highly recommended by my business partner/editor michael perlis, and conveniently located in the venetian where we planned to stay for my husband's recent november birthday. \n\nit started like this:\n\nsommelier eric, who also served as our very attentive waiter, opened a 2000 lynch bages at our table. we had brought in the wine, which was not on their wine list (wine 101ers note that it is not in good taste to bring in a wine that is available on a restaurant's wine list) and eric offered to decant it. i told him i preferred to let it open in our glasses as once it's decanted there's no going back. (not every wine needs decanting, which can age a wine significantly, so if i'm unsure swirling is safer. it took the wine 10 minutes to open up, and when we got to the last glass, i agreed with eric, it could have been decanted.)\n\nnow, back to our meal, as we decided to order oysters eric suggested we go with a nice champagne. i agreed, and it would give our bordeaux more breathing room. after that ed ordered the french onion soup. then, compliments of the chef de cuisine josh crain, much to our delight we were served some incredibly mouth-watering appetizers:\n\nassiette de charcuterie - served with pickled vegetables, dijon mustard & petite baguette.\n\np\\u00e2t\\u00e9 de campagne - country style p\\u00e2t\\u00e9 with watercress, cornichons, radishes & dijon mustard.\n\nsaucisson du jour - house-made sausage.\n\ndinner happened like this:\n\nmama bear had: steak frites - pan-seared prime flat iron, caramelized shallots and ma\\u00eetre d'h\\u00f4tel butter, served with french fries. (i had the saut\\u00e9ed brussels sprouts instead, another of eric's suggestions. i couldn't finish every scrap of my dinner...but i really wanted too!)\n\npapa bear had: steak bouchon - grilled snake river farms' eye of the rib and sauce b\\u00e9arnaise, served with french fries. (ed dipped his fries into his b\\u00e9arnaise too...we all did.)\n\nbaby bear had: p\\u00e2tes du jour - fresh hand-made pasta that night was made with veal, wagyu beef, leeks and fennel. (my daughter commented that she had never had pasta like this in her life. we agreed. it was incredible.)\n\ndesserts to put us over the edge:\n\nagain with chef crain's compliments, our group of three was served these oh-so-delightful treats:\n\nprofiteroles - vanilla ice cream & chocolate sauce.\n\nchocolate mousse.\n\npear tart and sorbet.\n\npumpkin parfait.\n\nthe next day, as we were missing bouchon, we had the ham and <mark>Ham & Cheese Croissant</mark> from the bouchon bakery!\n\nthe surprise kitchen tour:\n\nif you follow along this public photo album link from facebook https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10204323641438583.1073741889.1455706632&type=1&l=a8bf3835d8 you can get a pretty good idea of the food, and the incredible tour.\n\nwe started in the well-lit and sparkling clean kitchen where we met chef crain and dozens of kitchen staff preparing and plating the dinners. also in the same kitchen was a monitor showing three kitchens all at once - live video of other thomas keller kitchens! if that wasn't enough, there was a case that held the daily menus for the other restaurants too.\n\nfrom there, we happily pretended to work off our dinner by strolling past chefs preparing leg of lamb, vegetables and dozens of pastries that would also be served up in their bakery.  \n\nwe strolled more...passing giant mixers, meats, cheeses and more pastries...until we came to the end of our tour in one of three private dining rooms, for both intimate and large meeting groups.\n\nwe had come full circle. we were back at the entrance of bouchon, with nothing left to do but thank eric and the management for getting us started on a gastronomic discovery we had no comparison for.  bravo bouchon."

(i believe it was the canyon creek pools). \n\nservice was great and pretty attentive. \n\ncroissant- good. but unfortunately i just came back from paris so it's hard to be woo'ed when you've had a croissant at the best place in the world to eat one. anyways... \n\n<mark>Fruit Salad</mark>- wanted some fruit to cleanse my palate but this was mistake. just got a few pieces of blueberries, cantaloupe, and melon. i mean, where are the strawberries and kiwi or something else cool and tropical? totally underwhelmed. \n\nchicken and waffles- didn't eat this but cousins ordered it and said it was quite the dish! \n\nmadam croque- a bit underwhelmed considering this is a classic french dish. i honestly could've made this at home, but i was curious to try it at bouchon and it was ok. \n\nsalmon with capers and bread. bf had this and it was solid. \n\nso i wasn't blown away by the food but it was still a nice experience and i give it 3 stars bc it was pleasant and reasonably priced imo. good but not great.", 
            "not impressed!! <mark>Fruit Salad</mark> was 8 dollars, but you only get a hand full of fruits. very small portion. not big fan for their beignets either. their were over cooked and very dry. personally, i believe krispy kreme's doughnuts are even better than this place"

            "our group sat on the patio at lunch time, and the atmosphere was lovely.  service was friendly but a bit slow.  note that their lunch menu is quite small and simple.  it consists of a few sandwiches and salads.  i tried the steak sandwich, which was good but not mind-blowing by any means.  the sandwich came with <mark>North Fork Kettle Chips (2 Oz.)</mark>, and fries are extra.  dessert consisted of double chocolate cookie, chocolate chip cookie, <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark>, and a \"fat boy\" ice cream \"sandwich\".  i place quotes around \"sandwich\" because our waitress said it was a sandwich, the menu says it's a sandwich, but when it arrived at the table, it was an ice cream bar on a stick - the kind you get from an ice cream truck.  vanilla with chocolate and chopped peanuts.  it was also cracked, like someone sat on it.  so, i don't understand this at all.  on a brighter note, the <mark>Chocolate Bouchons</mark> were heavenly - like molten chocolate cake bites.\n\nas far as french bistros go, i would prefer to go to boulud at wynn."

            "everytime i go to vegas, this is the place i go to get quiche. i think you can only get it for brunch so come early! it is so so soo good.!!   the crust is crispy  and the inside of the quiche is different from a lot of other <mark>Quiche</mark> i've had.  other places make the egg overcooked and the crust dry, and either too salty or not salty enough.  bouchon 's quiche is just perfect and delictable!  the inside is not to firm and has the consistency of a flan.   the only negative thing i have about this is that they dont give you enough.  the slice is pretty small and the mixed baby greens they give you on the side is so pitiful!  but... thats okay. im still willing to eat you up my yummy quiche!  \n     i also really love their corned beef hash! its actually real cubed corn beef hash and potatoes...  you may be used to eating the mushy corn beef with oil oozing out from all over! yuck!  bouchon does it best!\n     their croque mademoiselle is probably a 3.5-4*.  i didn't think it was that great. the flavor combination wasn't anything new.  it looks really good, but didn't wow my tastebuds.  however...my friend ordered the special of the day: steak and eggs.  so cliche for brunch but...omg it was delicious! it came with caramelized onions and herbed potatoes in a cast iron skillet... the steak was cooked just right and was very flavorful, but still had the meatiness to it! \n    the environment is really nice.  its an open french restaurant nestled in the back of venetian and away from the hustle and bustle of the loud casino atmosphere.  it has a gorgeous garden pool view and large windows that let in the bright desert sun! love it! \n\n\n\nedit** they are opening one in bev hills! wooooot!", 
            "as i walked in i felt like this place we very fancy but the people were not pretentious at all. their service was excellent and their food was yummy.\n\nthis place is great for groups since they have quite a few round tables like asian restaurants or smaller more intimate areas for couples etc. \n\ni came in for breakfast and so that is all i can review them on. the hostess recommended the croque madame... and i was not disappointed. it is a fancier version of a eggs benedict. i usually do not order benny's but the differences were enough for me to order and enjoy it. a bit oily but since you are in lv... do it!! \n\na trout for breakfast? that was all i could think as my friend ordered this item. as common la folk (hahaha) we didn't know hwat all the facny words meant but basically it was a trout with green beans and almond pieces. while it doesn't sound amazing (and it has its head, not a fillet if you are squemish) it was very good. \n\nflorentine quiche with a side salad was amazing! i never like <mark>Quiche</mark> but this savory custard melted in my mouth. oh my goodness. get it if you do not like fried items like the croque madame. \n\nover all our bill was 98 for four girls and 5 glasses of various juices. \n\nthey also serve a special bread with butter and a special preserve. you must try the preserves even if all you want is rich butter! it is quite tasty and different... like a secret mix of spices and fruit. not quite strawberry and not quite orange marmalade. sadly, the bread was no hot... and i was disappointed more so when some of it was ice cold. \n\nbut being hungry/hung over/tired this is a eloquent place to eat.", 
            "i can't believe i forgot to review this. \n\nokay so i've been here several times over a span of years. been to other thomas keller spots- other bouchons, french laundry,etc. and i am such a big fan of that man. i hope he's there when i dine so i can try to shake that man's hand. \n\nwith that said, i still review it with the food in mind. i'm more critical of chefs i like actually and he lives up to what i enjoy. \n\ni'm a freak about pates, mention this in every spot that offers it and i can always be bought out happily with that, but it's the other stuff that brings me back.\n\neverything else was exceptional.\n\nappetizer- i love the pork belly sausage with anise.this was a wonderful sausage and i really like the dates and vinegrette pair with it.\n\nmain- i've had a leg of lamb with beans dish and a duck breast au poivre and both were executed nicely and cooked right.\n\ndessert- caramel creme and pot de creme. simple and hits the comfort food part of my soul. \n\ni mostly come here for brunch.\n\nlove the croque madame, <mark>Quiche</mark> have been flaky and flavorful, and the mussels served with fries are wonderfully  fresh mussels with a nice saffron wine sauce. the whole thing about his fries being the best- these are good fries but its debatable if its the best...on the other side of the casino is pinot brasserie and i favor their fries more. to each their own- there is no \"best\" out there but the \"best\" to each our taste. chicken and waffles were good but its not fried chicken which i looooveee...separate elements each are yum, but together i can't get past roasted chicken...but the chive and bacon waffle is awesome! . \n\ni have no complaints about service. it is decent and hasn't slipped up much. still it's not the best and the bouchon beverly hills staff is a lot more friendly and attentive to me....and the napa bouchon is the friendliest of the bouchons. \n\nthis is a recommended spot when people ask me about where to brunch on the strip. i support it by being a keller fan, i stand by it because it's solid.", 
            "this is the second time my wife and i have been to bouchon. before this last vegas trip i watched an old episode of anthony bourdain in paris. he and eric rippert were going around eating in both bistros and super fancy, pretentious french restaurants. anyhow, this gave me a massive craving for french food that i needed to satisfy.\n\nknowing that i couldn't afford anything by joel robouchon, and could just barely afford thomas keller, i went for the latter. however, knowing what kind of experience i was going into, perhaps my expectations were a bit too high. yes, the food was perfectly prepared and the service was attentive. yes, i ordered things i did not have the first time around (ordered steak frites, boring but oh so good). still, after spending 218 bucks for two people, i'm not sure i was completely satisfied. \n\nlook, the four stars are based on the overall experience. and yes, i was influenced by the fact that keller has three michelin stars. at the same time, i didn't walk out this time feeling i had creamed my pants. my wife was looking forward to scallops (on the online menu by the way). they didn't have a scallop entree, but did have a special scallop appetizer that they told us they ran out of after my wife ordered it. she settled for some heavenly french onion soup. i ordered the charcuterie platter which was enough for 4 people (ate it all myself). if it came with some proper bread, this could've been my entire meal. \n\nfor our main course my wife had the special sea bass, served with gnocci, eggplant, and shitake mushrooms. i thought the fish was a bit bland, but she seemed to like it. i had the roast leg of lamb, oh so tender with barely a hint of gaminess. it came with this block of something. i don't know what it was, but it had a <mark>Quiche</mark> consistency and it was good. we finished off dinner sharing what we thought were some chocolate covered cream puffs, but the cream turned out to be ice cream. very nice with coffee. \n\nsounds great right? well, we added a bottle of wine for dinner. i figured if one glass cost 10-20 bucks, might as well get an entire bottle for 50 bucks. yes, i hate spending that much, knowing it's a 10 dollar bottle, but they all do that. however, online they advertise a new system they call \"vin de carafe.\" it says they buy a bunch of \"house style\" wine in bulk, serve it in carafes without labels so that people can enjoy wine with their meals at low cost. this is the essence of bistro fair right? well, the waiter had never heard of it and i decided not to press it. disappointed, but overall still a nice experience. definitely go once, but after that spending over 100 bucks a person is up to you.", 
            "bouchon is open for brunch saturdays and sundays with a menu that features a mix of thomas keller breakfast and lunch  inspired dishes. the fiance and i did a power wake-up early sunday morning to ensure  non-queue walk-in status. boom. we were seated right away and started our morning the correct way with coffee and bellinis. the coffee, referred to as \"a medium roast european blend\" was exceptionally smooth. the bellinis were of the classic nature, with peach nectar, bubbly and a raspberry floater - juicy and refreshing. to go with our beverages, we ordered a few pastries. the featured beignets, filled with fresh raspberry pur\\u00e9e, were good, although i was expecting that hot-cooked dough sensation as opposed to something that had been made a few hours ago. we also ordered a pumpkin muffin (before the squash goes extinct for the next 10 months, which we ended up saving for a to-go snack to make room for the mains). \n\nan epi baguette was delivered to our table escorted by fresh butter and strawberry preserves. the bread had a pleasantly crunchy crust and a chewy crumb to it. \n\nchicken and waffles. the bacon-chive waffles were that savory sweet species. you know those mornings where you can't decide if you're feeling like something sweet and charming or like something meaty that will power you through for the rest of the day? these waffles help make that decision for you: drool inducing hits of bacon and a little tang from the chive all smoothed out with sweet waffle batter which is improved in it entirety with tahitian vanilla bean butter served on the side. the chicken is roasted as opposed to the classical fried chicken and waffles combination. the end result deemed to be juicy and flavorful.\n\nquiche due jour: which apparently happens to be florentine more often than not at the vegas location. i am most likely ruined from all other <mark>Quiche</mark> after this one with its healthy dose of spinach and garlic suspended in creamy custard bordered by a flaky buttery crust. a perfectly made quiche. the salad was coated in a red wine (read: raw onion) vinaigrette - buyer beware - my head turned in to a breathing onion odorizer. a shot of listerine should be served upon completion of this dish. or maybe thomas keller just wants to leave a lasting impression. nonetheless it was a fantastic meal and i would gladly return for brunch at any of their locations i happen to be.", 
            "dining at bouchon is always a special treat! i have yet to have the pleasure of coming here for dinner, but i'm a big fan of their weekend brunch. i've celebrated my birthday here and took the day off from work to do so - which was totally worth it. they do not take reservations for brunch, so you have to come and give your name, but i've never waited too long. even during my bachelorette party weekend, where they said the table for 8+ was 45 minutes, we got seated in 10 minutes. if there is a wait, they have a cute little seating area and usually pastries for you to sample. they have some daily specials, like a quiche of the day or soup of the day. their <mark>Quiche</mark> are perfectly soft and pillowy on the inside. i'm actually not a huge fan of their chicken & bacon chive waffles, but since everyone else raves about them, don't let my opinion stop you. one of my must orders is a side of fries - though i do wish they gave slightly bigger portions of ketchup and mayo, i always feel like such a classless fool when i have to ask for more. if you're with a larger group of people, the pastry basket is always a nice way to start off brunch as well while your entrees come in. i was so hungover and sick during the morning of my bachelorette weekend, i couldn't enjoy eating here. i sustained myself on ginger ale and their tasty cauliflower soup, while i watched everyone enjoy their mussels and steaks. i did have some of the foie gras that was ordered for the table - amazingly silky, and a big hit with all the californians. i was so jealous of everyone's enjoyment, my husband and i ate here the next weekend so i could enjoy bouchon like how it's meant to be enjoyed. i actually prefer sitting inside since it's beautifully decorated. the outside patio is right next to the pool and some bodies are just not meant to be looked at while you eat brunch. their champagne cocktails are all really interesting, so you don't have to be basic and get a mimosa, there are a ton of other options. one of my favorite things to eat here is actually complimentary - i love eating their warm baguettes with the mustard on the table while my husband prefers spreading jam and butter on it. \n\ni will  definitely be back here several more times and hopefully get to enjoy their dinner menu soon.", 
            "crouche madame is incredible. the fries are enough to share and the best fries i've ever had. my wife got the quiche and liked it but it was slightly softer or more whipped than most <mark>Quiche</mark>. still delicious."
