            "since returning from houston a couple of months ago, i found myself craving crawfish any chance i get.  after experiencing the crawfish craze in the westminster area of southern california, imagine my delight when i saw the sign for \"hot n juicy crawfish\" in las vegas.\n\nthe bf and i anxiously awaited the opening of this first of its kind restaurant in sin city and finally got to sit down to dinner the past sunday.  inviting a couple of newbies made the dining experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nwe started off with a pound each of the crawfish in every flavor - <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and hot n juicy combo.  at $8.99/lb, it was a dollar more than socal prices but we were okay with it.  for every two pounds you order, you get one corn and one potato.  so, we made sure we got our corn pieces and <mark>Potato</mark> and were able to choose what flavor we wanted it in.  (in the end, we ordered additional corn and potato on the side, corn runs about 50 cents each.)  we also threw an order of sausage ($2.50 for half a dozen or $4.00 for a dozen).  depending on the season, they should be offering <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, and shrimp.  you can also order oysters, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> or oyster baskets, catfish po-boy sandwich, or a basket of fries.\n\nthey didn't ask us how spicy we wanted our crawfish, later on telling us they automatically make it spicy unless otherwise stated.  the heat was a good amount, not too hot that it was unbearable and enough where we reached for our beverages.  of the four, i would say the <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> had the least flavor while the hot n juicy combo had the most.  we ordered four more pounds of the hot n juicy combo in this sitting.  the sausage was actually spicier than the crawfish!  we also found the crawfish to be pretty clean overall.  we're ones to suck up all the juices from the heads too, so they gotta be clean.  and i gotta admit, the last two pounds we had were especially good.  they do a good job on having cleaner crawfish than other places i've experienced.\n\nbe sure to get the salt and pepper mixture too.  you get a bowl of cut up limes and you squeeze all the lime juice into the little plastic cup and mix it all together.  this is usually meant for you to dip your crawfish in, but i found myself not needing it that much.\n\nservice was better too.  upon entering, they line your table up with the white plastic covering and lay out a roll of paper towels.  they also provide bibs too.  you can ask for plastic gloves, but they just get in the way.  they asked us often if we needed refills on our beverages and how we were doing overall.  (i would say this is probably because they are a new restaurant, i only hope they continue with this service in the future.)\n\nthey had a steady flow of customers this holiday weekend night.  it didn't get too busy, but they were never empty either.\n\nin conclusion, the four of us were pleased with our experience at hot n juicy crawfish.  it looks like we'll be coming back here a lot!  yay!\n\nside note: there's a 17% gratuity added for parties of six or more.\n\n(you can check out my food photos up above!)", 
            "sorry people but im going to have to be the fly in the ointment here. i got a chance to go to hot and juicy last weekend to see what all the hub bub was all about. and yes i saw it on man v food and it looked interesting. all the great reviews on here didnt hurt either. well i walked in and it was kinda plain but thats fine. the girl seated us and gave us menus to look over. i was going to order the shrimp instead of the crawfish until the waitress came over. she made the crawfish sound so good i caved and ordered a pound of them. i also ordered a pound of the <mark>King Crab</mark> and some sausage. my mom ordered the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and frys. \n    the girl brought out our food and it smelled incredible. i ripped into the bag of crawfish in hopes that i was really in for a treat. well i have come to a conclusion, theres nothing edible on crawfish!!! these things fought me every step of the way. i worked my ass off just to get a \"tinny\" piece of tale meat. the waitress said they were actually bigger than normal. i would hate the see the regular ones. the flavor of the sauce was absolutely fantastic. i went with the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> medium. the sausage dipped in the sauce was out of this world but the crawfish was a miserable failure. i ended up ordering a pound of the shrimp as well.\n    now the shrimp was another issue. i am not a big fan of whole shrimp. i dont want the head on with all the little hairs all over and the whole thing. if they had been cleaned before cooking it would have been much better. i didnt eat allot of them because of this. the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> were pretty good but i should have ordered the same sauce instead of the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>. \n    hot and juicy was kinda fun and the 2 waitresses were really sweet and fun to chat with. i dont think i will be coming but though. i do wish them the best.", 
            "first experience at hnj last night as part of the uye (unofficial yelp event) and i had a good time. there were a good 18 or so of us there and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. the servers were very friendly and helpful. the place was packed but the food came out really quick once it was ordered. i had blanche meet me there and neither of us were into the whole eating crawfish and messy thing so we took the easy way out and got some baskets.\ni ordered the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> basket (10pieces) for around $10.00 and a side order of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> for $4.50. blanche ordered the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> that comes with fries for $9 and change.\nthe <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> was delicious. cooked perfectly and nice size pieces of shrimp. however, at pretty much a dollar a shrimp i thought it was very overpriced.\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> i could eat every day. so good. a bit overpriced at nearly $5 for a medium size basket of fries but oh well.\nbeer was $2.50 for domestics and $3 for imports. not bad. was a little disappointed to have them run out of bud light after the first one i ordered. i usually don't like switching beers once i start drinking one but i made an exception to try a blue moon.\noverall it was a cool place and everyone else seemed to be having fun \"playing\" with their food. or maybe its \"working\" on their food because it seemed like it got difficult at times.\non a last note.. i do wish they would work on the temperature in their. i think it was cooler outside.", 
            "we ate here for dinner tonight and yes, i am officially a fan!  we always drive by this place and the parking lot is always packed.  i've also been hearing about it a lot.  it was also featured on man vs. food.  didn't need any more reasons to stop by here.  so we decided on dinner here tonight.  we got here at 9 on a tuesday night, mind you, and the parking lot was packed as usual.  we were lucky enough to get a parking spot and unfortunately there was a 30 min. wait for the 4 of us.  i don't mind waiting for food as long as it's good food!  \nwe actually ran across the street to the crown and anchor to grab a beer while we waited.  the bartender there told us that that was pretty common.   \nso we get seated 30 min later and we're ready!  we started with 2 lbs of crawfish, 2 lbs of shrimp, 2 lbs of <mark>King Crab</mark> legs all wth the hot n juicy marinade, spicy.  we also ordered <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, corn and <mark>Potato</mark> and a round of beers.   the tables are lined with a garbage bag and there is a roll of paper towels for each table.  no silverware.  the food started coming out really fast, within 5 minutes of ordering.  they are deiivered in plastic bags.  oh man, the crawfish was delicious! hot and juicy of course and the seasoning was so spicy and addictive.  my mouth was on fire inside and out!  but i couldnt stop!  everything was really good.  spicy, buttery and garlicy....yum!  we ended up ordering 2 more lbs of crawfish, 1 more lb of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and some more corn.  oh man, the corn was to die for.  sweet, but so spicy. \n a very messy meal and you kinda have to work for your food but it was definitely worth it!  the prices were reasonable as well.  i will definitely go back here.", 
            "soooooo delicious!!!!!! i love love love how affordable it is too! ordered two pounds of crawfish, one order <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and fried catfish, all for four people, and it was definitely enough. i'm not sure if that's because i drank so much water that i became full. however, i love their sauce, you must go for their specialty! really good asian blend of spices mixed with new orleans yummyness. i do have to admit that maybe about 10+ <mark>Crawfish</mark> in my tongue and mouth started to burn, but that wasn't going to make me stop eating!\n\nok i have to admit that the <mark>Crawfish</mark> are a bit tiny, but the best part of it all is that you're suppose to suck it all. not just eat the meat, but the brains/roes. for real! the corn was delicious after it absorbed all the flavor and it was so juicy!\n\n<mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> great, so was the catfish. i'm not sure what batter they use, but it's amazing. nice and crusty and oh sooo full of flavor! i like how the shrimp was butterflied open, and the catfish was so juicy inside. not overdone at all. complaint was the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>...not enough cajun seasoning. \n\ni'm definitely having more cravings....i want some now! will they deliver to ca? that would be great!", 
            "man v food is one of my favorite shows and you always hear adam say how great every single place he stops off at is. i always wonder if everywhere can be that amazing. i actually came to this place randomly with my girlfriend when we were in las vegas and she was craving crawfish. we came here before we knew it was on the show and we had no idea what to expect.\n\nwe came on a saturday afternoon and the place was completely empty. we were the only customers in the building... for a saturday afternoon i didnt see that as being a good sign. we ordered a pound of crawfish, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and i ordered myself some deep <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>.\n\ni was not a fan of the crawfish, but most notably the sauce. we got mild or medium and it just wasnt very good. the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> was over battered and the shrimp did not taste fresh at all. i ended up not finishing the shrimp, and i ate fries most of the time i was there. my girlfriend finished the crawfish, didnt like it very much. we left and both agreed that we probably wont be back to this location again.\n\nwe were definitely comparing this place to boiling crab and nothing really compares to boiling crab.\n\n\nthe positives. the service was pretty good and friendly :)", 
            "omg....this stuff is like crack! this is what i'm going to miss from vegas. \n\nmy sister, brother and friend went on sunday afternoon and we ordered:\n\nsoft shell crab - it was good and the fries had a kick to it.\netouffee - flavorful and pretty spicy.\n1 lb. crawfish - lots of work, but fun to eat.\n1 lb. clams - these were actually pretty disappointing. also, seemed to be more empty shells than clams.\n1 lb. shrimp - omg....i'm not a big shrimp fan, but i ate so many of these.\n\nwe went back monday with two other friends and ordered:\n\n<mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> - these were ok, but the batter was a bit too thick.\n<mark>Cajun Fries</mark> - still had a kick to it.\n2 lb. crawfish extra corn - still was good\n2 lb. shrimp - yum!\n2 lb. snow crab - oh these were good too, but one of our friend inhaled most of it.......i know not to go with him again.\n1 lb. clams - yeah, i would stay away from these as they are not worth it.\n7 <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> corn - these were so good. we ordered 4 first and we ended up ordering an additional 3. must try these!\n\nwe ordered mild for all of it and it does make your tongue and lips burn, but seems to fade away by the time you leave. i am definitely going to go crazy next time and try......medium! =)\n\ni thought the staff was awesome. there was a mix up and they ended up giving us 1 lb. snow crab on the house which most places wouldn't. awesome!\n\ni also thought the prices to be very reasonable! \n\ncan't wait to go back! this is going to our place to go when in vegas.", 
            "great place if you like it hot n spicy!!!  i ordered fresh oysters on a half shell which was great served over a platter of ice.  the fried catfish was great but i would probably not do the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> with it breaded.  the shrimp without the breading would probably be best.  overall it was packed in there and the food was great!!!  i would definitely come back again and its perfect for small groups!", 
            "this restaurant lives up to it's name.  wow it was good.  a friend took us to this restaurant and my wife really enjoyed it.  so on our last trip to vegas, she had to go back.  it was just as good as the first time.  restaurant offers no plates that i know of, so it can get messy.  recommend any of the boiled items - we had the shrimp and crawfish and to steer away from the fried stuff (the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> was nothing special).", 
            "i have heard good things about this place for a while and have driven past both locations pretty often. however, i have never really wanted to try hot n juicy crawfish because i am kind of like a cat, lol. i don't like messy eating and if i am going to go out and pay for my food, i prefer all the work to be done for me, if you know what i mean. \n\nthe in-laws were in town and have been wanting to eat here, so we finally came here for dinner the other night. we arrived at just the right time because there were a few tables still open and we were seated right away. 10 minutes later, the restaurant was full and many people were waiting outside. we had no luck with parking. the parking lot is very small and we had to park across the street. \n\nmy husband and the in-laws ordered a variety of seafood: <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, clams, shrimp crawfish, and catfish. \n\ntheir opinions:\n- the shrimp and catfish were the best\n- the crawfish required too much work for too little meat\n- the crab was very hard to take apart\n- \"mild\" was still pretty spicy\n\ni ordered the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. i know, boring right? the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> wasn't very good. i think that the size was decent, but there was just too much breading on them. after eating 2 pieces, i didn't want anymore. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were standard, nothing special. \n\ni'm glad i tried it, but i don't think i would come back again because i didn't enjoy it too much. however, i will give this place 4 starts because my family thought it was alright and had a good time. service was friendly and attentive. we even had nice neighbors who showed us what they had ordered and commented on what tasted good.\n\njust a few tips:\n- do not wear nice clothing because juices will squirt everywhere and you will get dirty!\n-remember to take a shower and do laundry asap because you will smell like the restaurant even after you leave! skin, hair, clothes, everything!", 
            "to me i thought hot n juicy was just like boiling crab, everything tasted the same except i thought their <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> basket was delicious.\nit seems like they fried their shirmp in corn meal which gave it a tasty bite and crunch.\ni think that was the only difference and you don't have to wait an 1 1/2 hour in line like boiling crab in garden grove.\nprices i think are a little more expensive but hey they got to ship everything to vegas...\ni would come back esp. for the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>.", 
            "i had heard so much about this place, i finally met up with some friends for lunch to try it out!\ndo not come here if you are afraid of getting a little messy! i ordered a pound of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and, after a little hesitation, dug right in! i have never had crab that you had to actually crack open the shell, it was very different! i absolutely loved it. my friends ordered the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> basket, rolls, corn, and crawfish. we left the restaurant with full stomachs and smiles. :-) i would reccommend this place to anyone who likes seafood!", 
            "i first went to hnj on a saturday afternoon.  although it was crowded, we got right in with no wait.  we each had a pound of crawfish with the special, which is the mix of the various flavors.  we also got it on the \"medium hot\" side.  i like stuff hot, but i have heard they can really put the heat on, so i was a little concerned about ordering it straight up hot.  we also got some <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> with french fries to share.\n\nthe crawfish is delicious, but you have to work to get them.  they have so little meat, i would recommend shelling quite a few before eating.  in subsequent trips, my wife has had the shrimp, which are of course much larger.  they have a much better pay off, but don't have the delicious heads to suck out like the crawfish do.\n\ni was surprised by how good the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> was.  it's probably the best i have had in the valley.  the coating was crunchy, but not overly thick or greasy.  and, they are large.  this was surprising and certainly welcome.  \n\nall in all, hnj lives up to its considerable hype after being featured on so many tv shows.  give it a shot.", 
            "we saw an episode of man vs food for this place just before our vegas trip, so we brought the hubby here for father's day.  this location had the man vs. food banner  so we knew we were in the right place.  we had to circle to get a parking spot.  it was 90 degrees outside, but comfy inside.  we were able to snag one of the last tables. the other tables had families with kids, couples, and friends. the wait staff was all young and friendly.  we ordered a pound of shrimp in garlic sauce and a pound in the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce, mild for both.  they were nice size shrimp.  the flavor of the sauce was great and the shrimp tasted fresh.  the tables were covered with plastic and they had plastic gloves for us.   a big roll of papertowels was on the table.  it was messy.  the shrimp comes tied up in a plastic bag.  the kids got chicken nuggets and <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> with fries, which came in a little basket and they were okay.  we didn't like the etoufee with rice that we ordered.  the flavor wasn't what we were use to, but the texture and rice seemed normal.  \nmy family doesn't like the shrimp heads, so lucky me, i got them all.  i didn't eat them all, but i ate quite a few.  i didn't feel well afterwards, maybe it was the shrimp heads.  hubby and kids were fine.  i normally have a pretty iron stomach, so i would try it again.", 
            "stopped by on our way home from vegas. the food was good, i actually like their sauce better than boiling crab (la). however, the waitress def could not explain the spice levels to us, they way she talked about the food made me not order as much as i normally do. she basically said the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are too hot, and to order the mild sauce because the medium is too hot for her. this was after i told her i like spicy foods. i def could of gone for the medium sauce, and i probably would of tries the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> if she didn't dissuade me from getting them. not a great way to sell your product! would of given then 4 stars but they made one of my friend <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> instead of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>, it took foreeverrrr for it to get corrected and they still handed is a bill with the <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> (their mistake). would go back but they need to work on their service.", 
            "atmosphere was great. love the fact that you can get messy and not everyone will look at you weird. the waitresses we're ok. i had the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> basket and it was yummy. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> we're so yummy but they fried my mouth but i couldn't stop eating them. \nmy husband had the craw fish and then the shrimp. i wasnt a fan of the craw fish (too much work for to little food) but the shrimp was soo good. also the corn fritters are to die for. it's definitely a place to try and not everyone is going to love.", 
            "where do i begin? i am a little lost for words for this place. unfortunately, i wasn't a fan of boiling crab, so i was looking forward to an improved experience at hot n juicy crawfish. boy, was i wrong! since i'm not a fan of peeling <mark>Shrimp</mark> and breaking off the head, i decided to order calamari. i love calamari, so i was looking forward to them; specially after a four hour drive. unfortunately, my taste buds went through an awful experience. the calamari looked pale, texture was soggy, and undercook! how in the world can you mess up something that goes in the fryer?! second, the batter had no seasoning and it tasted plain. i was so disappointed, because i really wanted to like this place. however, our waitress was very accommodating and apologized; although, it wasn't her fault. the waitress offered to comp my food and asked if i wanted to order something different. i was very pleased with her customer service, but said no after getting something raw. i was afraid of food poisoning; specially, since i'm in vegas. \n\ngreat customer service earned this place two stars and their <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>. the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> tasted fresh and it was fried all the way. in my opinion, they serve better shrimp than boiling crab. as for the seasoning, it tasted the same, so don't expect to be wowed. my sister wasn't in the mood to eat seafood, so she ordered chicken nuggets with <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. the chicken nuggets are not fresh, but frozen, and they taste like they've been in their fridge for weeks. so, parents beware when you take your children to this restaurant. also, if you're the type of person that likes to wait till everyone is served, your food will definitely get cold here. they don't bring all the entrees at the same time, but what ever comes out faster from the kitchen. i was the last one to be served, so you can only imagine how much i was looking forward to their calamari. those of you who like different type of hot sauces for your oysters, they only carry tabasco sauce. i wouldn't recommend this place, but you be the judge!", 
            "the crab is finger licking good.  we had the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> crab, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  the crab had so much flavor and spice, i really wanted some more.  the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> was also good, i loved the breading.  i also got a side of potato and corn to go with the crab but i feel like that should come with the bag of crab already since it was so small.  it was like half a corn and a really small potato.", 
            "first time at hot n juicy crawfish.  service was excellent. we tried a pound of <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> crawfish and a pound of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>.  both were very good although there's not a lot of meat on each crawfish and they are not easy to peel, so you are left wishing you had ordered more.  a fun and unique place to go with a group and the utter messiness of it all is mitigated with the plastic aprons and gloves that the restaurant provides.  i recommend giving it a try.", 
            "hostess was nice, waiter was stoned and acted tired, annoyed, and confused when we had questions, being it was our first time there. he said look at the menu everything is on there. paid 60 for 4 <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, they tasted good, but they forgot to bring out half our order. they acted rude when we suggested they forgot half our order. corn was good, <mark>King Crab</mark> was great. next time i will stick to <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and crawfish for the value. over all the food was over priced, tasted ok, but the service was terrible. the plastic bag thing was interesting, but it was loud with no music. bathrooms were disgusting!", 
            "at last count there were two hot n juicy crawfish locations in las vegas, but i have it on good authority that this is the one you want, at 4810 spring mountain road. my husband and i were steered towards this one, further away though it is, by a reliable local, which is the kind of good advice you want when choosing an off-strip, local neighborhood place. driving from the strip, you actually have to pass a hot n juicy crawfish (in chinatown) to get to the \"right\" hot n juicy crawfish.\n\nlocated on a busy multi-lane road chock-a-block with shopping centers and fast food, hot n juicy crawfish doesn't look like much from outside. or inside, for that matter -- a decent-sized space looks smaller than it is because of so many ragtag tables squeezed together, it's usually packed, it's loud, and i wouldn't exactly call it clean. you're in the middle of the desert but the vibe is carefree beachside -- the floor is a mess and most diners are wearing plastic bibs, happily covered in sauce. you order at a counter, from a menu posted on the wall overhead, and they call you when your order is ready. \n\nthough you can get baskets of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, wings and chicken nuggets, hot n juicy crawfish put their signature item right in their name. when you order the crawfish, there's a method. no \"crawfish nazis\" here -- the staff will kindly help you out if you're a first-timer. you order your crawfish by the pound, then you pick a seasoning, then you pick a spice level. for seasoning, you pick from <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> or a <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. spice levels range from mild to \"holy s@#t.\" that's not what they call it, that's what i called it. if you like spicy, you love this stuff.\n\nthe best experience is to go off-hours with a group, get an assortment of seasonings and spice levels, get some cold beers and have a blast. wear something washable, yer gonna get messy!", 
            "great experience, the service was excellent, especially michael. it's a little strange with all the plastic table cloths, food bags, and bibs. when the restroom ran out of soap and was a little nasty, they jumped on the cleaning. i really like the responsiveness of the staff. \n\nnow for the food, we had alaskan <mark>King Crab</mark>($27/lb) with garlic and butter, snow crab($18/lb) hot and spicy style, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> with <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and corn fritters. everything was good. the spicy version of hot and spicy was enough to numb my lips for the first 5 minutes. burn baby burn! we needed a few beers to quell the fires in our mouths. don't expect fine dining. the atmosphere is extremely casual with dance/club music playing throughout, basic bench and wood chair seating, aluminum siding accents, tvs spaced out on the walls, and tank top clad young ladies and t-shirt wearing men serving the tasty food in plastic bags. \n\nso, this is not a first date place, wouldn't be very impressive to a potential mate. but for the family, friends, or long-time mate, it's fun. ask for the mild versions and work up to the heat ladder. i can handle straight thai peppers and fresh serranos. so believe me when i say they can make it hot.", 
            "i've heard from a couple people that hot and juicy is better than boiling crab.  they say its more flavorful so i went with a group of friends to try it out.  i love boiling crab!  the only thing stopping me from eating it so often is the wait, and the calories!\n\nwhen i went on a tuesday night it was relatively empty.  the place looks like a boiling crab and the concept is pretty much the same.   menu is about the same too.  they have fresh oysters, the seafood boils, corn, potato, fried catfish, gumbo, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> etc.  for the four of us, we ordered 5 pounds of food.  4 pounds of shrimp in every flavor except <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, 4 <mark>Corn</mark>, and 1 pound of clams in the hot and juicy sauce. \n\nthe food came quickly...and we were ready.  this place offers gloves but i say ditch it.  they are big and bulky and get in the way and in the end, your hands get soaked in the garlicky buttery oil anyways.  the hot and juicy flavor is by far my favorite.  we went with medium and there is a spicy kick to it.  not too bad because i'm not one who can handle a whole lot of spice.  some of the shrimp were overcooked so it was crumbling when i peeled it (minus one star).  i forgot what the other flavors were but i remember peeling the shrimp in the other bags and dipping it in the hot and juicy sauce.  corn was really good too!  corn is always my favorite thing to eat at places like this so i'm glad it was sweet and juicy.\n\nthe clams were very flavorful.  they soak in the sauce way better than shrimp.  you just get less food for the money though.\n\nall in all i really like this place and will definitely come back.  i do think that they don't fully give you one pound of food.  i mean we each ate 1.25 pounds of food.  we killed everything!  and at boiling crab i usually only order 1/2 pound of shrimp with 2 <mark>Corn</mark> and am stuffed.\n\nthe sauce here is also a lot thinner.  boiling crab is thick with tons of garlic bits but this was more watery.  i personally like a thicker sauce so its easier to grab with my shrimp.  room for improvement but i would come here any day over the hour wait.", 
            "brought our parents here all craving some yummy crab and catfish. they delivered! we had 6 kiddos with us too. they placed us at a big table, explained the menu & gave us great service. its not a fancy place, casual dining, and thats one of the things we enjoyed about it. eating crab in this setting was perfect! \n\nthey also gave us a brief tutorial on how to eat crawfish (cool experiance for the kiddos too) and brought us samples of it for us all to try (kids included)\n\nfood: <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> (served whole, which means legs and body) with the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce. was over a pound, so cost more but worth it because it tasted so good. the sauce was the  bomb! level of spice we ordered was called \"baby\" (lowest on the scale) it was just spicy enough for us weaklings.\nsnow crab (<mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>) were sweet and large. our 9 year old ordered this with just butter sauce since she doesnt like hot spice. it was delicious just like that.\nthere are 4 different sauces, one of which is all 4 mixed together. my mother in law ordered that with her crab and it was  pretty tasty. \nkids got <mark>Chicken Wings Basket</mark> with fries, they were big so the little ones shared. and the father in law ordered basket of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and fried catfish. he is a harsh critic, who loved the catfish! i didnt even have a chance to taste it!\nthe only food we didnt like much was the corn fritters. too sweet and batter was not authentic. \n\nservice: great. all the waitresses there seemed on the ball and helped us out.  \n\npretty busy place, not impressive from the outside, but who cares? the crab is tasty and not too expensive. its served in a bag with all the sauce, you wear a plastic bib, even plastic gloves if you want them. the only thing that would make me happier is good beer on tap. they only serve bottles. give it a try. its yummy!"

            "finally (after the 6th mention of \"i'd really like to try hot & juicy\"), we made it there last night.  we ordered the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark> legs (<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>- mild) and the pound of shrimp (hot & juicy- medium) and corn on the cob. \n\nfirst off, if you don't want to do a little work for your food, don't come here. you have to crack the crabs, peel the shrimp, etc. second, it is messy, but that is part of the fun. we wore the plastic bibs, we went through a roll of napkins and we still had sauce everywhere and we put all the shells right on the garbage bag wrapped table.  \n\nwe both personally enjoyed the <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> sauce on the crab just a little more then the hot & juicy we had on the shrimp. i think it would have been better for us to order mild, because the medium was still really spicy. we liked the catfish, but we took the breading off and dipped it in our cajun sauce. it was really good that way! the fries that came with the catfish were so-so, nothing to write home about. the <mark>King Crab</mark> was a little over $20 for two legs. i would have liked a little more of that, it didn't seem like a whole pound to me but man was it good. i had to have my boyfriend crack it for me though cause <mark>King Crab</mark> legs will stab you repeatedly in the hands if you suck at cracking them. \n\ni have never eaten anything with the head still attached (well at least not that i can recall). i thought it would bother me, but when the shrimp came, i just tore that sucker apart and dug in. well worth the work, i must say.  the corn was delicious as well. yum. overall, a great place and lots of fun. i would really recommend it!!", 
            "hot and juicy crawfish - don't know if there are other places to eat <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> crawfish but this place is pretty good. best place in vegas for now! haha. the <mark>Crawfish</mark> are pretty decent size and the spices are good. unlike other places i have had, when u tell them mild, it is mild. when you tell them medium, its medium and so forth. the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> is so-so here. i have had better, i don't like the way it is breaded. the dungeoness crab is very good. they tend to run out so if you are going there for dungeoness, you may want to call before hand. my boyfriend won a contest with 4 other people.... 20 lbs is 5 minutes! hahahahahah!\n\n\ni prefer boiling crab in oc & alhambra and everywhere (they are a chain/franchise) but this is as good as it is gonna get in vegas til they open one!", 
            "during my vegas trip, i decided to stop by a crawfish restaurant! my friends and i were craving so we yelped out this place and decided to give it a try. being drunk the entire day gave us the biggest drink coma ever so we didnt get a cab til 1020 and didn't arrive here until 1040. service was great even when we came late and stayed super late.\n\nwe ordered hot n juicy crawfish and shrimp along with the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>. the catfish was pretty good and the fries were good too! surprisingly we actually finished the fries and the catfish. we ordered the crawfish/shrimp in med. because the server was persistent about noting how spicy medium really is. the sauce was good but a tad bit salty and not really the cajun texture i really like. as for spice level, medium isn't really that spicy. my friend and her bf can't eat spicy stuff but they were able to eat the medium with no hesitation. i liked the potato that was in the bag yum. the crawfish were huge and the shells were soft so i didn't leave with bloody pricked fingers= ]. the shrimp; however, were a little small and the heads were kind of bitter. we weren't able to finish it cuz we were so full already!\n\ni wonder why crawfish is priced differently in different areas? over here its 11$/lb. the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> was 9 or 10$. it's about the same as in san jose. in la it's 8$/lb and a <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> is about 8$. interesting! oh and they need to do something with the restroom because it's pretty dirty and a little gross.\n\nbtw hot n juicy is coming to sf:)", 
            "i love this place! a few people have mentioned they saw this place on man vs food, that's what happened to us too. saw it, then decided to check it out while we were in town. a no-frill place outside & inside, plastic sheets on the table with a roll of paper towel. they serve mainly seafood (shrimp, crawfish, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, fried fish, etc). your seafood comes with your choice of seasoning, which also comes with your choice of spiciness levels. i picked the hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning in mild, which it still had a bit of a bite to it, with a robust garlic flavor. i loved it.\n\nyour seafood is delivered to your table in a plastic bag, and if you order any potato or corn on the side, they come in the same bag too, along with the seafood & seasonings. my husband ordered the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> and he said they were good. no utensils, just you, your plastic bibs and your hands. so it does get quite messy. i ordered  pound each of crawfish, shrimp & <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>. just get down to cracking with my food & a few bottles of beer made for a nice, relaxed lunch while on vacation. \n\nthe staff were nice & friendly. since we were first-timers the girl who seated us explained the different seasonings & spice levels. she was very responsive, replenishing our drinks & clearing up items as we finish. \n\nnot cheap, but seafood usually isn't. i thought the market prices were fair. this will definitely become my vegas spot to re-visit next time i come in town.", 
            "first experience at hnj last night as part of the uye (unofficial yelp event) and i had a good time. there were a good 18 or so of us there and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. the servers were very friendly and helpful. the place was packed but the food came out really quick once it was ordered. i had blanche meet me there and neither of us were into the whole eating crawfish and messy thing so we took the easy way out and got some baskets.\ni ordered the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> basket (10pieces) for around $10.00 and a side order of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> for $4.50. blanche ordered the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> that comes with fries for $9 and change.\nthe <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> was delicious. cooked perfectly and nice size pieces of shrimp. however, at pretty much a dollar a shrimp i thought it was very overpriced.\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> i could eat every day. so good. a bit overpriced at nearly $5 for a medium size basket of fries but oh well.\nbeer was $2.50 for domestics and $3 for imports. not bad. was a little disappointed to have them run out of bud light after the first one i ordered. i usually don't like switching beers once i start drinking one but i made an exception to try a blue moon.\noverall it was a cool place and everyone else seemed to be having fun \"playing\" with their food. or maybe its \"working\" on their food because it seemed like it got difficult at times.\non a last note.. i do wish they would work on the temperature in their. i think it was cooler outside.", 
            "i don't see what the big deal is about this place.\n\nyes, the corn is overcooked and not plump.\n\nyes, the sauce does taste watered-down.\n\njust a fun thing to do when in vegas, i suppose.\n\ni do think the fried catfish was tasty, though.\n\nordered: 1 lb frozen craw fish (not in season anyway so who cares), 1 lb shrimp, <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>, and 2 corn.", 
            "this is definitely off the beaten path if you are one of those types of people that live for the strip and all of its foo-foo overpriced eateries. located about two miles from the strip, give or take a few feet, hot n juicy is located in vegas' \"chinatown\", although i saw more vietnamese and korean joints than i did chinese. \n\nfirst of all......if you are waiting outside the front door, beware the ramp located by the disabled parking spot! its made out of the same asphalt that the rest of the parking lot is made out of, and the wife didn't see it, and she ate shit............please be careful. \n\nwith that being said, we went this past sunday, (05/29/11), and it was jam packed. right away, they let us know that they just opened up another location down the street, but we politely declined and toughed out the wait. for our party of 10, which we said didn't mind having split up if it got us in faster, the wait time was only about 30-40 minutes, and they told us it would be about as much. \n\nwhen we were seated, the waitress was kind enough to explain the flavors and levels of spiciness and she was right on. getting right into it, we tried the shrimp (<mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> and <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, both mild), the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> with fries, the corn on the cob, and the steamed rice. \n\nshrimp- \n\nbig, fat, juicy, and oh so tasty. unlike other places similar to this one, the sauces they used for both types we tried were kind of thin in terms of thickness (?), but very, very, very flavorful. we've been to places that the sauce is almost sandy or chalky, but here, it is like a nice shrimp stock, and we easily and most enjoyably poured it all over our steamed rice, which made it that much better! \n\ncatfish- \n\nthe <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> comes with fries. fries, who can f those up? not these guys! crisp, crunchy, and salty. perfect the way a fry should be. the catfish, perfectly cooked, comes in a nice <mark>Corn</mark> type of coating that adds a little extra crunch. only problem is, they only give you about a fillet and a half, if that. i've been to places where they give you almost 3 fillets and that would have to be my only bitch about the fish. \n\nsides- \n\ncorn on the cob was awesome. boiled, buttery, sweet, and not overcooked. simplicity at its finest. \n\nsteamed rice- ditto. simple, yet delicious. \n\noverall experience- \n\nthe wait was expected. it was out the door just like other people said. waitresses were very helpful, but with the exception of the first refill, were slow on the next couple. as far as ordering more food, they were spot on. i'd come back over here for sure, and i'd bring my friends too. if you don't mind a wait, or taking the roads less traveled, be brave and head this way!", 
            "i'm comparing this to boiling crab...it's not as good and here's why...the sauce is different, kinda tastes like they put cream in there, not worse just different. the clams were not washed well and had sand bits in them. anyone who's bit into a grain of sand knows what i'm talking about. the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> was more expensive, had a subpar batter and had much less catfish than they give at bc. one thing i'll give them credit for is their shrimp...big and super fresh. bc has tendency for old shrimp that become mushy, so this is one area bc could improve on.", 
            "i wanted to celebrate my friends birthday on my day off so i decided to treat her and her fiance to some hot and juicy crawfish.  i grew up in so cal where boiling crab reigns supreme, and after moving to vegas i've had an empty void that needed filling.  i saw the man vs food episode and i've read the reviews before stepping in, so i came in excited, hungry and craving crawfish.   \n\nbetween the 3 of us this is what we ordered. dozen <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>, 2# shrimp <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> very spicy with corn and sausage, and 1# crawfish <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> medium spicy.\n\nthe only complaint about the service was that our <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, which should have been the first thing to come out, showed up on the table last.\n\n<mark>Raw Oysters</mark>- accompanied by cocktail sauce, lemons, horse radish and tabasco.  i'm a big fan of oysters and these were decent in size (comparable to hama hama), but without any accompaniments they were very bland.  oysters are suppose to taste like the sea, but these were washed so much they tasted watery and flavorless.  \n\n<mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>- breaded in a <mark>Corn</mark> crust served over a bed of french fries and accompanied by ketchup and tartar sauce.  personally i'm not a big fan of <mark>Corn</mark> breading, but i can't really hold that against the establishment and their recipe.  catfish was moist and flaky and had a hint of cayenne which perfected the \"southern\" flavor.  i actually enjoyed this the most.  \n\nshrimp <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> very spicy-  we ordered this with corn and sausage, both of which were awesome.  the corn was sweet and complimented the spice well. the sausage was spicy and tender and added a bold meaty flavor to the sauce for the shrimp.  the \"<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>\" sauce isn't as flavorful as i expected, and the \"very spicy\" here is comparable to  \"medium spicy\" at boiling crab.  but the flavor was decent and the shrimp themselves were \"okay\".  not the freshest shrimp i've ever had but they weren't rotten or anything, but what can you really expect in the middle of the desert? \n\ncrawfish <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> medium spicy-  i'm debating whether or not i should even review this item just because i should have known better than to order this when i already know that crawfish is out of season at this time.  needless to say we received a previously frozen, bland, rubbery product.  so i'm just going to comment on the sauce, which was the same on the shrimp, but this had significantly less flavor.  perhaps, more spicy=more flavor, or it could be that there wasn't sausage and corn in this bag to add to the flavor.  \n\nmaybe i'm being a bit unfair because i'm comparing this establishment to boiling crab.  however the food was decent and a better alternative to a lot of other restaurants i've been to in vegas.  if i was asked to come here again, i would, but i don't see myself craving hot and juicy crawfish like i do for boiling crab.  i guess my best advice is if you're a boiling crab fan don't expect too much out of this place.  if you're just looking to satisfy a seafood craving this would be a good supplement while you're out in the middle of the desert.", 
            "we really wanted to try this place because my friend works here and we love boiling crab type crawfish joints!:d \n\nthis is actually my first time getting my hands down and dirty with the seafood because usually i'm too \n::ughhh i don't wanna smell:: \n::ewww its gonna get under my nails and all over my hands::\nyeah... i'm a shame... but i finally decided that i'll get over my prissy self to enjoy some damn good crustaceans hahha\n\ni love shrimp! get the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>!! it's a mix of all their seasonings (<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> and <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>) and its soooo yummy!! i am a wimp and cannot for the life of me take spicy, so the server suggested i try it without spice and yummm it was sooo good!!! my bf is the total opposite and loves spice, so when he got the hot n juicy crawfish at spicy, he said it wasn't spicy enough -.-;;;; he is a fatass and got 4lbs of crawfish and was totally enjoying every last bit of it. a little too excited....\nwe all shared a dozen oysters... mmmm it was a relief and cool break from the spiciness of the <mark>Crawfish</mark> for my  friends.\n\nmy friends got the crawfish too but in medium  hot n juicy. they are big boiling crab fans and said that there was a certain zing to their seasoning that bc doesn't but didn't want to love it more because of how far it is from us (we live in orange county). they also got the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>. the catfish was breaded a little too much, and didn't taste as fresh as the rest of our meal. \n i got the <mark>Soft Shell Crab Basket</mark> on top of my shrimp and that was really good. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> that came with it weren't as impressive but were made better by the leftover hot n juicy sauce that i had. hehehe\n\nall in all, we had a good experience, our waitress was really cool (katherine, kaitlyn?? i don't remember....) pretty attentive, but we had to nudge her for water sometimes. \n\nwe'll probably be back, considering the long list of places we need to try in vegas in our short weekend stays.", 
            "i heard about this place from a friend, and during my last trip to sin city, made it a point to come here.  \n\ngot here around 8:00, and waited about 15 mins, which was not bad at all considering i normally wait around 2 hours at boiling crab.  \n\nonce we were seated, we ordered <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>,  the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>, 1 pound of crawfish, 2 pounds of shrimp, both with the hot n' juicy sauce.  \n\nthe hot and juicy sauce lacked flavor, we literally had to add salt to it  to liven it up.  the sweet <mark>Potato</mark> fries were not crispy, and the catfish had way too much batter.\n\neh , maybe i came on an off day, but i am willing to give this place another try.", 
            "my friends didn't realize that there were two locations which are fairly close together and so what had happened was that one group ended up being at one location while the other was at another, funny story lol. anyways, so we are in vegas and heard that this place was similar to the boiling crab & crab hut so we decided to check it out!\n\nservice: was kind, our waitress was helpful and attentive.\natmosphere: pretty spacious, had a good amount of seating, and it seems to be bigger than the other location next to mr.tofu.\n\nfood: my bf & i shared 1 1/2lb of shrimp, mild, in hot n juicy sauce, <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> w/<mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and two corn. verdict?\n\npro: the hot n juicy sauce has a nice kick to it & pretty flavorful and it was nicely smothered over the shrimp. the two half corn on the cob was nearly drenched into the sauce which made the corn sweet from its own juices yet hot/juicy from the sauce. i also got to try my friend's corn fritters because i was curious to see how it tasted and to my liking it was awesome. i like the creamy yet sweet texture that happens when the corn ball is dipped into the batter and then fried. \n\neh: the \"<mark>Cajun Fries</mark>\" ... about them fries, it clearly wasn't <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> but merely fries with a splash of cajun seasoning over it. it was not the same... not what i imagined and had experienced at the boiling crab. slightly disappointed, but at least the fries were not bad. \n\ncon: from the outside the crust appears to be crunchy but when i bit into the crust of the fried catfish i was in awe. it doesn't appear to be crunchy but semi chewy or had an interesting texture to it. the catfish was okay not as fresh. \n\noverall, i didn't come here for the crawfish because i'm not really a big fan of that but i did enjoy some parts of my meal if not all. it was a good experience to try a new place but i think i have to stick to the boiling crab as still my favorite go to place for this type of meal.", 
            "this is a must go!  if you have been to vegas or live in vegas you must go to hot n juicy crawfish... go in the evening and anticipate a wait and slow service.  it is worth the wait and mediocre service to taste their crawfish, shrimp, lobster, or seasonal crab.  we also recommend the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>, it is amazing !  \n\n\nmy wife, family, friends, and anyone who comes to vegas for a visit, we always take them here.  everyone has had great things to say and recently i have noticed some new employees.  the service has been some what better but still has room to improve.  either i have adjusted to their spice levels or they have reduced them, i don't think it is as spicy as it used to be.\n\nenjoy and let me know what you think.", 
            "heard of this place on man vs food and coming from a cajun family who often have crawfish boils at home we had to check it out.\n\nok to start we tried the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> with <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. it was \"okay\" the catfish was not spicy so we ordered a side of hot and juicy medium sauce to dip it in. fries were also just okay nothing special just some fries sprinkled with creole seasoning.\n\nthen we ordered 2 pounds of crawfish with corn, <mark>Potato</mark> and sausage with medium hot and juicy sauce. the crawfish was great!!! just spicy enough.. perfect actually. the sauce is a mixture of all of their sauces and it has a ton of garlic in it!! i love garlic!!  the <mark>Potato</mark> and sausage were yummy, not a fan of the corn. at home we throw in mushrooms and i think they should too because i was missing it..\n\nlast but not least we ordered corn fritters. these deep fried wonderful tasty treats were my favorite of the meal and to think i wasn't going to order it!!! it came with ranch sauce to dip but you need to ask for a side of sorracho sauce (chili sauce) just a little dip of it and it's soooo good!! \n\nwe will definitely return, but i think i will try the one in orange county.", 
            "you can feast or go light with a shrimp,  soft shell crab or <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>.  very friendly staff of lovelies working the joint!!", 
            "eat here yesterday for lunch. i had the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> spicy crawfish and my boo had the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> the food was amazing as usual however we didn't have the best server we asked for gloves 4 times before she brought them. it wasn't that busy. i go only for the food though. i recommend it to anyone who loves seafood and doesn't mind getting messy", 
            "food here is mediocre. nothing special, had the shrimp with their seasoning that has everything (forgot the name) and it was bland. \n\ni also ordered a <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> and when all the food was brought out that was missing. waitress said it'll be out soon. 10mins later i see another waitress give that order to a table that had come in after we did and the waitress still said it was coming. she comes back 15mins later and says it was given to another table by mistake.\n\neach time i asked her about it, she just seemed to ignore me. \n\nonly good thing that came out of the meal with my mom was that they didn't charge for the fried catfish after having me wait 30+minutes. basically, i didn't get it until we had finished our meal."

            "i saw this place on food network and was surprised we have this famous cajun restaurant here in las vegas. i decided to take my fiancee for a never-before crawfish experience. \n\nwe were there on tuesday night about 8:00pm and there was plenty of open seating. after we were seated, we were given the first-timer instruction on how to order. \n\nwe ordered 2lbs of crawfish(hot & juicy mild) included 1 potato & 1 corn, 1 lb of shrimp (galic butter mild), 1 <mark>Soft Shell Crab Basket</mark> include <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and 2 cokes. we really wanted to order oysters but they ran out, that's why we ordered the shrimp. \n\nthe taste of the spices was very good, and <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> was wonderful. we both loved the seasoning very much. but there was one problem for us, we realized that we don't like crawfish. we never had crawfish before this night, at least not a properly prepared crawfish meal. we manage to finish all 2 lbs of it because the spices was just that good. on the other hand, the shrimp was so good, the large amount of garlic in that buttery sauce made the shrimp so sweet and tasty. we just can not stop eating the shrimp!!! and the soft shell? nothing worth mentioning, except for the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> we dipped and ate with the sauce in the crawfish/shrimp bags.\n\nthe whole experience was pretty good, the whole meal cost us $57 which i thought was a little high. we decided if we go back, we would order shrimp only and call to make sure they have oysters before we go again.", 
            "i finally made it!!!!  i took my friend derek, as we have been pursuing the spiciest foods in vegas and had yet to be happy with the results.  we had excellent service here (5 different waitstaff helping us out and refilling our iced teas, cleaning trash, feeding derek's sugar packet habit, etc).  \n\nwe got the <mark>Soft Shell Crab Basket</mark> to start since derek never had it before.  it was a bit overfried but tasty, and the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were tasty.\n\nfor the meal we had 1 lb hot n juicy medium shrimp, 1 lb hot n juicy spicy crawfish, 1 lb hot n juicy extra spicy crawish, and corn + potato + rice.\n\nthe conclusion: the shrimp were large, juicy, flavorful and tasty.  the spicy crawfish was our favorite - not too hot but the spice added up enough to give us that delicious burning flavor on the tongue and runny nose/watery eyes.  the flavor also was great.  the extra spicy crawfish had a nice intense spice, but the butter and overly powdered seasoning muddled the flavor.  \n\nthe corn and rice were nice \"neutralizers\" - next time we go here we would get the spicy level with anything.  a fun, messy, bib-ilicious experience!  and yes, i felt like a garlic breathing dragon all day!", 
            "this place is sooo good! i am obsessed with this place! whenever i'm in town, i have to stop by here! they're hot n spicy very spicy crawfish is sooo good! along with their <mark>Soft Shell Crab Basket</mark> is good too!", 
            "my very first time i went was with the same person i always eat out with if it isn't my boyfriend, so i might as well introduce you to my friend mikhail.. not a yelper, yet! haha.. anyway, it was both our first time & i have never tried crawfish before.\n\nwe ended up getting sharing the two bags [2lbs each?] of <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> crawfish, the <mark>Soft Shell Crab Basket</mark> w <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and calamari. i felt like such a newbie trying to open the crawfish, i splashed myself a couple times, but that's what the bibs are for, right? the flavoring was great; we ordered medium & it was just enough for me. my nose was running a little & my eyes got watery, but i enjoyed it. i think next time i'll stick with <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> cause i definitely have that down to a science ;) the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were straaight up cajun! i'd have to stop myself after a while because it would get a little spicy. soft shell crab was good, just wanted marinara sauce from the calamari instead of the tartar that the soft shell came with :) the calamari was house made, but it wasn't anything fancy for me. there's only a few places where i can say that's great calamari. \n\nthe service was average, it was a sunday & the lakers were playing orlando so we had to wait for a good 20 minutes for a table for two. i didn't realize that the restrooms were in two different spots, but our table was against the wall for the mens restroom & i was washing my hands before & after we ate. my bad fellerz!\n\nthe weird thing is that at the bottom of the receipt says you get a 3% discount if you pay cash.. i don't get it, do you have to present the check with the cash, then get a new receipt with the new balance? they already use enough disposable stuff & use styrofoam cups so i don't really think they're going green anyway. blah, maybe i'm going crazy because i'm yelping & it's already 6am!! random.. and awkward receipt though. i will be back hot n juicy! the simplicity of the menu & your system is definitely working, so much props. i'll probably come back on a weekday because that day was madness~",

            "pretty good seafood.  it was a unique experience for me.  it's kind of like an informal picnic setup.  food came out when it was ready instead of all at once.  it was fun to try all the different seasonings and sauces they offer, but beware because when they mean \"hot\" it's \"hot\".\n\ni really liked the <mark>Soft Shell Crab Basket</mark>.\n\nshrimp is very large!"

            "this place is not for everyone, but if you can handle ripping apart shellfish with your bare hands, you are in for an amazing treat.  i'm hesitant on such things myself, but once i managed to get past that, and get the meat out of the crawfish and muss it around in the amazing sauce, i was hooked.\n\nthe experience: it's a simple clean place.  you order some type of shellfish (crawfish, shrimp, crab), a type of sauce (i go with the hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>), and tell them what else you want thrown in... <mark>Potato</mark>, corn, sausage (i recommend all three).  a few minutes later they bring out a big plastic bag filled with the goodies and they plop it on your table.  no plate, no utensils: just rip in and enjoy.  you're going to get messy, but they provide a bib and there's paper towel rolls at each table.  make sure you do not neglect to get the sauce all over everything you put in your mouth.\n\ni recommend washing it down with an ice cold blue moon.\n\nthey do also have fish & chips, and some pretty great <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>, so you don't have to get messy to enjoy a meal here.  but then you're kind of missing out on what makes it special.\n\ni should mention that unless you like pain, you should order \"medium\".  their \"spicy\" is truly hot, and not some watered down notion of \"spicy\".  my korean relatives agree.  their \"extra spicy\" is reserved only for the completely fearless.\n\nalso, i recently have tried the snow crab -- very tasty and satisfying, with larger chunks of meat than you can get from a crawfish.  good eating!\n\nagain, if you're squeemish about this kind of thing, it might not be the place for you.  also unlikely to go over well on a first date with it's enormous garlic content.  but it is unquestionably super delicious, and if you think you can handle it, you should definitely give it a shot.", 
            "was here just the other day while in town for halloween. i came in hoping it was good, and left satisfied. they were out o f a couple of items we would have tired, but we did get the <mark>King Crab</mark>, whole <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, crawfish, and calamari. the crawfish and the crab we got with varying amounts of heat, all on the hot n juicy sauce. the sauce was very good. plenty of tase, not simply liquid butter. add dollar beers to that(not sure if all bottles are $1 everyday or not) and it added up to a very good time. i would definately go back.\n\nthe only minus is that they really have nothing but seafood. several in our party do not like this kind of seafood, so their only choice was <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>(which they do not even have sauces for, they come out dry) and fries. a bit small of a non seafood choice.\n\nour waitress was very helpful and attentive as well.", 
            "i agree with marilou a. (the reviewer before me). similar experience. i'm from s. cali and love crawfish. we went to hot & juicy bc one of our friend saw it on food network. (*side note: it was on \"man vs food\" and obviously the host has never been to boiling crab in s. cali.) \nanyways, so when we went they told us they only had frozen crawfish. we figured we had frozen crawfish before ... if the sauce is good, everything will be ok. nothing was good.\n1) the crawfish was crumbly. i expected some toughness or flakiness from it being frozen, but this was just nasty. a bunch must have been dead before they were frozen. \n2) the sauce was not juicy. it did not make me want to lick my fingers or suck the crawfish head. too salty and pungent.\n3) the corn was either overcooked or it was bad frozen corn. the kernels were tiny and prune-like. \n\nthe only think i liked about the place was the fried <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>. those were definitely hot & juicy, but i didn't go there for crawfish. i wanted dang good crawfish. we felt so cheated out  of the experience, so when we went home 2 days later, we dropped by boiling crab to cleanse our taste bud of not hot & juicy. \n\nwill never come back to this place again.", 
            "i have been to this place a few times , i thought they had the best crawfish in vegas...as my bf and i kept going we noticed that the crawfish is not fresh at all. 4 out of the 7 times we've been there some of the crawfish were black, now you know when it's not good at all when you open the crawfish and find black juice not just one crawfish but a few. don't get me wrong their flavors are all there! you have to try the hot and juicy seasoning which is a mixture of everything. \n\nwhen they mean spicy they really mean it! the have other items on the menu for those who do not eat seafood like <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> and chicken nuggets. \n\nservice is okay, a few times they forgot my order and never checked up on us to see why we haven't all received our food. not only that they never even apologized. make sure the printer in the back is working!\n\noh yeah, parking is a pain in the butt when it's busy!", 
            "im a big fan and always spoke above and beyond about the awesome food that they serve here.  i usually come to eat about 3x a month and never had an issue with the service until last nights horrible experience with the servers/workers.  \n\nso several of my friends and i decided to hit up the place after a pool concert for a quick fix of hot n juicy shrimp.  we walk in 5 minutes before they close and was promptly greated by our server who ended up later giving us a really bad attitude.  but before i get ahead of myself, she initially tells us that we have 2 minutes to put in our order.  because we come there very often we knew what we wanted and did not hesitate to waste time and gave her our order.  we ordered 4lbs of shrimp, <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, plain with extra spicy hot n juicy sauce on the side along with some lemons and salt and pepper.  the same way we order it every time.  we had also ordered  1/2 a dozen of <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>.  \n \nnot more than five minutes later we get our order, but not how we had ordered specifically.  the extra spicy hot and juicy sauce had come all mixed in with the 4lbs of shrimp that we ordered making it very spicy, painful to the mouth, and unenjoyable.  but because we walked in prior to closing, we did not want to hassle the kitchen and waiter to remake our food.  instead we asked our waiter  for some extra hot butter to help balance out the spiciness in our food. our waiter stated that the kitchen was closed and that there was nothing that she could do.  so i had asked politely to speak to a manager.  but our waiter told me that there was no manager available.  we then asked her if there anything that she can do to make our food less spicy and more enjoyable but she still persisted that there was nothing that she could do and that the kitchen was closed.  regretfully, i was upset and had belittled her in front of my friends using inappropriate language.    \n\nafter getting no response or help from our waiter, we began to remove ourselves from the table and left the mostly untouched food on the table and headed towards the door.  we had barely eaten any food because of how spicy it was.  we were then greeted and cussed out by a  who claimed to be a manager.  he threatened that he would remember us and told us to \"fuck off\".  and i'm sorry to say that he received the same treatment back.  shortly after another guy who also claimed to be the manager tried to listen to the situation and made us believe that he had understood what went wrong.  he stated that he would have this issue taken care of with another manager the following day and we gave him our contact information for them to contact us.  he shortly after sent us on our way.  \n\nsince we were still oh so hungry we went across the street to eat some pho.  five minutes into eating, las vegas metro police walks in stating that the hot n juicy staff claimed that we dined in and ran off with our tab unpaid. we ended up being forced to pay for food we didn't order and eat.  \n\nwhat a way to lose business hot n juicy.  im still working to write a letter to the owner of this place.  what sucks is that i really really love the food and would love to go back to eat there.  it just sucks!  if our waiter knew the kitchen couldn't fully accomodate our needs she should have never sat us down to eat.", 
            "love it...this time we skipped the crawfish (too much work) and opted for 2pounds of shrimp. wished we had gotten one pound of shrimp and one pound of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> like the people seated next to us..oh well, still awesome.  we got it medium spice and hot n'<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>- got the <mark>Extra Seasoning Sauce</mark> to put on rice...oh hell yeah...the sauce on the rice alone was delish!\nwe also got soft shell crab and <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>..everything was very great...stuffed ourselves silly that's for sure..", 
            "hot and juicy is definitely some hot stuff! i came here for the first time with michelle w. last year and i really don't remember it being this packed for a weekend. however, the 20-30 minute wait was well worth the wait. we decided on the hot and juicy snow crabs in medium, the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> shrimp in mild, <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> basket with the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and a side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> for me. i was definitely salivating waiting for the food to come out...which actually didn't take very long! everything was soooooo good! next time though i think i will stick with the mild hotness level. my mouth was on fire by the time i was through...the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were probably not the best idea with all of this hotness going on, but i guess that's why they call it hot and juicy. everything that we ordered totaled up to about 45 bucks plus sodas....not a bad deal. btw....the rice with some sauce is oh so delicious! i will definitely be back for more garlic dousing!", 
            "i can honestly admit i'm a lazy person when it comes to eating. cutting a piece of meat with a knife and/or fork/spoon (when i'm even lazier) is probably the most strenuous work i'll tolerate. using my fork or spoon is enough, isn't it?\n\nthe only, i repeat only, food i'll take time to carefully work at and eat is shellfish...specifically crab, lobster and crawfish. unfortunately, being located in the tri state area, there is a lack of crawfish which saddens me. since i was in town for work i jumped at the opportunity to eat one of my favorite shellfish friends...crawfish!\n\nafter leaving the ces convention center, my colleagues and i hailed a taxi* and requested to go to hot n juicy located in chinatown. a split second later, we realized hot n juicy sounded like a strip club so we joked around with the taxi driver and insisted it wasn't a peep show. we were going to that after we ate.\n\nmy colleagues didn't know it but i was giggling like a little school girl when we arrived. unfortunately for them, they aren't as adventurous when it comes to food so they ordered calamari, <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> and fries which they enjoyed.\n\nour waiter was extremely informative, briefly describing to us (mostly me) how to order the seafood (per pound), by seasoning and spiciness. since i've been to boiling crab i already knew what i wanted...2 lbs of <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> crawfish with medium heat. the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> seasoning is so mouth wateringly good that i could drink it as a side (not recommended though). they serve the seafood in plastic bags with bibs and paper towels. this is the messiest meal you will ever eat but so worth it. i was in business attire but was able to leave without any stains!\n\nas i twisted and separated the head and tail, sucked the head and pushed out the meat from the tail...my colleagues looked at me in complete disgust like i was a monster. did i feel bad? not at all. i easily finished the 2 lbs of crawfish like a true fatty. i ordered medium heat but my mouth was on fire pretty much the entire time i was eating so to counteract the heat, i took big swigs of beer which helped. \n\nthe seafood pricing on the menu says market price so be sure to ask the waiter beforehand. the crawfish was about $10 per pound. currently, they're having a bogo shrimp special because they opened up another hot n juicy location in washington, dc. do i hear a road trip?\n\nmy next visit will showcase their <mark>Blue Crab</mark> legs. if you're ever in vegas or dc, i would highly recommend coming here if you're a seafood lover and don't mind getting messy. it's a freakin' dream.\n\na fun tip, hot n juicy was on man vs. food.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n*in las vegas, taxis aren't allowed to pick up passengers on streets like nyc. they have to pull into a parking lot, hotel, restaurant, etc.", 
            "oh em gee. i come here on average at least once a month. i wanna say it's their seasoning that gets me to come back everytime but i can't tell. when i went, crawfish was around $10 a pound and shrimp was a little less. i typically get shrimp because they have more meat and it is easier to get full. crawfish meat is quite tiny once you peel the gigantic shell. if you buy 2lbs of crawfish, you automatically get a free corn and potato. awesome!!! get the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasonsing which is basically a combination of all the other seasonings. i'm usually content with mild and medium spicyness level but my mother in law  get extra extra spicy and lemme tell ya... that kills you. \n\nif you're lucky, you can catch them when they have etouffee (kind of like gumbo). delish! has pieces of crawfish, red bell pepper, celery.. etc. the flavor tastes similar to the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> but i'm not sure. \n\nsurprisingly, they have one of the bessstttt <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> anywhere. it comes out hot and fresh. the skin is super crispy and the inside is hot and juicy. comes with ranch and ketchup and fries if you wish. a must have if you come!!! \n\npros: <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> & fries!!!\n<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning\n\ncons: none really. could be cheaper but business is business. =p", 
            "definitely a fan--went back this trip, as i remembered this place from my last trip to vegas.  i'll echo some of the other reviewers, if you go for dinner, go early, as the line builds up.  we were seated right away, at 5:30, but by 6:30, there was a line outside the door.  i had the crawfish and clams, medium spice, and my mouth was burning for a couple of hours after we left (and i am usually pretty tolerant of spicy foods).  i also made the mistake of touching my eye, even after washing my hands, it still burned badly.  loved both the clams and crawfish.  my wife is not a crawfish fan, so she got <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>, which were apparently good as well.", 
            "yummy!!!!! good service!!!! the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce is the best. if you dont wanna wait for too long, better come before 5. the <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are good too.",

            "brought our parents here all craving some yummy crab and catfish. they delivered! we had 6 kiddos with us too. they placed us at a big table, explained the menu & gave us great service. its not a fancy place, casual dining, and thats one of the things we enjoyed about it. eating crab in this setting was perfect! \n\nthey also gave us a brief tutorial on how to eat crawfish (cool experiance for the kiddos too) and brought us samples of it for us all to try (kids included)\n\nfood: <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> (served whole, which means legs and body) with the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce. was over a pound, so cost more but worth it because it tasted so good. the sauce was the  bomb! level of spice we ordered was called \"baby\" (lowest on the scale) it was just spicy enough for us weaklings.\nsnow crab (<mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>) were sweet and large. our 9 year old ordered this with just butter sauce since she doesnt like hot spice. it was delicious just like that.\nthere are 4 different sauces, one of which is all 4 mixed together. my mother in law ordered that with her crab and it was  pretty tasty. \nkids got <mark>Chicken Wings Basket</mark> with fries, they were big so the little ones shared. and the father in law ordered basket of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and fried catfish. he is a harsh critic, who loved the catfish! i didnt even have a chance to taste it!\nthe only food we didnt like much was the corn fritters. too sweet and batter was not authentic. \n\nservice: great. all the waitresses there seemed on the ball and helped us out.  \n\npretty busy place, not impressive from the outside, but who cares? the crab is tasty and not too expensive. its served in a bag with all the sauce, you wear a plastic bib, even plastic gloves if you want them. the only thing that would make me happier is good beer on tap. they only serve bottles. give it a try. its yummy!"

            "i love hot n juicy. i found out about this place from foodnetwork? or travel channel's mvf? not really sure. \n\nthe 1st time i've ever tried to eat crawfish was here. we ordered 1 lb of crawfish in medium hot&juicy sauce. after trying crawfish i learned that it's too much work for not enough meat, so never again. the hot&juicy sauce was delicious and pretty spicy. i love spicy food, but not so spicy that all you get is heat and no flavor. \n\ni prefer to order the 1 lb of shrimp with 1 dozen sausage in mild hot&juicy sauce. with a side of <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. this is a winner for sure. this entire meal would cost around $30 and good for 2 people. hot&juicy sauce in mild has a good balance of heat and flavor. i love to let my <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> swim in that sauce. the h&j sauce also has the best flavor out of the other flavor options they offer. beware tho cause the garlic and butter in the sauce will make you smell all day. by the end of the day you can still sort of smell the sauce on your fingers. \n\ni've also tried their <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> and you get 1 dozen for $15. it was good but the oysters are kind of small so i wouldn't really recommend it.\n\nthe calamari is ok. cooked well. i tried dipping it into the hot&juicy sauce just because i love the sauce so much. unfortunately it tasted too salty. the calamari is good on its own. \n\ni'm from the bay area so i've tried crawdaddy's and this is way better than crawdaddy's. crawdaddy's sauce is watered down compared to hot n juicy. crawdaddy's shrimp also looks anemic compared to hot n juicy. i haven't tried boiling crab tho.", 
            "great, hole-in-the-wall type of seafood place! have gone here a couple of times with my sea-food loving friends and their families, and everyone left very satisfied!\n\nthe service was charming, and helpful, as the menu is a bit confusing as far as prices and options. the food was delicious! probably one of the best <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> i've ever had! the spices used were out of this world! just make sure to ask for mild if you can't handle spicy food.\n\nthe location was authentic, right on the edge of las vegas china town. servers spoke english and were informative. \n\ni really enjoyed my dining experience here and will be back when i have a craving for seafood.", 
            "this place was just like boiling crab...and we must have gone at a good time because we didn't have to wait for a table.  \n\ni had <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> for the first time and they were really good!  other than that, i had the usual pound of shrimp and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  mmmm, so good but we smelled like garlic for 24 hours!!!", 
            "<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> comin right up!\n\ni just came back from las vegas on a quick 23 hour trip and i managed to make it out to hot n juicy in chinatown. my friends heard of it from man vs. food and i thought the pictures on yelp looked promising, so it wasn't very hard to persuade me to go. we go there a little after it opened and were welcomed very excitedly by the staff. of course, since we were there so early, we were seated right away. we ordered the calamari, two orders of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, a half-dozen <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, two pounds of the hot and juicy crawfish, one pound of the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> crawfish and three pounds of the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> crawfish (my personal favorite). \n\nthe calamari was fantastic, it wasn't overly breaded like some places do it. it comes with lemon and some marinara sauce. now i am not a fan of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, but my friends ordered two orders, i was bound to try one. not only did i try one, i tried like eleven! haha.. they were nicely seasoned and went perfectly with the ketchup. believe it or not, i would order them again. (zoinks?! lol). the <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> were so fresh it melted in my mouth. my only complaint is that i usually add a bit of soy sauce with the lemon wedge when i shoot <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> and all they had was lemon. but none the less, melts in your mouth goodness!!! the guests of honor to our luncheon were the crawfish. all the flavors that we had were very flavorful and delicious in their own right. however, the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> was my absolute favorite, and i think everyone elses' as well. mainly because we put in an order for two more pounds after killin' just the one. \n\n*btw you can order different grades of spicyness for your food, however we ordered the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> at just a mild grade of spicy juice and it was pretty intense. even to my spicy-loving thai mates that ate with me :).\n\ni only gave them 4 stars because they only served beer. i'll add that additional star once they start selling wine at least, but with fingers-crossed they'll someday have a full bar.", 
            "my aunt and cousin are fans of this spot and said we had to check it out!  we ordered the shrimp, crawfish, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>.  needless to say it was all devoured.  we are fans and will definitely hit this spot again when we are in town.\n\nservice was hit and miss.  greeted, check. drinks, check.  ordered food.  check.  but, when our meal was complete it took a bit too long to get our check.  then i had to walk to the register to pay my bill.", 
            "i wanted to celebrate my friends birthday on my day off so i decided to treat her and her fiance to some hot and juicy crawfish.  i grew up in so cal where boiling crab reigns supreme, and after moving to vegas i've had an empty void that needed filling.  i saw the man vs food episode and i've read the reviews before stepping in, so i came in excited, hungry and craving crawfish.   \n\nbetween the 3 of us this is what we ordered. dozen <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>, 2# shrimp <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> very spicy with corn and sausage, and 1# crawfish <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> medium spicy.\n\nthe only complaint about the service was that our <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, which should have been the first thing to come out, showed up on the table last.\n\n<mark>Raw Oysters</mark>- accompanied by cocktail sauce, lemons, horse radish and tabasco.  i'm a big fan of oysters and these were decent in size (comparable to hama hama), but without any accompaniments they were very bland.  oysters are suppose to taste like the sea, but these were washed so much they tasted watery and flavorless.  \n\n<mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>- breaded in a <mark>Corn</mark> crust served over a bed of french fries and accompanied by ketchup and tartar sauce.  personally i'm not a big fan of <mark>Corn</mark> breading, but i can't really hold that against the establishment and their recipe.  catfish was moist and flaky and had a hint of cayenne which perfected the \"southern\" flavor.  i actually enjoyed this the most.  \n\nshrimp <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> very spicy-  we ordered this with corn and sausage, both of which were awesome.  the corn was sweet and complimented the spice well. the sausage was spicy and tender and added a bold meaty flavor to the sauce for the shrimp.  the \"<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>\" sauce isn't as flavorful as i expected, and the \"very spicy\" here is comparable to  \"medium spicy\" at boiling crab.  but the flavor was decent and the shrimp themselves were \"okay\".  not the freshest shrimp i've ever had but they weren't rotten or anything, but what can you really expect in the middle of the desert? \n\ncrawfish <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> medium spicy-  i'm debating whether or not i should even review this item just because i should have known better than to order this when i already know that crawfish is out of season at this time.  needless to say we received a previously frozen, bland, rubbery product.  so i'm just going to comment on the sauce, which was the same on the shrimp, but this had significantly less flavor.  perhaps, more spicy=more flavor, or it could be that there wasn't sausage and corn in this bag to add to the flavor.  \n\nmaybe i'm being a bit unfair because i'm comparing this establishment to boiling crab.  however the food was decent and a better alternative to a lot of other restaurants i've been to in vegas.  if i was asked to come here again, i would, but i don't see myself craving hot and juicy crawfish like i do for boiling crab.  i guess my best advice is if you're a boiling crab fan don't expect too much out of this place.  if you're just looking to satisfy a seafood craving this would be a good supplement while you're out in the middle of the desert.", 
            "my brother, wife and kids were in town and spotted this as we drove and bombarded me with questions. it was good the last time i went, but it wasn't impressive that i was dying to go back. i was dreading a very ridiculous wait, but they said 20 minutes and it seemed like we got seated sooner than that. i guess in the recent year they've really ironed out their efficiency since our orders came swiftly was well.\n\nordered shrimp, crawfish, and clams in hnj sauce, andouille sausage in hot butter, and one in lemon butter, half a dozen <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, and rice. i've never been a fan of crawfish since it's a whole lot of shell for a little bitty nub of meat. the shrimp was big, juicy and perfectly cooked. the clams were pretty good but a few had a bit of sand still. i guess that's just a typical hazard with shells. after trying the <mark>Sausage</mark> in other sauces, i still prefer the hnj as my sauce- spicy and garlicky good. i was a tad miffed last time i came here with $2 rice being a piddly scoop- they made the serving bigger which they should. asians rejoice!  my family liked this place so that's good. sometimes being a yelper everyone thinks you know all the things and i feel pressure being different in food taste too. \n\nservice was great. very friendly, checked on us often, fast about getting things. i really think the staff here has finally figured out a groove. only helps them to faster turnover.\n\nof course this is a messy experience, but if you don't like getting your hands all garlicky and seafood smelling, you can request gloves! my nephew wanted gloves so his hands don't smell. they give you bibs of course but this isn't the spot to wear something nice to and avoid long sleeves like white button downs. cracking shells is a splatter hazard. \n\nyeah, this place is hyped to hell and i don't think is the greatest thing to happen to seafood like people make it out to be, but it is solid if you just want simple, fresh seafood. sometimes clambake style food just hits that spot. if only it came with a sea view, i would feel complete.", 
            "you gotta love a place that gives you a bib and wraps the table in a plastic bag. here's a tip, don't wear white clothing to this place.\n\nthe food was fantastic. you order meat by the pound and pick your sauce. i went with their combo spice and picked 1lb in medium and 1lb in spicy. the crawfish was good but you get less meat for your money. the shrimp was delicious. we also had <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> which were also amazing.\n\ni also tried the etoufee. it was pretty good but i've had better. stick to the pounds of meat and you'll have a great time here getting messy with delicious seafood!", 
            "horrible experience my buddy ordered oysters on the half shell, and he kindly offered me one. on a side note my buddy had been drinking for two days straight so his taste buds were not on point. as i took the oyster the smell and taste were very off to the point i spit it back up right away. i eat <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> often; and frequent the hot and juicy in hollywood, this location is gross flies, floor looked horrible. once we made them aware that the oysters were bad all they did was remove it from bill. mind you buddy ate two or three before i noticed they were bad. i don't expect a free meal but when your dealing with people's health i would at least expect a hey sorry let us remove your buddies one drink also. i mean we just tried to poison you!! when we asked for salt before this experience it took so long we just went and got it our selves. bad service and bad food not a successful combo!!!!! i believe the service was the worst, my shrimp were overcooked but the sauce is still great!", 
            "at last count there were two hot n juicy crawfish locations in las vegas, but i have it on good authority that this is the one you want, at 4810 spring mountain road. my husband and i were steered towards this one, further away though it is, by a reliable local, which is the kind of good advice you want when choosing an off-strip, local neighborhood place. driving from the strip, you actually have to pass a hot n juicy crawfish (in chinatown) to get to the \"right\" hot n juicy crawfish.\n\nlocated on a busy multi-lane road chock-a-block with shopping centers and fast food, hot n juicy crawfish doesn't look like much from outside. or inside, for that matter -- a decent-sized space looks smaller than it is because of so many ragtag tables squeezed together, it's usually packed, it's loud, and i wouldn't exactly call it clean. you're in the middle of the desert but the vibe is carefree beachside -- the floor is a mess and most diners are wearing plastic bibs, happily covered in sauce. you order at a counter, from a menu posted on the wall overhead, and they call you when your order is ready. \n\nthough you can get baskets of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, wings and chicken nuggets, hot n juicy crawfish put their signature item right in their name. when you order the crawfish, there's a method. no \"crawfish nazis\" here -- the staff will kindly help you out if you're a first-timer. you order your crawfish by the pound, then you pick a seasoning, then you pick a spice level. for seasoning, you pick from <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> or a <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. spice levels range from mild to \"holy s@#t.\" that's not what they call it, that's what i called it. if you like spicy, you love this stuff.\n\nthe best experience is to go off-hours with a group, get an assortment of seasonings and spice levels, get some cold beers and have a blast. wear something washable, yer gonna get messy!"

            "since returning from houston a couple of months ago, i found myself craving crawfish any chance i get.  after experiencing the crawfish craze in the westminster area of southern california, imagine my delight when i saw the sign for \"hot n juicy crawfish\" in las vegas.\n\nthe bf and i anxiously awaited the opening of this first of its kind restaurant in sin city and finally got to sit down to dinner the past sunday.  inviting a couple of newbies made the dining experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nwe started off with a pound each of the crawfish in every flavor - <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and hot n juicy combo.  at $8.99/lb, it was a dollar more than socal prices but we were okay with it.  for every two pounds you order, you get one corn and one potato.  so, we made sure we got our corn pieces and <mark>Potato</mark> and were able to choose what flavor we wanted it in.  (in the end, we ordered additional corn and potato on the side, corn runs about 50 cents each.)  we also threw an order of sausage ($2.50 for half a dozen or $4.00 for a dozen).  depending on the season, they should be offering <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, and shrimp.  you can also order oysters, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> or oyster baskets, catfish po-boy sandwich, or a basket of fries.\n\nthey didn't ask us how spicy we wanted our crawfish, later on telling us they automatically make it spicy unless otherwise stated.  the heat was a good amount, not too hot that it was unbearable and enough where we reached for our beverages.  of the four, i would say the <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> had the least flavor while the hot n juicy combo had the most.  we ordered four more pounds of the hot n juicy combo in this sitting.  the sausage was actually spicier than the crawfish!  we also found the crawfish to be pretty clean overall.  we're ones to suck up all the juices from the heads too, so they gotta be clean.  and i gotta admit, the last two pounds we had were especially good.  they do a good job on having cleaner crawfish than other places i've experienced.\n\nbe sure to get the salt and pepper mixture too.  you get a bowl of cut up limes and you squeeze all the lime juice into the little plastic cup and mix it all together.  this is usually meant for you to dip your crawfish in, but i found myself not needing it that much.\n\nservice was better too.  upon entering, they line your table up with the white plastic covering and lay out a roll of paper towels.  they also provide bibs too.  you can ask for plastic gloves, but they just get in the way.  they asked us often if we needed refills on our beverages and how we were doing overall.  (i would say this is probably because they are a new restaurant, i only hope they continue with this service in the future.)\n\nthey had a steady flow of customers this holiday weekend night.  it didn't get too busy, but they were never empty either.\n\nin conclusion, the four of us were pleased with our experience at hot n juicy crawfish.  it looks like we'll be coming back here a lot!  yay!\n\nside note: there's a 17% gratuity added for parties of six or more.\n\n(you can check out my food photos up above!)", 
            "this is my first time trying hot n juicy crawfish and i have to agree with the other yelpers when they say that the crawfish yield is not worth it.  my homegirls from nyc came to visit and i suggested that we try this place since none of us have ever tried crawfish.  so here we are 1 guy and 3 girls and we ordered 1 lb of crawfish - hot and juicy spicy sauce, 1 dungenuss crab - hot and juicy spicy sauce, 1 lb of shrimp - <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and 3 corn on the cob.\n\nthe shrimp yields more meat than the crawfish, however the hot and juicy spicy sauce is the way to go if you can take the heat!!  it'll get your lips burning at the end of the meal.  \n\nthe dungenuss crab was the star of the night for us.  it was 1.8 lbs and about $28.  we had it made with the hot and juicy spicy sauce and it came whole, which means you had to do the dirty work yourself.  getting down and dirty with crab is my thing!  i go to any buffet and ill sit there and eat <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> all night long!  anyways, the sauce and the crab was fantastic!  it was sooo good we ended up going to the supermarket the next day and bought 4 two pound <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, one for each of us, so we could make some more crab. lol\n\n anyways, 4 pounds of seafood and 5 beers later, we were stuffed.  we enjoyed our food.  we would suggest the crawfish if you've never had them before, but the shrimp is better.  must get the <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> if you are willing to spend the money.  total charge was $80 including tip, not bad for 4 people.  i will definitely go back there with more out of town friends.", 
            "easily craving crawfish, especially since the husband missed out the last two times i went.\n\nwent last sunday and the place is packed!  dang, it's getting busy in there and it's only going to get busier!  \n\nstarted off with two pounds of crawfish ($10.99/lb) of their <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning with medium heat.  easy to peel shells, juicy and flavorful crawfish, what's there not to love?\n\ninquired about the <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, $17.99/lb.  they gave us a 1.7-pounder and it arrived whole in a bag.  started off with the back legs and moved up to the claws.  the meat was sweet and the crab was fresh.  deciding on how to move about the body, broke the head off and it was crab head heaven.  loads and loads of crab fat/head etc. and so bad for our cholesterol!  but it was so good, really good.  we were scooping that stuff up and dipping it into the sauce.  yum yum! \n\nfinally moving onto the body, broke it in half and dug into the lump meat.  really sweet meat and just good stuff.  nice treat from having only crawfish.  they did a last call as we were chowing on the crab, which was fine for us at the time.\n\ncome to today, a few hours earlier, the husband looks at me and says \"i want to go back for more crawfish.\"  i realize that because we ordered only two pounds the other day, we just teased ourselves.  (we're used to two pounds each.)  then my brother calls and asks for the address of this place.  is he in town...no, this weekend he will be with his boys.  uh, if you're gonna go, we'll probably want to go with you too so let us know...\n\nyeah, we like it that much.  our cholesterol numbers aren't looking too good at this point.",

            "i love this place!  mudbugs, crawfish, crawdad, whatever you want to call them i love to eat them!  another gem located way off the strip on spring mountain rd which is asian food heaven from what i saw driving around.  the place was crowded which is always a good sign.  the crawfish was very fresh as i think we are nearing peak season.  nice big juicy suckers with plenty of tail meat.  all crustaceans (crawfish, king/snow crab, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark> and shirmp) have a choice to be bathed with mild to extra spicy <mark>Extra Seasoning Sauce</mark>.  the spice level is as stated.  no watering it down for the tourists.  when they mean spicy, it will be spicy.  best to avoid the extra spicy unless you are participating in some food challenge or trying to show off.  not really a first date kind of place but heck if you bring someone here you both should know what you are getting in to.  parking is beyond tiny and likely you will need to park on the side street which is a little on the sketchy side.  the servers were all fun and eager to please with refills constantly coming.", 
            "hot n' juicy is an old favorite of mine located on spring mountain between decatur and jones. hot n' juicy is definitely the messiest eatery in town, and all the more fun because of it. sometimes when i give that description people don't want to try it, but it would be a shame not to. besides the fun of eating here, the food is great. how can you really go wrong with fresh seafood, butter, and cajun seasonings?\n\ntoday i ordered one pound of the crawfish ($9.99) and my husband ordered one pound of the snow crab ($13.99). we both asked for the hot n' <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning, extra spicy! you are free to choose your heat level as well as the style of seasoning you prefer - <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, juice cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, or <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. besides crawfish and snow crab, you can also order <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, or shrimp.\n\nthe first time i had a crawfish boil was at my brother's graduation from university of the south in sewanee, tennessee. i remember them dumping huge buckets of steamed crawfish onto the tables and everyone would just have at them, discarding the shells and heads onto neighboring tables. at hot n' juicy it's a little different, but not much. you are given bibs and your table is covered in white plastic that is accessorized with your own roll of paper towels. they bring your crawfish in plastic bags that are tied at the top to capture the heat. when you open the bag you get an aromatic burst of spicy steam that gets you really excited for what you are about to enjoy. this is where the fun starts. crawfish are peel and eat little buggers that require somewhat of an experienced eater to navigate through them in order to get to the savory bits. first you must detach the tail, which you peel just as you would the tail of a shrimp. then, and this is most flavorful part, you must suck the head by gently squeezing it into your mouth so you can get all the juices and inner goodness out of it. if this sounds totally disgusting to you, go for the crab. they supply you with crab crackers, but ian and i agree they should probably pre-crack them for you to make the experience easier and allow all the seasoned butter to seep into the meat. whatever you decide to get, i'm sure you'll enjoy it.\n\nif you order two pounds of crawfish you get a hunk of corn on the cob and a red potato in your bag, but since we ordered one pound each of different items we opted for the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> ($2.99). these came out hot n' spicy with a side of cooling ketchup. we managed to reserve some of the fries to dip in the juices at the bottom of our bags, and this was way better than the ordinary condiment. who would have thought that you could make french fries even tastier and more unhealthy with the addition of seasoned butter? i guess europeans serve their fries with mayonnaise, so i don't feel too guilty or out of line.\n\nby the time you are finished, it looks like hurricane katrina has hit your table leaving a mass of wet and crumpled paper towels in her wake. this is certainly not a prime location for a wedding reception, but if you don't mind getting your hands dirty in the name of taste, you really should try hot n' juicy almost any other time.", 
            "my friends and i are big fans of boiling crab and boat house, so we were excited to find a cajun seafood restaurant when we were in vegas. i'm totally over eating at buffets when in vegas because i can no longer justify paying $40+ for ayce when i can't even eat a lot anymore. i did notice that some yelpers have mentioned seeing this place on man vs. food. i guess i must have missed that episode, but i did see adam's picture framed on the wall there!\n\ni ended up eating the shrimp, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, and crawfish with mild <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce. i usually order mild whenever i eat at boat house or boiling crab, which is the perfect amount of spicy for me, but here at hot n juicy crawfish, mild was a little too hot for me to handle. our server did warn us that their food was a little bit spicier than other places, so i should have better prepared myself. it took a while for our party to finish the food because everyone's mouths were on fire, but we won the battle against the food, even if it was only mild!", 
            "rustic cajun eating at it's best!  what a great concept: bags of boiled seafood, paper on the tables, no plates, just finger lickin!  i love it when places make it fun to eat your food.  you never have to give me any excuses to eat with your hands, i will always be there for that party.  \n\nthis being said, i was not extremely impressed with the food at hot n juicy crawfish.  the crawfish were frozen the nights i've been here, but they always say they usually get in fresh when they can.  the flavors were all pretty good, although i preferred the hot-n-juicy flavor and the cajun one was also very good.  the food came by the pound, and when we asked how much to order she told us about a pound per person.  this was way too much!  but i can never be mad at someone for suggesting a lot of food, it will all get eaten at some point, right?  \n\nthe food was relatively cheap, at around $10 per pound of each type of seafood.  we got the shrimp and the crawfish, and wish i would have tried the <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, it sounded really good.  \n\nif you're looking for a fun meal to grab with friends, definitely try out hot n juicy crawfish.  but since the place was on man v. food, it may take you a little while to wait for your reservation, so maybe try to go during off hours.", 
            "honestly, if i have never been to the boiling crab in san jose this would have easily been a 5 star rating for me.  i just love the atmosphere of the whole place..from the garlic smell (that follows you through your clothing for the rest of your day by the way) to the get-down-and-dirty style.  some things just taste better eating with your hands and this is one of those occasions.  seating did not take very long and our server was very friendly and helpful.  he explained the system to us and forewarned us that even mild has a kick to it since it is a cajun restaurant.  my lips were burning by the end of my meal with mild, so if you don't like spicy food, do not come here!\n\nwe ordered <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> since the <mark>Blue Crab</mark> and the <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> were out (that was upsetting).  we got it with the hot n juicy seasoning, which the server explained did not mean it was spicy, but was a combination of all the other sauces.  it comes in a plastic bag, so we put on our plastic bibs and dug in!  it was delicious...the crab was meaty and the seasoning was just right.  just thinking about the taste right now makes my mouth water.  we also ordered the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  maybe you would have better luck, but if you want my honest advice, do not order those!  they were soggy and gross.\n\nthis is a must try if you have never experienced anything like this.  i would definitely come here again.  do not wear nice clothes here if you plan to go clubbing afterwards, keep an open mind, and enjoy!", 
            "solid 4.5 stars. (docked half a star for the slow service).\n\ni've lived in las vegas for 6 months now, and can't believe it has taken me this long to try this place.  i have been to boiling crab and other places like it in southern california, but this place is by far- my favorite.  the \"hot n juicy\" sauce is the best i've had.  \n\ni came with 2 other people, and we ordered  a calamari appetizer, 2 lbs of shrimp, 1 lb of crawfish, and a <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> (2.4 lbs), and a side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>.  and i am so glad i ordered the rice, because after all of the crustaceans were devoured, the rice was the perfect vessel to soak up the remaining sauce.  \n\neverything was delicious, but the <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> was the star.  every bite was perfection- so meaty, so sweet, so juicy! this is now my go to place to bring las vegas visitors!", 
            "this place is delicious!! \n\nthe hot n juicy seasoning is so good! the shrimp was tasty as was the crawfish but the <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> was spectacular! it was so tender, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. probably one of the best crabs i have ever tasted.\n\njust thinking about the sauce makes me drool a little bit!\n\nthis service was so-so but the food greatly made up for it and i would most definitely come back next time i'm in town!", 
            "stay away from the <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>.  they claim its fresh but they are actually recooking cooked crabs.  the meat was mushy upon opening so we complained and received another new crab. it was however the same mushy and spoiled crab.  other than that everything else was fine.", 
            "pretty good...for vegas.  here's my recap:  parking could be better.  not a lot of spaces.  available spaces were a little tight.  seated immediately upon entering.  the place was pretty busy.  many tables with chairs, some with booths.  some booth seating was not accessible because the neighboring table was too close.  servers were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.  menu offered crawfish, shrimp, oysters, clam, lobster, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, and snow crab.  all market prices.  seasoning choices were <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.  choice of mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy.  sides: corn, potato, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, rice, rolls, and sausage.  also, appetizers were etoufee and a large variety of fried items: calamari, hot wings, soft shell crab, catfish, shrimp, and chicken nuggets.  we ordered two pounds of boiled shrimp: one <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> medium and the other <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> medium.  bibs were served first.  the bottom of the bib folds over to make a pocket to catch debris you drop.  we also ordered a side of white rice.  the cook time seemed about right, not real fast, but not too slow either.  constant line for men's restroom.  only one person at a time.  many people waiting to get in to wash their hands after eating.  the food comes out as it is ready, not served at the same time.  i prefer this method.  the shrimp is served in a clear plastic bag and the shells are left on the table.  plastic table cloth makes for quick and easy clean up.  the shrimp was good sized, hot, and flavorful.  there was a little extra juice in the bottom of the bag which we used to dip our shrimp once peeled.  also, we ladled some on the rice for a bit of flavor.  the shrimp was head and shell on.  this requires a little work, but is the traditional way to serve, saves the kitchen a bit of time, and leads one to believe the shrimp were alive when cooked.  i lived in louisiana for many years so i know there is a difference between <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> and cajun style, but i don't know why they made the distinction here.  most patrons in vegas won't know the difference.  the difference here is that louisiana had more butter and cajun was more traditional with more spices and less brother allowing the sweet flavor of the shrimp to come through better.  the difference is almost not noticeable, but i prefer their <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>.  the rice was okay.  all in all the food was pretty good.  we really enjoyed it.  on a side note, they did not purge the shrimp.  that is, the gastrointestinal track and the poop were still in the shrimp.  vegas patrons don't know any better.  its kind of gross, but i ate anyways knowing that it won't hurt you (otherwise, the place would have been shut down a long time ago).  there were plenty of paper napkins at each table and wet wipes served at the counter and with the bill, but i would have preferred a washing station, similar to those at cravin cajun.  you get really, really messy eating boiled shrimp and that stuff is super painful if you get it in your eyes.  they do serve alcohol, but we had tap water, which was served in styrofoam cups.  the server did not ask if we wanted lemon, but she brought out a styrofoam bowl with almost two whole lemons (kind of a waste).  shrimp was $8.99 per pound and the side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> was $2.  we really enjoyed this experience and will be coming back.  i tried the crawfish on a previous visit here.  it was the best crawfish in vegas.  flavor was right, but a bit small for louisiana standards.  i love crawfish, but think the shrimp is a better deal because there is much more meat.  i really like this place, but cravin cajun is better.",

            "this was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious! we got a pound of crawfish (medium spicy) and a <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> (hot n juicy style). great seasoning, good quality seafood, fair market prices. since it's so popular, there is usually a wait at the door- we waited about 30 min. the wait staff is helpful & informative, but it's hard to hear due to the noise level in there- the music is great, tho a little loud. the food arrives in good time, but the staff was a little slow in keeping up with the drinks considering how spicy it is ;) \none thing to beware of- the parking lot gets crowded & often people park on frontier street- when i returned to my car, the window was smashed :( so, park in that neighborhood at your own risk!",

            "since returning from houston a couple of months ago, i found myself craving crawfish any chance i get.  after experiencing the crawfish craze in the westminster area of southern california, imagine my delight when i saw the sign for \"hot n juicy crawfish\" in las vegas.\n\nthe bf and i anxiously awaited the opening of this first of its kind restaurant in sin city and finally got to sit down to dinner the past sunday.  inviting a couple of newbies made the dining experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nwe started off with a pound each of the crawfish in every flavor - <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and hot n juicy combo.  at $8.99/lb, it was a dollar more than socal prices but we were okay with it.  for every two pounds you order, you get one corn and one potato.  so, we made sure we got our corn pieces and <mark>Potato</mark> and were able to choose what flavor we wanted it in.  (in the end, we ordered additional corn and potato on the side, corn runs about 50 cents each.)  we also threw an order of sausage ($2.50 for half a dozen or $4.00 for a dozen).  depending on the season, they should be offering <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, and shrimp.  you can also order oysters, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> or oyster baskets, catfish po-boy sandwich, or a basket of fries.\n\nthey didn't ask us how spicy we wanted our crawfish, later on telling us they automatically make it spicy unless otherwise stated.  the heat was a good amount, not too hot that it was unbearable and enough where we reached for our beverages.  of the four, i would say the <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> had the least flavor while the hot n juicy combo had the most.  we ordered four more pounds of the hot n juicy combo in this sitting.  the sausage was actually spicier than the crawfish!  we also found the crawfish to be pretty clean overall.  we're ones to suck up all the juices from the heads too, so they gotta be clean.  and i gotta admit, the last two pounds we had were especially good.  they do a good job on having cleaner crawfish than other places i've experienced.\n\nbe sure to get the salt and pepper mixture too.  you get a bowl of cut up limes and you squeeze all the lime juice into the little plastic cup and mix it all together.  this is usually meant for you to dip your crawfish in, but i found myself not needing it that much.\n\nservice was better too.  upon entering, they line your table up with the white plastic covering and lay out a roll of paper towels.  they also provide bibs too.  you can ask for plastic gloves, but they just get in the way.  they asked us often if we needed refills on our beverages and how we were doing overall.  (i would say this is probably because they are a new restaurant, i only hope they continue with this service in the future.)\n\nthey had a steady flow of customers this holiday weekend night.  it didn't get too busy, but they were never empty either.\n\nin conclusion, the four of us were pleased with our experience at hot n juicy crawfish.  it looks like we'll be coming back here a lot!  yay!\n\nside note: there's a 17% gratuity added for parties of six or more.\n\n(you can check out my food photos up above!)", 
            "not bad at all.  the crawfish was meatier than a similar one in california.  the <mark>Blue Crab</mark> was also good.  the shrimp pieces were nice and big.  what i like about this place is that it has good seasoning to choose from such as <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, house special, cajun style, and one other i can't remember.  they give you a piece of corn and a potato for ordering a 2lb bag of crawfish.  the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are good, but you can get similar tasting fries at a lot of places.  the medium spiciness has some kick to it.  they have actually five levels of spiciness which is ridiculous unless you're a hardcore fan of spicy food.  the service was good, but maybe it was because i went for lunch at a non-busy time.  the prices are just a dollar more than california, but it's still worth it.", 
            "fun place to go.  service was good and you just eat everything like a viking.  i found the crawfish to be unsatisfying....too much work for such a little amount of meat but good flavor.  we had to order a pound of shrimp after we ordered 2 pounds of crawfish and a pound of <mark>Blue Crab</mark> because neither of us felt remotely full.  everything tasted great though.  but i will only order the shrimp the next time we come here.  \n\nas soon as we were leaving, a bunch of poker players (jc tran, nam le, amnon fillipi etc) came through the door to eat.  i thought it was interesting that these guys could eat at picasso every night yet they chose to come here of all the places on a wednesday night.", 
            "my so loves spicy food ( she's chinese ) and she is always taking me to chinatown to try various places serving spicy fare...after hearing about hot n juicy i decided this might interest her.  in a nutshell...she loved this place !!!  do not wear your sunday best to this place !!  yes, they give you a big roll of paper towels on the table....yes they give you that tacky lobster bib ( use it...you're not to cool ) \nshe ordered a pound of the crawfish w/ house special sauce ( basically all the other sauces combined ) extra spicy.....i ordered the shrimp and sausage with medium sauce ( yeah,...i admit...i'm a wimp ! )  before getting the food my so kept yakking about some city in china ( it may have been shanghai ...can't remember ) that there is a street of restaurants that only serve spicy crawfish ...she loves the stuff....she can be picky  about the food and how it's served - i was pleased she did not have attitude when her food came out in a plastic bag - no plates, forks, etc...just a bag of food...she put down a paper towel and she went to town...every now and then she would say...\"so good\"  or \"yummy-yummy\"  but for the most part just  kept working on those lil buggers...her cheeks getting redder and redder due to the heat...she was in heaven...we ordered another poiund...she ate that...she was still hungry....she is not a big eater....we ordered 2 pounds to go\n\noverall, it is a fun place...next time we will try the crab...btw...the shrimp were very good, lots of butter and garlic...i asked the server if they served bread ( they don't ) i wanted a roll to slop up the sauce at the bottom of the bag !!\n\na little pricey - total bill was $66...and we were still hungry ( but we did have an extra 2 pound bag ...so ate that the next day for lunch )\n\nwe need places like this in the vegas valley !!!  variety is the spice of life\n\nupdate - 2nd visit -  tried the <mark>Blue Crab</mark>....so loved it...too much work for me... after one crab, i went back to the shrimp - i was pleased to see they listen to their customers - they added the option of buying rice and also rolls....they also had a special - $2.50 coronas and heinekens....again, maybe a little pricey but this place is all good !\n\nupdate 3rd visit ----  they've added <mark>King Crab</mark> legs to the menu ...$20.95 / pound ....i guess i'm an elitist ...my only complaint about the kcl ...they don't cut them in 1/2 ....very tasty ! so did her usual - 2 lbs of crawfish at the restaurant, 2 pounds to go - she thought this was the freshest batch of crawfish she's had in our 5 visits to h&j !", 
            "found this joint only because of yelp -- so thanks, guys!  took my neighbor and her 13 yr old and my mother...we were prepared to get down and dirty...\n\nour first impression was that on a friday night, this place should have been much busier -- it almost made us nervous -- but we soldiered on.   \n\nthe four of us ordered 3 pounds of shrimp, a pound of crawfish and a half pound of sausage -- all with mild \"hot n juicy\" (which is all of their sauces combined).  word to the wise, i was sort of bummed about ordering it mild, but we had a \"tendertongue\" with us... maybe i'm out of fire breathing practice because we thought the mild - like others on yelp - was definitely hot enough.  first you have to peel the saucy shrimp or crawfish while it's hot out of the steamer -- but then you realize once things cool down to the touch that your tongue is still on fire.   \n\nwe ordered rolls -- and that was the fun part -- sopping up all the great sauce (since they don't use newspapers on the tables, this is possible...)\n\nwe thought the shrimp was definitely better than the crawfish.  they were out of dungeness and <mark>Blue Crab</mark> tonight -- altho had snow crab but we were worried about the texture -- and honestly the shrimp were really good.\n\nthe 13 year old is a shrimp-oholic...we ended up ordering another pound for him and the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> for us...really good crispy fries, too.  we girls all had beers -- perfect with the shrimp -- but honestly, once you start eating, you have to keep going -- because you're so slimed, you really can't stop and drink...i'd say we easily went through a roll of paper towels.  and they cleared us up before our 2nd round of shrimp and gave us a new plastic tablecloth and fresh drinks.  \n\nservice was genuine -- a little flakey and not really clued into the real reason they were out of crab -- but...does that really matter?  \n\nbeware, it's very easy to miss if you're heading from the strip westbound -- fortunately it's on the right hand side if you're heading west on spring mt before you reach decatur.  then the easiest way to get back to henderson is to take decatur back to the 215 -- another warning -- they're doing some crazy roadwork on decatur headed south -- so be careful -- the road is badly marked, dark and nuts...\n\nwe'll definitely go back -- but this is not for the faint of heart, anyone who doesn't like to eat with their hands or has an aversion to plastic.  \n\nour total bill came to $70 and change before tip.  but we had 4 pounds of shrimp (16 - 20s), 1/2 pound of sausage, 1 pound of crawfish, about a dozen rolls, 1 pc of corn and 1 potato, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, 5 beers and used up more wetnaps than i'm sure any table has ever before...so we thought it was completely fair.\n\n(naturally, we stopped at sheridan's frozen custard on the way home...)\n\nfun friday!", 
            "wow this was as close to home( new orleans ) as you can get here in las vegas. i will start by saying please don't let the location stop you from visiting this restaurant. i live in henderson and do not go across town to often to eat. it is a simple family owned place that we need more of in this town. the food is simple to order its all by the pound. we ordered 2 pounds of shrimp (our favorite), 2 pounds of crawfish (very good) both were mild with the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce. they tasted great but if you want more of the louisiana taste get the 2nd sauce i think it is called <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>. we also tried the fried soft shell crab with fries (oh so good), oysters on the half shell(fresh and good size, from the gulf not salty but i think its because of the season), potato's, corn, and sausage (potato's and corn are a must have, the sausage was ok) and last we got the etouffee (this was ok my wife really liked it i thought it had to many bell peppers but thats just me). there is more on the menu but all i could try this visit. i will return for sure the food is really that good. i put $$$ for the price because i ordered more than we needed but you will spend 25 to 35 per person easy.please visit this restaurant they are doing so much perfect. the service was very friendly. thank you to everyone for your reviews. it was the reason i had to try it.\n\nwent back for some live <mark>Blue Crab</mark> and everything was as good as the 1st time. the <mark>Blue Crab</mark> is now my favorite. the bread rolls also are a must have to eat with the sauce. i know this place is different but if you love seafood please give it a try.", 
            "never been to anyplace like this before and we are completely hooked! now we wish that las vegas is only 10 minutes away. the place was cozy, very clean and our server was very gracious and attentive. the food a++++!!! we ordered 1/2 dozen oysters, a lb of <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Shrimp</mark>, and  crawfish, a basket of soft shell crab with <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and three beers - for only $59. unbelievable!!! (yes, we were starving, we just came from the boneyard tour). you can never ever find anything affordable like this in the bay area! and the seasoning, hot n juicy in medium.. arrrghhh. so good!! i can't help dipping my fries and <mark>Shrimp</mark> on this special sauce. now hubby and i can't stop kicking ourselves for not going twice, but it's all good, we're going back to vegas this labor day and hot n juicy is on top of our list!", 
            "wanna try something different, have lots of fun eating and just have a good night out?  then grab some friends, your wallet and head on over the hot n juicy crawfish.\n\nthis is a place that you have to try ... once .. just for the experience.\n\nwent on a weeknight for the experience.  order the dungenous crab (they were out), <mark>Blue Crab</mark> (they were out too) and settled with: crawfish, shrimp and alaskan <mark>King Crab</mark>, and an order of <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>.\n\nthe dinner might have been better with dungenous crab, but overall was just ok.  the crawfish -- there isn't anything there.  so little meat.  brings back memories of  \"where's the beef\" commercials.\nthe shrimp was good and the <mark>King Crab</mark> was ok.  you can tell that the crab was frozen.  the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were good and spicy.\n\nremember to dress comfortably & wash your hands when you get there.  you eat with your hands here and there are lots of paper towels on the table for you to use.\n\nhaving tried crawfish, i probably won't return on the next trip to lv.", 
            "dear husband and i just got back from our oh, i dunno, sixth visit to this place?  we reek of garlic and our lips are burning but our bellies are very, very happy.\n\nsometimes we order takeout and drive roundtrip from henderson to get it.\n\nwe had the cajun-style crawfish this time, two pounds each - as well as the catfish.  we wanted the etoufee, but they were out.  hubby said the next time we discuss going to hush puppies for catfish, remind him to go to hot n' juicy instead.  i got the medium spiciness and hubby got the spicy and we were both wincing at the heat.  the blue moon beer helped with that.\n\ni have to say that i prefer the shrimp to the crawfish - for the \"more meat\" argument that previous reviewers have noted.  i also like ordering sausage to add to the mix.\n\ni have yet to try the dungeness or <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, i guess i never go during the right season.\n\ni'd give this place a five if i hadn't had crawfish in louisiana.  no place beats dwights in lafayette.", 
            "i agree, this place is awesome. i'm from maryland and we don't really have any good seafood restaurants out here.  anybody interested in live <mark>Blue Crab</mark> and crawfish at lower prices should check out nvseafood.com", 
            "was here just the other day while in town for halloween. i came in hoping it was good, and left satisfied. they were out o f a couple of items we would have tired, but we did get the <mark>King Crab</mark>, whole <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, crawfish, and calamari. the crawfish and the crab we got with varying amounts of heat, all on the hot n juicy sauce. the sauce was very good. plenty of tase, not simply liquid butter. add dollar beers to that(not sure if all bottles are $1 everyday or not) and it added up to a very good time. i would definately go back.\n\nthe only minus is that they really have nothing but seafood. several in our party do not like this kind of seafood, so their only choice was <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>(which they do not even have sauces for, they come out dry) and fries. a bit small of a non seafood choice.\n\nour waitress was very helpful and attentive as well.", 
            "after all the reviews, decided why not give it a try?  wow, packed on a sunday nite with a 20 minute wait.  know all about eating the spicy mudbugs after living in houston 7 yrs.  the crawfish were really good, not soggy and mildly spiced for my tastes choosing the hot n juicy spice.  they were out of stone & <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, leaving only king legs and snow crab to choose from.  i got the tiny sized snow crabs, my friend got the shrimp platter.  both were mostly fries.  this place would die a quick death in south texas or the bayou country.\n\npros: food came out really fast, miller lite by the bottle served really cold.\ncons: limited items available that night, say they serve beer & wine but wine was only sold by the bottle last night.  atmosphere gets a zero, we were packed in like sardines, forgive the pun. waitress seemed frazzled, maybe it was her first night.  had to ask for lemons, wtf?", 
            "robyn, my future daughter-in-law had her trepidations about bringing me to hot 'n juicy crawfish... in the past few years, virtually every place she thought i would like turned out to me... just average, at best... and she heard from my youngest kids, that dad doesn't like to touch his food - which is mandatory at hot 'n juicy.\n\nwhen your pound of either <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, shrimp, or crawfish is brought out in it's plastic bag... the plastic bib and the paper towels are definitely not enough \"protection\" to prevent yourself from getting messy! in fact, i'm proud to admit after the four of us finished the 2 pounds of combos - we had the largest remnants of \"stuff\" by far of anyone dining that evening.\n\nyou'll receive a free cob of corn and a small potato with every 2 pounds of stuff ordered. but, i recommend more - just for the fact that you'll have something pretty neutral to offset the heat from the crawfish.\n\nhot 'n juicy's recommendation of how to eat crawfish is:\n 1) gently twist the head apart from the tail.\n 2) take the head and suck the juice from inside.\n 3) peel away 2 to 3 segments of shell from the tail to expose more meat.\n 4) pinch the bottom end of the tail while carefully pulling the meat out of the shell.\n\ni have a few modifications to this procedure... why would i suck on a crawfish head when i don't do it to it's bigger cousin lobster? that just.... sucks! i break off the tail from the head section and only retrieve the meat from the tail section.\n\nthe absolute best value is the shrimp...\ni treat the shrimp at hot 'n juicy like the salt & pepper shrimp that is prepared at chinese restaurants. i consume the tail section, shell and all - it's just too much work trying to de-skin the shrimp! when robyn heard that --- eww!\n\nrobyn's recommendation: order a pound of <mark>Blue Crab</mark> legs and a pound of shrimp.\n\nkevin and kathy's (my daughter) suggestion: crawfish and shrimp.\n\nmy suggestion: after a crawfish & shrimp combo... i'd go for a shrimp and shrimp...\n\nsuggestions for sides - bread rolls, <mark>Potato</mark>, <mark>Sausage</mark> are ok. corn on the cob, which is boiled along with the crawfish literally turns into cream of corn - way too soft.\n\nand... don't breathe and eat at the same time! took me a few minutes to recover from the heat going down! kevin tried some of my spicy crawfish and subsequently devloped a heat reaction - blotches of red all over his face and neck. i think for most - spicy is hot enough.\n\nrobyn was totally shocked when i gave hot 'n juicy a yelper rating of 5-stars - despite that fact that you can't avoid getting messy here and despite scrubbing down with virtually all the soap in the restroom afterwards and returning home probably needing a bath / shower... you can't help but have a pretty good time!\n\ni can't think of a more enjoyable time to spend a couple of hours people watching - customers or your dinner companions getting down n' dirty with the crawfish, or just to lower your own clean-freak inhibitions.\n\ni was wondering why this restaurant was located in the un-officially designated chinatown along spring mountain... so far as i could see that evening, there was only one waitress of asian descent... i queried our waitress whether hot 'n juicy was asian-owned - she replied that the owner was thai and resided in texas and was the second crawfish place he owned.\n\nhighly recommended by one who abhors using his dainty fingers....\n\n\ni do have one last thought though.... what exactly is the chemical reaction of flash boiling on a plastic bag? are there any chemical breakdowns of the plastic bag that the usda should be worried about?", 
            "my sister was in town and we both wanted to try this place after seeing it on man v. food (travel channel). \n\nas we pulled into the super small parking lot, we both noticed the sign that said $1 beers on sunday and mondays!!\n\nwhat we ordered:\n\n 2 lbs of crawfish in their hot n juicy sauce medium spicy (comes w/1 corn and 1 potato)\n\n1 lb of shrimp in the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce mild spicy\n-added 1 corn and 1 potato\n\nhad a couple heineken lights and blue moons\n\nthe crawfish were a bit on the smaller side but the sauce was great. the medium spicy was a little too spicy for my sister, but perfect for me. the <mark>Shrimp</mark> were big and the sauce was good too. the corn and potato were just ok.\n\nnext time i come here, i will pass on the crawfish. i will get <mark>Shrimp</mark> for sure and probably try the <mark>Blue Crab</mark>.\n\ni hope they get some better soap in the restroom because i couldn't get the smell of the sauce off my hands until i washed them again back at the hotel. \n\ni'm glad i was just wearing tshirt and jeans because your clothes smell like the sauces when you leave the place.", 
            "i love this place!  mudbugs, crawfish, crawdad, whatever you want to call them i love to eat them!  another gem located way off the strip on spring mountain rd which is asian food heaven from what i saw driving around.  the place was crowded which is always a good sign.  the crawfish was very fresh as i think we are nearing peak season.  nice big juicy suckers with plenty of tail meat.  all crustaceans (crawfish, king/snow crab, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark> and shirmp) have a choice to be bathed with mild to extra spicy <mark>Extra Seasoning Sauce</mark>.  the spice level is as stated.  no watering it down for the tourists.  when they mean spicy, it will be spicy.  best to avoid the extra spicy unless you are participating in some food challenge or trying to show off.  not really a first date kind of place but heck if you bring someone here you both should know what you are getting in to.  parking is beyond tiny and likely you will need to park on the side street which is a little on the sketchy side.  the servers were all fun and eager to please with refills constantly coming.", 
            "hot n' juicy is an old favorite of mine located on spring mountain between decatur and jones. hot n' juicy is definitely the messiest eatery in town, and all the more fun because of it. sometimes when i give that description people don't want to try it, but it would be a shame not to. besides the fun of eating here, the food is great. how can you really go wrong with fresh seafood, butter, and cajun seasonings?\n\ntoday i ordered one pound of the crawfish ($9.99) and my husband ordered one pound of the snow crab ($13.99). we both asked for the hot n' <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning, extra spicy! you are free to choose your heat level as well as the style of seasoning you prefer - <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, juice cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, or <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. besides crawfish and snow crab, you can also order <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, or shrimp.\n\nthe first time i had a crawfish boil was at my brother's graduation from university of the south in sewanee, tennessee. i remember them dumping huge buckets of steamed crawfish onto the tables and everyone would just have at them, discarding the shells and heads onto neighboring tables. at hot n' juicy it's a little different, but not much. you are given bibs and your table is covered in white plastic that is accessorized with your own roll of paper towels. they bring your crawfish in plastic bags that are tied at the top to capture the heat. when you open the bag you get an aromatic burst of spicy steam that gets you really excited for what you are about to enjoy. this is where the fun starts. crawfish are peel and eat little buggers that require somewhat of an experienced eater to navigate through them in order to get to the savory bits. first you must detach the tail, which you peel just as you would the tail of a shrimp. then, and this is most flavorful part, you must suck the head by gently squeezing it into your mouth so you can get all the juices and inner goodness out of it. if this sounds totally disgusting to you, go for the crab. they supply you with crab crackers, but ian and i agree they should probably pre-crack them for you to make the experience easier and allow all the seasoned butter to seep into the meat. whatever you decide to get, i'm sure you'll enjoy it.\n\nif you order two pounds of crawfish you get a hunk of corn on the cob and a red potato in your bag, but since we ordered one pound each of different items we opted for the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> ($2.99). these came out hot n' spicy with a side of cooling ketchup. we managed to reserve some of the fries to dip in the juices at the bottom of our bags, and this was way better than the ordinary condiment. who would have thought that you could make french fries even tastier and more unhealthy with the addition of seasoned butter? i guess europeans serve their fries with mayonnaise, so i don't feel too guilty or out of line.\n\nby the time you are finished, it looks like hurricane katrina has hit your table leaving a mass of wet and crumpled paper towels in her wake. this is certainly not a prime location for a wedding reception, but if you don't mind getting your hands dirty in the name of taste, you really should try hot n' juicy almost any other time.", 
            "delicious!!! \n\nyou walk in and that smell of garlic hits you and you automatically become hungry. \n\ncrawfish and <mark>Blue Crab</mark> my fave, in hot n juicy sauce ( which is all of their sauces combined) \n\nthe shrimp can be mushy if they're of bad quality. i havent had good quality yet so i tend to stay away from that. \n\nalso order their fries and wings! super crispy and they stay that way throughout the meal. \n\nnom nom nom! i am glad theres one in vegas so i dont have to go to california to get a boiling crab fix.", 
            "wow, these places are everywhere! it's funny too because it's like asian cajun! i assume only in california and it's closest neighbor vegas have places like this.\n\ni actually really like this place. the spices they use in their signature hot-n-juicy is off the hook, much better than crawdaddy (in san jose) and right up there if not better than boiling crab (in san jose). we ordered the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs in butter and garlic and hot-n-juicy in mild and medium as we were all wimps, shrimp in hot-n-juicy in medium also, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and corn on the cob and <mark>Potato</mark>! i love that they serve the corn on the cob and potato in the bag with the juices, the other places mentioned above don't and they don't have <mark>Potato</mark> either. they also have <mark>Blue Crab</mark> here which the ones in san jose don't have. can't wait to go here again!\n\nthe service wasn't the best, they forgot the fries and i had to keep asking for water. but all in all this is a good off the strip joint for those staying in town for the weekend. get there early because i hear there is usually a wait, sounds like all the other places too!", 
            "this place was incredible.  after reading about it we went straight there from the airport.  it did not disappoint.  two of us had 2 lbs each of the snow crab, <mark>King Crab</mark> and shrimp.  the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce was delicious, the hot n juicy sauce even better.  service was super attentive.  only negative was they ran out of <mark>Blue Crab</mark> before we'd gotten there.  next time for sure...", 
            "this was my first time eating crawfish... and i must say that it's a lot of work to get to a small amount of meat but it is fun and messy. they cover the table with a plastic tablecloth and have complimentary crawfish bibs to wear to protect your clothes. i think it's worthwhile trying the crawfish at least once! \n\nwe tried a few other things from the menu including snow crab (this was awesome), <mark>Blue Crab</mark> (skip this altogether) <mark>King Crab</mark>, shrimp (definitely order this!), sausage, corn, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, potato and one of my personal favorites, the \\u00e9touff\\u00e9e! the sausage comes in sliced pieces and i found it delicious to add to the \\u00e9touff\\u00e9e which is much like a gumbo. \n\nwe came here twice. the place is constantly packed to capacity, the parking lot full and a waiting list to get a table but it's well worth the wait trust me!", 
            "ive been going to this place since the week it opened, and of course since i am \"asian\" i needed to eat rice with my food so i would actually bring in my own rice until i finally was able to convince the owner to put rice on the menu and she did. \n\ni watch this place grow so busy over the last several years now and im so happy for the owners that this place became a huge success. \n\ni want to make a very true  and clear point here because its just very dissappointing to find out to hear what people will do for vengeance to make a fabulous place like this shut down.  to the person who loves to spread false information and to put it on this on the news is completely outright wrong! and secondly karma is a bitch cause you messed up in the first place...hate it to say it to the folks but this place is not going to shut down.\n\nthere will always be dissatisfied customers no matter what! no matter what!\nhonestly,  this place is not gonna make everyone happy, i mean, what business out there does???? this is america people! we love to complain, and all the better, we loooove to sue each others ass off!!\n\n all i can tell you is that since ive been coming here along with all the waaaaay tooooo many people i referred this place to and i rarely ever got a bad response, and only a few times i did get one its because they were either 1) don't eat seafood 2) extremely fickle picky eaters.\n\nbut this place is outstanding, and consistent, its always freaking busy! so the customer service is not always gonna be 110% on top of things, your not coming here for superb service, your coming here for seafood cajun style and  of course, if you like it \"spicy\". if your a customer and you demand perfect food along with perfect service go take yourself to a 5 star rated michelin awarded restaurant cause theres a few here in vegas, and spend your $500  + worth of experiencing excellent dining. \n\nother than that,  ive said what i needed to say. nonetheless, hot and juicy, when it comes to great seafood and spice and <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, you never fail me, you just make me and all the rest of your fans from vegas, l.a., the bay, and everyone else from all over,coming back for more!!!!!!!!", 
            "honestly, if i have never been to the boiling crab in san jose this would have easily been a 5 star rating for me.  i just love the atmosphere of the whole place..from the garlic smell (that follows you through your clothing for the rest of your day by the way) to the get-down-and-dirty style.  some things just taste better eating with your hands and this is one of those occasions.  seating did not take very long and our server was very friendly and helpful.  he explained the system to us and forewarned us that even mild has a kick to it since it is a cajun restaurant.  my lips were burning by the end of my meal with mild, so if you don't like spicy food, do not come here!\n\nwe ordered <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> since the <mark>Blue Crab</mark> and the <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> were out (that was upsetting).  we got it with the hot n juicy seasoning, which the server explained did not mean it was spicy, but was a combination of all the other sauces.  it comes in a plastic bag, so we put on our plastic bibs and dug in!  it was delicious...the crab was meaty and the seasoning was just right.  just thinking about the taste right now makes my mouth water.  we also ordered the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  maybe you would have better luck, but if you want my honest advice, do not order those!  they were soggy and gross.\n\nthis is a must try if you have never experienced anything like this.  i would definitely come here again.  do not wear nice clothes here if you plan to go clubbing afterwards, keep an open mind, and enjoy!", 
            "i can honestly admit i'm a lazy person when it comes to eating. cutting a piece of meat with a knife and/or fork/spoon (when i'm even lazier) is probably the most strenuous work i'll tolerate. using my fork or spoon is enough, isn't it?\n\nthe only, i repeat only, food i'll take time to carefully work at and eat is shellfish...specifically crab, lobster and crawfish. unfortunately, being located in the tri state area, there is a lack of crawfish which saddens me. since i was in town for work i jumped at the opportunity to eat one of my favorite shellfish friends...crawfish!\n\nafter leaving the ces convention center, my colleagues and i hailed a taxi* and requested to go to hot n juicy located in chinatown. a split second later, we realized hot n juicy sounded like a strip club so we joked around with the taxi driver and insisted it wasn't a peep show. we were going to that after we ate.\n\nmy colleagues didn't know it but i was giggling like a little school girl when we arrived. unfortunately for them, they aren't as adventurous when it comes to food so they ordered calamari, <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> and fries which they enjoyed.\n\nour waiter was extremely informative, briefly describing to us (mostly me) how to order the seafood (per pound), by seasoning and spiciness. since i've been to boiling crab i already knew what i wanted...2 lbs of <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> crawfish with medium heat. the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> seasoning is so mouth wateringly good that i could drink it as a side (not recommended though). they serve the seafood in plastic bags with bibs and paper towels. this is the messiest meal you will ever eat but so worth it. i was in business attire but was able to leave without any stains!\n\nas i twisted and separated the head and tail, sucked the head and pushed out the meat from the tail...my colleagues looked at me in complete disgust like i was a monster. did i feel bad? not at all. i easily finished the 2 lbs of crawfish like a true fatty. i ordered medium heat but my mouth was on fire pretty much the entire time i was eating so to counteract the heat, i took big swigs of beer which helped. \n\nthe seafood pricing on the menu says market price so be sure to ask the waiter beforehand. the crawfish was about $10 per pound. currently, they're having a bogo shrimp special because they opened up another hot n juicy location in washington, dc. do i hear a road trip?\n\nmy next visit will showcase their <mark>Blue Crab</mark> legs. if you're ever in vegas or dc, i would highly recommend coming here if you're a seafood lover and don't mind getting messy. it's a freakin' dream.\n\na fun tip, hot n juicy was on man vs. food.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n*in las vegas, taxis aren't allowed to pick up passengers on streets like nyc. they have to pull into a parking lot, hotel, restaurant, etc.", 
            "when i hear the term 'hot and juicy', crawfish is the last thing that comes to my mind so when i heard about a restaurant called \"hot and juicy crawfish\", i had to check it out. i had heard that it was casual, not too expensive for seafood and had an interesting approach to service.\nwe went there monday night for dinner with our boy, sean, who was visiting from so. cal. we found the restaurant on the sleazy edge of chinatown in a small strip center next to a chinese massage parlor and a karaoke bar. didn't look to special on the outside but even out in the parking lot, we could smell the garlic in the air.\n\nwe went in and it was equally unimpressive inside but we were greeted pleasantly and seated quickly by the window under the neon light....ah, ambiance. the table was covered with a thin plastic tablecloth and contained only a roll of paper towels. the slender menu listed a variety of shellfish, crab, shrimp and, of course, crayfish, all of which are ordered by the pound. side orders were limited and included mostly corn on the cob, rice and french fries or potato.\nwe ordered the crayfish with cajun sauce, shrimp with lemon-pepper sauce and <mark>Blue Crab</mark> with the garlic sauce. you can order any sauce from mild to paralyzing spicy. we went with mild which turned out to be pretty spicy on its own accord.\n\nthe food comes out piping hot, almost too hot to touch; dropped unceremoniously on the table all tied up in a plastic bags with all that sauce. you open the bag and dig in with your hands...no tableware of any kind except for a cracker for the crab.\n\nas to the quality of the food...delicious...hot and juicy. all the sauces were fabulous. the crayfish is something we'd not order again, although it was fun to eat. you have to be a real 'crayfishianado' to suck the juice out of the heads like some do (we won't). so that leaves you with the tail which contains about a  \" piece of meat that took more work than it was worth to get to. the shrimp (head, shell and tail intact) were fabulous. twist the head off, peel the shell and eat to your hearts content. we also tried a fried dish...breaded soft shell crab which was served with french fries...also delicious.\n\nif you are looking to take people out to an impressive 'vegas-style' food event, this is definitely not your place. but, if you want an inexpensive place with wonderful seafood, and don't mind getting your hands a little dirty, then i highly recommend it. it would be a blast to go to with friends who are laid-back and have a good sense of humor.", 
            "any place that makes me crave to come back is getting 5 stars from me!  i finally convinced a couple of friends to try the infamous hot n juicy for the first time.  none of us had been here before, but i am pretty sure all of us are returning soon!\n\nwe ordered two pounds of crawfish, and a pound each of shrimp and snow crab.  we opted for the hot n juicy sauce, medium spice.  the spice level of the sauce was right about on for us (although we may go hotter next time!), and the flavor was extremely good.  it was some sort of a garlic sauce that made sucking the juices out of these crustaceans so addicting.  \n\nthe shrimp were by far our favorite.  nice and big in size, and juicy.  they weren't that hard to peal really, with the heads on them.  the crawfish were also tasty, although there was a lot less meat in them (obviously).  i am not a big crawfish eater, but these were so damn good that i probably would get them again just for the experience of cracking them open!  the money paid for the crawfish versus how much meat you get might not be worth it to some, but the experience is worth it to me.  the <mark>Blue Crab</mark> legs were few, but large and extremely delicious!\n\ni can't wait to come back, so hot n juicy is getting a 5 star review from me.  the waitresses are cute and friendly and they'll make sure you know how to crack those shellfish!  this place definitely deserves the a+ reputation that it has earned.", 
            "when the crawfish and <mark>Blue Crab</mark> are fresh...they are the most delectable, mouth-watering, delicious dish in the world (wow...it makes me salivate just thinking about it)! if you love crawfish! this is the place! the hot n juicy seasoning (the mix of everything) is the best i've ever tasted. i'm a chicken, so i stick to mild...\n\nbut i didn't give them 5 stars because if the crawfish are frozen...stay away! the waitress did warn us...and they were $6.99/lb but my sister was in town for thanksgiving, and i raved to her about this place. eeee gads! we got 5 lbs and they were mushy! i think my sister complained of a belly ache afterwards. not me, i have a strong stomach for crawfish...ha ha...\n\nwe did get a couple pounds of the fresh <mark>Blue Crab</mark> and they were heavenly and the meat sweet and tender!\n\nalso, be prepared...it's messy! make sure you wear a bib. thank goodness there are plenty of paper towels...i think i used up a whole roll...\n\ni highly recommend this place, as long as the crawfish and seafood are fresh! i think between july - september, they are the biggest!!! i'm sure i will be back there in january when they are in season (small...? who cares...it's still crawfish)!", 
            "pretty good...for vegas.  here's my recap:  parking could be better.  not a lot of spaces.  available spaces were a little tight.  seated immediately upon entering.  the place was pretty busy.  many tables with chairs, some with booths.  some booth seating was not accessible because the neighboring table was too close.  servers were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.  menu offered crawfish, shrimp, oysters, clam, lobster, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, and snow crab.  all market prices.  seasoning choices were <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.  choice of mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy.  sides: corn, potato, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, rice, rolls, and sausage.  also, appetizers were etoufee and a large variety of fried items: calamari, hot wings, soft shell crab, catfish, shrimp, and chicken nuggets.  we ordered two pounds of boiled shrimp: one <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> medium and the other <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> medium.  bibs were served first.  the bottom of the bib folds over to make a pocket to catch debris you drop.  we also ordered a side of white rice.  the cook time seemed about right, not real fast, but not too slow either.  constant line for men's restroom.  only one person at a time.  many people waiting to get in to wash their hands after eating.  the food comes out as it is ready, not served at the same time.  i prefer this method.  the shrimp is served in a clear plastic bag and the shells are left on the table.  plastic table cloth makes for quick and easy clean up.  the shrimp was good sized, hot, and flavorful.  there was a little extra juice in the bottom of the bag which we used to dip our shrimp once peeled.  also, we ladled some on the rice for a bit of flavor.  the shrimp was head and shell on.  this requires a little work, but is the traditional way to serve, saves the kitchen a bit of time, and leads one to believe the shrimp were alive when cooked.  i lived in louisiana for many years so i know there is a difference between <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> and cajun style, but i don't know why they made the distinction here.  most patrons in vegas won't know the difference.  the difference here is that louisiana had more butter and cajun was more traditional with more spices and less brother allowing the sweet flavor of the shrimp to come through better.  the difference is almost not noticeable, but i prefer their <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>.  the rice was okay.  all in all the food was pretty good.  we really enjoyed it.  on a side note, they did not purge the shrimp.  that is, the gastrointestinal track and the poop were still in the shrimp.  vegas patrons don't know any better.  its kind of gross, but i ate anyways knowing that it won't hurt you (otherwise, the place would have been shut down a long time ago).  there were plenty of paper napkins at each table and wet wipes served at the counter and with the bill, but i would have preferred a washing station, similar to those at cravin cajun.  you get really, really messy eating boiled shrimp and that stuff is super painful if you get it in your eyes.  they do serve alcohol, but we had tap water, which was served in styrofoam cups.  the server did not ask if we wanted lemon, but she brought out a styrofoam bowl with almost two whole lemons (kind of a waste).  shrimp was $8.99 per pound and the side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> was $2.  we really enjoyed this experience and will be coming back.  i tried the crawfish on a previous visit here.  it was the best crawfish in vegas.  flavor was right, but a bit small for louisiana standards.  i love crawfish, but think the shrimp is a better deal because there is much more meat.  i really like this place, but cravin cajun is better.", 
            "i must admit i only wanted to try this place to compare it to my favorite spot in cali. after doing so, i still have my #1 favorite but this one is pretty good as well. i first ordered 1 pound of <mark>Shrimp</mark>, 1 pound of <mark>Blue Crab</mark> and one basket of catfish (pretty much my usual). i shared it of course with my sis. both shrimp and crab was made in the hot n spicy sauce mild. some of my friends got the highest spice level (cringe). the <mark>Shrimp</mark> were huge compared to what i'm use too! this was the first thing that came out and me and my sis went thru it pretty fast and since she wasn't having any of the crabs we decided to get another pound.... terrible mistake cause she got pretty full so we ended up sharing with our whole group hehe. i lucked out on the crab. both females!!! and i love the eggs so i was a happy camper :d \n\none thing and its a very little thing, the cajan fries were not very cajan. it was barely seasoned to what i'm use to... but this place is definitely great!!! make it a place to stop by if your partying in vegas for the weekend", 
            "similar to boiling crab, but a little different.  i cannot say either one is better than the other since they are pretty similar.  both restaurants are delicious.  the difference i noticed was that boiling crab's seasoning has more garlic.  hot and juicy has soft shelled <mark>Blue Crab</mark> with fries; i do not think boiling crab has that.", 
            "i have heard good things about this place for a while and have driven past both locations pretty often. however, i have never really wanted to try hot n juicy crawfish because i am kind of like a cat, lol. i don't like messy eating and if i am going to go out and pay for my food, i prefer all the work to be done for me, if you know what i mean. \n\nthe in-laws were in town and have been wanting to eat here, so we finally came here for dinner the other night. we arrived at just the right time because there were a few tables still open and we were seated right away. 10 minutes later, the restaurant was full and many people were waiting outside. we had no luck with parking. the parking lot is very small and we had to park across the street. \n\nmy husband and the in-laws ordered a variety of seafood: <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, clams, shrimp crawfish, and catfish. \n\ntheir opinions:\n- the shrimp and catfish were the best\n- the crawfish required too much work for too little meat\n- the crab was very hard to take apart\n- \"mild\" was still pretty spicy\n\ni ordered the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. i know, boring right? the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> wasn't very good. i think that the size was decent, but there was just too much breading on them. after eating 2 pieces, i didn't want anymore. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were standard, nothing special. \n\ni'm glad i tried it, but i don't think i would come back again because i didn't enjoy it too much. however, i will give this place 4 starts because my family thought it was alright and had a good time. service was friendly and attentive. we even had nice neighbors who showed us what they had ordered and commented on what tasted good.\n\njust a few tips:\n- do not wear nice clothing because juices will squirt everywhere and you will get dirty!\n-remember to take a shower and do laundry asap because you will smell like the restaurant even after you leave! skin, hair, clothes, everything!", 
            "gave this place another chance.  tried to come here for my birthday a few months ago, only to face a 45 minute wait, a trip to their 2nd location, a waitress dumping a full soda on our table and finding out there was no crab - <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, snow crab , <mark>King Crab</mark> - none at all - only when our server took our order.  this time, i called ahead and yes, they had crab available.  \n\npros - \n\nno wait at 6:15 on a friday night\nbeverages refilled promptly\nservers were friendly\nfood was good\n\ncons -\n\ntwo of us ordered <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>; and server gave each of us a claw cracker tool, and that was it.  no fork, no pick, not even a butter knife or even one of those \"sea sheller\" plastic gadgets.  how did they expect anyone to eat crab without any other tools?  one of us ordered the lobster, and he did get the sea sheller tool.  when i asked for two more, the server said she wasn't sure if they had more, but she would look!  come on, it's a seafood restaurant, and you can't give your customers something as simple as a plastic tool to open <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>?  she did manage to bring two more to our table.\n\nonly the crawfish included corn & <mark>Potato</mark>.  i can understand not including sausage with boiled seafood, but one tiny potato and half an ear of corn for three people added $4 to our bill.  how hard could it be to just include this in every boiled seafood menu item?  petty money grab, imo. and . . .\n\nsausage, corn and <mark>Potato</mark> were brought to the table 10 minutes before we got our seafood.  they were cold by the time we ate them with our seafood.\n\nmarinara sauce with mozzarella sticks from appetizer menu was cold.\n\nseasoning description on menu could have had more information.  i have no idea what was in \"<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>\" or \"<mark>Louisiana Style</mark>\" - white pepper?  black pepper?  red pepper?  paprika?  no clue whatsoever with no information in the menu, and server didn't know either.\n\nparking lot is too small for the capacity of the restaurant.  \n\nif you go -\ncall ahead and ask if they have the seafood you want\npark on the street\nif you plan on ordering crab, bring your own crab tools\ntell your server to bring the corn and <mark>Potato</mark> with your seafood.", 
            "11/1/12 - 6:30pm - i will admit, i am not a huge fan of <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> seafood. however a large group of us were going out for dinner and this is the place they selected. i am pretty opened minded with food and wanted to give it a good shot. \n\nthe place is busy, i definitely recommend planing to arrive with the possibility you will have to wait a minute for a table. my girlfriend and i had a lb of shrimp mild with the hotnspicy special seasoning and a lb of <mark>Blue Crab</mark> with <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>. we also ordered the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and corn fritters. \n\nthe shrimp showed up in a bag marinating in the sauce, the crab came shortly after in its own bag with the fries and fritters in tow. it was messy to eat and absolutely delicious!! i would definitely recommend the pace to anyone who wants to go enjoy some delicious seafood with incredible flavor. we had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed the food!!", 
            "i love seafood and this place definitely has fresh seasonal seafood from <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, crawfish, clams, lobster, oyster, and shrimp. since this place is usually packed, it's recommended that you call ahead for reservations. \n\nthe staff and service is very helpful in recommendations and attentiveness. they will refill your glasses of water when they get a chance, get more napkins whenever they come to your table with more orders, and make sure you order enough before the kitchen is closed. \n\nthe set up is simple: order seafood by the pound. you can choose the seasoning for your seafood (like <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>) as well as the spice level. then, the food is served in clear plastic bags and all you need to do is rip it open and dig in. you can make a mess on the table and not worry about the clean up. it's messy, it's fun, and it's delicious. \n\nbesides seafood, you could order sides like their <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> or rolls to soak up the flavorful broth or sauce that is used to cook the seafood. \n\nfast, fun, and filling, hot n juicy crawfish is the best place for people who want a feast of fresh seafood without the worry of cooking or cleaning up.",

            "the food at this place rocks. don't take a person here though if they don't like spicy food or making a mess when they eat. we made that mistake so one of the members of our party didn't eat. also, the food is very messy but they give you a bib as protection. \n\nall of the food is very spicy and very delicious. we got crawfish which i hadn't had before and there wasn't all that much meat. i also got the <mark>King Crab</mark> and that was awesome! the fried calamari was also good.", 
            "do you like to have your fingers stinging and smelling like garlic for days? then this place is for you!!\n\ni went here after finding it on yelp and my gambling buddy and i had the fried calamari, two pounds of shrimp, one pound of <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, corn, hot n juicy style mild and used a whole messsss of napkins.  it was fabulous.  the only thing i would try differently next time is get it medium in spiciness.", 
            "wanna try something different, have lots of fun eating and just have a good night out?  then grab some friends, your wallet and head on over the hot n juicy crawfish.\n\nthis is a place that you have to try ... once .. just for the experience.\n\nwent on a weeknight for the experience.  order the dungenous crab (they were out), <mark>Blue Crab</mark> (they were out too) and settled with: crawfish, shrimp and alaskan <mark>King Crab</mark>, and an order of <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>.\n\nthe dinner might have been better with dungenous crab, but overall was just ok.  the crawfish -- there isn't anything there.  so little meat.  brings back memories of  \"where's the beef\" commercials.\nthe shrimp was good and the <mark>King Crab</mark> was ok.  you can tell that the crab was frozen.  the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were good and spicy.\n\nremember to dress comfortably & wash your hands when you get there.  you eat with your hands here and there are lots of paper towels on the table for you to use.\n\nhaving tried crawfish, i probably won't return on the next trip to lv.", 
            "i must admit, when the taxi dropped me off, i was nervous ... it doesn't look like much from the outside. \n\n... but the minute you walk in, like a slap in the face, the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> cajun smell hits you and you know you are in for some good eatin' \n\nonce inside the restaurant is clean and there is plenty of room. the tables are covered in plastic and there are professionals here that actually bring surgical gloves to do their grubbin' \n\nthe waitress recommended a mild hot n' juicy seasoning for our shellfish feast, which was the perfect amount of heat for me - might be too much for some. \n\nthe crawfish were the best but the shrimp & <mark>King Crab</mark> legs come in close second. \n\nit was such a fun experience for all of us, we had a blast, probably the most fun i have ever had at lunch!", 
            "i have never been to an authentic crawfish place in the deep south but i can say that this tasted fantastic.\n\nit's set up knowing you're going to eat like a slob. the table is covered with plastic. each table gets its own paper towel roll. everyone gets a bib. and afterwards you get handiwipes. i just went to wash my hands in the bathroom.\n\ni had mild, which other places call medium. their mild is good enough for me. good heat without killing my mouth. shrimp and crawfish were 10.99 a pound when we went 1-2 days ago. i had a pound of each. i'm glad i tried the crawfish but my favorite was the shrimp simply because there was more meat and i liked that it was sweeter and larger bits to eat. i was stuffed so next time if having the crawfish only, get 2 pounds as there is more shell than meat. if shrimp, i think a pound is just fine. i saw someone else get the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs and i may order that next time but i have a hell of a time getting the meat out of those so i may not if they are not pre cut down the length.\n\ni had the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> which is a equal mixture of their 3 sauces( cajun, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>). i'm not sure what it was, but there was an underlying orange and it tasted fantastic! maybe it wasn't orange but it didn't taste like lemon. perhaps it's part of their boil, or an accent in their <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce but wow. really complimented the food and went so yummy with the shrimp.\n\ni want to try the sauces alone next time but it's going to be hard to do because i know i like the mixture already.\n\ni ordered ice tea, and a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> in addition to my seafood boils. the ice tea was ok. not fantastic but good, but then i love a really really strong tea.\n\nthe rice was the perfect compliment for peeling seafood over. it caught all of the juices and was tasty eating when i was done peeling. yum yum good!!!\n\nmy husband had the catfish with fries. he finished way before i did and that was a bit of a bummer because the best part about eating there is peeling with your friends. friends don't let friends eat there without ordering a peeling meal.\n\nthe \"man versus food\" guy is going to be there on thursday but i really would only go if you're interested in crowds. nah..not for me. i just want their good food. i don't need a show to tell me something i already know. go if you like but man it's going to be a zoo.", 
            "just like the food in the big easy. it is sweet to see it in vegas.  <mark>King Crab</mark> in <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> ( both my favorite ) med heat is perfect hot. i will be back", 
            "finally (after the 6th mention of \"i'd really like to try hot & juicy\"), we made it there last night.  we ordered the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark> legs (<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>- mild) and the pound of shrimp (hot & juicy- medium) and corn on the cob. \n\nfirst off, if you don't want to do a little work for your food, don't come here. you have to crack the crabs, peel the shrimp, etc. second, it is messy, but that is part of the fun. we wore the plastic bibs, we went through a roll of napkins and we still had sauce everywhere and we put all the shells right on the garbage bag wrapped table.  \n\nwe both personally enjoyed the <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> sauce on the crab just a little more then the hot & juicy we had on the shrimp. i think it would have been better for us to order mild, because the medium was still really spicy. we liked the catfish, but we took the breading off and dipped it in our cajun sauce. it was really good that way! the fries that came with the catfish were so-so, nothing to write home about. the <mark>King Crab</mark> was a little over $20 for two legs. i would have liked a little more of that, it didn't seem like a whole pound to me but man was it good. i had to have my boyfriend crack it for me though cause <mark>King Crab</mark> legs will stab you repeatedly in the hands if you suck at cracking them. \n\ni have never eaten anything with the head still attached (well at least not that i can recall). i thought it would bother me, but when the shrimp came, i just tore that sucker apart and dug in. well worth the work, i must say.  the corn was delicious as well. yum. overall, a great place and lots of fun. i would really recommend it!!", 
            "so i was at my gf's hotel room at ti, and we were laying down there watching tv relaxing and digesting all the junk and drinks we had the night before and during the day at the pool. we both took a nap and i turned on the tv. then all sudden we realized man vs food was being televised in las vegas. so it caught our attention. so being from texas and having access to good nola type of food an cajun food. i was intrigued that this guy was at a local joint here off spring mountain road ((known for asian food)) and thought to myself.. i gotta try that place out. so needless to say, we jumped in a taxi and headed over there. the minute you get there, your eyes start to water and you can smell the spice from 20 yard out from the front door. i knew at this point i was in love. sorry sweetie, but there is room for more than one love in my life.. its called food :) though, we placed our name on the list and it took a while to sit us down. that was ok, i knew it would be a wait. though, once we sat down and we ordered 2 pounds of crawfish and an order of <mark>King Crab</mark>! we were in love! some of the best food! i cant say it was the best ive ever had, but might tasty and i filled my stomach up with anything i saw on the table. its completely messy though. so expect to leave with the smell of spice and seafood on your body for the next couple of days. also expect to be drenched in a goooy saucey spice sauce all over your fingers! the food was served in huge bags with the food in them. you rip them apart and lay it all out on the trash bag covered table. it was a bliss for me. everyone was really friendly and i really really enjoyed the food adn my experience. it was very affordable and i would come back for sure! not to mention the blonde new jersey girl told us a story that the guy from man vs food, got drunk and passed out in the back of her car. wonder what else happened :) hehe jk.. regardless, if you are in the las vegas area, and you want to get something away from the strip and enjoy a good meal. make your self available to this awesome lil hole in the wall. you will not be let down!", 
            "crawfish is good. mainly because they are larger here than most other places ive seen. this place, the little guys were big enuf that you could pull the meat out with minimal effort. ive been to places where you sit there peeling back the shell and when you're done, the meat is almost gone because it got squished between your fingers and gets lost in a boatload of shells.\n\nthe seasoning is good, although a bit oily from the butter. the spices left me out of commission the next morning but  was worth it at the time.\n\nwe also ordered the <mark>King Crab</mark> which tasted ok but it definietly wasnt fresh. you can tell it was frozen stored because the shell was soft and stale when it came to our table.  when you peeled the shell off, a lot of water came gushing out.\n\nfor $20 something a pound, we expected fresh.  \n\nall in all, it was a fun experience we thank adam richman for telling us about.\n\nbtw, they need to move that dumpster full of rotting crawfish leftovers away from the part of the building thats visible. the sweltering vegas desert heat doesnt help much either. the smell after leaving the restaurant was mortifying.", 
            "sorry people but im going to have to be the fly in the ointment here. i got a chance to go to hot and juicy last weekend to see what all the hub bub was all about. and yes i saw it on man v food and it looked interesting. all the great reviews on here didnt hurt either. well i walked in and it was kinda plain but thats fine. the girl seated us and gave us menus to look over. i was going to order the shrimp instead of the crawfish until the waitress came over. she made the crawfish sound so good i caved and ordered a pound of them. i also ordered a pound of the <mark>King Crab</mark> and some sausage. my mom ordered the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and frys. \n    the girl brought out our food and it smelled incredible. i ripped into the bag of crawfish in hopes that i was really in for a treat. well i have come to a conclusion, theres nothing edible on crawfish!!! these things fought me every step of the way. i worked my ass off just to get a \"tinny\" piece of tale meat. the waitress said they were actually bigger than normal. i would hate the see the regular ones. the flavor of the sauce was absolutely fantastic. i went with the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> medium. the sausage dipped in the sauce was out of this world but the crawfish was a miserable failure. i ended up ordering a pound of the shrimp as well.\n    now the shrimp was another issue. i am not a big fan of whole shrimp. i dont want the head on with all the little hairs all over and the whole thing. if they had been cleaned before cooking it would have been much better. i didnt eat allot of them because of this. the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> were pretty good but i should have ordered the same sauce instead of the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>. \n    hot and juicy was kinda fun and the 2 waitresses were really sweet and fun to chat with. i dont think i will be coming but though. i do wish them the best.", 
            "was here just the other day while in town for halloween. i came in hoping it was good, and left satisfied. they were out o f a couple of items we would have tired, but we did get the <mark>King Crab</mark>, whole <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, crawfish, and calamari. the crawfish and the crab we got with varying amounts of heat, all on the hot n juicy sauce. the sauce was very good. plenty of tase, not simply liquid butter. add dollar beers to that(not sure if all bottles are $1 everyday or not) and it added up to a very good time. i would definately go back.\n\nthe only minus is that they really have nothing but seafood. several in our party do not like this kind of seafood, so their only choice was <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>(which they do not even have sauces for, they come out dry) and fries. a bit small of a non seafood choice.\n\nour waitress was very helpful and attentive as well.", 
            "we wanted to visit this place b/c we saw it on that episode of man vs. food and when we visited vegas we wanted a change from the restaurants available on the strip.  it was a good experience, the staff is super friendly.  we ordered 2lbs of the (spicy) hot & juicy crawfish and 1lb of the <mark>King Crab</mark>, some <mark>Sausage</mark>, corn and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>.  it was alright... satisfying, but definitely not the best i've ever had.  the crawfish were pretty small, and when they're small like that you have to work harder to get to the actual meat, which kinda sucked since the meat was super duper small.  the crab was really good, and i really liked the <mark>Sausage</mark>, but i remember them being pretty expensive.  i think we paid an extra $6 to get six slices of andouille sausage.  the corn is the neutralizer, which is necessary if you can't handle the heat.    the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were so-so, our next trip we will do w/out them.  next time, i'd like to try the shrimp and maybe clams (if they have them) and i'll probably try the medium instead of the spicy so i'm not constantly asking for more water.", 
            "i saw this on the travel channel and without that i would not have gone. but im glad i saw that episode because wow.\n\nmy cousin and i went and had 1 pound of hot & juicy shrimp- extra spicy, 1 pound of <mark>King Crab</mark> legs$35 bucks. great deal! \n\nand the food was great, i would advise you to not wear dressy clothes due to the hands on food. u got to use your hands and remember your bib.", 
            "i went here so long ago... 2 years ago to be exact... but i can still remember how good this place was!  we ordered crawfish, <mark>King Crab</mark> legs and shrimp and everything was a delicious mess!\n\nat the time service was fairly quick on a saturday afternoon and it wasn't crowded at all.  i dunno if things have changed in the last 2 years... judging from everyone's reviews... it seems like it's gotten better!",

            "i was soooo disappointed in this place, i'd thought i write a review. was there last week and almost walked out on hot n juicy. worst service ever, nothing compared to the first time we've been there. honestly, the first time we were there late last year food was awesome (almost as good as bc)\n\nwas there for a late late lunch and we were all starving. i recommended this spot to my fellow travelers and said it's worth the wait and just as good as bc. waited for about 1 hour and this is a late late lunch around 2-3pm. got seated and waiter took our order. he confirmed the order and everything was correct. food came 15 min later. sauce taste so watered-down, no flavor what so ever. nothing like the first time we were there. not only that our friend had ordered 2 lbs of <mark>King Crab</mark> legs. 1 with their special sauce and 1 just steamed (plain.) everybody got their food except for the steam <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>. we kept reminding them that we still have not received it and it's been about 20 mins. 5 min later, still nothing. told another waitress/waiter to check on it. again, 5 mins later, still nothing. it's been 45 mins and still nothing. everybody is done eating and one of us still have not gotten plain <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>. wth!!! so again, we ask if they have forgotten our order and they said no, it's on order. told us <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> takes an average of 25 mins to steam, but yet we got the first lb with sauce and everything in 15 min. why does it take longer for plain <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>? everybody is completely done now and we still did not get the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>. we ask what was going on and they said, again we are doing everything we can to fulfill orders and it's very busy and for us to just hang in there. nobody else was waiting to get seated. there were empty tables and people who came in after us was already finishing up their food. wth!!! so we ask for the manager and the jerk in charge said with a smile \"there's no manager available right now\" and walked away. we saw the waiter ask him what was going on with their order and he threw his hands in the air, said \"i dunno\" and walked away. obviously somebody was in charge at the time. wth!!! and their apology to us was that they will not charge us gratuity since we were not happy. omg!!! i can't believe this place even made it on the travel channel now. we paid for our food even after the way they treated us. not only that, as i was walking to the restroom to wash my hands, the girl in charge was on the phone with the owner and was explaining to him how it happened and if he hears anything about it... that's what really happened. wth!!! that did it!!! that was the last call!!! never ever going there again and never going to recommend it to anybody else. horrible!!!", 
            "hot n' juicy is an old favorite of mine located on spring mountain between decatur and jones. hot n' juicy is definitely the messiest eatery in town, and all the more fun because of it. sometimes when i give that description people don't want to try it, but it would be a shame not to. besides the fun of eating here, the food is great. how can you really go wrong with fresh seafood, butter, and cajun seasonings?\n\ntoday i ordered one pound of the crawfish ($9.99) and my husband ordered one pound of the snow crab ($13.99). we both asked for the hot n' <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning, extra spicy! you are free to choose your heat level as well as the style of seasoning you prefer - <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, juice cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, or <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. besides crawfish and snow crab, you can also order <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, or shrimp.\n\nthe first time i had a crawfish boil was at my brother's graduation from university of the south in sewanee, tennessee. i remember them dumping huge buckets of steamed crawfish onto the tables and everyone would just have at them, discarding the shells and heads onto neighboring tables. at hot n' juicy it's a little different, but not much. you are given bibs and your table is covered in white plastic that is accessorized with your own roll of paper towels. they bring your crawfish in plastic bags that are tied at the top to capture the heat. when you open the bag you get an aromatic burst of spicy steam that gets you really excited for what you are about to enjoy. this is where the fun starts. crawfish are peel and eat little buggers that require somewhat of an experienced eater to navigate through them in order to get to the savory bits. first you must detach the tail, which you peel just as you would the tail of a shrimp. then, and this is most flavorful part, you must suck the head by gently squeezing it into your mouth so you can get all the juices and inner goodness out of it. if this sounds totally disgusting to you, go for the crab. they supply you with crab crackers, but ian and i agree they should probably pre-crack them for you to make the experience easier and allow all the seasoned butter to seep into the meat. whatever you decide to get, i'm sure you'll enjoy it.\n\nif you order two pounds of crawfish you get a hunk of corn on the cob and a red potato in your bag, but since we ordered one pound each of different items we opted for the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> ($2.99). these came out hot n' spicy with a side of cooling ketchup. we managed to reserve some of the fries to dip in the juices at the bottom of our bags, and this was way better than the ordinary condiment. who would have thought that you could make french fries even tastier and more unhealthy with the addition of seasoned butter? i guess europeans serve their fries with mayonnaise, so i don't feel too guilty or out of line.\n\nby the time you are finished, it looks like hurricane katrina has hit your table leaving a mass of wet and crumpled paper towels in her wake. this is certainly not a prime location for a wedding reception, but if you don't mind getting your hands dirty in the name of taste, you really should try hot n' juicy almost any other time.", 
            "friends were in town and we came here for dinner last night. what we ordered:\n\n2 lbs <mark>King Crab</mark> in hot n juicy sauce med spicy\n2 lbs shrimp in hot n juicy sauce med spicy + 1/2 dozen sausage\n1 lb shrimp in hot n juicy sauce extra spicy\n3 blue moons\n2 iced teas\n1 bud light\n\nthe food was great. i wanted some shrimp in the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce but my friends only wanted the hot n juicy sauce. oh well. there's always next time!!",

            "for a long time i had been craving for some seafood and i don't mean fish and chips, or fish sticks, or long john silvers.  i mean seafood: <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, oysters, and shrimp (or how australians call it, prawns).  i never could find any place that had these items.  my withdrawals could be compared to a crack addict waiting for the next fix.\n\ni was with my cousin exploring townsquare wine walk on night a couple of weeks ago.  our expedition was only to end there, but when i'm with my cousin or cousins i always want to end it with food.  i remembered his review on hot n juicy crawfish which gave me the idea of going.  i swear, driving from townsquare to the restaurant felt like a five minute drive since i flew down the i215 and drove 60 miles per hour on the side streets.  not that it mattered since there was a thirty minute when we arrived.\n\nas always i do observe the host/hostess on how i'm greeted.  the first thing i noticed was their smile just beamed like a ray of sunshine.  was that too much?  it just seemed like they love where they work and like what they do.  peeking through the window as i waited, all i saw were <mark>Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Lobster</mark>, crabs, and <mark>Corn</mark> laid out on the table lined with off white paper cloth.  this definitely heightened my excitement.\n\nfinally, we got seated.  my cousin and i ordered a pound of shrimp, a pound of <mark>King Crab</mark>, and half dozen of oysters with four sides of corn in their hot n juicy spice mix.  as the server came with our order, it was brought in a plastic bag filled with a lot of butter and the spice mix.   i've never had food served in a plastic bag looking like a doggy bag ready to be taken home.  \n\nit's a very interactive way of dining as there was no where to place the shells, only on the table.  so in the end you get from a plastic filled shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> to a table filled with empty shrimp shells and crab shells.  it's the most fun i've had eating here.  my boyfriend just told me that this girl he knows says it was just okay.  she must've been drunk or upset about some drama that she didn't see the goodness of this place.  but whatever.\n\ni would definitely go back and eat here again and again.  the relaxed atmosphere and interactive dining is worth coming back for.  kudos to you hot n juicy crawfish for being one of the best seafood restaurants in vegas.", 
            "oh, the very moment i stepped into hot n juicy crawfish i knew i'd love it.  i sat down, looked at my foodie friend and said, \"i know i haven't eaten anything yet, but can we come back soon?\" lol.\n\nthe smell of the garlic fills the small restaurant, and the smiles upon everyone's face makes you want to smile along with them.  i go to lunch every saturday at 2:00 pm, and most places are dead, but this place was packed, with movement and chatter...it really has an incredible vibe!\n\nthe service was great for how busy it was and the wait staff was all friendly, our waitress explained the menu to us and also answered our questions thoroughly ( i was really hoping the pictures on the walls were because of some type of eating contest, but...it was just pictures of customers..drat)\n\nwe ordered 1 lb of crawfish, <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> flavor, medium.  i didn't think it was too spicy, but i'm not sure if i'd go up a notch on spiciness, because i'm a wuss.  we also ordered the calamari and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>.\n\nthe crawfish were amazing. i've never had crawfish before, so i honestly can't compare it to others, but it was down-right delish in my book.  i got a kick out of my friend squirting himself in the face with crawfish juice, and wish i went with a group of friends, as most of the people there did. i would order the crawfish again in a heart beat! but i would get 1 lb to myself instead of sharing, because it was sooo nummy! next time i'm probably going to try the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, oooh yess.\n\nthe calamari seemed really good at first, but the more i ate it the more salty it seemed to be...i probably wouldn't order them again because there are so many more appetizers to try! next time i will probably try the fried catfish!\n\nthe <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> weren't my cup of tea, a little too spicy for poor little me.  my dear friend grubbed on them though, said he really liked em.\n\nit was a lot of fun getting down and dirtay, and working for my food. and honestly, i would totally recommend eating here as a first date, whats a better way to get to know someone then being knee deep in delicious crawfish?", 
            "we ate here for dinner tonight and yes, i am officially a fan!  we always drive by this place and the parking lot is always packed.  i've also been hearing about it a lot.  it was also featured on man vs. food.  didn't need any more reasons to stop by here.  so we decided on dinner here tonight.  we got here at 9 on a tuesday night, mind you, and the parking lot was packed as usual.  we were lucky enough to get a parking spot and unfortunately there was a 30 min. wait for the 4 of us.  i don't mind waiting for food as long as it's good food!  \nwe actually ran across the street to the crown and anchor to grab a beer while we waited.  the bartender there told us that that was pretty common.   \nso we get seated 30 min later and we're ready!  we started with 2 lbs of crawfish, 2 lbs of shrimp, 2 lbs of <mark>King Crab</mark> legs all wth the hot n juicy marinade, spicy.  we also ordered <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, corn and <mark>Potato</mark> and a round of beers.   the tables are lined with a garbage bag and there is a roll of paper towels for each table.  no silverware.  the food started coming out really fast, within 5 minutes of ordering.  they are deiivered in plastic bags.  oh man, the crawfish was delicious! hot and juicy of course and the seasoning was so spicy and addictive.  my mouth was on fire inside and out!  but i couldnt stop!  everything was really good.  spicy, buttery and garlicy....yum!  we ended up ordering 2 more lbs of crawfish, 1 more lb of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and some more corn.  oh man, the corn was to die for.  sweet, but so spicy. \n a very messy meal and you kinda have to work for your food but it was definitely worth it!  the prices were reasonable as well.  i will definitely go back here.", 
            "a review of this place by me is extremely overdue.  honestly, i feared sharing this little desert jewel with everyone and they mama...but i guess when something's that good, word spreads like an la wildfire.\n\nbackground: i'm from ca.  i've never been to lousiana but i have been to crawdaddy's (sj, ca), boiling crab (sj, ca) and hot n juicy.  my first experience eating cajun seafood was at hot n juicy about 4 years ago.  ever since then, i became an instant fan.  i've located cajun seafood restaurants closer to my place of residence, hence crawdaddy's and boiling crab.  anyhow, by far, hot n juicy blows the other two out the water, hands down!!  i just went to hot n juicy over the july 15th weekend and the ish was bomb diggity!!!  their crawfish was huge.  usually i think you get about 13-15 critters per lb, this time the crawfish were so big, we got about 8-9 per lb. but so worth it, i mean they were so big, i even ate the critters' claws...omg! - tell me the last time you had a crawfish so big, you could eat their claws?\n\n** as some of you may be aware, i'm allergic to shell fish but damn, i make sure to bring my benadryl so i can grub out without having to break out in itchy hives.  that's how good hot n juicy is.  \n\nbtw, if you didn't know:  they have now added <mark>King Crab</mark> legs...man, i might die from od'ing on shellfish that i know i really shouldn't be indulging in...gluttony\n\nfor those of you looking to compare:  it has been a toss up between boiling crab in sj, ca and hot n juicy.  after i got back from las vegas, i went to boiling crab to make sure i ate at both places within a short time span so as to keep flavors and experience fresh in my mind....well (drum roll please.....hot n juicy takes the cake).  hot n juicy has at a minimum 2 more secret ingredients that bc doesn't have.  the intense spicy flavors are there at hnj (<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>) without the thick oilyness that bc has in their whole shabang.", 
            "went here right after they opened for the day on a saturday so the place was relatively empty. we must have been there for close to an hour and a half, and by the time we left the place had filled up. the service was top notch throughout our entire meal. multiple servers asking if we needed anything, constantly offering assistance, and refilling our drinks. our waitress was as friendly as they come and really helped us through the ordering process. \n\nnow the food. we ordered all our seafood with the hot n juicy seasoning: 1 lb. crawfish (medium heat), 1 lb. shrimp (medium heat) and 1 lb. <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> (spicy).  i could handle the medium level fine, but the spicy level got the nose running and the pores sweating. it added to the experience. \n\nthey will demonstrate how to properly eat a crawfish, and after an attempt or two, you will have it down no problem. make sure to suck the juice out of the head, that is where the flavor really accumulates. what is great about this meal is the seafood comes out very fast and it's nice and hot, but it will take you a while to make your way through it all with all the peeling and cracking and talking about how great everything tastes. \n\nthe <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> were amazing and we immediately ordered  pound of <mark>King Crab</mark> legs when we had finished those off. the shrimp was tasty.  i even decided to bite off a few heads and they were nice a crunchy. \n\nalthough the place is named after the crawfish, and those do have an unique flavor, i would almost stick exclusively to the crabs next time. so tasty. unfortunately due to the oil spill they were only offering the snow and <mark>King Crab</mark> legs. normally whole crabs from the gulf region are available too.\n\nit's a great dining experience. fun and very tasty. your knuckles will burn with spices and smell of garlic  for a few hours after, but that will serve as a reminder of money well spent in vegas.", 
            "for the longest time i grappled with  leaving a review or to not.  after hearing so many great things about hot n juicy from friends, family and chef's i was really looking forward to this place!!  i knew what it was all about before i got there.  rolling up yer sleeves and gettin down n' dirty with pound bags of some critters of the sea......  we heeded the warnings of early yelpers and went at an off time so we didn't have to wait an hour.  we ordered crawdads, crab and shrimp.  i had never had crawfish to eat before but i had caught these lil buckaroos as a kid when my add would leave me catching critters in the lakes i was fishing in instead of watching my fishing pole. i was not a fan of my first crawfish experience but i don't hold that against hot n juicy , probably just wasn't for me.  the shrimp were average and the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs were good.  the hardest thing for me reviewing hot n juicy was it might just not be for me.  the concept is cool but after my experience i don't want my seafood to be masked with a flavor of garlic and chile for lbs on end.  i want to taste the natural sweetness, or flavor of freshly squeezed lemon juice and allow the protein to be in the spotlight it deserves.  my two star rating isn't for the cuisine here though.  i realize it just wasn't for me.  i was more disappointed and left unsure of the cleanliness of the dining room.  i am not a neat-freak.... i knew going into this that it was dirty.  i was not expecting the table fun to extend to the walls of the restaurant though.  we were seated in a booth in the back of the restaurant that during the time of our dining had direct sunlight on the wall.  that entire wall was the spotlight of 100 different greasy, juicy paw prints that made it look like kids finger painting with crisco.  it actually pains me to leave a negative review of a restaurant that gets so many rave reviews from fellow yelpers.  cleanliness needs to be improved dramatically.  hot n juicy needs to get hot and soapy......", 
            "wow, these places are everywhere! it's funny too because it's like asian cajun! i assume only in california and it's closest neighbor vegas have places like this.\n\ni actually really like this place. the spices they use in their signature hot-n-juicy is off the hook, much better than crawdaddy (in san jose) and right up there if not better than boiling crab (in san jose). we ordered the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs in butter and garlic and hot-n-juicy in mild and medium as we were all wimps, shrimp in hot-n-juicy in medium also, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and corn on the cob and <mark>Potato</mark>! i love that they serve the corn on the cob and potato in the bag with the juices, the other places mentioned above don't and they don't have <mark>Potato</mark> either. they also have <mark>Blue Crab</mark> here which the ones in san jose don't have. can't wait to go here again!\n\nthe service wasn't the best, they forgot the fries and i had to keep asking for water. but all in all this is a good off the strip joint for those staying in town for the weekend. get there early because i hear there is usually a wait, sounds like all the other places too!", 
            "this place was incredible.  after reading about it we went straight there from the airport.  it did not disappoint.  two of us had 2 lbs each of the snow crab, <mark>King Crab</mark> and shrimp.  the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce was delicious, the hot n juicy sauce even better.  service was super attentive.  only negative was they ran out of <mark>Blue Crab</mark> before we'd gotten there.  next time for sure...", 
            "this was my first time eating crawfish... and i must say that it's a lot of work to get to a small amount of meat but it is fun and messy. they cover the table with a plastic tablecloth and have complimentary crawfish bibs to wear to protect your clothes. i think it's worthwhile trying the crawfish at least once! \n\nwe tried a few other things from the menu including snow crab (this was awesome), <mark>Blue Crab</mark> (skip this altogether) <mark>King Crab</mark>, shrimp (definitely order this!), sausage, corn, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, potato and one of my personal favorites, the \\u00e9touff\\u00e9e! the sausage comes in sliced pieces and i found it delicious to add to the \\u00e9touff\\u00e9e which is much like a gumbo. \n\nwe came here twice. the place is constantly packed to capacity, the parking lot full and a waiting list to get a table but it's well worth the wait trust me!", 
            "thank you man vs. food for reviewing this place! fricken amazing! simple and delicious, busy, but quick, the simplicity is what i love about this place; seafood + sauce + bag + vigorous shaking = hot n juicy!\n\nwhen you go i would suggest a pound of the <mark>King Crab</mark> in pepper lemon sauce not spicy and a pound of crawfish spicy! you will not be disappointed!\n\nenjoy!", 
            "i went to hot n juicy as part of a group of 10 for a bachelor party. although the wait was about 40 minutes on a friday night, they were able to accommodate us pretty easily. i have never been to a restaurant with this concept, but i thought it was great. the table ordered a little bit of everything; crawfish, shrimp, & crab. everything was delicious but the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs are fantastic. we were talking about the food for days after.\n\nthe wait staff were friendly and able to handle a rowdy bunch of guys. you may want to arrive by cab because i don't think there is much in the way of parking. to help offset the wait time check out crown & anchor bar across the street.", 
            "i love sundays, besides being \"holy\". (i am a good girl). as usual, i have my sunday treat but it was \"messy\" and \"kind-of-getting dirty\". i just had to have...aaah, crawfish.  i would say that is the closest i could get myself to transporting my state of mind in my good ole' neighborhood in the south. since lived there, and having crawfish and alligator meat as southern fare, crawfish became my last sunday's dinner. \n\nthe smell of garlic, pepper and spice filled my nostrils upon entering. windows brought in the early evening light as we walked in this cozy restaurant with its simple dining set-up. rows of wooden chairs and white plastic-covered tables. each table had a roll of paper towel. television perched high up on one wall. not much talking around, diners were busy.... \n\nmet by a smiling male waitstaff, and got a seat and table by the wall. menu was simple in a rectangular paper. i knew what i liked. what else? but crawfish! i yearn for the days i would buy them from a seafood grocer in north carolina and take it home to steam & boil it in my gigantic steamer-boiler pot. i am great at coo<mark>King Crab</mark>. my kitchen has a rollaway spice rack filled with spices, stainless steel cookwares and stainless steel range-oven...i like making seafood and crawfish for myself and whenever i have guests. \n\nbut this time, this restaurant cooks it for me. order the crawfish or  seafood by the pound..or two...or three...as much you like. also indicate the type of spice and amount of spiciness. the waitstaff pleasant and helpful about anything unclear about the spiciness. if you care to ask about how to peel off the crawfish meat from the shell, the waitstaff will show you how. but i do know how, so let me say that i am hands-up, thumbs-up delighted when the crawfish i ordered came in a plastic bag inside a bucket. it was pulled out of the bucket and presented to me and my mom. it was steaming hot-and-juicy! just like the restaurant is called. the aroma was invigoratingly intoxicating! but stop! one thing i just have to do. \"cleanliness is next to godliness\" so where else would i go before all this? the bathroom awaits for a good hands cleansing. did that so fast! yes, hands where the main activity going in this restaurant. everyone was just eating away with hands! diners were busy! by golly, this is a feastful of fun! the crawfish was extrasuperfantastically delicious! well made, not too dry! there was sauce inside the plastic bag. spicy, it was especially my request of louisiana hot and spicy special was definitely the spiciness it supposed to be, just like in the south! small chunks of garlic and ginger were visible as part of the seasoning. besides the crawfish, the oysters on their half-ed oyster shells (my favorite!) were large and fresh. with sprinkling of lemon juice and butter sauce gave it the \"to-die-for\" yumminess. also, the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> (presented steaming in a plastic bag) was remarkably meaty. a side order of corn was drenched with garlic and butter with a little spiciness of creole seasoning. oh, corn-soft-ness!\n\nalas, this is a place for hands-on eating for juicy seafood! my mom and i was delightfully full and messy. yes, there were splashes of red on our bibs and table cover from the creole-cajun-louisiana sauce but no cares. the table covers gets trashed by the waitstaff after each table is vacated. there's water in the bathroom, just go wash those hands! but will surely go back for more hot and juicy sea eats!", 
            "they bleed garlic\n\nwe all have our flavor obsessions.  some of us need lots of salt in a dish, while others tend to follow their sweet tooth.  for those of you who crave garlic, hot n' juicy crawfish is your mecca, you should make your pilgrimage.  \n\nthis place is all about one thing, and that is the food.  generally speaking, you will not use plates or silverware here, just your hands.  the small paper menu features a few items, which can be ordered in a variety of styles.  tables are topped with a roll of paper towels, and a garbage bag as a table cloth.  normally i balk at the idea of wearing a gimmicky bib at a restaurant, but when your server brings you a bib, put it on.  this meal is a hot n' juicy mess.  \n\nlast night we had a pound of the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs cooked \"hot n' <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>\" style (think chinatown meets the bayou, or mulan meets the frog princess if you're a disney fanatic)  we also had a pound of crawfish the same way.  \n\nthe <mark>King Crab</mark> legs ($20 a lb. right now) were huge, meaty, and succulent.  the meat eagerly came out of the shell, as if it was waiting all day for me to eat it. \n\nwe also ordered a pound of the crawfish.  the only issue i had with these tiny dancers was that they're typically out of season this time of year.  the ones brought to the table were small, like the size of a medium shrimp.  they were tasty, but it is a lot of work for what amounts to a mento-sized morsel of meat. \n\nbe ready to emanate garlic from your pores for a few hours after the meal, but its totally worth the aroma.  this is a great alternative date spot, since it is messy, casual, and reasonably priced.  \n\nmessy + casual + reasonably priced = delicious fun!", 
            "saw this place on man vs food and definitely wanted to try this place out. i've gone to boiling crab in san jose, ca and this place blows them out of the water, hands down!!! i came out on a wed night and it wasn't packed. i wonder how it is on the weekends. the staff is nice and the place is great for a group of friends. i recommend sharing food as most items on the list is served in pounds. *watch out* the sauce is *hot* i love spicy food so i order the meduim and even that was a little to hot for me!!! the sauce is one of the best and most flavorful i've had. if you've gone to other places, you gotta try this place out!!!\n\n<mark>Cajun Fries</mark>: a\nsausage: a\n<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce: a \nmedium spice level: (hot!!!)\n<mark>King Crab</mark> legs: a\nsnow crab: b\ncrawfish: c (not in season)\nshrimp: b", 
            "if i were to die tomorrow, i would be down to have this as my last meal. the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs are delicious. the oysters are fresh. the only thing i could complain about is service. the times i went it wasn't really that busy, but we needed to, for real, track our waitress down to refills. \n\nmy suggestion for going is to go early afternoon, and before 6 because after 7ish it gets packed, and there is a little bit of a wait. and make sure to come dressed pretty casual, and make plans to shower after cuz you're gonna smell.", 
            "great food, but couple of pointers.\n\n1. you will stink, for a while. i can still smell garlic (probably coming out of my pores) a day later. so you probably don't want to take a date here.\n\n2. <mark>King Crab</mark> legs are good, but the shell is actually very soft, so that makes it very hard to break the shell to get to the meat.\n\n3. if you order 2 pounds of crawfish, expect to get less... because we had quite a few tiny crawfish in our bag.", 
            "so i saw this place on the man vs. food so i had to try it when i went to vegas with my family. the place was cute. lots of pictures of past customers. some familiar faces on the wall. we ordered the crawfish and <mark>King Crab</mark>.. the flavor was mediocre.. like many of the other crawfish restaurants i've been to but the <mark>King Crab</mark> was delicious. a little over price though.", 
            "so we went for the first time on a thursday about 12 o clock we went in and it wasnt very busy. the service was good we ordered the 1 pound of shrimp and 1 pound of <mark>King Crab</mark>(not so much in 1lb!) the shrimp were in <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> and  spicy level...yeah they were spicy alright!! and the <mark>King Crab</mark> had the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning and medium spice level and that was good! u dont get plates or silverware other than what u need for the crab. it was great but we didnt have much time to enjoy it since our daughter had a doctors appointment! but next time we go it will be enjoyed better!!!!!!",

            "yum! don't wear your sunday finest- things can get messy here. shellfish in a baggie of spicy broth- simple yet delicious. the crawfish is fresh and, if you prefer, the <mark>King Crab</mark> is well worth the price. a little taste of n'awlins off the strip.", 
            "super yummy and messy! not a place for a first date or important meeting. you will get messy. i ordered 1 pound of mild crawfish, <mark>King Crab</mark>, shrimp all with the hot n juicy sauce. it was perfect for 2 adults. but if you dont like spicy let me warn you..mild is pretty spicy. overall if your craving cajun spices and seafood this is the place to go.", 
            "hot and mushy is more like it!  this place is way over priced, and they do not stand behind their food.  we live in a neighborhood of friends, and often get together on a friday night and order something fun.  many times it has been hot and juicy.  this week we ordered hot and juicy for pickup.  we ordered 13 lbs... 11 lbs of shrimp, and 2 lbs. of crawfish.  the shrimp were inedibly mushy when we got them home.  luckily, i had defrosted a bunch of <mark>King Crab</mark> legs an lobster tails from costco.  this higher quality seafood saved the day, and the party.  we called hot and juicy the next day to see if they would refund the money for the shrimp, and that we would gladly bring back the mushy shrimp.  it took 4-5 calls and many hilarious conversations dealing with several of the 20-something children who seem to run the place. one girl said \"for the future, i would ask them to put no more than a lb. per bag.  the shrimp are fickle\"  really, young child??  as if we are the ones who packed all of the shrimp in one bag!  i'm not at all convinced the amount per bad has any bearing, but she shed all responsibility, saying she doesn't have the authority to give a refund. after a few more calls with other little girls who had no authority, we finally got a hold of a manager, since the owner is apparently too important to deal with his customers.  he offered a 5% discount on our next order.  when we promised to write the story on yelp, he upped it to 10%.  the problem is, i don't want disgusting mushy shrimp paste nastiness at any price.  the manager said \"i checked with the 'chef' (i'd call him a cook at best) and he said that they were cooked perfectly\".  did he?  hahaha!  of course he said that. i have 10 people, one a sous chef at a restaurant in the bellagio, who beg to differ.  the manager also practically accused us of lying when we told him we order from there often saying \"well, i don't see an order history on your card\". this, after we had already mentioned that a different person in our group of 10 picks up the food each time. some of us pay cash.  this place is damned sure not worth the wait, and certainly not worth the exorbitant prices they charge.  they just lost a ton of business from all of us and everyone we know, and don't seem to care at all.  they simply don't stand behind their product at all, so why should we?  order at your own risk!", 
            "i dont if it's because i'm tired of boiling crab or something but this place and their hot n juicy flavoring kick boiling crab's whole shabang's ass!!! it wasn't too oily or salty and their spice definitely has more kick. i was sniffling on a mild haha... i tried the shrimp, <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, and lobster  tail and all were pretty bomb! mmmmmmmmmmm", 
            "this place looked so good on mvf, i had to come here and try it. \n\nthere's two hot n juicy crawfish restaurants less than a mile from each other. the cab driver was a little confused too,  but he said this one was the one that he drops everyone off at. \n\nfirst off, the servers are very friendly. they might not have been very quick to get our food order or remember to bring everything, but they were all super nice. \n\nthere were 6 of us in the group and we decided to order by pairs. it's hard to not share and hard to share with the entire group. you'll see it gets really messy and there's no way of passing things around the table. so the easiest way to eat is to share with the person next to you or across from you. \n\nwe ordered the shrimp, crawfish (of course), clams, and <mark>King Crab</mark> legs. you also get a choice of sauce and spiciness. everyone ordered the hot n juicy sauce (a mix of 3 of the choices). i usually eat my thai food 4 stars and ordered medium spiciness. it was pretty good for me, although i could have used a little more spice. it might be too spicy for people that don't eat hot foods. \n\nthe food comes out in bags and you just dig in with your hands. there's bibs and gloves for everyone (highly recommended). i loved the clams and shrimp. the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> didn't have much flavor. the crawfish were just a pain in the ass- a lot of work for nothing. i would probably skip that next time. in fact, everyone in our group was saying how great the food was- except for the pain-in-the-ass crawfish :) \n\ni would highly recommend this place. the food is good, service is great, and the atmosphere is so much fun. and prices were not bad if you're used to the astronomical prices on the strip.", 
            "i got this recommendation from a las vegas hoya!  what a great recommendation it was.  i have seen this place recently near woodley park on connecticut avenue in washington, d.c.  i have to pay it a visit.  this place is worthy of all-madden status.  <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> with a delicious blend of cajun and creole spices in a bag.  it does not get much better than this.  the crawfish etoufee appetizer is wonderful--more like a soup than the traditional etoufee i am used to.  i had the stone <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> which were wonderful, but i think the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs are the best.  this is not a place you would see rachel ray at, but i love it!  thanks to the las vegas hoyas!  we are georgetown!", 
            "hawt n' joosay!\n\nthe name really says it all for this place.  the sauce is hot, the food is juicy.  get a garbage bag of food and tap into your inner caveman.  most crawfish joints do kind of the same thing but the variations in the sauces make them different.  what sets this place apart is they use the sichuan pepper (i think) which leaves your mouth a little numb but taste great and creates a unique spiciness.  as far as the items to order ive had most of the menu but here are my suggestions.\n\n<mark>King Crab</mark> legs  - hands down the item to get.  huge chunks of crab with little effort.  you just have to know how to use the little plastic claw tool.  use one side to make a crack then the other to slice through like scissors through paper.  ask your server if you need help.  don't be afraid of the price these are well worth it, trust me you wont be sorry.  \n\nshrimp - if your not going big with the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> then these are the best bang for your buck.  best meat to price ratio and easy to eat.\n\ncorn - soaks up the sauce like a sponge.  make room in your gut for this.  don't sleep! \n\nfries - regular or sweet potato are both tasty and good sharing choices to break up all the buttery spice from the seafood.\n\nsauce - i prefer the everything mix or whatever they call it here.  i also prefer extra spicy which i wouldn't suggest for most people.  even spicy has a kick to it.\n\nthey can handle large groups and there is a second one down the street if this one is full.", 
            "saw this restaurant on the travel channel and had to try when we're in vegas.  it was amazing!  first time trying crawfish so i can't compare but i wasn't impressed, we also had the shrimp, <mark>King Crab</mark> and calamari...all were amazing!  the mild had a kick to it but i loved it.  definitely would go back!  only wished they opened a little earlier...11?",

            "i am a big fan of seafood and mixed with spices and garlic just make hot n juicy my kind of restaurant. i was a bit of a doubter at first since i came from southern ca and was used to boiling crab (which has since made its way to the las vegas valley). i have yet to try the lv boiling crab, but i am a fan of hot n juicy. the sauce is a bit different than boiling crab, but has a lot of flavor and you can definitely enjoy it. my usual order consists of shrimp and alaskan <mark>King Crab</mark> legs in the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce (which is basically all the sauces combined together - extra garlic please!) at the spicy level. note - extra spicy is really really hot, almost too hot to be enjoyable. \n\ni have also had their lobster tails and other crabs. i'm not a huge fan of crawfish since its a lot of work for a little meat, but a lot of other people enjoy it here. be prepared for a messy meal as this is a eat with your hands kind of place since you have to peel most everything. its usually fun to see who can make the biggest pile of shells!\n\ni've also had the deep fried soft shell crab with fries and the oysters - both are really good and the oysters were fresh. \n\nthis is definitely a place that i will frequent and also bring friends to from out of town. i will see how the new lv boiling crab compares, but for now, you can find me at hot n juicy!", 
            "amazing!  food tastes great and the staff is nice.  hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce with the lobster, <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, shrimp, mussels, and clams is the winner.", 
            "pretty good...for vegas.  here's my recap:  parking could be better.  not a lot of spaces.  available spaces were a little tight.  seated immediately upon entering.  the place was pretty busy.  many tables with chairs, some with booths.  some booth seating was not accessible because the neighboring table was too close.  servers were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.  menu offered crawfish, shrimp, oysters, clam, lobster, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, and snow crab.  all market prices.  seasoning choices were <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.  choice of mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy.  sides: corn, potato, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, rice, rolls, and sausage.  also, appetizers were etoufee and a large variety of fried items: calamari, hot wings, soft shell crab, catfish, shrimp, and chicken nuggets.  we ordered two pounds of boiled shrimp: one <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> medium and the other <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> medium.  bibs were served first.  the bottom of the bib folds over to make a pocket to catch debris you drop.  we also ordered a side of white rice.  the cook time seemed about right, not real fast, but not too slow either.  constant line for men's restroom.  only one person at a time.  many people waiting to get in to wash their hands after eating.  the food comes out as it is ready, not served at the same time.  i prefer this method.  the shrimp is served in a clear plastic bag and the shells are left on the table.  plastic table cloth makes for quick and easy clean up.  the shrimp was good sized, hot, and flavorful.  there was a little extra juice in the bottom of the bag which we used to dip our shrimp once peeled.  also, we ladled some on the rice for a bit of flavor.  the shrimp was head and shell on.  this requires a little work, but is the traditional way to serve, saves the kitchen a bit of time, and leads one to believe the shrimp were alive when cooked.  i lived in louisiana for many years so i know there is a difference between <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> and cajun style, but i don't know why they made the distinction here.  most patrons in vegas won't know the difference.  the difference here is that louisiana had more butter and cajun was more traditional with more spices and less brother allowing the sweet flavor of the shrimp to come through better.  the difference is almost not noticeable, but i prefer their <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>.  the rice was okay.  all in all the food was pretty good.  we really enjoyed it.  on a side note, they did not purge the shrimp.  that is, the gastrointestinal track and the poop were still in the shrimp.  vegas patrons don't know any better.  its kind of gross, but i ate anyways knowing that it won't hurt you (otherwise, the place would have been shut down a long time ago).  there were plenty of paper napkins at each table and wet wipes served at the counter and with the bill, but i would have preferred a washing station, similar to those at cravin cajun.  you get really, really messy eating boiled shrimp and that stuff is super painful if you get it in your eyes.  they do serve alcohol, but we had tap water, which was served in styrofoam cups.  the server did not ask if we wanted lemon, but she brought out a styrofoam bowl with almost two whole lemons (kind of a waste).  shrimp was $8.99 per pound and the side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> was $2.  we really enjoyed this experience and will be coming back.  i tried the crawfish on a previous visit here.  it was the best crawfish in vegas.  flavor was right, but a bit small for louisiana standards.  i love crawfish, but think the shrimp is a better deal because there is much more meat.  i really like this place, but cravin cajun is better.",

(it gets kind of uncomfortable having a grown adult help you with your napkin ) they offered gloves to avoid the garlic smell stained to your hands for days!\n\n we ordered a pound of <mark>King Crab</mark> and a pound of shrimp with medium hot n juicy sauce. i would say the medium sauce is definitely on the mild sauce so i would go higher if you like a nice kick. the crab was good but one leg seemed like it had been cooking a little too long. the shrimp were big and fresh. \n\nall in all, this place did well and i will be returning",

(so what i cheated!) but it was worth the calories. and out of all the expensively ridiculously priced restaurants on the las vegas strip this was the most economical (its worth a car rental/ limo drive). this place came highly recommended from travel channel's man vs food.  ordering from menu was easy and simple. you have to definitely try my fave <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> shrimp! but the crawfish, humugous <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, and oysters are just as good too. it's vegas's cheapest bag of freshest seafood and the best bang for your buck. extremely the highlight of my las vegas trip (off the strip)!\n\nemployees were chill and friendly, don't be afraid to take apart anything with your hands. great service! too bad hot n juicy crawfish isn't closer to my home town... tried a few hot n juicy knock-offs near home (but didn't even the close)",

            "great experience, the service was excellent, especially michael. it's a little strange with all the plastic table cloths, food bags, and bibs. when the restroom ran out of soap and was a little nasty, they jumped on the cleaning. i really like the responsiveness of the staff. \n\nnow for the food, we had alaskan <mark>King Crab</mark>($27/lb) with garlic and butter, snow crab($18/lb) hot and spicy style, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> with <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and corn fritters. everything was good. the spicy version of hot and spicy was enough to numb my lips for the first 5 minutes. burn baby burn! we needed a few beers to quell the fires in our mouths. don't expect fine dining. the atmosphere is extremely casual with dance/club music playing throughout, basic bench and wood chair seating, aluminum siding accents, tvs spaced out on the walls, and tank top clad young ladies and t-shirt wearing men serving the tasty food in plastic bags. \n\nso, this is not a first date place, wouldn't be very impressive to a potential mate. but for the family, friends, or long-time mate, it's fun. ask for the mild versions and work up to the heat ladder. i can handle straight thai peppers and fresh serranos. so believe me when i say they can make it hot."

            "for a long time i had been craving for some seafood and i don't mean fish and chips, or fish sticks, or long john silvers.  i mean seafood: <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, oysters, and shrimp (or how australians call it, prawns).  i never could find any place that had these items.  my withdrawals could be compared to a crack addict waiting for the next fix.\n\ni was with my cousin exploring townsquare wine walk on night a couple of weeks ago.  our expedition was only to end there, but when i'm with my cousin or cousins i always want to end it with food.  i remembered his review on hot n juicy crawfish which gave me the idea of going.  i swear, driving from townsquare to the restaurant felt like a five minute drive since i flew down the i215 and drove 60 miles per hour on the side streets.  not that it mattered since there was a thirty minute when we arrived.\n\nas always i do observe the host/hostess on how i'm greeted.  the first thing i noticed was their smile just beamed like a ray of sunshine.  was that too much?  it just seemed like they love where they work and like what they do.  peeking through the window as i waited, all i saw were <mark>Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Lobster</mark>, crabs, and <mark>Corn</mark> laid out on the table lined with off white paper cloth.  this definitely heightened my excitement.\n\nfinally, we got seated.  my cousin and i ordered a pound of shrimp, a pound of <mark>King Crab</mark>, and half dozen of oysters with four sides of corn in their hot n juicy spice mix.  as the server came with our order, it was brought in a plastic bag filled with a lot of butter and the spice mix.   i've never had food served in a plastic bag looking like a doggy bag ready to be taken home.  \n\nit's a very interactive way of dining as there was no where to place the shells, only on the table.  so in the end you get from a plastic filled shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> to a table filled with empty shrimp shells and crab shells.  it's the most fun i've had eating here.  my boyfriend just told me that this girl he knows says it was just okay.  she must've been drunk or upset about some drama that she didn't see the goodness of this place.  but whatever.\n\ni would definitely go back and eat here again and again.  the relaxed atmosphere and interactive dining is worth coming back for.  kudos to you hot n juicy crawfish for being one of the best seafood restaurants in vegas.", 
            "my very first time i went was with the same person i always eat out with if it isn't my boyfriend, so i might as well introduce you to my friend mikhail.. not a yelper, yet! haha.. anyway, it was both our first time & i have never tried crawfish before.\n\nwe ended up getting sharing the two bags [2lbs each?] of <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> crawfish, the <mark>Soft Shell Crab Basket</mark> w <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and calamari. i felt like such a newbie trying to open the crawfish, i splashed myself a couple times, but that's what the bibs are for, right? the flavoring was great; we ordered medium & it was just enough for me. my nose was running a little & my eyes got watery, but i enjoyed it. i think next time i'll stick with <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> cause i definitely have that down to a science ;) the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were straaight up cajun! i'd have to stop myself after a while because it would get a little spicy. soft shell crab was good, just wanted marinara sauce from the calamari instead of the tartar that the soft shell came with :) the calamari was house made, but it wasn't anything fancy for me. there's only a few places where i can say that's great calamari. \n\nthe service was average, it was a sunday & the lakers were playing orlando so we had to wait for a good 20 minutes for a table for two. i didn't realize that the restrooms were in two different spots, but our table was against the wall for the mens restroom & i was washing my hands before & after we ate. my bad fellerz!\n\nthe weird thing is that at the bottom of the receipt says you get a 3% discount if you pay cash.. i don't get it, do you have to present the check with the cash, then get a new receipt with the new balance? they already use enough disposable stuff & use styrofoam cups so i don't really think they're going green anyway. blah, maybe i'm going crazy because i'm yelping & it's already 6am!! random.. and awkward receipt though. i will be back hot n juicy! the simplicity of the menu & your system is definitely working, so much props. i'll probably come back on a weekday because that day was madness~", 
            "cajun seafood at its best.  i recommend the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and shrimp ($10/lb).  the crawfish ($11/lb) was tasty, but it's so much work to get to the small pieces of meat. we ordered everything in medium, but even that was pretty spicy!  i can't imagine what extra spicy tastes like.  your bowels would probably be in butt-clenching agony.", 
            "love it...this time we skipped the crawfish (too much work) and opted for 2pounds of shrimp. wished we had gotten one pound of shrimp and one pound of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> like the people seated next to us..oh well, still awesome.  we got it medium spice and hot n'<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>- got the <mark>Extra Seasoning Sauce</mark> to put on rice...oh hell yeah...the sauce on the rice alone was delish!\nwe also got soft shell crab and <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>..everything was very great...stuffed ourselves silly that's for sure..", 
            "yay! i finally got to have the hot-n-juicy experience.  it took years and family visiting from out of town to go.  i could never get the place to appeal to the hubby.  he was never thrilled with the idea of eating from a bag and leaving the shells on the table.  he's not big into making a mess, but me on the other hand...the dirty just makes it taste better, right?!\n\nso i went with my mom, cousin, and his wife.  i was excited because i've heard so much about this place and the yelpers can't help but to rave.  between us all we ordered the 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 pounds of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> (both <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, mild), 2 orders of calamari, a basket of chicken, and an order of fries.  \n\ni zeroed in on the seafood, i didn't take all this time to get here to eat chicken!!  my mom freaked out a bit about shrimp with heads and made me pull them off for her (this is why no crawfish...no sucking heads for us that day!)  but she did eventually get over it and was able to take of the heads herself without being grossed out.  everything tasted really good, just a bit of a kick that didn't overwhelm (enough of a kick for me, i'm a pussy when it comes to spicy).  i don't even remember how many paper towels i personally went through but i'm glad there was an unlimited number of them.\n\ni think the family enjoyed the experience, but when my mom discovered they had plastic gloves after our meal she was disappointed her hands smelt like garlic and seafood.  i just asked the waitress for some lemons for our hands then went and washed them in the bathroom...good as new.  but my dog has that super sonic smell going on and couldn't get over how yummy my hands were!\n\ni'm quite the happy fat-n-preggers girl after this experience.  baby was definitely happy with all the yummy goodness i fed her.  now that i know they have some pansy plastic gloves for the hubby i think i've got a better chance to get him to come with me for a return trip.  he's also a sucker for anywhere that serves <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. :o)", 
            "we ate here for dinner tonight and yes, i am officially a fan!  we always drive by this place and the parking lot is always packed.  i've also been hearing about it a lot.  it was also featured on man vs. food.  didn't need any more reasons to stop by here.  so we decided on dinner here tonight.  we got here at 9 on a tuesday night, mind you, and the parking lot was packed as usual.  we were lucky enough to get a parking spot and unfortunately there was a 30 min. wait for the 4 of us.  i don't mind waiting for food as long as it's good food!  \nwe actually ran across the street to the crown and anchor to grab a beer while we waited.  the bartender there told us that that was pretty common.   \nso we get seated 30 min later and we're ready!  we started with 2 lbs of crawfish, 2 lbs of shrimp, 2 lbs of <mark>King Crab</mark> legs all wth the hot n juicy marinade, spicy.  we also ordered <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, corn and <mark>Potato</mark> and a round of beers.   the tables are lined with a garbage bag and there is a roll of paper towels for each table.  no silverware.  the food started coming out really fast, within 5 minutes of ordering.  they are deiivered in plastic bags.  oh man, the crawfish was delicious! hot and juicy of course and the seasoning was so spicy and addictive.  my mouth was on fire inside and out!  but i couldnt stop!  everything was really good.  spicy, buttery and garlicy....yum!  we ended up ordering 2 more lbs of crawfish, 1 more lb of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and some more corn.  oh man, the corn was to die for.  sweet, but so spicy. \n a very messy meal and you kinda have to work for your food but it was definitely worth it!  the prices were reasonable as well.  i will definitely go back here.", 
            "went here right after they opened for the day on a saturday so the place was relatively empty. we must have been there for close to an hour and a half, and by the time we left the place had filled up. the service was top notch throughout our entire meal. multiple servers asking if we needed anything, constantly offering assistance, and refilling our drinks. our waitress was as friendly as they come and really helped us through the ordering process. \n\nnow the food. we ordered all our seafood with the hot n juicy seasoning: 1 lb. crawfish (medium heat), 1 lb. shrimp (medium heat) and 1 lb. <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> (spicy).  i could handle the medium level fine, but the spicy level got the nose running and the pores sweating. it added to the experience. \n\nthey will demonstrate how to properly eat a crawfish, and after an attempt or two, you will have it down no problem. make sure to suck the juice out of the head, that is where the flavor really accumulates. what is great about this meal is the seafood comes out very fast and it's nice and hot, but it will take you a while to make your way through it all with all the peeling and cracking and talking about how great everything tastes. \n\nthe <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> were amazing and we immediately ordered  pound of <mark>King Crab</mark> legs when we had finished those off. the shrimp was tasty.  i even decided to bite off a few heads and they were nice a crunchy. \n\nalthough the place is named after the crawfish, and those do have an unique flavor, i would almost stick exclusively to the crabs next time. so tasty. unfortunately due to the oil spill they were only offering the snow and <mark>King Crab</mark> legs. normally whole crabs from the gulf region are available too.\n\nit's a great dining experience. fun and very tasty. your knuckles will burn with spices and smell of garlic  for a few hours after, but that will serve as a reminder of money well spent in vegas.", 
            "yeah, this place is good.  in comparison to claws and boiling crab in the oc, i like this place too.  the people i went with don't eat very spicy food, so the waiter dude recommended mild heat which was still good.  we had crawdads, shrimp, and clams, and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>.  decent service, eye-candy patrons, tv's and beers on tap.  i will come back!  that ish is vegas, son! \n\nbtw, to all you whiners that complain about waiting an hour to eat, too bad! we got lucky and seated 7 right away by calling ahead and checking first before making the effort to go there.", 
            "this place is one of my favorites on the planet earth and i encourage vegas visitors to take a short ride over to chinatown to experience this place. the garlic scent summons you in from the parking lot and once inside, (if you're a garlic lover), you just want to stay there. we had the shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and i could go on eating them forever!  one tip, do not forget to get the corn. it is brought to you in the bag along with your seafood and garlicky goodness (get the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>). i have never had better corn. oh, and do not wear fancy clothes there. you will smell like garlic for a few days...but i really didnt care. it was worth it!", 
            "i go for the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>. oh so tasty!  dip the crab meat into the hot n' juicy sauce and enjoy!\n\nplace gets crazy crowded now, so get in when you can!", 
            "okay, i can see why this place gets a bunch fo 4 stars.  \n\nthis was my first time eating crawfish as was it for my wife.\n\nso first off, we get there and the place is full, no waiting, just full of people enjoying their dinner.  we had stopped at another \"crawfish\" place nearby and there was litterally no one in the place.  that was the first clue that we didn't want to stay.  then we did a quick yelp and the average rating was 2.5 stars.\n\nwhile yelping the first restaurant we saw this place with an average of 4 stars.  much better, so we headed on over.\n\nlike i said, the first time we've had crawfish. \n\nthe first big plus, we were greeted and sat quickly.  the server asked if we had ever had crawfish before, and when we said \"no\", he brougt out two crawfish and showed us the process.\n\nwe ordered crawfish and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>.  both were great, but beware, the \"mild\" sauce has quite a kick to it.  we also ordered calamari and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  everything was good.\n\nnow, this is not a first date place.  but if you can find someone that will go here and  get dirty with you on the first date...marry them. :-)  half of the fun is you eat your shell fish and just toss the shells on the table.  in fact, it's so messy, they give you a bib and plastic gloves(upon request).\n\nthis place is fun, good food, decent prices and just worth the visit if you haven't had crawfish before, or just want to eat some good ol' southern crawfish, crab(blue, snow, dungenous) and catfish.", 
            "hot n juicy is one of those places that i never thought i would like.  growing up, my relatives have always been obsessed with <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and other seafoods that you have to work for to get to the good stuff.  as i got older i saw that it wasn't just my family, it was pretty much everybody that was obsessed with peeling their food.  i just did not see the point in having to work so hard for your food!\n\nand then there was hot n juicy.  admittedly, my first visit here was made reluctantly.  if i didn't care much for crab, why would i care for crawfish?  the answer is easy: the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce.  medium spice.  i went from avoiding seafood that requires my hands to eat, to getting serious cravings for hot n juicy.  that sauce is spicy and leaves a (pleasant) burn on your lips as you continue to eat.  the garlic flavor can get pretty strong as it leaves it's mark on your breathe, and infiltrates every article of clothing you're currently wearing.  you'll probably end up doing laundry as soon as possible.  but all of that doesn't matter...because the sauce is worth it.\n\nmy current favorite is the shrimp.  crawfish is good, but their size is inconsistent.  not that that's the restaurants fault or anything, it's just that the first time i went, the crawfish were pretty darn big.  but with each subsequent visit...their size diminished.  but it's okay, i have my shrimp to keep me satisfied.  next time i go i'll have to try the crab.\n\nso has my mind changed about seafood?  no not really.  as it stands, i'm really in it for the sauce.  no <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, no seafood peeling/cracking for me.  five stars for instilling a craving that i never thought i would have, and having consistently delicious sauce.", 
            "i gave it 2 stars only because im from la and we have boiling crab and claws. 2 restaurants with the same concept, but very different flavors (in my opinion).\n\ni get it...hot n juicy was featured on man vs food and i guess if you're ok with the spice level, its worth trying. i, on the other hand, dont like my food that spicy.\n\ncame in for dinner with a few friends and ordered shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, and a few appetizers. service was ok. but the food was just...eh. maybe i'm spoiled by la food and expect a lot more from seafood, but we're in a desert, so what more can you expect?\n\ni didnt really enjoy the food because i expected what i get at boiling crab and claws, or maybe the hype of this place was built up so much i expected much more from it.\n\nall in all, it definitely calms that seafood craving when i dont wanna go to a buffet and craving something with that bit of spice/extra flavor to it.\n\nand - both times i came in it definitely didnt sit well with my stomach. same thing with my best friend. kinda left our stomachs a little \"hot n juicy\"...sorry i had to say it. thats exactly how we felt when we got home.\n\ni'll probably back, if im really really craving cajun style seafood", 
            "so i am kinda new here, but i decided to join to write for a restaurant i really care about.\n\ni have been going to hot n' juicy ever since the man v food filming for the travel channel show. i have to say that every time i have been there the service has been more than accommodating. the waitresses are very sweet and pretty and all the servers and staff are beyond friendly. \n\nas for the food, you really can't go wrong with a big ol' bag of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and shrimp. i always get at least a dozen sausage and oysters to go with them. the sauces are out of this world good. my friend and i always get the nosebleed sauce on the side so we can just dip everything in it and use the rice on the side to cool down. it is an exhilarating experience. this place is hands down a one-of-a-kind experience for those in vegas. i have lived here my whole life and have not found such an inexpensive restaurant that offers this kind of experience to this scale. \n\nimportant: all the claims of sanitation issues and health violations are completely false! they have recently been checked by the state health department and have been cleared of all false accusations.\n\nplease don't let a few negative words fool you on this joint. just go there and try for yourself. you won't be disappointed!",

            "on our most recent trip to vegas, which was just this week, we ventured off the strip and tried hot n juicy crawfish.\n\nit was phenomenal!\n\nwe had never been here before so we were pretty unsure of what to order...the waitress was super helpful in explaining the menu to us.  \n\nwe ordered two pounds of crawfish and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> (mild, hot n juicy) with <mark>Potato</mark> and corn and a few blue moons.\nthe food was so incredible.\nso messy.\nso, so good.\n\nthe spice level was right on with what the waitress said it would be and wasn't too overwhelming.  she said even the medium is a little spicy so we went with the mild.  my lips were tingly...and i liked it!\n\nthe crawfish are a lot of work with not much payoff but it's fun...if you go expecting to get lobster-sized pieces of meat out of a crawfish, well, duh.  it's a crawfish.\n\nthe <mark>Potato</mark> were great...new <mark>Potato</mark> that soak up all the juicy sauce.  same with the corn.  \n\ni can't say enough about this place except that i wish we had found it sooner.  \n\noh...don't go in your fancy club clothes.  you'll leave smelling like garlic and seafood.  \ndo go expecting to have a good time and an enjoyable meal.\nyour palate will thank you!",

(i am a good girl). as usual, i have my sunday treat but it was \"messy\" and \"kind-of-getting dirty\". i just had to have...aaah, crawfish.  i would say that is the closest i could get myself to transporting my state of mind in my good ole' neighborhood in the south. since lived there, and having crawfish and alligator meat as southern fare, crawfish became my last sunday's dinner. \n\nthe smell of garlic, pepper and spice filled my nostrils upon entering. windows brought in the early evening light as we walked in this cozy restaurant with its simple dining set-up. rows of wooden chairs and white plastic-covered tables. each table had a roll of paper towel. television perched high up on one wall. not much talking around, diners were busy.... \n\nmet by a smiling male waitstaff, and got a seat and table by the wall. menu was simple in a rectangular paper. i knew what i liked. what else? but crawfish! i yearn for the days i would buy them from a seafood grocer in north carolina and take it home to steam & boil it in my gigantic steamer-boiler pot. i am great at coo<mark>King Crab</mark>. my kitchen has a rollaway spice rack filled with spices, stainless steel cookwares and stainless steel range-oven...i like making seafood and crawfish for myself and whenever i have guests. \n\nbut this time, this restaurant cooks it for me. order the crawfish or  seafood by the pound..or two...or three...as much you like. also indicate the type of spice and amount of spiciness. the waitstaff pleasant and helpful about anything unclear about the spiciness. if you care to ask about how to peel off the crawfish meat from the shell, the waitstaff will show you how. but i do know how, so let me say that i am hands-up, thumbs-up delighted when the crawfish i ordered came in a plastic bag inside a bucket. it was pulled out of the bucket and presented to me and my mom. it was steaming hot-and-juicy! just like the restaurant is called. the aroma was invigoratingly intoxicating! but stop! one thing i just have to do. \"cleanliness is next to godliness\" so where else would i go before all this? the bathroom awaits for a good hands cleansing. did that so fast! yes, hands where the main activity going in this restaurant. everyone was just eating away with hands! diners were busy! by golly, this is a feastful of fun! the crawfish was extrasuperfantastically delicious! well made, not too dry! there was sauce inside the plastic bag. spicy, it was especially my request of louisiana hot and spicy special was definitely the spiciness it supposed to be, just like in the south! small chunks of garlic and ginger were visible as part of the seasoning. besides the crawfish, the oysters on their half-ed oyster shells (my favorite!) were large and fresh. with sprinkling of lemon juice and butter sauce gave it the \"to-die-for\" yumminess. also, the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> (presented steaming in a plastic bag) was remarkably meaty. a side order of corn was drenched with garlic and butter with a little spiciness of creole seasoning. oh, corn-soft-ness!\n\nalas, this is a place for hands-on eating for juicy seafood! my mom and i was delightfully full and messy. yes, there were splashes of red on our bibs and table cover from the creole-cajun-louisiana sauce but no cares. the table covers gets trashed by the waitstaff after each table is vacated. there's water in the bathroom, just go wash those hands! but will surely go back for more hot and juicy sea eats!", 
            "las vegas is sin city for a reason; it celebrates the seven deadly sins. in vegas, your greatest weakness or vice becomes the source of all your pleasures. we were ready to give into our carnal desires and get down and dirty, indulging our voracious, gluttonous appetites. we wanted to get stuffed with something hot n juicy. \n\nhot n juicy is known for their seafood: crab (dungeness, blue, snow), shrimp, and of course, crawfish. you pick the type of seasoning (<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> or the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>) and the level of spiciness (mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy). \n\nwe ordered 2 lbs of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and 2 lbs of crawfish with <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> at medium, 2 pieces of corn, 2 red <mark>Potato</mark>, etouffee (a cajun seafood stew, similar to gumbo), and a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. eating at hot n juicy is not an elegant refine affair. it's messy work because they dump a plastic bag of whatever seafood you ordered and you're only protection is the plastic table covering and a plastic bib. you open the bag and dig in.\n\nthe crab meat was very sweet and juicy. it was perfectly cooked. i found that the spiciness of the food depended on the type of seafood because the seasoning is on the outside of the shell. the meat isn't spicy unless you soak it in the sauce first. i found the level of spiciness in the crawfish much higher because the tail meat was much smaller and there was more shell around it, unlike the crab meat where i could pull out large pieces of meat out of the shell. also i got more spicy sauce from the crawfish because i sucked crawfish heads. after a while my lips got tingly and numb from the cajun spices. \n\ni've never had crawfish whole before. i only had them de-shelled. while i love crawfish and the meat was great, i'll never have them whole like that again. the tail meat is rather tiny (i like 'em big -- size matters when it comes to these things). at the end, we looked at the mountain of shell and agreed that it was more work than it was worth. crawfish is mostly shell and i'd rather pay someone to shell them for me.\n\netouffee was a spicy rice seafood stew. i liked the flavor and the level of spice was just perfect for me. i thought the rice was a tad overcooked and mushy from just sitting in a pot all day, but in general it was enjoyable.\n\nthe boiled red <mark>Potato</mark> were much needed as a break from the relentless cajun spice. they were nice and sweet. the corn is out of season, so not as sweet and juicy as in the summer, but still tasty. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were crispy and tasty.\n\nthe final price for all of us was $30/person for three people. we gorged ourselves on great seafood and left utterly satiated. happy ending for us indeed.\n\nwhat happens in vegas, stays in vegas. but this is one of the few times where you wish you could get crabs and bring them home with you.", 
            "honestly, if i have never been to the boiling crab in san jose this would have easily been a 5 star rating for me.  i just love the atmosphere of the whole place..from the garlic smell (that follows you through your clothing for the rest of your day by the way) to the get-down-and-dirty style.  some things just taste better eating with your hands and this is one of those occasions.  seating did not take very long and our server was very friendly and helpful.  he explained the system to us and forewarned us that even mild has a kick to it since it is a cajun restaurant.  my lips were burning by the end of my meal with mild, so if you don't like spicy food, do not come here!\n\nwe ordered <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> since the <mark>Blue Crab</mark> and the <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> were out (that was upsetting).  we got it with the hot n juicy seasoning, which the server explained did not mean it was spicy, but was a combination of all the other sauces.  it comes in a plastic bag, so we put on our plastic bibs and dug in!  it was delicious...the crab was meaty and the seasoning was just right.  just thinking about the taste right now makes my mouth water.  we also ordered the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  maybe you would have better luck, but if you want my honest advice, do not order those!  they were soggy and gross.\n\nthis is a must try if you have never experienced anything like this.  i would definitely come here again.  do not wear nice clothes here if you plan to go clubbing afterwards, keep an open mind, and enjoy!", 
            "i came here two years ago when on leave from iraq.  loved it.  and then after i came back from iraq i was pleasantly surprised to see man vs. food come and eat here!  good for them (both the show and the restaurant!).  \n\ncoming for ces i wanted to come back here.  came on a friday night and the place was packed.  had to wait 30 minutes.  \n\nwhen they sat me down, the menu looked identical to what it was 2 years ago.  they told me because of the new opening of a 2nd hot 'n juicy in washington (d.c. or state?) the shrimp was buy one and get one free.  sure, why not?  so i ordered 1 lb of crawdad, 1 lb of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and 1 lb of shrimp which turned into 2 lbs of shrimp.  \n\ngot the hot 'n juicy flavor which is a combination of all their flavors together.  you get four different flavors to choose from (check the website's menu) or you can just combine them all.  so i did this and asked for extra garlic.  and i emphasized a lot of garlic.  and i chose medium as to how spicy.  i remember the 1st time i went i ordered either the spicey or extra spicey and after 2 lbs of crawdad my mouth and innards were burning.  so i decided on medium this time.\n\nthe tables you sit down at are covered with a plastic sheet.  you get a bib to eat all your food with also.  the food comes out in a plastic bag that holds your food and the juice of whatever flavor you chose.  while eating your food, you crack and open whatever it is you're eating directly on the table.  after you're down, the waiters just come and wrap up the entire thing with that plastic sheet and voila!  a brand new clean table is ready.  i thought this was so cool the 1st time i came here so i made a complete mess of myself and the table.\n\nfood came out and i started to chow down.  there was a ton of garlic in my bags, it was outstanding.  they forgot my bib and half-way through my 1st bag i asked for my bib.  one of the waitresses actually tied it around my neck for me 'cause my hands were already all messy.  i laughed as she tied it for me!  that's service!\n\nfood was even better than i last remembered.  shrimp was completely on point being moderate to big sized.  choose snow crab for my legs and they were great.  and of course the crawdad was excellent.  after 4 lbs of food the spices got to me again.  will have to go with mild sauce next time-sigh, i'm just getting old and can't quite handle my spicy foods like i use to.\n\nso overall hot 'n juicy actually improved since i last came here-amazing.  a definite have to visit if you love crawdad.", 
            "this place was so good that we went twice on our trip to vegas -- the day after we got there and the day we left.\n\nthe crawfish were pretty small when i ordered them (the waitress told us they would be) but they were succulent and sweet and more or less worth it. the shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> were better though. i liked the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> medium (which was super spicy the first time i came and milder the second time) and my boyfriend was a big fan of the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> mild. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were awesome as well. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were a bit spicy which would have been okay but my mouth was already burning from the seafood. beers are cheap.\n\ndefinitely a fun eating experience as well. i would recommend the trip if you are in vegas.",

            "this place looked so good on mvf, i had to come here and try it. \n\nthere's two hot n juicy crawfish restaurants less than a mile from each other. the cab driver was a little confused too,  but he said this one was the one that he drops everyone off at. \n\nfirst off, the servers are very friendly. they might not have been very quick to get our food order or remember to bring everything, but they were all super nice. \n\nthere were 6 of us in the group and we decided to order by pairs. it's hard to not share and hard to share with the entire group. you'll see it gets really messy and there's no way of passing things around the table. so the easiest way to eat is to share with the person next to you or across from you. \n\nwe ordered the shrimp, crawfish (of course), clams, and <mark>King Crab</mark> legs. you also get a choice of sauce and spiciness. everyone ordered the hot n juicy sauce (a mix of 3 of the choices). i usually eat my thai food 4 stars and ordered medium spiciness. it was pretty good for me, although i could have used a little more spice. it might be too spicy for people that don't eat hot foods. \n\nthe food comes out in bags and you just dig in with your hands. there's bibs and gloves for everyone (highly recommended). i loved the clams and shrimp. the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> didn't have much flavor. the crawfish were just a pain in the ass- a lot of work for nothing. i would probably skip that next time. in fact, everyone in our group was saying how great the food was- except for the pain-in-the-ass crawfish :) \n\ni would highly recommend this place. the food is good, service is great, and the atmosphere is so much fun. and prices were not bad if you're used to the astronomical prices on the strip.",

            "dear miss manners:\n  i was invited to this place to eat crawfish. i had never tried crawfish before so i was not aware of the intense labor that is required to eat these little creatures. but it's ok because at the end you are rewarded with lots of flavor.  it was so messy i had to wear a bib, and the only way to eat them was using nothing but your fingers! i had to put aside everything my mother had taught me on table etiquette.\n  i have to admit that i had a wonderful time. this place is awesome. the food the service and the ambiance were exceptionally good. everyone seems to be having a wonderful time! can't wait to come back and try other things. like the shrimp the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> or the oysters!\n  my question is.... is it bad when you like something so much to the point of licking the juices of the fingers? even if the fingers are those of your friends?", 
            "hawt n' joosay!\n\nthe name really says it all for this place.  the sauce is hot, the food is juicy.  get a garbage bag of food and tap into your inner caveman.  most crawfish joints do kind of the same thing but the variations in the sauces make them different.  what sets this place apart is they use the sichuan pepper (i think) which leaves your mouth a little numb but taste great and creates a unique spiciness.  as far as the items to order ive had most of the menu but here are my suggestions.\n\n<mark>King Crab</mark> legs  - hands down the item to get.  huge chunks of crab with little effort.  you just have to know how to use the little plastic claw tool.  use one side to make a crack then the other to slice through like scissors through paper.  ask your server if you need help.  don't be afraid of the price these are well worth it, trust me you wont be sorry.  \n\nshrimp - if your not going big with the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> then these are the best bang for your buck.  best meat to price ratio and easy to eat.\n\ncorn - soaks up the sauce like a sponge.  make room in your gut for this.  don't sleep! \n\nfries - regular or sweet potato are both tasty and good sharing choices to break up all the buttery spice from the seafood.\n\nsauce - i prefer the everything mix or whatever they call it here.  i also prefer extra spicy which i wouldn't suggest for most people.  even spicy has a kick to it.\n\nthey can handle large groups and there is a second one down the street if this one is full.",

            "i have finally had the chance to check this place out and what a disappointment.\n\nlet me start by saying... our waiter, nick... damn. it was almost like he was fed up in being there and just didn't give a fck. once we sat down, he came and yes... threw out menus in our face, threw sugar bags down on the table, and asked us you guys want anything to drink?! daaaamn serious?!?!! why boo??!! why??! wow okay... . came back with our teas and took our orders.. that's the last time we saw his face. \n\nit took numerous attempts to get a runner, server, whoever worked there to ask for refills, which finally was able to be refilled, but with regular tea when i had raspberry. nasty... the whole time we were there... our throats were like a desert and our drinks were empty.. so damn empty,  the melted ice made a few gulps of replenishment to get us through our meals. we had to ask for gloves, we had to ask again for our pepper and  limes on the side, which our server never brought, and we even had to ask the next table to please get their server's attention for us after she was done giving them their food orders, just so we could... ask. even our tools to crack open our crabs were not the right tools, but after trying to get a server's attention. it was more tiring to wave down a server than tear apart our meals. from the frustration on the service here, i tore the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> with my own bare hands and ate like an animal. tearing it with my own straight teeth!!! grrr!!! i ended up doing the.. break the shell with my fingers and gently wiggle wiggle the meat out. several times i showed my great company that i conquered a looooong piece of crab meat ha haaaa! but then she shows off her piece, which was thicker and longer than mine!!! oh yeah?!??!!!! i had that ooo impressed face and nodded my head. we entertained each other... but never once were we checked back upon to see how we were doing or we needed anything. it was literally the worst service for a fun-filled environment. \n\ni heard their other new location has better service, but this experience makes me think twice to even want to give them my business.\n\nthe food was the only thing that made me want to give any stars to this establishment. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> was excellent in texture and taste. the shrimp, crab, and side of sausage we ordered were full of spice and with the combination of asking limes on the side to make your own sauce.. it tasted refreshing, sweet, spicy, peppery, bitter, and ended with a great bite from the acidity of the limes. don't forget to ask for those pepper and limes on the side.. makes a great impact with the flavors of the spices that were cooked in with the crab and shrimp. even if you have to hunt someone down that worked there to get it! i will note that the food deserves high remarks. however, due to the lack of service we received here, it's unfortunate to give it such a low rating. but i must speak the truth and the service here was... non-existence. damn, damn shame if you ask me. it ruined a good meal experience and for us to constantly try to get a server's attention is just bad news. we couldn't enjoy our food and it shouldn't be that way.\n\nand for that reason alone... first and last time dining here. wasn't so \"hot\" after all and that's the juicy part.",

            "sooooooo good!!!\nits my favorite crab restaurant here in vegas. nothing compares. the service is amazing, especially this last time we went aj was great. the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> are delicious and the environment is perfect. recommend this place to anyone who likes seafood.!", 
            "this place is awesome, the priority at this place is good food... i heard a lot about this place so my expectations were high when i got to vegas. i didn't want to put the bib on but it was definitely a good idea...\n\nwhat we had:\nfried catfish\ncorn fritters\nshrimp boil\n<mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>\ncorn on the cobb\nfries\n<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\n\nthe only thing that i had that was not off the charts good were the fries, everything else was so good i can't wait to go back. our waitress was funny an had no problem trading shots with 8 guys.\n\nthis place is now on my 'must do while in vegas' list. this place is awesome before accounting for the relatively inexpensive prices. add that in and this place is borderline 5 stars. if i have the same experience again i will bump this place up to 5 stars.\n\nthey don't have plates, but who cares? so it's not a first date place, or a place you go to prior to a club, but this place is awesome.", 
            "viva las vegas!!! this has become my favorite restaurant in vegas! i go there every time. fresh crawfish flown in every day...shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> that are to die for, tender clams and the hot n juicy sauce (i prefer this sauce in hot but you get a choice of sauces & heat level) just covers everything with love! \n\nall the seafood is served in bags so it keeps absorbing the flavor of the sauce. the crawfish comes with a potato and corn in the bag, but you can get it added to everything else. i recommend adding these as the corn gets the flavor of the sauce and the potato absorbs the sauce. i also like getting a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> as well and you can pour the sauce on it! \n\nyes, you are peeling and ripping your food apart with your bare hands, so ladies, if you do not want to mess up your manicure, they do provide gloves. i went brazenly bare last time though and it was a lot easier to eat and when i was done all the sauce washed off easily.\n\nthey now have 2 locations... i prefer the one that is furthest from the strip. the one closer is very, very loud because of the building. it's like being in a tin can, so take the extra 5 minutes and head a little further up spring mountain.\n\ni cannot wait for my next hot n juicy fix!", 
            "gave this place another chance.  tried to come here for my birthday a few months ago, only to face a 45 minute wait, a trip to their 2nd location, a waitress dumping a full soda on our table and finding out there was no crab - <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, snow crab , <mark>King Crab</mark> - none at all - only when our server took our order.  this time, i called ahead and yes, they had crab available.  \n\npros - \n\nno wait at 6:15 on a friday night\nbeverages refilled promptly\nservers were friendly\nfood was good\n\ncons -\n\ntwo of us ordered <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>; and server gave each of us a claw cracker tool, and that was it.  no fork, no pick, not even a butter knife or even one of those \"sea sheller\" plastic gadgets.  how did they expect anyone to eat crab without any other tools?  one of us ordered the lobster, and he did get the sea sheller tool.  when i asked for two more, the server said she wasn't sure if they had more, but she would look!  come on, it's a seafood restaurant, and you can't give your customers something as simple as a plastic tool to open <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>?  she did manage to bring two more to our table.\n\nonly the crawfish included corn & <mark>Potato</mark>.  i can understand not including sausage with boiled seafood, but one tiny potato and half an ear of corn for three people added $4 to our bill.  how hard could it be to just include this in every boiled seafood menu item?  petty money grab, imo. and . . .\n\nsausage, corn and <mark>Potato</mark> were brought to the table 10 minutes before we got our seafood.  they were cold by the time we ate them with our seafood.\n\nmarinara sauce with mozzarella sticks from appetizer menu was cold.\n\nseasoning description on menu could have had more information.  i have no idea what was in \"<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>\" or \"<mark>Louisiana Style</mark>\" - white pepper?  black pepper?  red pepper?  paprika?  no clue whatsoever with no information in the menu, and server didn't know either.\n\nparking lot is too small for the capacity of the restaurant.  \n\nif you go -\ncall ahead and ask if they have the seafood you want\npark on the street\nif you plan on ordering crab, bring your own crab tools\ntell your server to bring the corn and <mark>Potato</mark> with your seafood.", 
            "i had heard so much about this place, i finally met up with some friends for lunch to try it out!\ndo not come here if you are afraid of getting a little messy! i ordered a pound of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and, after a little hesitation, dug right in! i have never had crab that you had to actually crack open the shell, it was very different! i absolutely loved it. my friends ordered the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> basket, rolls, corn, and crawfish. we left the restaurant with full stomachs and smiles. :-) i would reccommend this place to anyone who likes seafood!", 
            "came on monday at 12:00. \nordered a pound of shrimp in hot n spicy sauce and 2 lbs of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> in the same sauce.and the sweetest, yummiest corn ever.\nso tasty and delicious. we were full all day and yes, you will stink of garlic for the next couple days, but it is totally worth it. the place was full with 2 waiters but they accomidated to all of our needs quickly and brought out the food fast. it was totally yummy. there are 2 locations on the same street, so if one is too busy, try the other one. totally worth it.", 
            "when i first landed in vegas, my cousin couldn't stop talking about this place. we are both from chicago, so unfortunately, they do not have a location by us. he have tried this place tons of times before and since he hyped this place up so much, i had to try it myself.\n\nthe first day, we tried 2lbs of crawfish, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, and shrimp. we also got the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, which is a good compliment to all those seafood. we got everything with the hot and juicy mild sauce because this was what my cousin recommended. everything was so good, but i didn't really like the crawfish. they are small and requires more time to eat than the shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>. you also get very little out of the crawfish. i would not recommend this. the shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> are really good and the sauce was perfect!\n\nthe second time we came back here was a few days later. we came back with a bigger group and ordered a storm again. this time we only ordered shrimp, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> again. everything was once again perfect and i wanted to come back here again before we left back to chicago. sadly, this was my last time here and till this day, i would come here as my 1st stop after landing in vegas. i also must say that after all this food, my gf and uncle threw up afterwards. everyone else was fine though.\n\ni also heard that this location is better than the other location, but i have never tried the other one yet. also, for all you outsiders, prepare to get your hands dirty and do not wear a white shirt. it is messy and you eat with gloves and a bib.", 
            "my favorite are the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>. i like it with <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce. their shrimp is big and their <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce is delicious! i even like to get rice on the side to put sauce on it and eat the rice like that if i'm feeling really hungry. i'm not a fan of the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce though, i think it's a mixture of all the sauces put together and it just doesn't taste good. crawfish is good when in season long enough to grow big. when they're not in season they suck because it's frozen so it's mushy and doesn't taste as good.\n\nextra spicy is reallly spicy! to where its painful, so avoid unless you love very spicy food! i get spicy or medium.", 
            "there are not too many places where i feel a bib is necessary to eat, i mean i'm an adult and can handle putting food in my mouth without spilling it all over myself.  hot n juicy is the rare exception to this rule.  breaking into crawfish and sucking the juice from their heads is messier than one would expect.  \n\ni can vouch for the crawfish, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and lobster.  i'm also a huge fan of the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning.  i have kind of a \"when in rome\" approach to food ... if something is a specialty or a namesake, more often than not it's damn good.  when i lived in vegas, i would frequent this place often and bring visitors from out of town here.  never a dissatisfied experience or visitor.\n\na few thing to keep in mind though ... expect to wear a bib and smell like hot n juicy for the rest of the day ... maybe into the next day.  this place is also crowded, expect to wait ... it's well worth the wait though.  hot n juicy is an experience, be ready to get your hands dirty.", 
            "i've always been a fan of hot n juicy even though i'm allergic to shellfish (nothing benadryl can't fix).  it's laid-back, service is great and the food is simple but fantastic.  it's always busy...packed with locals and tourists.  we go here a lot especially around lent.  if this location gets to crazy-busy, there's another one a few blocks away.\n\nthey have oysters, mussels, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, lobster, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, clams, <mark>Shrimp</mark>, and of course, crawfish.  with the exception of the lobster, you order shellfish by the pound.  you can pick the seasoning you want: cajun, <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> and hot n juicy.  pick your spice level: less than mild, mild, medium, spicy extra spicy.  pick your sides and appetizers.  you get a bib and you could ask for a pair of gloves because it'll get messy...you don't want to ruin your manicure, do you?  i do away with gloves since i like to lick the juices off my fingers when i eat here. \n\ni'm not a big fan of crawfish because you it's too much work and you get a teeny tiny bit of crawfish meat.  i always get less than mild <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>...either <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> or lobster.  hey, if i'm going to have an anaphylactic reaction, i might as well make it count.  \n\ndon't take your date here unless you've been together forever.  or maybe you can test-drive your date to see if he/she's down to get dirty.  the garlic smell lingers...on your breath and hands no matter how many times you brush your teeth, gargle and wash your hands.  after a day, you should be good to go.", 
            "oh my gosh. after today's visit, i finally understand the hype around hnj! this place is good. the only thing that sucks is the wait! so it's a good thing it's worth it!\n\nwe had a few people visiting from texas, so my best friend randy and i had to be strategic about getting a party of 10 people in this small space. since they don't take reservations, i planned to put our name down early and wait before everyone else got there. the wait was at least 30 minutes when we got there. by the time everyone showed up, it had been 40 minutes, however, the hostess came out to inform us that they were preparing our table! wonderful timing and within another five minutes, we had a table in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nthe food was delicious and with a large group, the experience was so much fun! i don't normally like getting dirty or using my hands, but with the bibbs, plastic gloves, cracker, sheller, and paper towels, it made dinner very enjoyable. i ordered a pound of the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs (market price today was $25.99/lb) with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> (all the seasonings combined) in medium. oh, it was so tasty and those legs were huge! it was challenging with thin plastic gloves and legs with gigantic spikes, so i utilized three pairs of gloves and several paper towels. i think there needs to be gardening gloves and/or real towels for those heavy duty <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>! it can be pretty dangerous. ruben and i also ordered the calamari and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. all delicious! but that <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning/sauce, wow.\n\nwonderful, wonderful place. the service was just okay, but i know they're busy and honestly, you're so consumed with wrestling <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> that you forget your server hasn't checked on you. as long as they remember to keep the beverages filled, there's nothing lacking. can't wait to go back!", 
            "love. this is a regular spot for my friends and i. we went there this weekend and got the snow crab. it was awesome! a lot of our <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> were pretty skimpy on the meat tho, but we mentioned it to our server and she gave us an extra half pound. then because it took so long to get that half pound (they were pretty busy), she changed it to an additional pound plus took a pound off of our bill. \ni have noticed that the service is a little inconsistent...sometimes they go above and beyond and sometimes they don't. we have had a problem with getting our drinks refilled and getting our bill split. but it really does depend on the server. sometimes they'll say that the bill can't be split, other times it's not an issue. one thing is consistent tho - the food is always delicious!!!! i've had the crawfish, mussels, snow crab, and shrimp. their fries are pretty delicious (i usually order a basket to dip in the sauce). their \\u00e9touff\\u00e9e is also fantastic. can't go wrong here!", 
            "where do i start with this place?  i haven't found a single place that even begins to compare to the awesome seasoning this place uses.  it is hot and juicy, as the restaurant name suggests, and damn delicious. \n\nthe servers all bear a striking resemblance to suicide girls except without the attitude problem. i wish i remembered our girl's name, as she was super friendly and helpful, and even put on some gloves and demonstrated how to most efficiently peel our crawfish for the newbs at the table.\n\nordered the crawfish, shrimp, and sausage (which should definitely be combined!) all in the special hot and juicy seasoning, medium level, which combines all of their flavors and was amazing. we also went through a basket of crispy <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and added on some <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, but i don't remember what kind.\n\nas with most restaurants that serve by the pound, this place can get pricey if you're not careful, but it is so tasty you'll pull out your wallet without a second thought.", 
            "very disappointed with the crawfish in garlic sauce.  the crawfish themselves were good, but they were served in a plastic bag with probably a quart of sauce.  \n\nit's one thing to have spicy food, but when you have to put your hand into what amounts to a bag of soup to pull out the food, it's just too much.\n\ni think those who chose <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and shrimp were happy, but the hot n juicy crawfish was a big disappointment.\n\nwon't do this again and all in all, not what i would call a good experience.", 
            "shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> in their spicy hot and juicy sauce make me go back over and over. and yes, i stink for days, but who cares?!? lol", 
            "i really enjoyed hot n juicy from the time i walked in to til the time i left. my server was cute n friendly! she knew who she was dealing with because she recommended the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>! \nwhoooooooo! \nthe sauce was soooo good and spicy! so hot and tasty! i think i opened up other senses while on that food high! lol!!!\nif you're a seafoodie, this is a must try!\nhighly recommended, prices are very reasonable. email me and i will meet you there!", 
            "been here three times already, but we've always gotten take out.  it's usually very busy and parking is a pain.  for a place that is so popping i'm surprise they are in such a tight spot with parking, etc.  the food though is great.  we usually get a few pounds of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and a pound of shrimp.  i could eat the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> all by myself though lol and every time we finish eating i am left wanting more.  i had never had <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> like this until i came here.  everything is priced based on the market.  can't wait to take my parents to the one in orange county.", 
            "best seafood place i've ever been to!  go in with a plan though cause if you let your eyes order your chec can get pretty high (when ordering for a family).  my 6 yr son orders the catfish platter and he loves it.  i order the shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> with the seasoning that is a combo of all of the flavors (forget what its called).  if you take the sauce the shrimp is in and poor it over rice its sooooo good!", 
            "you have to know what you are getting when you come here.  i had the shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>.  food was as expected and sauce was on par as to how the staff described it.  i've been to the boiling crab and i would say this is better since its got more variety and this is more raw in your face good.", 
            "one of my favorite places in vegas! great quality seafood and delicious sauces and flavors! i'd highly recommend the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce with the shrimp and getting <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> with their famous hot and juicy sauce! though i'd like to think i like spicy foods it turns out the mild on both of these is spicy enough for me ! lots of kick in the best sense! me and my boyfriend usually get a pound or pound and a half of shrimp and a pound of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> but when we are really going big we do two pounds of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>! a little pricey but so worth it and such a fun date place i love picking everything apart for the meat and getting messy and licking sauce of my fingers it's a great time", 
            "after passing by this place half a dozen times and laughing at the name, i saw it recommended in fodor's, and quickly yelped it to see that  it was indeed a highly appreciated, just two dollar signs, seafood spot.  couldn't wait to go, and it was dee-licious!  \n\ni had a pound of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> in their hot and juicy sauce.  normally i would get the crawfish, but they are out of season right now, so they just had frozen available.  thankfully our server had given us a heads up that their spicy was a notch or two above most other places; i had \"mild\" and my lips were burning with the first bite.  not that i let a little thing like that slow me down.  you have to order corn and red bliss <mark>Potato</mark> by the piece, so i had one of each, and they had also absorbed the awesome hot spicy flavor from the sauce.\n\nthe weak link in this restaurant are the servers.  supposedly every server is yours, not just one.  but we found that meant asking several people for the same item before we actually got it.  happened twice to us with requests for more ketchup and more water, and we heard the table next to us say the same thing.  also, our original server placed our order incorrectly (which she acknowledged immediately) so then one member of our party had to wait 10+ minutes for her food to come out while the rest of us were eating.  and since we didn't have our \"own\" waitress, nobody gave us updates, nobody let a manager know, and we kept having to flag servers down to find out what was happening.  it definitely turned a five star rating into a four star rating.", 
            "this review is long overdue. hot n juicy is a staple among myself and my girlfriends! it is the ultimate, messy, satisfying meal.\n\nwe usually order:\n\n-<mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> (spicy medium)\n-shrimp (spicy medium)\n-add sausage and corn\n-seasoned fries\n-bud light\n\ni generally don't drink beer (the occasional amstel light when boating) but for whatever reason when eating at hot n juicy i just have to have a bud light to wash down all the flavorful, salty goodness.\n\nthree tips: \n1. yes wear the plastic gloves, if they don't give them to you, ask for them. otherwise you will wreck your manicure with all the juice and sauce. \n2. bring a hair clip (if you have long hair) \n3. wear clothes that you don't mind absorbing garlic and hnj sauce aromas. you will smell like a hnj shellfish when you leave this restaurant.\n\nmmm just writing about this makes me crave hnj now!", 
            "messy, but oh so worth it! had <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, shrimp, mozz sticks, rice and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>.  everything was amazing!",

            "really fun experience with good friends! i've never worn gloves and a bib and had my food brought to me in a bag and shared with the table. it was messy and delicious and we got cajun spices all over our beer glasses. :) \n\ni have no idea how much it cost because my buddy grabbed the bill, but we got 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 pounds of crab and 2 pounds of mussels to split between three people. it sounds like alot, but it was just enough, actually. plus it came with a little corn on the cob and a little potato for each of us. we chose the medium level of spice, which was plenty spicy for me! \n\nso this is food you have to work for. you have to tear the heads and legs off of the shrimp and peel them and you have to crack open your <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and pry the meat out. but it's worth it! the mussels required no work and were delicious. the shrimp was, ya know, shrimp. the crab was delectable - i freakin' love a good juicy piece of crab meat. :) \n\nwe felt like three ravenous animals tearing apart food with our hands and leaving a mess of shells and sea creature parts behind. awesome. \n\nmy boyfriend was not a fan of the chicken tenders he ordered; he said they were slightly worse than the kind you buy in the freezer section of the grocery store. and they didn't have bbq sauce, just ketchup and not-so-good ranch. so yeah. get the seafood.", 
            "as always hot n juicy delivers. i have been here only multiple occasions and have always enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. of course the food is what stands out. delicious fresh seafood in absolutely amazing sauces varying from mild to spicy for the more adventurous types. \n\nwhile i usually go in a group we typically start with two pounds of food and add on as we go. i have had the shrimp extra spicy hot n juicy, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> hot n juicy extra spicy. the lobster (mind you it is served whole) hot n juicy extra spicy. a few sides such as <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, the sausage and corn on the cob. \n\nyes it is a bit of work while eating to de-shell the food, but to me that's part of experience and i don't mind getting my hands dirty (also ask for gloves if you want). i highly recommend this place to seafood lovers or people who just want to have a fun time with dinner. 5/5\n\n-arnold.", 
            "first timers..we really enjoyed our meal of calamari, fried catfish and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> mild seasoning of <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>. food was served super hot. come prepared to get messy if you order the crab, served in a plastic bag and comes with a nut cracker,  pick and paper towels. towelettes served after. :)",

            "whenever we come here, we are usually never disappointed. the sauce is amazing. i wouldn't be eating seafood if their sauce wasn't included. the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and live louisiana crawfish are the best items on their list. the price is surprisingly not that bad either. we ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of crawfish with a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> and paid 27 bucks. the crab and lobster are obviously more expensive but even then its worth it. hot n juicy medium sauce is the perfect heat and flavor. there are other sauces but hot n juicy sauce is a combination of all sauces and just has a much better flavor than competitors sauce such as boiling crab. parking is a bit on the downside but they have 2 other locations in vegas with more leg room and car room if you prefer more space.", 
            "sooo good. first time eating at a hot n juicy and must say i will def be coming back. service is a bit slow, but the food makes it worth it. we ordered the hot n juicy mild seasoning on the crawfish, shrimp, and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and it was delicious. mild was a bit spicy so i wouldn't go spicier than that.", 
            "omg. this place was excellent. the food was sooooo good. however, i reeked of garlic the next 2 days. reeked! i could smell it on my fingers for crying out loud!\nno bueno.\nthat was one of only 2 things i didn't like. the other....no cocktails, just beer.\nbut moving on........\n\nthe food was delicious. i mean, my <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> were outstanding. i tasted my friends shrimp and wow. i have really been put off by shrimp lately and it was just like my <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>.....outstanding!!!!!\ni will absolutely be back.....just when i know i wont see people for at least 2 days!",

            "finally made it here and we will definitely be back. we had the cajun calamari, 1 lb of shrimp with <mark>Potato</mark> and sausage in the hot n juicy sauce spicy, and 1lb <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> in the garlic sauce. you really need to add the sausage to one of your orders. they were out of the crawfish but the shrimp in my opinion was the best deal for the price.", 
            "this location is a bit difficult haha but it's in the same plaza as bambu.\n\nit's usually crowded to be prepared to wait but wait usually isn't that long.\n\nbun opt for <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> while i got the shrimp, i believe my shrimp was about uh... $12 or $14 per lb. we also got their <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and oo they were yum. but over time, it did get salty but if i remember correctly, these fries had more of a cajun taste while boiling crab (my next review!) was more of a kick spicy taste, however bun says the exact opposite and he's more sensitive to spicy.\n\nsoda beverages were $1.25 with free refills. sad that they got my flavor wrong but were willing to change it kindly. tbh i couldn't taste to much of a difference in terms of taste between this and boiling crab haha\n\ntotal bill was about $40 with tip. \n\nwill be back!", 
            "just taking my own personal time writing this review about hot n juicy makes me want to drive over there right now and get a pound of shrimp. this place is king in terms of asian/creole style crawfish/shrimp/prawns. i think the shrimp is the better than the crawfish. the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce- spicy-  is the best tasting style imo. id recommend requesting the <mark>Potato</mark> and putting them inside the bag. the only negative things id say about this place is that dinner can be very messy and that your hands will smell, sometimes days after you eat. <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> are above average, corn is sweet, and prices are reasonable.", 
            "i finally popped my hot & juicy cherry! first time here and it was all that everyone said it was, and more! \n\ntheir idea of spicy is really spicy, i think we had ordered mild and my friends were still dying. i was fine but there was definitely a kick to it! \n\ni didn't take any pictures since we were pretty much just thrown into the fray of it all and it's quite messy! \n\ni recommend the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> for sure, and well, the crawfish, however since it was november when we went, crawfish was not in season, so they warn you that the crawfish was previously frozen and not fresh. thanks for the warning! we will ordered them anyway. fries were good, softshell crab platter was good, shrimp i think was the best of them all, next to the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>. \n\na little hard getting server's attention, but other than that, it was a fun time and delicious meal.", 
            "after reading all the reviews regarding horrible/ bad customer service, we went into the restaurant expecting the worst customer service. as soon as we walked in we were greeted and had a table ready within 5 minutes. our server( i can't recall his name) was really cool. the shrimp and the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> were amazing!!!!! we also ordered the green mussels which where good but not as good as their shrimp. this is a place were we will be going back to. we  were very impressed with everything,", 
            "we decided to stop here on our way home to california and boy are we glad we did. our server rene was awesome and because it was our first time he helped us decide what to order. we had the lobster, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, and shrimp with the hot and juicy mild sauce. not only was the flavor amazing but the atmosphere was fun. a neat little place with great food and service. thank you again!", 
            "the sauce is just amazing but you'll definitely pay for it later.  it's definitely worth the bubble guts and burps. the crawfish wasn't frozen and the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> had plenty of meat.  i would definitely skip on the etouffee but overall great meal. they serve beer to wash it all down as well.", 
            "who likes to go out and eat alone?? i do!! i go to eat out alone more than others because of my work schedule and manage to enjoy it because it's a treat to not have to cook, to have someone wait on you  making sure you're happy and last but not least you leave without having to clean any dishes. well if you're expecting to leave here satisfied and happy think again!!!! by the time i was walking to my car i felt like i shouldn't try any new places for a few months, then i realized i wouldn't like anyone else to leave with a stomachache and headache like i did so i had to come online and review with details.\n \nexactly what happened: after i ordered i was left to be ignored like if i was paying with monopoly money. apparently  my \"waitress\" seems to have had a limited energy source and giving me good customer service would've drained her too much. so when i needed limes, more salt&pepper etc.. i had to ask the waitress closest to my table. if that wasn't bad enough my fried fish tasted like it was fried with old oil and the fries were tasteless because i was hungry i just tried to eat it and not complain. then came the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and although i specifically told the waitress i didn't want them to be spicy, she said i had to choose one strength of spicy and that baby spice was very light. well light it was not, it was spicy, my lips were burning and my stomach felt punched with just one little piece of crab leg. if it had not been for another young lady that stepped up and asked what was wrong and how could she make it better i would've left feeling worse. they took the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> off the table and tab so i paid immediately. left a cash tip to the girl that was nice and made sure to leave a handwritten note on the credit card auth to the other. hopefully the manager sees it and provides better service training.\n\n that's as much as my queasy stomach allows me to write. good luck!!", 
            "i've heard a lot about this place so we tried it out! the service was good and the people that work there are really nice. however! the food wasn't all that to me! the shrimp was fair but i was highly disappointed in the quality of my <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>!!! very poor quality!  it was just a waste of time and money! i do not recommend this place. the hot n juicy sause was good though! giving 2 stars because the service was great!", 
            "hostess was nice, waiter was stoned and acted tired, annoyed, and confused when we had questions, being it was our first time there. he said look at the menu everything is on there. paid 60 for 4 <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, they tasted good, but they forgot to bring out half our order. they acted rude when we suggested they forgot half our order. corn was good, <mark>King Crab</mark> was great. next time i will stick to <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and crawfish for the value. over all the food was over priced, tasted ok, but the service was terrible. the plastic bag thing was interesting, but it was loud with no music. bathrooms were disgusting!",

            "at last count there were two hot n juicy crawfish locations in las vegas, but i have it on good authority that this is the one you want, at 4810 spring mountain road. my husband and i were steered towards this one, further away though it is, by a reliable local, which is the kind of good advice you want when choosing an off-strip, local neighborhood place. driving from the strip, you actually have to pass a hot n juicy crawfish (in chinatown) to get to the \"right\" hot n juicy crawfish.\n\nlocated on a busy multi-lane road chock-a-block with shopping centers and fast food, hot n juicy crawfish doesn't look like much from outside. or inside, for that matter -- a decent-sized space looks smaller than it is because of so many ragtag tables squeezed together, it's usually packed, it's loud, and i wouldn't exactly call it clean. you're in the middle of the desert but the vibe is carefree beachside -- the floor is a mess and most diners are wearing plastic bibs, happily covered in sauce. you order at a counter, from a menu posted on the wall overhead, and they call you when your order is ready. \n\nthough you can get baskets of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, wings and chicken nuggets, hot n juicy crawfish put their signature item right in their name. when you order the crawfish, there's a method. no \"crawfish nazis\" here -- the staff will kindly help you out if you're a first-timer. you order your crawfish by the pound, then you pick a seasoning, then you pick a spice level. for seasoning, you pick from <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> or a <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. spice levels range from mild to \"holy s@#t.\" that's not what they call it, that's what i called it. if you like spicy, you love this stuff.\n\nthe best experience is to go off-hours with a group, get an assortment of seasonings and spice levels, get some cold beers and have a blast. wear something washable, yer gonna get messy!", 
            "heard about it, watched it on man vs food, but the experience was so much better!\n\nmuch more than just crawfish, they serve lobster and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> - snow and king - on the menu.  you can customize the heat and sauce offerings.  \n\nask for tiffany - as a server, she's attentive and knows how to turn a table without rushing you.  to clarify my definition of attentive - the best servers are those who anticipate and observe.  they know when you need a refill or when a look of confusion crosses someone's face when they are looking at seafood tools like the cracker and splitter.  tiffany is one of these.  ask for her and complete a wonderful dining experience!", 
            "finally, i got to try the creme de la creme a la cajun-styled seafood: hnj! i love that crack-a-lackin seafood joints are becoming an upcoming trend. \n\nas a seafood lover, you really can't be afraid to crack-attack, and dig in for your meat. for great seafood, it is oh-so-worth it!  this style is new to the chicago area, and i have a girlfriend who can't stop raving over how much better this one is than our chicago options.\n\nback on to food.\n\noysters: we ordered a half dozen. fresh, yum, cleaned well, good sized meat.\n\nsausage: a little spicy for my liking, but still good. i don't have too high a tolerance for too much salt.\n\n<mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>: fat and juicy. good amount of meat. good crack to the shell, indicating good freshness. the meat's own sweet flavor still shone through, despite the hnj sauce we smothered it with love in.\n\nshrimp: also fat and juicy. fresh and plump, but i couldn't conquer for the life of me. between 3 girls, we ordered 1lb of crab each, and split a half pound of shrimp.  even then, too much for us, despite all of its hot and juicy glory.  it made me soooo appreciate that this spot supports a half pound of shrimp. save that cash for the pricier proteins.\n\nextra bonuses: i love that they offered gloves, to keep that seafood smell away from under your nails. the gloves aren't great, and they really mess with your dexterity, but hey. if you've got a hot date, or an outing with friends, you don't want that seafood-smelly-give-away to follow you aruond all day.\n\ndefinitely becomin my gold standard. when in vegas, i'll always have to find my way off the strip to make it to this joint. it is definitely a go-to-gem that no foodie in vegas should miss out on!", 
            "brought our parents here all craving some yummy crab and catfish. they delivered! we had 6 kiddos with us too. they placed us at a big table, explained the menu & gave us great service. its not a fancy place, casual dining, and thats one of the things we enjoyed about it. eating crab in this setting was perfect! \n\nthey also gave us a brief tutorial on how to eat crawfish (cool experiance for the kiddos too) and brought us samples of it for us all to try (kids included)\n\nfood: <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> (served whole, which means legs and body) with the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce. was over a pound, so cost more but worth it because it tasted so good. the sauce was the  bomb! level of spice we ordered was called \"baby\" (lowest on the scale) it was just spicy enough for us weaklings.\nsnow crab (<mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>) were sweet and large. our 9 year old ordered this with just butter sauce since she doesnt like hot spice. it was delicious just like that.\nthere are 4 different sauces, one of which is all 4 mixed together. my mother in law ordered that with her crab and it was  pretty tasty. \nkids got <mark>Chicken Wings Basket</mark> with fries, they were big so the little ones shared. and the father in law ordered basket of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and fried catfish. he is a harsh critic, who loved the catfish! i didnt even have a chance to taste it!\nthe only food we didnt like much was the corn fritters. too sweet and batter was not authentic. \n\nservice: great. all the waitresses there seemed on the ball and helped us out.  \n\npretty busy place, not impressive from the outside, but who cares? the crab is tasty and not too expensive. its served in a bag with all the sauce, you wear a plastic bib, even plastic gloves if you want them. the only thing that would make me happier is good beer on tap. they only serve bottles. give it a try. its yummy!", 
            "one of my absolute favorite spots in lv. the sauce is so much better than their competitors and they are always consistent. i crave hot and juicy <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> with corn at least once a month. it's life changing!!! great service too!"

            "for a long time i had been craving for some seafood and i don't mean fish and chips, or fish sticks, or long john silvers.  i mean seafood: <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, oysters, and shrimp (or how australians call it, prawns).  i never could find any place that had these items.  my withdrawals could be compared to a crack addict waiting for the next fix.\n\ni was with my cousin exploring townsquare wine walk on night a couple of weeks ago.  our expedition was only to end there, but when i'm with my cousin or cousins i always want to end it with food.  i remembered his review on hot n juicy crawfish which gave me the idea of going.  i swear, driving from townsquare to the restaurant felt like a five minute drive since i flew down the i215 and drove 60 miles per hour on the side streets.  not that it mattered since there was a thirty minute when we arrived.\n\nas always i do observe the host/hostess on how i'm greeted.  the first thing i noticed was their smile just beamed like a ray of sunshine.  was that too much?  it just seemed like they love where they work and like what they do.  peeking through the window as i waited, all i saw were <mark>Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Lobster</mark>, crabs, and <mark>Corn</mark> laid out on the table lined with off white paper cloth.  this definitely heightened my excitement.\n\nfinally, we got seated.  my cousin and i ordered a pound of shrimp, a pound of <mark>King Crab</mark>, and half dozen of oysters with four sides of corn in their hot n juicy spice mix.  as the server came with our order, it was brought in a plastic bag filled with a lot of butter and the spice mix.   i've never had food served in a plastic bag looking like a doggy bag ready to be taken home.  \n\nit's a very interactive way of dining as there was no where to place the shells, only on the table.  so in the end you get from a plastic filled shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> to a table filled with empty shrimp shells and crab shells.  it's the most fun i've had eating here.  my boyfriend just told me that this girl he knows says it was just okay.  she must've been drunk or upset about some drama that she didn't see the goodness of this place.  but whatever.\n\ni would definitely go back and eat here again and again.  the relaxed atmosphere and interactive dining is worth coming back for.  kudos to you hot n juicy crawfish for being one of the best seafood restaurants in vegas.", 
            "i've eaten at plenty of places that serve pretty much the same kind of food. but this place rocked. i normally order crawfish, but they were out of louisiana crawfish, but  they had crawfish from northern california. very smart. they had a backup plan and they succeeded. i mean these suckers were huge. mini <mark>Lobster</mark>, i'm telling you. very fresh, flavorful, and so full of meat. then the clams, they weren't overcooked. they were big, and dare i say it, juicy. yummers. shrimp. good. not overcooked, easy to peel and tasted great.  and they've got a second location, which i've been to. and you can always call to see what their inventory is. and if they don't have it earlier in the day, they definitely will by dinner time. highly highly recommended. this is the spot to go when you're in vegas. oh, by the way, i've been here at least 4 times in the past 8 months, and i live in california. this is always a stop.",

            "since returning from houston a couple of months ago, i found myself craving crawfish any chance i get.  after experiencing the crawfish craze in the westminster area of southern california, imagine my delight when i saw the sign for \"hot n juicy crawfish\" in las vegas.\n\nthe bf and i anxiously awaited the opening of this first of its kind restaurant in sin city and finally got to sit down to dinner the past sunday.  inviting a couple of newbies made the dining experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nwe started off with a pound each of the crawfish in every flavor - <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and hot n juicy combo.  at $8.99/lb, it was a dollar more than socal prices but we were okay with it.  for every two pounds you order, you get one corn and one potato.  so, we made sure we got our corn pieces and <mark>Potato</mark> and were able to choose what flavor we wanted it in.  (in the end, we ordered additional corn and potato on the side, corn runs about 50 cents each.)  we also threw an order of sausage ($2.50 for half a dozen or $4.00 for a dozen).  depending on the season, they should be offering <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, and shrimp.  you can also order oysters, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> or oyster baskets, catfish po-boy sandwich, or a basket of fries.\n\nthey didn't ask us how spicy we wanted our crawfish, later on telling us they automatically make it spicy unless otherwise stated.  the heat was a good amount, not too hot that it was unbearable and enough where we reached for our beverages.  of the four, i would say the <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> had the least flavor while the hot n juicy combo had the most.  we ordered four more pounds of the hot n juicy combo in this sitting.  the sausage was actually spicier than the crawfish!  we also found the crawfish to be pretty clean overall.  we're ones to suck up all the juices from the heads too, so they gotta be clean.  and i gotta admit, the last two pounds we had were especially good.  they do a good job on having cleaner crawfish than other places i've experienced.\n\nbe sure to get the salt and pepper mixture too.  you get a bowl of cut up limes and you squeeze all the lime juice into the little plastic cup and mix it all together.  this is usually meant for you to dip your crawfish in, but i found myself not needing it that much.\n\nservice was better too.  upon entering, they line your table up with the white plastic covering and lay out a roll of paper towels.  they also provide bibs too.  you can ask for plastic gloves, but they just get in the way.  they asked us often if we needed refills on our beverages and how we were doing overall.  (i would say this is probably because they are a new restaurant, i only hope they continue with this service in the future.)\n\nthey had a steady flow of customers this holiday weekend night.  it didn't get too busy, but they were never empty either.\n\nin conclusion, the four of us were pleased with our experience at hot n juicy crawfish.  it looks like we'll be coming back here a lot!  yay!\n\nside note: there's a 17% gratuity added for parties of six or more.\n\n(you can check out my food photos up above!)", 
            "food: 4.5 stars\nservice: 4.5 stars\nprice: 4. 5 stars\n\nthis restaurant is located in a small not-so-good looking plaza off the strip near the chinatown area. based on the reviews from yelp, we ordered one pound of shrimp $9.99, not the crawfish as people said they don't taste as good as the shrimp. we also ordered 1/2 dozen of the sausage $2.50 and a bowl of etouffee soup $6.79. the etouffee soup is like a gumbo soup, but with seafood in it. taste super good and must try! the <mark>Shrimp</mark> and the sausage came in one plastic bag. the <mark>Shrimp</mark> were yummy and juicy, but not spicy at all because we ordered it in mild. next time we would try medium. the sausage wasn't very special, so we will skip it next time. \n\nthe service was great. the waiters were very polite and attentive. they refilled our soda three times. i like the plastic bib that they passed out because you will need it if you don't want to get stains on your shirt. it's a great experience. i highly recommend it!",

            "i have to start off by saying that i may be a bit biased since i looooooooooovvvvvvveeee boiling crab. \n\nafter we landed, our first stop was to drop off our luggage at our hotel and then we jumped into a cab \"hot n' juicy please!\" this place isn't too far from the strip, a 5-10 minutes ride from where we were staying [venetian], about a $10.00 cab fare. when we arrived there were only a table or two dining which got us worried since we're used to boiling crab always being packed. as we were overlooking the menu i noticed that they serve blue moon, which deserves extra brownie points! \n\nwe ordered 2 pounds of the shrimp in their hot n' juicy sauce which is a combination of all their sauces, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and an order <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>. [fyi: you can't order half pounds here ]the food took quite a while to come out, but once we got to eating we noticed that the shrimp were wayyy over cooked. the skin and heads of the shrimp were falling off, and some pieces of shrimp were definitely too soft for my liking. we were probably only able to get through a pound-if that, of our order. but their sauce weren't too bad, definitely better than most places i've tried, but definitely doesn't live up to boiling crab's whole shabang sauce. \n\nall in all, this place isn't bad; if i'm ever in las vegas having major <mark>Shrimp</mark> cravings i wouldn't mind coming back.", 
            "i went to this place right after my flight and i loved it.  i got extra spicy crawfish and some medium <mark>Shrimp</mark>.  man, they don't lie... extra spicy is hott!  i was all red and my nose started to get runny but boy was it good.  spicy + beer = heaven.  afterburn was harsh but something about it was really addictive, kinda like crack.  i'm back in la and craving it so badly.  by the end of  the bad, i was the crawfish peeling master.  ohh the head juice after you twist the head off... yum!  oh but make sure you don't eat the junk, well i didn't, just the juice!", 
            "my sister was in town and we both wanted to try this place after seeing it on man v. food (travel channel). \n\nas we pulled into the super small parking lot, we both noticed the sign that said $1 beers on sunday and mondays!!\n\nwhat we ordered:\n\n 2 lbs of crawfish in their hot n juicy sauce medium spicy (comes w/1 corn and 1 potato)\n\n1 lb of shrimp in the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce mild spicy\n-added 1 corn and 1 potato\n\nhad a couple heineken lights and blue moons\n\nthe crawfish were a bit on the smaller side but the sauce was great. the medium spicy was a little too spicy for my sister, but perfect for me. the <mark>Shrimp</mark> were big and the sauce was good too. the corn and potato were just ok.\n\nnext time i come here, i will pass on the crawfish. i will get <mark>Shrimp</mark> for sure and probably try the <mark>Blue Crab</mark>.\n\ni hope they get some better soap in the restroom because i couldn't get the smell of the sauce off my hands until i washed them again back at the hotel. \n\ni'm glad i was just wearing tshirt and jeans because your clothes smell like the sauces when you leave the place.", 
            "for a long time i had been craving for some seafood and i don't mean fish and chips, or fish sticks, or long john silvers.  i mean seafood: <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, oysters, and shrimp (or how australians call it, prawns).  i never could find any place that had these items.  my withdrawals could be compared to a crack addict waiting for the next fix.\n\ni was with my cousin exploring townsquare wine walk on night a couple of weeks ago.  our expedition was only to end there, but when i'm with my cousin or cousins i always want to end it with food.  i remembered his review on hot n juicy crawfish which gave me the idea of going.  i swear, driving from townsquare to the restaurant felt like a five minute drive since i flew down the i215 and drove 60 miles per hour on the side streets.  not that it mattered since there was a thirty minute when we arrived.\n\nas always i do observe the host/hostess on how i'm greeted.  the first thing i noticed was their smile just beamed like a ray of sunshine.  was that too much?  it just seemed like they love where they work and like what they do.  peeking through the window as i waited, all i saw were <mark>Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Lobster</mark>, crabs, and <mark>Corn</mark> laid out on the table lined with off white paper cloth.  this definitely heightened my excitement.\n\nfinally, we got seated.  my cousin and i ordered a pound of shrimp, a pound of <mark>King Crab</mark>, and half dozen of oysters with four sides of corn in their hot n juicy spice mix.  as the server came with our order, it was brought in a plastic bag filled with a lot of butter and the spice mix.   i've never had food served in a plastic bag looking like a doggy bag ready to be taken home.  \n\nit's a very interactive way of dining as there was no where to place the shells, only on the table.  so in the end you get from a plastic filled shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> to a table filled with empty shrimp shells and crab shells.  it's the most fun i've had eating here.  my boyfriend just told me that this girl he knows says it was just okay.  she must've been drunk or upset about some drama that she didn't see the goodness of this place.  but whatever.\n\ni would definitely go back and eat here again and again.  the relaxed atmosphere and interactive dining is worth coming back for.  kudos to you hot n juicy crawfish for being one of the best seafood restaurants in vegas.", 
            "been wanting to come for a while and get this off my list. i was kinda worried as most things hyped can very well disappoint. did a uye here today and it was a ton of fun getting hot n messy with some of vegas finest eaters.\n\nbf and i got some crawfish and shrimp- both with mild hot n juicy sauce....with the hnj sauce- it's a notch up in spice than the others. a mild is more like a medium so keep that in mind if you cant do the spice. it was nicely flavored and garlicky so plan to have time to shower a few times before seeing other people! mmmm garlic. other sauces can be had with zero spice for those who can't do heat (<mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, cajun, etc).\n\nthe shellfish was very fresh. i rarely eat crawfish since the last few places i've gotten it at  it tasted like mud. it was fresh, juicy and \"clean\" (no mud) aftertaste. <mark>Shrimp</mark> were a good size and not overcooked- still succulent and had \"the snap\". we also put half a dozen andouille  <mark>Sausage</mark> in with our shrimp (meaning half a dozen slices- not individuals <mark>Sausage</mark>) which were great in the sauce. ask for some lime/lemons and salt and pepper. i find when it gets a bit too spicy, dipping the meats in lemon helps balance the hnj sauce out.\n\nfor sides i needed my rice! hahaha i swear, a filipino girl can't have <mark>Shrimp</mark> with no white rice. it was $2 for a small bowl and i can easily devastate a few bowls when i'm eating spicy...so in that sense- they are making a killing off this per scoop thing. bf wanted some <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>- pretty good, but for nearly $5 i think it's overpriced for what it is. that's where some places get ya- a la carte sides.  we also had ice teas and a blue moon. it came to nearly $50.\n\nmajor kudos to the staff for accommodating 16 peeps and keeping the service going consistently. i would die if i was eating spicy foods and drinks are neglected. so glad i didn't get a hnj sauce with a medium level!!! they keep up on drinks and kept checking in on us and i definitely appreciate attentive service. \n\nthis place was a fun experience, but definitely brings out the inner ocd where i am hoping for a bucket or a plastic bag even to appear so i can hide the shells from myself and keep the table clean. hell, i even had shrimp brains all over my arms from myself and my table mates so dont wear your finery here!  i understand though why some esteemed yelpers like teri c. are regulars as it is fresh and tasty, but since it's such a messy experience. with a need for a shower to remove the seafood garlic smell, i doubt i can do this too often. i say, what a good call for a uye though. at this point if i can be dripping shrimp juice off my face and squirting my neighbor from the head cracking, then really whats there to be shamed of in front of the yelp crew? \n\n i will come back for <mark>Shrimp</mark> again. i like crawfish time to time, but for the per pound price and naturally small body with a big heavy head it's not always worth the trouble. i can also only eat so much of the head buttery tamal/brains. i feel then the crawfish is slightly wasted since the head makes for half the animal and seems like half the reason to have them. i have a cousin who i know would love this place, so i know there will be a future trek.  i am curious about their fried softshell crab and maybe some oysters i can dip in hnj sauce. \n\ni will bring a lot of wet wipes and a change of clothes for next time.", 
            "first experience at hnj last night as part of the uye (unofficial yelp event) and i had a good time. there were a good 18 or so of us there and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. the servers were very friendly and helpful. the place was packed but the food came out really quick once it was ordered. i had blanche meet me there and neither of us were into the whole eating crawfish and messy thing so we took the easy way out and got some baskets.\ni ordered the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> basket (10pieces) for around $10.00 and a side order of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> for $4.50. blanche ordered the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> that comes with fries for $9 and change.\nthe <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> was delicious. cooked perfectly and nice size pieces of shrimp. however, at pretty much a dollar a shrimp i thought it was very overpriced.\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> i could eat every day. so good. a bit overpriced at nearly $5 for a medium size basket of fries but oh well.\nbeer was $2.50 for domestics and $3 for imports. not bad. was a little disappointed to have them run out of bud light after the first one i ordered. i usually don't like switching beers once i start drinking one but i made an exception to try a blue moon.\noverall it was a cool place and everyone else seemed to be having fun \"playing\" with their food. or maybe its \"working\" on their food because it seemed like it got difficult at times.\non a last note.. i do wish they would work on the temperature in their. i think it was cooler outside.",

(thinking) \"wtf, are you serious.  this s%$t better be good\"\n\ni gave this place a try 3 times already, and each time was horrible.  i really cant believe this place is highly rated.  i mean the best part was paying for the bill and leaving.  service sucked, food wasn't fresh, <mark>Shrimp</mark> looked like the shrimp from walmart (frozen little kind), and having lived down south in biloxi, ms the seasoning was whack!  it seemed like they just put more seasoning in the bag to hide the fact that the shrimp or crawfish taste like rubber.\n\nwhy do so many people flock to the so-called \"hole in the wall\".  i'll tell you why, its because they paid to be on tv.  \n\n\"well they wouldn't be on tv if they weren't good\" \n\nlisten up.....the detroit lions are on tv every football season.  that still doesn't mean they're good.  lol  (i can say that i was born there)\n\ngo down the road to cajun crawfish, there's no wait, service is not as slow, and the seasoning is more authentic (in my opinion).\n\nif i have offended anyone with this post, go eat there and you'll understand.  if you like it.....more power to you.",

            "mmm hot & juicy!  indeed!  i came here for a bachelorette party in the summer.  i took the bachelorette to hot & juicy as we waited for the other bridesmaids to arrive.  there was a long line of people waiting outside.  it was a thursday night.  the staff told it was a 45 minutes wait, so we decided to go cross the street and go grocery shopping.  i wanted to buy some fruits and snacks for the hotel.  by the time we got back, we were directed to our table.  i've heard such good things about this place from my girlfriends who were locals, skinny, extremely glamorous, and they can eat!   the bachelorette ordered 1 lb of shrimp with the hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce, garlic fries, and i ordered 1 lb of crawfish as well as buttered corn on the cob.   they all come out piping hot in a plastic bag.  we received a bib however,  we did not get any gloves as did some of my fellow yelpers.  i guess we didn't order enough food?  my buttered corn was completely soaked in butter and spices, it was so salty and soft.  i couldn't eat it.  i just wanted boiled corn and they said i had to be more specific.  you had to say boil corn or something.  my waiter was horrible.  he wasn't that attentive.  he gave me attitude because he had to take that corn back and gave me a different corn.  my 2nd corn was still super soft and with tons of butter.  i was super disappointed.  i love corn too!   ah, did i forget to mention that i had to ask where my corn was?  he had forgotten to place an order of the corn.  he didn't even apologize for forgetting.  he just brought out that soggy salty corn.  anyway, on to the review of the rest of the meal, it was yummy!  the crawfish was fresh.  all the shells were hard and not soft.  so that's how you would know if the crawfish is fresh or not.  the flavors of the garlic and spices were so good.  it was definitely a finger licking experience.  for the two of us, 1 lb each on <mark>Shrimp</mark> and crawfish was enough.  i don't normally eat that much shrimp, but crawfish i can eat a lot of.  i'd recommend coming to this place for the experience, maybe not so much for the corn.  it was actually kind of neat to see them serving white rice as a side dish.  next time i visit vegas, i'm definitely coming back.  we have a crawfish king in seattle and i do not like that place at all.  i'll do a review on that place later.",

            "the crawfish here were delicious. and a little warning, please trust them when they tell ya spicy means spicy. believe it or your lips would feel like they are burning.  and their secret recipe (the hot & juicy flavor) is the way to go, sooo hot and soooo juicy! =p \n\nbesides the crawfish, their <mark>Shrimp</mark> are also delicious; tender, juicy, and very flavorful as well. we did not try the <mark>King Crab</mark> leg, which looked amazing when some lady cracked those shells and pulled out a whole long strip of crab meat. holy cow, wish i could go back now and get some! \n\noh oh, and their <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are soooo sooo good. it was the first time when i did not find any soggy fries in the bunch and every single one of them was perfectly fried (crispy) and sweet! oh man...\n\nbesides the food, the service here is very friendly; they are very busy, but everybody still greet the customers with smiles and are knowledgeable with recommendations...another thumbs up. the shadiest part of my dining experience here is that they use all plastic cups for drinks and water. guess it gives you a seafood shack type of feel and most importantly, easier to clean as they can just wrap everything in the paper table cloths and throw away. maybe should consider recycling cuz that's just a lot of paper and plastic everyday? \n\nnow that i've done my let's save earth ad, allow me to highly recommend this place if you know you are a crawfish fan....a must in vegas.", 
            "i must admit i only wanted to try this place to compare it to my favorite spot in cali. after doing so, i still have my #1 favorite but this one is pretty good as well. i first ordered 1 pound of <mark>Shrimp</mark>, 1 pound of <mark>Blue Crab</mark> and one basket of catfish (pretty much my usual). i shared it of course with my sis. both shrimp and crab was made in the hot n spicy sauce mild. some of my friends got the highest spice level (cringe). the <mark>Shrimp</mark> were huge compared to what i'm use too! this was the first thing that came out and me and my sis went thru it pretty fast and since she wasn't having any of the crabs we decided to get another pound.... terrible mistake cause she got pretty full so we ended up sharing with our whole group hehe. i lucked out on the crab. both females!!! and i love the eggs so i was a happy camper :d \n\none thing and its a very little thing, the cajan fries were not very cajan. it was barely seasoned to what i'm use to... but this place is definitely great!!! make it a place to stop by if your partying in vegas for the weekend", 
            "my boyfriend and i were craving boiling crab (bc) while we were in vegas visiting his parents. so we yelped for the new boiling crab in vegas, but stumbled across hot n juicy crawfish so we decided to give it a try. good choice!! i am happy to report that this is my new favorite hot spicy cajun shrimp place to eat! there doesn't seem to be a line here to eat, which is good because i hate waiting for more than an hour for food. \n\nservice is really good here. our waitress explained everything and gave us her recommendations. and when your water is low they come and fill it rather quickly. the waiters and waitresses are usually walking around and asking how everything is. \n\ni think prices were a dollar more than bc but that's okay. totally worth it. we usually order just 2lb of shrimp (i can't even eat half) and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> to share. and we got the medium spicy <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. \n\nthe shrimp: it's so good. it's better than the shrimp at bc because the shrimp here are more plump and drenched more in sauce! sometimes at bc it's either you get small shrimp or not enough sauce. but here, it looked like everyone's bags came with lots of sauce and plump <mark>Shrimp</mark>. i think that is a win.\n\nthe <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>: hot spicy goodness in the mouth. i felt like my mouth was on fire just after a couple! i love spicy food so this was a win in my book. it doesn't look like they just sprinkle the cajun sauce on the fries, but it looks like they cook it while the fries are in the fryer because it is seriously explosion of cajun flavor in your mouth after one bite.\n\nnext time i'm in vegas, i'm going to make a stop here. it's not near the strip so if you are visiting and staying on the strip, get a rental car or taxi it over to the \"chinatown\" of vegas.", 
            "this restaurant lives up to it's name.  wow it was good.  a friend took us to this restaurant and my wife really enjoyed it.  so on our last trip to vegas, she had to go back.  it was just as good as the first time.  restaurant offers no plates that i know of, so it can get messy.  recommend any of the boiled items - we had the shrimp and crawfish and to steer away from the fried stuff (the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> was nothing special).", 
            "i have heard good things about this place for a while and have driven past both locations pretty often. however, i have never really wanted to try hot n juicy crawfish because i am kind of like a cat, lol. i don't like messy eating and if i am going to go out and pay for my food, i prefer all the work to be done for me, if you know what i mean. \n\nthe in-laws were in town and have been wanting to eat here, so we finally came here for dinner the other night. we arrived at just the right time because there were a few tables still open and we were seated right away. 10 minutes later, the restaurant was full and many people were waiting outside. we had no luck with parking. the parking lot is very small and we had to park across the street. \n\nmy husband and the in-laws ordered a variety of seafood: <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, clams, shrimp crawfish, and catfish. \n\ntheir opinions:\n- the shrimp and catfish were the best\n- the crawfish required too much work for too little meat\n- the crab was very hard to take apart\n- \"mild\" was still pretty spicy\n\ni ordered the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. i know, boring right? the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> wasn't very good. i think that the size was decent, but there was just too much breading on them. after eating 2 pieces, i didn't want anymore. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were standard, nothing special. \n\ni'm glad i tried it, but i don't think i would come back again because i didn't enjoy it too much. however, i will give this place 4 starts because my family thought it was alright and had a good time. service was friendly and attentive. we even had nice neighbors who showed us what they had ordered and commented on what tasted good.\n\njust a few tips:\n- do not wear nice clothing because juices will squirt everywhere and you will get dirty!\n-remember to take a shower and do laundry asap because you will smell like the restaurant even after you leave! skin, hair, clothes, everything!", 
            "to me i thought hot n juicy was just like boiling crab, everything tasted the same except i thought their <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> basket was delicious.\nit seems like they fried their shirmp in corn meal which gave it a tasty bite and crunch.\ni think that was the only difference and you don't have to wait an 1 1/2 hour in line like boiling crab in garden grove.\nprices i think are a little more expensive but hey they got to ship everything to vegas...\ni would come back esp. for the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>.", 
            "we came to vegas for some fun! it was saturday afternoon - so we were hungry. we had 2 pounds of crawfish, 2 of <mark>Shrimp</mark> and 1 pounds of mussel. there was something different with the sauce. \n\ncrawfish seems like overcooked - really rubby taste! u i guess that kind of spoil the taste a bit. shrimp could not go wrong. mussel was good. or maybe we got the end of the pot - sauces. i don't know. 65 bucks unsatisfied!", 
            "i had heard so much about this place, i finally met up with some friends for lunch to try it out!\ndo not come here if you are afraid of getting a little messy! i ordered a pound of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and, after a little hesitation, dug right in! i have never had crab that you had to actually crack open the shell, it was very different! i absolutely loved it. my friends ordered the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> basket, rolls, corn, and crawfish. we left the restaurant with full stomachs and smiles. :-) i would reccommend this place to anyone who likes seafood!", 
            "no star if i could. the stench of this place you won t be able to get rid of for days... the food isn't good. if it wasn't for the very hot sauce that masks any flavor you d be able to notice that there is no taste. the <mark>Shrimp</mark> were big but no taste, crawfish, and <mark>Blue Crab</mark> were no better. do your self a favor and pass!", 
            "i first went to hnj on a saturday afternoon.  although it was crowded, we got right in with no wait.  we each had a pound of crawfish with the special, which is the mix of the various flavors.  we also got it on the \"medium hot\" side.  i like stuff hot, but i have heard they can really put the heat on, so i was a little concerned about ordering it straight up hot.  we also got some <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> with french fries to share.\n\nthe crawfish is delicious, but you have to work to get them.  they have so little meat, i would recommend shelling quite a few before eating.  in subsequent trips, my wife has had the shrimp, which are of course much larger.  they have a much better pay off, but don't have the delicious heads to suck out like the crawfish do.\n\ni was surprised by how good the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> was.  it's probably the best i have had in the valley.  the coating was crunchy, but not overly thick or greasy.  and, they are large.  this was surprising and certainly welcome.  \n\nall in all, hnj lives up to its considerable hype after being featured on so many tv shows.  give it a shot.", 
            "good eating. 4lbs crawfish in the hot and juicy sauce. mild spice. wish i had ordered a notch up. came with corn and potato. also ordered 2lb <mark>Shrimp</mark>. delicious all around. extremely messy. it was nice to try something different then all the buffets i ate the previous few days. price was came out to about $60 or so. will be back when i visit once again.", 
            "i've always been a fan of hot n juicy even though i'm allergic to shellfish (nothing benadryl can't fix).  it's laid-back, service is great and the food is simple but fantastic.  it's always busy...packed with locals and tourists.  we go here a lot especially around lent.  if this location gets to crazy-busy, there's another one a few blocks away.\n\nthey have oysters, mussels, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, lobster, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, clams, <mark>Shrimp</mark>, and of course, crawfish.  with the exception of the lobster, you order shellfish by the pound.  you can pick the seasoning you want: cajun, <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> and hot n juicy.  pick your spice level: less than mild, mild, medium, spicy extra spicy.  pick your sides and appetizers.  you get a bib and you could ask for a pair of gloves because it'll get messy...you don't want to ruin your manicure, do you?  i do away with gloves since i like to lick the juices off my fingers when i eat here. \n\ni'm not a big fan of crawfish because you it's too much work and you get a teeny tiny bit of crawfish meat.  i always get less than mild <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>...either <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> or lobster.  hey, if i'm going to have an anaphylactic reaction, i might as well make it count.  \n\ndon't take your date here unless you've been together forever.  or maybe you can test-drive your date to see if he/she's down to get dirty.  the garlic smell lingers...on your breath and hands no matter how many times you brush your teeth, gargle and wash your hands.  after a day, you should be good to go.", 
            "bags and bags of crustaceans yes please!!! \n\nwe drove by this place and i'm like, \"hey!  i think i read about this place on yelp!\".  we waited for about 10 minutes on a saturday night and then got a booth.  \n\nour waitress was super helpful guiding us through the different flavors and the types of seafood.  we eventually settled on 2 pounds of crawfish and 0.5 pound of shrimp.  i think next time, 1 pound of shrimp, 1 pound crawfish and 1 pound of crab/lobster.  crawfish heads had tons of flavor but paying per pound is working against you with crawfish because it's all shell....at least <mark>Shrimp</mark> have thin shells!  \n\norder with beer, order some bread to dip into the sauce.  wear clothes that you don't like because you will stink like garlic for days to come.  i saw one table with plastic gloves on which may be a good idea....but then i think you lose a bit of the experience if you use gloves.  \n\ndo go!  this is a must do off strip experience!!!!", 
            "this place has all the quality to deserve 5- stars rating:\n\nservice- very friendly and fast respond service. called in for to-go, the server who took order remembered me over the phone and say hi to me. ordered extra rice on the spot and was ready before i even paid for the check.\n\nfood- 1ib of shrimp, clams, 6 pieces of sausage, 4 pieces of corn, mix sauce and mild spicy. everything is fresh, juicy and none of that soggy <mark>Shrimp</mark> i had in those vietnamese crabs places.", 
            "we saw an episode of man vs food for this place just before our vegas trip, so we brought the hubby here for father's day.  this location had the man vs. food banner  so we knew we were in the right place.  we had to circle to get a parking spot.  it was 90 degrees outside, but comfy inside.  we were able to snag one of the last tables. the other tables had families with kids, couples, and friends. the wait staff was all young and friendly.  we ordered a pound of shrimp in garlic sauce and a pound in the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce, mild for both.  they were nice size shrimp.  the flavor of the sauce was great and the shrimp tasted fresh.  the tables were covered with plastic and they had plastic gloves for us.   a big roll of papertowels was on the table.  it was messy.  the shrimp comes tied up in a plastic bag.  the kids got chicken nuggets and <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> with fries, which came in a little basket and they were okay.  we didn't like the etoufee with rice that we ordered.  the flavor wasn't what we were use to, but the texture and rice seemed normal.  \nmy family doesn't like the shrimp heads, so lucky me, i got them all.  i didn't eat them all, but i ate quite a few.  i didn't feel well afterwards, maybe it was the shrimp heads.  hubby and kids were fine.  i normally have a pretty iron stomach, so i would try it again.", 
            "so finger lickin' good. \n\nthe epitome of my dining experience here was not only watching myself and my friends devour the whole menu but the finale to the great dinner began at the restroom's line to wash my hands.. \n\ntwo minutes into my wait in line, the young gentlewoman in front of me helped triple confirmed how delicious this place was when i struggled to keep myself from awkwardly admiring her as she licked her fingers clean. classy woman was ~5 feet away from the restroom and probably only had to wait another minute for her turn at the sink. \n\nwell, ain't no body got time to wash your 'hot n juicy' fingers at the sink when you're here!\n\nstay classy and put your cool bib on before you get your sanitized hands on what we ordered:\n\n-as many lbs of <mark>Shrimp</mark> you can handle\n-dozens of fresh oysters\n-<mark>Sausage</mark>\n-<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\n-fried cat fish\n-calamari\n-fried <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>!\n-beers for the whole party\n\nwe also ordered the crawfish but i'm not a big fan of working so much for a little piece of meat. i did have a couple and it wasn't very impressive so it'd be my last recommendation to order. spicy here is truly spicy - you'll get the heads up before ordering as well!\n\nalso, be mindful not to ask for the 'whole-shebang' here or you'll get some hot n juicy stares from the waiters/waitresses. just kidding, you'll just get kindly reminded that you're not at boiling crab and it's crowned the \"hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>\" sauce here - could've been more saucily creative than that methinks but the taste is very up to par.", 
            "stopped by on our way home from vegas. the food was good, i actually like their sauce better than boiling crab (la). however, the waitress def could not explain the spice levels to us, they way she talked about the food made me not order as much as i normally do. she basically said the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are too hot, and to order the mild sauce because the medium is too hot for her. this was after i told her i like spicy foods. i def could of gone for the medium sauce, and i probably would of tries the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> if she didn't dissuade me from getting them. not a great way to sell your product! would of given then 4 stars but they made one of my friend <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> instead of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>, it took foreeverrrr for it to get corrected and they still handed is a bill with the <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> (their mistake). would go back but they need to work on their service.", 
            "atmosphere was great. love the fact that you can get messy and not everyone will look at you weird. the waitresses we're ok. i had the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> basket and it was yummy. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> we're so yummy but they fried my mouth but i couldn't stop eating them. \nmy husband had the craw fish and then the shrimp. i wasnt a fan of the craw fish (too much work for to little food) but the shrimp was soo good. also the corn fritters are to die for. it's definitely a place to try and not everyone is going to love.", 
            "where do i begin? i am a little lost for words for this place. unfortunately, i wasn't a fan of boiling crab, so i was looking forward to an improved experience at hot n juicy crawfish. boy, was i wrong! since i'm not a fan of peeling <mark>Shrimp</mark> and breaking off the head, i decided to order calamari. i love calamari, so i was looking forward to them; specially after a four hour drive. unfortunately, my taste buds went through an awful experience. the calamari looked pale, texture was soggy, and undercook! how in the world can you mess up something that goes in the fryer?! second, the batter had no seasoning and it tasted plain. i was so disappointed, because i really wanted to like this place. however, our waitress was very accommodating and apologized; although, it wasn't her fault. the waitress offered to comp my food and asked if i wanted to order something different. i was very pleased with her customer service, but said no after getting something raw. i was afraid of food poisoning; specially, since i'm in vegas. \n\ngreat customer service earned this place two stars and their <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>. the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> tasted fresh and it was fried all the way. in my opinion, they serve better shrimp than boiling crab. as for the seasoning, it tasted the same, so don't expect to be wowed. my sister wasn't in the mood to eat seafood, so she ordered chicken nuggets with <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. the chicken nuggets are not fresh, but frozen, and they taste like they've been in their fridge for weeks. so, parents beware when you take your children to this restaurant. also, if you're the type of person that likes to wait till everyone is served, your food will definitely get cold here. they don't bring all the entrees at the same time, but what ever comes out faster from the kitchen. i was the last one to be served, so you can only imagine how much i was looking forward to their calamari. those of you who like different type of hot sauces for your oysters, they only carry tabasco sauce. i wouldn't recommend this place, but you be the judge!", 
            "the crab is finger licking good.  we had the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> crab, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  the crab had so much flavor and spice, i really wanted some more.  the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> was also good, i loved the breading.  i also got a side of potato and corn to go with the crab but i feel like that should come with the bag of crab already since it was so small.  it was like half a corn and a really small potato.", 
            "never get enough of it! always have <mark>Shrimp</mark> hot n juicy or <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>. 5/5! <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> is delicious as well. 5/5! my friends always add a corn. i ordered lobster once. 4/5! lol i don't know how to eat it!! they said they can crack it for you. crabs are good, my friends' favorite! 5/5! <mark>Sausage</mark> are optional,  i had them sometimes. 3/5! i have been both places. my friends like it on decatur 4/5!,  but i kinda like it at valley view because it is newer, even though there is wired smells and long queue! 3/5!", 
            "first time at hot n juicy crawfish.  service was excellent. we tried a pound of <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> crawfish and a pound of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>.  both were very good although there's not a lot of meat on each crawfish and they are not easy to peel, so you are left wishing you had ordered more.  a fun and unique place to go with a group and the utter messiness of it all is mitigated with the plastic aprons and gloves that the restaurant provides.  i recommend giving it a try.", 
            "i am updating my review from the last time, added another star because customers service improved. on a weekday the place was pretty steady, the server were working as a team as well as the manager all of them went to our table to ask how we were. water is constantly being filled. food is pretty good, piping hot as a matter of fact that means it just came out fresh from the cooking pot. \nordered <mark>Shrimp</mark>, clams and crabs legs, beer. for two people that's a lot of food. we did not left any shrimp unpeeled. that's how good it was. over all food and customer service -two thumbs up and so glad we gave it another try. equals = we will be a repeat customer.",

            "it's definitely a hint or miss here.  7 out of 10 times coming here the food is really good.  there are some of those shrimp and crawfish off season, they have really small crawfish and bad <mark>Shrimp</mark>.  but more of the time it's very satisfying.  they don't do free <mark>Potato</mark>/<mark>Corn</mark> with your order per lb anymore.  it's all additional, if you want them under a dollar each. \n\nservice was great in my opinion.  you're getting your fingers all dirty, you don't want that much service.  lol  this last time we came in an hour before they closed.  there was no line.  the server took about 5 minutes to seat us, he was busy setting up tables.  we ordered 3 lbs of shrimp, 1 lb of crawfish, 3 <mark>Corn</mark>, 3 <mark>Potato</mark> all hot n' juicy mild and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>.  i have to say, their mild is way, way to spicy for us.  we should have done the baby spice.  i don't remember if being that spicy.  \n\noverall, we were all really satisfy.  happy and stuffed.", 
            "i've been here serval times before not because i'm a huge crawfish fan but it's because everyone i know is. every time before have been just good but this time i really did enjoyed everything.\n\nthis is the original hot n juicy of las vegas and has always been legit except for the parking. parking kinda sucks but that doesn't stop us or anyone else from coming. the atmosphere is great and service has gotten even better through out the years. that is all because they are staffed with fun young servers to hype the joint up which makes it a exciting experience. \n\nthe music is hip, there are tvs all around and they have plenty of seating for the amount of space they have. to keep the place cool from the hot vegas weather they have tons of ceiling fans which really keeps the resturant comfortable. the day we went was pretty chilly outside so inside it was actually pretty cold, good for the summer days but not that day. \n\nif you are not a big crawfish person like myself not to worry they have other items on the menu like <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>, shrimp, clam, calamari, catfish and nuggets with fries basket. there is also \\u00e9touff\\u00e9e which is like jambalaya and it was really really good. the oysters we ordered was so good, fresh and juicy. the <mark>Potato</mark> and corn that soak in the cajun juice is always amazing and my favorite part of the bag. with the right amount of spice and the right amount of cajun the <mark>Shrimp</mark> was delicious. the craw fish wasn't bad as well i just don't care for them. the fried calamari was battered and seasoned just right and paired with their season fries it really hits the spot. \n\ndon't forget it's always fun to eat at a place where you are required to wear a big plastic bib and gloves to fully enjoy your food. or maybe get a polaroid taken to be put up on the walls to remember a bday celebration or just to say you've eaten at a place that was featured on man vs food. but no matter what don't forget to try this place it's worth it.", 
            "hostess was nice, waiter was stoned and acted tired, annoyed, and confused when we had questions, being it was our first time there. he said look at the menu everything is on there. paid 60 for 4 <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, they tasted good, but they forgot to bring out half our order. they acted rude when we suggested they forgot half our order. corn was good, <mark>King Crab</mark> was great. next time i will stick to <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and crawfish for the value. over all the food was over priced, tasted ok, but the service was terrible. the plastic bag thing was interesting, but it was loud with no music. bathrooms were disgusting!",

            "we always get the <mark>Shrimp</mark> with <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> (spicy). the clams were very good too. the catfish does not have a lot of meat (mostly batter) and that sucks. not must of a crawfish fan but love me some clams and <mark>Shrimp</mark>.", 
            "at last count there were two hot n juicy crawfish locations in las vegas, but i have it on good authority that this is the one you want, at 4810 spring mountain road. my husband and i were steered towards this one, further away though it is, by a reliable local, which is the kind of good advice you want when choosing an off-strip, local neighborhood place. driving from the strip, you actually have to pass a hot n juicy crawfish (in chinatown) to get to the \"right\" hot n juicy crawfish.\n\nlocated on a busy multi-lane road chock-a-block with shopping centers and fast food, hot n juicy crawfish doesn't look like much from outside. or inside, for that matter -- a decent-sized space looks smaller than it is because of so many ragtag tables squeezed together, it's usually packed, it's loud, and i wouldn't exactly call it clean. you're in the middle of the desert but the vibe is carefree beachside -- the floor is a mess and most diners are wearing plastic bibs, happily covered in sauce. you order at a counter, from a menu posted on the wall overhead, and they call you when your order is ready. \n\nthough you can get baskets of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, wings and chicken nuggets, hot n juicy crawfish put their signature item right in their name. when you order the crawfish, there's a method. no \"crawfish nazis\" here -- the staff will kindly help you out if you're a first-timer. you order your crawfish by the pound, then you pick a seasoning, then you pick a spice level. for seasoning, you pick from <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> or a <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. spice levels range from mild to \"holy s@#t.\" that's not what they call it, that's what i called it. if you like spicy, you love this stuff.\n\nthe best experience is to go off-hours with a group, get an assortment of seasonings and spice levels, get some cold beers and have a blast. wear something washable, yer gonna get messy!", 
            "best crawfish in vegas and possibly the whole of us! the hot and juicy sauce med spicy was amazing! will definitely come back for more big and juicy <mark>Shrimp</mark>! wished u guys had more outlets in other states though", 
            "great experience, the service was excellent, especially michael. it's a little strange with all the plastic table cloths, food bags, and bibs. when the restroom ran out of soap and was a little nasty, they jumped on the cleaning. i really like the responsiveness of the staff. \n\nnow for the food, we had alaskan <mark>King Crab</mark>($27/lb) with garlic and butter, snow crab($18/lb) hot and spicy style, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> with <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and corn fritters. everything was good. the spicy version of hot and spicy was enough to numb my lips for the first 5 minutes. burn baby burn! we needed a few beers to quell the fires in our mouths. don't expect fine dining. the atmosphere is extremely casual with dance/club music playing throughout, basic bench and wood chair seating, aluminum siding accents, tvs spaced out on the walls, and tank top clad young ladies and t-shirt wearing men serving the tasty food in plastic bags. \n\nso, this is not a first date place, wouldn't be very impressive to a potential mate. but for the family, friends, or long-time mate, it's fun. ask for the mild versions and work up to the heat ladder. i can handle straight thai peppers and fresh serranos. so believe me when i say they can make it hot.", 
            "i've heard from a couple people that hot and juicy is better than boiling crab.  they say its more flavorful so i went with a group of friends to try it out.  i love boiling crab!  the only thing stopping me from eating it so often is the wait, and the calories!\n\nwhen i went on a tuesday night it was relatively empty.  the place looks like a boiling crab and the concept is pretty much the same.   menu is about the same too.  they have fresh oysters, the seafood boils, corn, potato, fried catfish, gumbo, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> etc.  for the four of us, we ordered 5 pounds of food.  4 pounds of shrimp in every flavor except <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, 4 <mark>Corn</mark>, and 1 pound of clams in the hot and juicy sauce. \n\nthe food came quickly...and we were ready.  this place offers gloves but i say ditch it.  they are big and bulky and get in the way and in the end, your hands get soaked in the garlicky buttery oil anyways.  the hot and juicy flavor is by far my favorite.  we went with medium and there is a spicy kick to it.  not too bad because i'm not one who can handle a whole lot of spice.  some of the shrimp were overcooked so it was crumbling when i peeled it (minus one star).  i forgot what the other flavors were but i remember peeling the shrimp in the other bags and dipping it in the hot and juicy sauce.  corn was really good too!  corn is always my favorite thing to eat at places like this so i'm glad it was sweet and juicy.\n\nthe clams were very flavorful.  they soak in the sauce way better than shrimp.  you just get less food for the money though.\n\nall in all i really like this place and will definitely come back.  i do think that they don't fully give you one pound of food.  i mean we each ate 1.25 pounds of food.  we killed everything!  and at boiling crab i usually only order 1/2 pound of shrimp with 2 <mark>Corn</mark> and am stuffed.\n\nthe sauce here is also a lot thinner.  boiling crab is thick with tons of garlic bits but this was more watery.  i personally like a thicker sauce so its easier to grab with my shrimp.  room for improvement but i would come here any day over the hour wait.", 
            "brought our parents here all craving some yummy crab and catfish. they delivered! we had 6 kiddos with us too. they placed us at a big table, explained the menu & gave us great service. its not a fancy place, casual dining, and thats one of the things we enjoyed about it. eating crab in this setting was perfect! \n\nthey also gave us a brief tutorial on how to eat crawfish (cool experiance for the kiddos too) and brought us samples of it for us all to try (kids included)\n\nfood: <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> (served whole, which means legs and body) with the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce. was over a pound, so cost more but worth it because it tasted so good. the sauce was the  bomb! level of spice we ordered was called \"baby\" (lowest on the scale) it was just spicy enough for us weaklings.\nsnow crab (<mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>) were sweet and large. our 9 year old ordered this with just butter sauce since she doesnt like hot spice. it was delicious just like that.\nthere are 4 different sauces, one of which is all 4 mixed together. my mother in law ordered that with her crab and it was  pretty tasty. \nkids got <mark>Chicken Wings Basket</mark> with fries, they were big so the little ones shared. and the father in law ordered basket of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and fried catfish. he is a harsh critic, who loved the catfish! i didnt even have a chance to taste it!\nthe only food we didnt like much was the corn fritters. too sweet and batter was not authentic. \n\nservice: great. all the waitresses there seemed on the ball and helped us out.  \n\npretty busy place, not impressive from the outside, but who cares? the crab is tasty and not too expensive. its served in a bag with all the sauce, you wear a plastic bib, even plastic gloves if you want them. the only thing that would make me happier is good beer on tap. they only serve bottles. give it a try. its yummy!"

            "let me preface this by saying that i will be forever loyal to cajun <mark>Corn</mark> on brookhurst.   however, anytime i'm craving some cajun in vegas, this would definitely be the place i would go to.  \n\ni came by with my parents when we were visiting vegas over winter break cause my dad is a seafood fanatic and loves any form of seafood.  we started with some oysters which were shucked off the shell and came with plenty of lemon and tabasco on the side.\n\nwe also had the hot n juicy shrimp with extra garlic which was fantastic, but not as spicy as i'm used to from cajun <mark>Corn</mark>.  \n\nthe crawfish was also well seasoned and had a bit more meat than i expected which was a big bonus.  \n\nmy dad had the softshell crab which came with <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> although there wasn't that much cajun seasoning on them which was a bit disappointing because the seasoning was deliciously spicy and salty.\n\nthe corn was alright, only because it somehow didn't soak up the juice as it does at cajun <mark>Corn</mark> (maybe i'm just biased)\n\nthe reason that i'm willing to give this place five stars despite a few minor preference issues is that the wait staff is great.  the waitress who took our order was fantastic, very nice and somehow managed to memorize all of the things that we ordered with modifications and had it all come out correctly.  that was impressive enough in my book considering that our ordered included different levels of spice, amounts of garlic and there was just a bunch of stuff to memorize.  \n\ni will definitely be back when the craving for cajun in vegas strikes", 
            "being from southern california where the king of crawfish restaurant resides, the boiling crab, it's hard to find another place that can dethrone it. but my wife and i had to give hot and juicy crawfish a try after seeing it on one of our favorite shows, man vs food.\n\nthe food looked absolutely delicious on the show, everything that my wife and i come to expect from this type of restaurant.  we had a basketball tournament in vegas this past weekend and made sure we made time to head over to hot and juicy.\n\nmade it there on friday afternoon around 1:30pm. i was happy to see that it wasn't so busy and were able to get seated right away. at boiling crab, the average wait time is an hour.\n\nwe ordered the following: one pound of crawfish, two pounds of shrimp and five <mark>Corn</mark> all in the special hot and juicy sauce medium spicy.\n\nthe sauce itself was not bad. it's doable but it does not compare to boiling crab's shabang sauce.  the shabang sauce is love at first bite. \n\nthe crawfish was not bad but the shrimp and corn were not very good. the body of the shrimp was fine but the shrimp heads was dry. no juice/brains to enjoy sucking on and the corn was very rubbery, sort of like eating candy corn.  my wife and i shared one corn and left 4 uneaten. normally, we could eat three each.\n\nfor those who have not tried boiling crab, you might find hot and juicy crawfish a good place to eat.  but for those who have dined at boiling crab, you will be disappointed.  \n\ni will be sending adam richman (host of man vs food) an email of my review and a recommendation that if he is ever in orange county california, to stop by boiling crab and see what he thinks.", 
            "for a long time i had been craving for some seafood and i don't mean fish and chips, or fish sticks, or long john silvers.  i mean seafood: <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, oysters, and shrimp (or how australians call it, prawns).  i never could find any place that had these items.  my withdrawals could be compared to a crack addict waiting for the next fix.\n\ni was with my cousin exploring townsquare wine walk on night a couple of weeks ago.  our expedition was only to end there, but when i'm with my cousin or cousins i always want to end it with food.  i remembered his review on hot n juicy crawfish which gave me the idea of going.  i swear, driving from townsquare to the restaurant felt like a five minute drive since i flew down the i215 and drove 60 miles per hour on the side streets.  not that it mattered since there was a thirty minute when we arrived.\n\nas always i do observe the host/hostess on how i'm greeted.  the first thing i noticed was their smile just beamed like a ray of sunshine.  was that too much?  it just seemed like they love where they work and like what they do.  peeking through the window as i waited, all i saw were <mark>Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Lobster</mark>, crabs, and <mark>Corn</mark> laid out on the table lined with off white paper cloth.  this definitely heightened my excitement.\n\nfinally, we got seated.  my cousin and i ordered a pound of shrimp, a pound of <mark>King Crab</mark>, and half dozen of oysters with four sides of corn in their hot n juicy spice mix.  as the server came with our order, it was brought in a plastic bag filled with a lot of butter and the spice mix.   i've never had food served in a plastic bag looking like a doggy bag ready to be taken home.  \n\nit's a very interactive way of dining as there was no where to place the shells, only on the table.  so in the end you get from a plastic filled shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> to a table filled with empty shrimp shells and crab shells.  it's the most fun i've had eating here.  my boyfriend just told me that this girl he knows says it was just okay.  she must've been drunk or upset about some drama that she didn't see the goodness of this place.  but whatever.\n\ni would definitely go back and eat here again and again.  the relaxed atmosphere and interactive dining is worth coming back for.  kudos to you hot n juicy crawfish for being one of the best seafood restaurants in vegas.", 
            "i have been to hot n juicy a couple times now. each time being a wonderful experience!\n\nfirst time, got 1lb crawfish, 1lb shrimp and 1lb snow crab to share amongst my boyfriend and i. ended up taking 1/2 the bag of shrimp home. \n\ni love the seasoning! its so tasty and spicy! very thick and messy! i love that they provide a bib (very much needed!)\n\nsurprisingly, i didn't care too much for crawfish. i feel like it was so much work just for a little piece of tail. the shrimp on the other hand, much more meatier and i guess i like the taste of the heads on shrimp than i did with the crawfish. the crab was da bomb as well! \n\nsecond time around, only ended up getting shrimp and snow crab again! we got the seasoning where you mix everything together! sooooo good! \n\nyou pay extra for corn, red <mark>Potato</mark> and sausage. i usually add a couple <mark>Corn</mark> and <mark>Potato</mark> to the bag.\n\nif it is busy, you will have to wait awhile. you can occupy youself by looking at the wall of poloroid pictures. trust me, even though its torture waiting to be seated and seeing all this delicious smelling food coming out, its well worth it!", 
            "i love crawfish, and seeing as how i go to boiling crab in southern ca all the time, i wanted to give this place a try.\n\nneedless to say my whole family was very disappointed. the sauce was very bland, it was not as good as home.  there was nothing significant about the sauce. it was just essentially a bag of spicy water.\n\nwe ordered 4 pounds of crawfish and 2 pounds of shrimp, 12 <mark>Sausage</mark>, 6 <mark>Corn</mark>, and 2 <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. what made me upset the most was the fact that they weighed in the corn with our shrimp (note to hot n juicy crawfish: when customers order 2 pounds of shrimp, they expect two pounds of shrimp, not .03 pounds of shrimp and the rest were corn and <mark>Sausage</mark>. those items are considered side orders, even if you do put them together in the same bag, you don't weigh them).\n\nhighly disappointed in this place! i will not be coming back.",

            "i have to say i am a bigger fan of crawdaddy's in san jose, ca than i am of this place - both the service and the food (well, the sauce) is better at crawdaddy's.\n\nwe ordered a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, two <mark>Corn</mark> and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. we ordered both the crawfish and shrimp with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce which is supposed to be a combination of all of the sauces - the crawfish came out with that sauce and luckily they made a mistake and our shrimp came out with just the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce.  i was not feeling the hot n juicy sauce - it tasted weird with the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> and whatever else was in there, it was just too much. the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> that was on the shrimp was really good though, we got medium spice and there were some nice chunks of garlic which is my favorite part :) both the shrimp and crawfish were big - no tiny suckers here which i did appreciate because when you get a tiny crawfish it's quite annoying - all that work for nothing. my favorite part is always the corn because they sit it in the bag with the shrimp and it soaks up all the juice and every bite you get the sweet corn with the spicy <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> taste - absolutely amazing i'll tell ya! i think if we never got the hot n juicy sauce i would have liked the crawfish better.\n\nthe service was okay - we got some jock looking like dude.  he was nice but we had asked for <mark>Extra Seasoning Sauce</mark> and some extra <mark>Corn</mark> - waited about 10 minutes, didn't see the guy and when we finally spotted him he was just kicking it behind the counter chatting it up with the girls. in my head i'm thinking \"come on fool!  i want my corn and <mark>Extra Seasoning Sauce</mark>! wtf you talking for?! that won't get you a good tip!\" haha.. we didn't end up getting our corn until the end of our meal along with the check - i guess we could just call that our dessert ;)\n\nthanks to mvf we came, we saw and we tried some pretty good food but i think if were in vegas again we wouldn't come back.", 
            "i wanted to celebrate my friends birthday on my day off so i decided to treat her and her fiance to some hot and juicy crawfish.  i grew up in so cal where boiling crab reigns supreme, and after moving to vegas i've had an empty void that needed filling.  i saw the man vs food episode and i've read the reviews before stepping in, so i came in excited, hungry and craving crawfish.   \n\nbetween the 3 of us this is what we ordered. dozen <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>, 2# shrimp <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> very spicy with corn and sausage, and 1# crawfish <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> medium spicy.\n\nthe only complaint about the service was that our <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, which should have been the first thing to come out, showed up on the table last.\n\n<mark>Raw Oysters</mark>- accompanied by cocktail sauce, lemons, horse radish and tabasco.  i'm a big fan of oysters and these were decent in size (comparable to hama hama), but without any accompaniments they were very bland.  oysters are suppose to taste like the sea, but these were washed so much they tasted watery and flavorless.  \n\n<mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>- breaded in a <mark>Corn</mark> crust served over a bed of french fries and accompanied by ketchup and tartar sauce.  personally i'm not a big fan of <mark>Corn</mark> breading, but i can't really hold that against the establishment and their recipe.  catfish was moist and flaky and had a hint of cayenne which perfected the \"southern\" flavor.  i actually enjoyed this the most.  \n\nshrimp <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> very spicy-  we ordered this with corn and sausage, both of which were awesome.  the corn was sweet and complimented the spice well. the sausage was spicy and tender and added a bold meaty flavor to the sauce for the shrimp.  the \"<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>\" sauce isn't as flavorful as i expected, and the \"very spicy\" here is comparable to  \"medium spicy\" at boiling crab.  but the flavor was decent and the shrimp themselves were \"okay\".  not the freshest shrimp i've ever had but they weren't rotten or anything, but what can you really expect in the middle of the desert? \n\ncrawfish <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> medium spicy-  i'm debating whether or not i should even review this item just because i should have known better than to order this when i already know that crawfish is out of season at this time.  needless to say we received a previously frozen, bland, rubbery product.  so i'm just going to comment on the sauce, which was the same on the shrimp, but this had significantly less flavor.  perhaps, more spicy=more flavor, or it could be that there wasn't sausage and corn in this bag to add to the flavor.  \n\nmaybe i'm being a bit unfair because i'm comparing this establishment to boiling crab.  however the food was decent and a better alternative to a lot of other restaurants i've been to in vegas.  if i was asked to come here again, i would, but i don't see myself craving hot and juicy crawfish like i do for boiling crab.  i guess my best advice is if you're a boiling crab fan don't expect too much out of this place.  if you're just looking to satisfy a seafood craving this would be a good supplement while you're out in the middle of the desert.", 
            "i've dined here three times so i know the drill.\n\n1. skip the crawfish and go for the shrimp. crawfish is way too much work for that tiny piece of meat! i've had the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> as well and didn't think they were worth the price.\n2. order hot n juicy sauce mild or medium. the mild used to be pretty spicy but last time i was there, it wasn't as hot. did they change their ratio of seasonings?\n3. the catfish is the bomb.com! the <mark>Corn</mark> coating was crispy and not oily at all.\n4. it gets messy but that's part of the experience. they even give you a cute little bib.\n\nwhat really impressed me was my server the last time i was there. i forget her name but she was such a sweetheart. she took the time to explain the menu to my friends and she was very patient. keep up the good work guys.", 
            "i always wanted to try crawfish \"lousiana stye\" with corn & <mark>Potato</mark>. i ordered the 1lb. bag of crawfish hot & juicy style, medium-spiced. the sauce that they coat the crawfish in is to-die for. i liked it so much i dripped my <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> in it! \ni highly recommend this place. i just wish they had one closer to me than orange county. luckily they are opening one soon in we-ho. which is just around the <mark>Corn</mark> of my beau's place!", 
            "what a fun and unique place to eat!  i had a great time here and definitely want to return the next time i travel to vegas.  i got here at about 8pm on a friday night and didn't have to wait for a table.  our waitress was very attentive and helpful.  she recommended her favs and gave great suggestions.\nthe four of us ordered 3 lbs. shrimp, 1 lb. <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, a lobster which was about 1.5 lbs. , and 4 <mark>Corn</mark>.  we all liked the shrimp the best and found it very fun to peel the shells off.  we also all liked the hot n juicy sauce the best, which was a mixture of  all their sauces.  the medium spicy level was more than enough!  i recommend dipping your seafood into the sauce after you peel it out of its shell!  yum!\ni minused one star because they were out of the <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, they also shorted us 1 corn, and the lobster took very very long to come out (i think they accidentally forgot about it until we reminded them).\nbut this was a great dinner and a great experience and also very affordable!", 
            "went here on a thursday night. i was craving fried catfish. the place was packed, so i figured that's usually a good sign of good food. i can't say i was completely wrong, but i wasn't satisfied. see, down in the bayou, we don't \"bread\" our catfish. it's more like a <mark>Corn</mark> batter.. this place's catfish was heavily breaded and wasn't what i expected after hearing so many good things about hot n juicy. not enough flavor, but at least the sapporo was good! i'm sure that the specialty here is the crawfish (which i'll have another time), but that's a different review. service was great and the girls working were full of spunk, polite and respectful.", 
            "this location is much nicer and newer than the one down the street from it.  i've never had to wait very long to be seated at this one.\n\nas far as the food goes, if you love messy finger food that comes equipped with a bib, you'll love hot and juicy. their spice is not for the faint of heart! even their mild spice has a good amount of kick. so far i've tried their shrimp, crawfish, corn fritters, and fries. you have to peel the shrimp and crawfish yourself.  it's a bit of a hassle, but it's part of the experience. \n\ndon't waste your time or money on the crawfish.  big creature, small amount of meat.  1 lb of shrimp in hot n juicy seasoning is the way to go.  \nkeep in mind that when you order by the pound, that includes the weight of the entire shrimp body, antennas, legs, and the juice. their seasoned fries are burn-your-face-off spicy, and with all the spice in the shrimp, i found it overwhelming. their corn fritters are crispy, creamy, sweet balls of <mark>Corn</mark> goodness.  they pair perfectly with the spicy shrimp.\n\nfor those who have children or unenthusiastic seafood eaters in your group, they also offer things like chicken strips and popcorn shrimp on their menu.\n\noh and unless you want your fingers to burn for hours after the meal and garlic scented fingertips for the next week, wear the gloves!", 
            "it's definitely a hint or miss here.  7 out of 10 times coming here the food is really good.  there are some of those shrimp and crawfish off season, they have really small crawfish and bad <mark>Shrimp</mark>.  but more of the time it's very satisfying.  they don't do free <mark>Potato</mark>/<mark>Corn</mark> with your order per lb anymore.  it's all additional, if you want them under a dollar each. \n\nservice was great in my opinion.  you're getting your fingers all dirty, you don't want that much service.  lol  this last time we came in an hour before they closed.  there was no line.  the server took about 5 minutes to seat us, he was busy setting up tables.  we ordered 3 lbs of shrimp, 1 lb of crawfish, 3 <mark>Corn</mark>, 3 <mark>Potato</mark> all hot n' juicy mild and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>.  i have to say, their mild is way, way to spicy for us.  we should have done the baby spice.  i don't remember if being that spicy.  \n\noverall, we were all really satisfy.  happy and stuffed.", 
            "if i could give them no stars i would give them negative stars. literally the worst service i have ever received or should i say no service. apparently our waitress was the manager which makes things worse. danielle did not check on us once. we had to flag down waitresses to order more food, had to remind them about refills, and when she same came with the coke glass she said oh you have sprite and never returned. had to ask for the check. had to ask for someone to take the check. he even held the check in the air! lol we asked who our server was and we were stuck between two tables who were getting serviced lol good food for what? never returning 100$ for nothing. every other server was so happy to help other people but not us!!! it's sucks they don't have a complaint line because we just wasted our money. \n\n\n\nsteer clear boiling crab is just around the <mark>Corn</mark>!  with real service real tables real managers.", 
            "i've heard from a couple people that hot and juicy is better than boiling crab.  they say its more flavorful so i went with a group of friends to try it out.  i love boiling crab!  the only thing stopping me from eating it so often is the wait, and the calories!\n\nwhen i went on a tuesday night it was relatively empty.  the place looks like a boiling crab and the concept is pretty much the same.   menu is about the same too.  they have fresh oysters, the seafood boils, corn, potato, fried catfish, gumbo, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> etc.  for the four of us, we ordered 5 pounds of food.  4 pounds of shrimp in every flavor except <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, 4 <mark>Corn</mark>, and 1 pound of clams in the hot and juicy sauce. \n\nthe food came quickly...and we were ready.  this place offers gloves but i say ditch it.  they are big and bulky and get in the way and in the end, your hands get soaked in the garlicky buttery oil anyways.  the hot and juicy flavor is by far my favorite.  we went with medium and there is a spicy kick to it.  not too bad because i'm not one who can handle a whole lot of spice.  some of the shrimp were overcooked so it was crumbling when i peeled it (minus one star).  i forgot what the other flavors were but i remember peeling the shrimp in the other bags and dipping it in the hot and juicy sauce.  corn was really good too!  corn is always my favorite thing to eat at places like this so i'm glad it was sweet and juicy.\n\nthe clams were very flavorful.  they soak in the sauce way better than shrimp.  you just get less food for the money though.\n\nall in all i really like this place and will definitely come back.  i do think that they don't fully give you one pound of food.  i mean we each ate 1.25 pounds of food.  we killed everything!  and at boiling crab i usually only order 1/2 pound of shrimp with 2 <mark>Corn</mark> and am stuffed.\n\nthe sauce here is also a lot thinner.  boiling crab is thick with tons of garlic bits but this was more watery.  i personally like a thicker sauce so its easier to grab with my shrimp.  room for improvement but i would come here any day over the hour wait."

            "since returning from houston a couple of months ago, i found myself craving crawfish any chance i get.  after experiencing the crawfish craze in the westminster area of southern california, imagine my delight when i saw the sign for \"hot n juicy crawfish\" in las vegas.\n\nthe bf and i anxiously awaited the opening of this first of its kind restaurant in sin city and finally got to sit down to dinner the past sunday.  inviting a couple of newbies made the dining experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nwe started off with a pound each of the crawfish in every flavor - <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and hot n juicy combo.  at $8.99/lb, it was a dollar more than socal prices but we were okay with it.  for every two pounds you order, you get one corn and one potato.  so, we made sure we got our corn pieces and <mark>Potato</mark> and were able to choose what flavor we wanted it in.  (in the end, we ordered additional corn and potato on the side, corn runs about 50 cents each.)  we also threw an order of sausage ($2.50 for half a dozen or $4.00 for a dozen).  depending on the season, they should be offering <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, and shrimp.  you can also order oysters, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> or oyster baskets, catfish po-boy sandwich, or a basket of fries.\n\nthey didn't ask us how spicy we wanted our crawfish, later on telling us they automatically make it spicy unless otherwise stated.  the heat was a good amount, not too hot that it was unbearable and enough where we reached for our beverages.  of the four, i would say the <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> had the least flavor while the hot n juicy combo had the most.  we ordered four more pounds of the hot n juicy combo in this sitting.  the sausage was actually spicier than the crawfish!  we also found the crawfish to be pretty clean overall.  we're ones to suck up all the juices from the heads too, so they gotta be clean.  and i gotta admit, the last two pounds we had were especially good.  they do a good job on having cleaner crawfish than other places i've experienced.\n\nbe sure to get the salt and pepper mixture too.  you get a bowl of cut up limes and you squeeze all the lime juice into the little plastic cup and mix it all together.  this is usually meant for you to dip your crawfish in, but i found myself not needing it that much.\n\nservice was better too.  upon entering, they line your table up with the white plastic covering and lay out a roll of paper towels.  they also provide bibs too.  you can ask for plastic gloves, but they just get in the way.  they asked us often if we needed refills on our beverages and how we were doing overall.  (i would say this is probably because they are a new restaurant, i only hope they continue with this service in the future.)\n\nthey had a steady flow of customers this holiday weekend night.  it didn't get too busy, but they were never empty either.\n\nin conclusion, the four of us were pleased with our experience at hot n juicy crawfish.  it looks like we'll be coming back here a lot!  yay!\n\nside note: there's a 17% gratuity added for parties of six or more.\n\n(you can check out my food photos up above!)", 
            "with so few choices for crawfish in vegas, hot n juicy has created quite a name for themselves.  imagine my surprise when i saw a huge \"crawfish\" sign in front of pho kim long.  now, i believe in some healthy competition and i did venture over there for some crawfish to see if they measure up.\n\nsure, the price for crawfish is now $9.99/lb when i went last week.  i'm definitely curious about the shrimp that everyone else raves about, but i can't seem to stray away from the crawfish.  the head juice is so good!  the hot n juicy flavor is so tasty and leaves me wanting more.  the big f and i always usually go for two pounds a piece, and sometimes a little more.  the shells are pretty thick right now, and dark.  so your fingers will definitely be torn up by the time you're done.  \n\nservice - it could be better.  the last few times we went, we had to ask for the limes and salt/pepper concoction.  not so fun when your friends already got their crawfish and you're just waiting for the stuff.  it takes awhile to get their attention because the staff usually congregates behind the counter and kicks it back there.  when you do get your food, they get better about coming around to see if you need refills on your beverages.  then again, i guess it depends on who your waitperson is that day.\n\ncrawfish over at pho kim long is going for $8.50/lb.  they throw in more <mark>Potato</mark>, corn, and sausage than hot n juicy, but the crawfish is not good.  it's worth the extra money to eat at this place instead.  you'll find some old or overly cooked stuff at the other place.  \n\ni would love to eat more often at this place, but all that butter must be bad for me, right?  who wants to meet up with the big f and i for some crawfish anyway?", 
            "i decided to do something off the strip for a change and we found this hole in the wall type crawfish restaurant. it was the best crawfish i had outside texas and louisiana. the decor is very simple and nothing to write home about and the sides were not quite as generous as in big d. i mean it came with few <mark>Potato</mark> and corn and we had to order extra even though we ordered a few pounds of crawfish, crabs, peeled shrimp and crab cakes.\n\nthe highlight of my day was when i had to put on the bib around my neck while i went to work with the crawfish. we were given a roundtable and all the food was placed in the middle with a nylon table covering which made the clean up process a lot easier. \nthey had different grades of seasoning and spices for the crawfish so you can specify how hot you want it.\n\ni will definitely love to go back next time i am in sin city and still up from gambling which never happens", 
            "i find it only fair to mention that i hail from the south and have had the best in boiled crawfish most of my life. i thought i would be getting the same quality since the owners are from houston. crawfish is not on par with anything from houston or any part of louisiana but since there are no alternatives in vegas, i would have to say it's the best crawfish place (and i think the only one) in town. it is listed on the best of las vegas but i've found that list to be a disappointment. \n\ni was disappointed that they charge extra for red <mark>Potato</mark> and corn on the cob. all the other patrons seem to always be amazed at seeing crawfish and that we know how to peel them and suck the heads. this just adds to my impression that people are easily impressed and amused here. prices are moderate but i still don't feel like i'm getting my money's worth due to the portion size. \n\ncrawfish is not really fresh due to the fact that we're in the mohave desert. i guess i just have a higher standard having had crawfish in new orleans and all over louisiana countless times. everyone else raves about this place i suppose because they have nothing to compare it to. i'm sure i'll be back when i have another crawfish jones but i just feel they could do better. \n\nit's always blazing hot in the restaurant no matter what time of day i've been in there. i guess they are trying to save money? \n\ndon't have enough bathrooms.", 
            "this place is not for everyone, but if you can handle ripping apart shellfish with your bare hands, you are in for an amazing treat.  i'm hesitant on such things myself, but once i managed to get past that, and get the meat out of the crawfish and muss it around in the amazing sauce, i was hooked.\n\nthe experience: it's a simple clean place.  you order some type of shellfish (crawfish, shrimp, crab), a type of sauce (i go with the hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>), and tell them what else you want thrown in... <mark>Potato</mark>, corn, sausage (i recommend all three).  a few minutes later they bring out a big plastic bag filled with the goodies and they plop it on your table.  no plate, no utensils: just rip in and enjoy.  you're going to get messy, but they provide a bib and there's paper towel rolls at each table.  make sure you do not neglect to get the sauce all over everything you put in your mouth.\n\ni recommend washing it down with an ice cold blue moon.\n\nthey do also have fish & chips, and some pretty great <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>, so you don't have to get messy to enjoy a meal here.  but then you're kind of missing out on what makes it special.\n\ni should mention that unless you like pain, you should order \"medium\".  their \"spicy\" is truly hot, and not some watered down notion of \"spicy\".  my korean relatives agree.  their \"extra spicy\" is reserved only for the completely fearless.\n\nalso, i recently have tried the snow crab -- very tasty and satisfying, with larger chunks of meat than you can get from a crawfish.  good eating!\n\nagain, if you're squeemish about this kind of thing, it might not be the place for you.  also unlikely to go over well on a first date with it's enormous garlic content.  but it is unquestionably super delicious, and if you think you can handle it, you should definitely give it a shot.", 
            "they're not kidding when they say it's spicy. being korean, my mom and sister decided to be brave and go for the spiciest crawfish, but my sister quickly regretted it and ordered a regular spiced one. haha. everything is full of flavor. i like the <mark>Potato</mark> it comes with, too. not being a fan of crawfish, i just got fish and fries. obviously, i am not the right person to come here, but my family really enjoyed this place. \n\ntip: the food is very pungent and will seep into your clothes, and the whole eating process is super messy. i didn't even eat crawfish, but my mom was eating one and accidentally flung a piece to my ear! so, dress appropriately and prepare to get messy.", 
            "my husband and i love this place!!!!  we got the crawfish, shrimp, sausage, corn and <mark>Potato</mark> in the hot and juicy seasoning/ medium heat.  yum!  we did smell like garlic for the next couple days, but it was totally worth it.  as some one else said, the corn did seem a little over cooked, but it wasn't bad enough to stop me from going and getting it again.\ni know people say there are better places in ca, but i don't happen to live in ca, so will probably not get a chance to try other places anytime soon. i love being able to support a local restaurant that is privately owned- well done hot n juicy crawfish!",

            "ok.  i'm writing this review as a seasoned crawfish eater, hitting up the og (original if you don't know slang) crawfish places in westminster....  \n\nthis place was alright.  their sauce wasn't very good, which is a major bummer, being that their crustaceans were pretty fresh.  the fries were meh.  nothing special....  maybe i've just been spoiled by places with <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and yummy house sauces....  good place to go if you're desperately craving seafood though", 
            "robyn, my future daughter-in-law had her trepidations about bringing me to hot 'n juicy crawfish... in the past few years, virtually every place she thought i would like turned out to me... just average, at best... and she heard from my youngest kids, that dad doesn't like to touch his food - which is mandatory at hot 'n juicy.\n\nwhen your pound of either <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, shrimp, or crawfish is brought out in it's plastic bag... the plastic bib and the paper towels are definitely not enough \"protection\" to prevent yourself from getting messy! in fact, i'm proud to admit after the four of us finished the 2 pounds of combos - we had the largest remnants of \"stuff\" by far of anyone dining that evening.\n\nyou'll receive a free cob of corn and a small potato with every 2 pounds of stuff ordered. but, i recommend more - just for the fact that you'll have something pretty neutral to offset the heat from the crawfish.\n\nhot 'n juicy's recommendation of how to eat crawfish is:\n 1) gently twist the head apart from the tail.\n 2) take the head and suck the juice from inside.\n 3) peel away 2 to 3 segments of shell from the tail to expose more meat.\n 4) pinch the bottom end of the tail while carefully pulling the meat out of the shell.\n\ni have a few modifications to this procedure... why would i suck on a crawfish head when i don't do it to it's bigger cousin lobster? that just.... sucks! i break off the tail from the head section and only retrieve the meat from the tail section.\n\nthe absolute best value is the shrimp...\ni treat the shrimp at hot 'n juicy like the salt & pepper shrimp that is prepared at chinese restaurants. i consume the tail section, shell and all - it's just too much work trying to de-skin the shrimp! when robyn heard that --- eww!\n\nrobyn's recommendation: order a pound of <mark>Blue Crab</mark> legs and a pound of shrimp.\n\nkevin and kathy's (my daughter) suggestion: crawfish and shrimp.\n\nmy suggestion: after a crawfish & shrimp combo... i'd go for a shrimp and shrimp...\n\nsuggestions for sides - bread rolls, <mark>Potato</mark>, <mark>Sausage</mark> are ok. corn on the cob, which is boiled along with the crawfish literally turns into cream of corn - way too soft.\n\nand... don't breathe and eat at the same time! took me a few minutes to recover from the heat going down! kevin tried some of my spicy crawfish and subsequently devloped a heat reaction - blotches of red all over his face and neck. i think for most - spicy is hot enough.\n\nrobyn was totally shocked when i gave hot 'n juicy a yelper rating of 5-stars - despite that fact that you can't avoid getting messy here and despite scrubbing down with virtually all the soap in the restroom afterwards and returning home probably needing a bath / shower... you can't help but have a pretty good time!\n\ni can't think of a more enjoyable time to spend a couple of hours people watching - customers or your dinner companions getting down n' dirty with the crawfish, or just to lower your own clean-freak inhibitions.\n\ni was wondering why this restaurant was located in the un-officially designated chinatown along spring mountain... so far as i could see that evening, there was only one waitress of asian descent... i queried our waitress whether hot 'n juicy was asian-owned - she replied that the owner was thai and resided in texas and was the second crawfish place he owned.\n\nhighly recommended by one who abhors using his dainty fingers....\n\n\ni do have one last thought though.... what exactly is the chemical reaction of flash boiling on a plastic bag? are there any chemical breakdowns of the plastic bag that the usda should be worried about?", 
            "very interesting and good new orleans style boil restaurant.  i prefer the shrimp here (heads on) over the crawfish - add some sausage, <mark>Potato</mark> and corn to the boil and all is good.\n\n1 lb. of shrimp is about $10, add some add-ins and it is around $13, good value, variety of 'boil' sauces are added in - i like the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> mild, which is still pretty hot.\n\nvery casual plastic tablecloth and paper towel joint on the west end of chinatown on spring mountain, reasonable interpretation of a louisiana crawfish/shrimp boil for las vegas - heavily frequented by louisiana ex-pats and chinatown regulars.\n\nvery good option if you like this style of cuisine and don't mind making a mess when you eat.", 
            "so i just flew into vegas tonight and pretty much headed straight here after checking into my hotel. what can i say, i was fiending. while i was a little skeptical reading some of the reviews from loyal boiling crab fans (because honestly, who doesn't love bc), i decided to give it a shot. so, let me reiterate that i have been to both boiling crab and hot n juicy, and each has their pros and cons. i personally think they stack up pretty well (and i have reviewed both).\n\npros for hot n juicy:\n\n1. wait time was less than 10 minutes for a table for 2. it was a \"slow\" night for them (monday) around 8ish but there was enough space to sit while waiting. while we were waiting, c and i searched their wall of polaroids for adam richman's...of course, he had his own frame.\n\n2. wait staff was friendly. our server amanda was excellent. she checked in with us frequently and let us know that the kitchen was closing and asked if we wanted any more food before then. after it was kind of cooled down a little (we were one of the last to leave) she came over and talked to us and we bonded over our dogs. i think that their wait staff is way nicer than bc's. they say hi as soon as you walk in the door...and they smile. who'd have thought.\n\n3. price is pretty good. after reading previous reviews, we decided to skip the crawfish, and we got 2 pounds of shrimp (with their version of bc's \"whole shabang\" sauce) with sausage (which are bigger), <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and 2 beers a piece and the total was less than $45. i saw complaints about the shrimp being overcooked, but ours was done perfectly.\n\n4. they have a full bar.\n\n\ncons for hot n juicy:\n\n1. their parking lot is tiny...fits maybe 20 cars. we had to park in the lot across the side street and walk over.\n\n2. restaurant is a lot smaller than bc. if you go on a super busy night, it might take you a bit longer to get seated. that's the main reason that we went tonight instead of on a saturday.\n\n3. you walk out of there smelling like crap. but...you would at bc too. so i guess that's not much of a con.\n\nin terms of the food...the level was about the same, although i will say this (and i hope it makes sense): while h&j was a little bit spicier, bc had more flavor to it. my friend and i both liked the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> here better than at bc. the size of the sausage (har, har, har) was bigger at h&j. beer prices were the same, which is a huge plus. you really can't beat $3 for a corona. both places have tvs, which at the time were playing the lakers game.\n\nif i was in town again, i would probably end up going back. it's no bc, but it fills the void.\n\ni'd give it 3 3/4 stars, but i round up because i'm nice.", 
            "ah, vegas. so yeah, i dined at the supremely elegant fleur de lys, downed steak at the trendy n9ne steakhouse, and ate my frites at bouchon - but nothing was quite as satisfying as rolling up my sleeves, donning a bib, and digging into a bag full of hot and juicy crawfish. \n\nafter watching the man vs. food vegas edition, we decided the trek off the strip was worth it for pounds upon pounds of seafood, all seasoned with the house signature, hot and juicy sauce.\n\nthis is interactive dining, not for the faint-hearted. we ordered several pounds of hot and juicy crawfish, hot and juicy shrimp, <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, chicken nuggets, corn& <mark>Potato</mark> and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. while extremely inexpensive and delicious, be prepared to get down and dirty. if you can dig your beer under the mounds of crawfish and shrimp shells, take a long swig because even the mild sauce had my senses in a frenzy.\n\nask for extra paper towels. 3% off your bill if you opt to pay in cash. the wait can be long but at $3 a beer, the time will pass quickly.", 
            "after seeing this place on man vs. food and multiple pictures on my friend's facebook page, i had to make a pit stop here while i was in vegas.  the crawfish was good but super duper exceptionally bodaciously spicy.  you order the crawfish by the pound and it was $9.99 a pound and get to choose the <mark>Extra Seasoning Sauce</mark>.  the specialty here is the hot and spicy, which you then get to choose mild, medium or hot.  let me tell you, even if you can eat really spicy food, choose mild because it's going to so burn going in and coming out!  i can usually handle spicy food very well but found the mild here to be really hot.  the garlic in the hot and spicy sauce really came through and made the crawfish really really good!  in fact i think this place is even better than the crawfish boil restaurants that i've been to in both new orleans and houston. \n\nwe came here on a thursday night and found it to be about half full which was to our surprise because we had heard it can be at least a 30-40 minute on weeknights and longer on weekends.  i guess we just lucked out.  3% discount if you pay in cash.  the total for the two of us came to $41 dollars with tax and tip; this included 2 pounds of crawfish, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, beer, rice and extra corn and potato.  \n\nawesomeness is achieved here and this time man won, at least until his visit with the porcelain goddess later in the evening!", 
            "been wanting to come for a while and get this off my list. i was kinda worried as most things hyped can very well disappoint. did a uye here today and it was a ton of fun getting hot n messy with some of vegas finest eaters.\n\nbf and i got some crawfish and shrimp- both with mild hot n juicy sauce....with the hnj sauce- it's a notch up in spice than the others. a mild is more like a medium so keep that in mind if you cant do the spice. it was nicely flavored and garlicky so plan to have time to shower a few times before seeing other people! mmmm garlic. other sauces can be had with zero spice for those who can't do heat (<mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, cajun, etc).\n\nthe shellfish was very fresh. i rarely eat crawfish since the last few places i've gotten it at  it tasted like mud. it was fresh, juicy and \"clean\" (no mud) aftertaste. <mark>Shrimp</mark> were a good size and not overcooked- still succulent and had \"the snap\". we also put half a dozen andouille  <mark>Sausage</mark> in with our shrimp (meaning half a dozen slices- not individuals <mark>Sausage</mark>) which were great in the sauce. ask for some lime/lemons and salt and pepper. i find when it gets a bit too spicy, dipping the meats in lemon helps balance the hnj sauce out.\n\nfor sides i needed my rice! hahaha i swear, a filipino girl can't have <mark>Shrimp</mark> with no white rice. it was $2 for a small bowl and i can easily devastate a few bowls when i'm eating spicy...so in that sense- they are making a killing off this per scoop thing. bf wanted some <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>- pretty good, but for nearly $5 i think it's overpriced for what it is. that's where some places get ya- a la carte sides.  we also had ice teas and a blue moon. it came to nearly $50.\n\nmajor kudos to the staff for accommodating 16 peeps and keeping the service going consistently. i would die if i was eating spicy foods and drinks are neglected. so glad i didn't get a hnj sauce with a medium level!!! they keep up on drinks and kept checking in on us and i definitely appreciate attentive service. \n\nthis place was a fun experience, but definitely brings out the inner ocd where i am hoping for a bucket or a plastic bag even to appear so i can hide the shells from myself and keep the table clean. hell, i even had shrimp brains all over my arms from myself and my table mates so dont wear your finery here!  i understand though why some esteemed yelpers like teri c. are regulars as it is fresh and tasty, but since it's such a messy experience. with a need for a shower to remove the seafood garlic smell, i doubt i can do this too often. i say, what a good call for a uye though. at this point if i can be dripping shrimp juice off my face and squirting my neighbor from the head cracking, then really whats there to be shamed of in front of the yelp crew? \n\n i will come back for <mark>Shrimp</mark> again. i like crawfish time to time, but for the per pound price and naturally small body with a big heavy head it's not always worth the trouble. i can also only eat so much of the head buttery tamal/brains. i feel then the crawfish is slightly wasted since the head makes for half the animal and seems like half the reason to have them. i have a cousin who i know would love this place, so i know there will be a future trek.  i am curious about their fried softshell crab and maybe some oysters i can dip in hnj sauce. \n\ni will bring a lot of wet wipes and a change of clothes for next time.", 
            "first experience at hnj last night as part of the uye (unofficial yelp event) and i had a good time. there were a good 18 or so of us there and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. the servers were very friendly and helpful. the place was packed but the food came out really quick once it was ordered. i had blanche meet me there and neither of us were into the whole eating crawfish and messy thing so we took the easy way out and got some baskets.\ni ordered the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> basket (10pieces) for around $10.00 and a side order of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> for $4.50. blanche ordered the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> that comes with fries for $9 and change.\nthe <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> was delicious. cooked perfectly and nice size pieces of shrimp. however, at pretty much a dollar a shrimp i thought it was very overpriced.\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> i could eat every day. so good. a bit overpriced at nearly $5 for a medium size basket of fries but oh well.\nbeer was $2.50 for domestics and $3 for imports. not bad. was a little disappointed to have them run out of bud light after the first one i ordered. i usually don't like switching beers once i start drinking one but i made an exception to try a blue moon.\noverall it was a cool place and everyone else seemed to be having fun \"playing\" with their food. or maybe its \"working\" on their food because it seemed like it got difficult at times.\non a last note.. i do wish they would work on the temperature in their. i think it was cooler outside.", 
            "you can definitely smell that this place serves garlic, and lots of it.  i saw this place on the travel channel and had to try it since i'm a fan of boiling crab in so. cal.  the crawfish is good, but doesn't have a lot of meat, so instead i recommend that you opt for shrimp.  as for choice of sauce, i definitely recommend the hot n' <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> - almost as good as boiling crab.  the red <mark>Potato</mark> and corn on the cob are good choices for add-ons and come right in the bag with the seafood smothered in sauce.  \nyou will use your hands to eat, and you will get dirty and possibly reek of garlic for the next few days.  so this place is a definite no for a 1st or even 2nd and 3rd date (or the day before any date).\nas for price, the bill came out to around $60 for 2 people (shrimp, crab, sides and  2 ice cold beers).\ni give this place 3.7 stars.", 
            "i have been to hot n juicy a couple times now. each time being a wonderful experience!\n\nfirst time, got 1lb crawfish, 1lb shrimp and 1lb snow crab to share amongst my boyfriend and i. ended up taking 1/2 the bag of shrimp home. \n\ni love the seasoning! its so tasty and spicy! very thick and messy! i love that they provide a bib (very much needed!)\n\nsurprisingly, i didn't care too much for crawfish. i feel like it was so much work just for a little piece of tail. the shrimp on the other hand, much more meatier and i guess i like the taste of the heads on shrimp than i did with the crawfish. the crab was da bomb as well! \n\nsecond time around, only ended up getting shrimp and snow crab again! we got the seasoning where you mix everything together! sooooo good! \n\nyou pay extra for corn, red <mark>Potato</mark> and sausage. i usually add a couple <mark>Corn</mark> and <mark>Potato</mark> to the bag.\n\nif it is busy, you will have to wait awhile. you can occupy youself by looking at the wall of poloroid pictures. trust me, even though its torture waiting to be seated and seeing all this delicious smelling food coming out, its well worth it!", 
            "yay! i finally got to have the hot-n-juicy experience.  it took years and family visiting from out of town to go.  i could never get the place to appeal to the hubby.  he was never thrilled with the idea of eating from a bag and leaving the shells on the table.  he's not big into making a mess, but me on the other hand...the dirty just makes it taste better, right?!\n\nso i went with my mom, cousin, and his wife.  i was excited because i've heard so much about this place and the yelpers can't help but to rave.  between us all we ordered the 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 pounds of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> (both <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, mild), 2 orders of calamari, a basket of chicken, and an order of fries.  \n\ni zeroed in on the seafood, i didn't take all this time to get here to eat chicken!!  my mom freaked out a bit about shrimp with heads and made me pull them off for her (this is why no crawfish...no sucking heads for us that day!)  but she did eventually get over it and was able to take of the heads herself without being grossed out.  everything tasted really good, just a bit of a kick that didn't overwhelm (enough of a kick for me, i'm a pussy when it comes to spicy).  i don't even remember how many paper towels i personally went through but i'm glad there was an unlimited number of them.\n\ni think the family enjoyed the experience, but when my mom discovered they had plastic gloves after our meal she was disappointed her hands smelt like garlic and seafood.  i just asked the waitress for some lemons for our hands then went and washed them in the bathroom...good as new.  but my dog has that super sonic smell going on and couldn't get over how yummy my hands were!\n\ni'm quite the happy fat-n-preggers girl after this experience.  baby was definitely happy with all the yummy goodness i fed her.  now that i know they have some pansy plastic gloves for the hubby i think i've got a better chance to get him to come with me for a return trip.  he's also a sucker for anywhere that serves <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. :o)",

            "if i lived in vegas, i would be a fan. it just doesn't compare to boiling crab. i ordered crawfish, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and oysters. crawfish was a little tiny. the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning wasn't bad. it had <mark>Potato</mark> at least. we added <mark>Sausage</mark> to it. it tasted weird. like turkey sausage or something. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and oysters were great!", 
            "i'm pretty sure this place always has a wait, but it wasn't too bad when we went. the smell was overwhelming and delicious as we waited for our table. i saw mainly asians, and wondered why. are these people from out of town or are they locals? anyhow, it was definitely worth our short 25 minute (instead of the 15 quoted) wait for our hot n juicy seafood. we ordered some shrimp, crab, corn and <mark>Potato</mark>. all were delicious, and our waitress was helpful in verbally assisting two crab dissecting virgins. we got through the meal happy, and with one cut on my finger, nothing too bad. i would definitely, absolutely, positively recommend this place to anyone!",

            "i was afraid that i would have to wait a few hours to get into this place.  just went here last night with a friend around 6:30pm and we were seated right away.  awesome!  but then again, there were larger groups of people who were still waiting outside, so maybe it's a good idea to come in smaller groups!  it was also labor day.\n\nwe ordered the following items:\n1 lb. of shrimp\n1 lb. of craw fish\na couple ears of corn each\n<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\n\nand we had this in the \"mild\" hot n juicy sauce.\n\nboy was it not mild.  it was super hot!  but it was so good.  the sauce was best paired with the craw fish.  the juice from the shrimp does not take as well, but if you peel the shrimp and then plunge the entire body into the sauce in the bag, then you are good to go with the awesome hot n juicy and very garlicky flavor.  you must love butter, you must love garlic, and you must be able to handle spicy.  \n\nthis place is pretty good, and comparable to boiling crab in the bay area, maybe even better in my opinion.  i have to go back and check as i've only been there once.  \n\nnot sure this would be a good date night, but i like a man who can take in some spice.  i find it very flattering!  so why not, bring your date here, see if he can pass the hot test!  you will have fun with the interactive eating, and the get down and dirty environment; bibs and all!  yum!  i'll be back here soon, once i get this garlic and seafood smell off me for awhile.  it certainly sticks to your clothes so don't bother going out after eating here!", 
            "okay, i can see why this place gets a bunch fo 4 stars.  \n\nthis was my first time eating crawfish as was it for my wife.\n\nso first off, we get there and the place is full, no waiting, just full of people enjoying their dinner.  we had stopped at another \"crawfish\" place nearby and there was litterally no one in the place.  that was the first clue that we didn't want to stay.  then we did a quick yelp and the average rating was 2.5 stars.\n\nwhile yelping the first restaurant we saw this place with an average of 4 stars.  much better, so we headed on over.\n\nlike i said, the first time we've had crawfish. \n\nthe first big plus, we were greeted and sat quickly.  the server asked if we had ever had crawfish before, and when we said \"no\", he brougt out two crawfish and showed us the process.\n\nwe ordered crawfish and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>.  both were great, but beware, the \"mild\" sauce has quite a kick to it.  we also ordered calamari and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  everything was good.\n\nnow, this is not a first date place.  but if you can find someone that will go here and  get dirty with you on the first date...marry them. :-)  half of the fun is you eat your shell fish and just toss the shells on the table.  in fact, it's so messy, they give you a bib and plastic gloves(upon request).\n\nthis place is fun, good food, decent prices and just worth the visit if you haven't had crawfish before, or just want to eat some good ol' southern crawfish, crab(blue, snow, dungenous) and catfish.", 
            "<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> comin right up!\n\ni just came back from las vegas on a quick 23 hour trip and i managed to make it out to hot n juicy in chinatown. my friends heard of it from man vs. food and i thought the pictures on yelp looked promising, so it wasn't very hard to persuade me to go. we go there a little after it opened and were welcomed very excitedly by the staff. of course, since we were there so early, we were seated right away. we ordered the calamari, two orders of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, a half-dozen <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, two pounds of the hot and juicy crawfish, one pound of the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> crawfish and three pounds of the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> crawfish (my personal favorite). \n\nthe calamari was fantastic, it wasn't overly breaded like some places do it. it comes with lemon and some marinara sauce. now i am not a fan of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, but my friends ordered two orders, i was bound to try one. not only did i try one, i tried like eleven! haha.. they were nicely seasoned and went perfectly with the ketchup. believe it or not, i would order them again. (zoinks?! lol). the <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> were so fresh it melted in my mouth. my only complaint is that i usually add a bit of soy sauce with the lemon wedge when i shoot <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> and all they had was lemon. but none the less, melts in your mouth goodness!!! the guests of honor to our luncheon were the crawfish. all the flavors that we had were very flavorful and delicious in their own right. however, the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> was my absolute favorite, and i think everyone elses' as well. mainly because we put in an order for two more pounds after killin' just the one. \n\n*btw you can order different grades of spicyness for your food, however we ordered the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> at just a mild grade of spicy juice and it was pretty intense. even to my spicy-loving thai mates that ate with me :).\n\ni only gave them 4 stars because they only served beer. i'll add that additional star once they start selling wine at least, but with fingers-crossed they'll someday have a full bar.", 
            "this was my first crawfish experience and it was pretty yum!  we had 1lb of shrimp (hot n juicy - medium spice), 1 lb of snow crab (<mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> - medium spice), 1lb of shrimp (<mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> - medium spice), and 1lb of crawfish (hot n juicy - medium spice).  also got beers and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  the lemon peper was good on the crab but not so good on the shrimp.  were told to go less spicy than normal because their spice was hotter than everyone else's, so we went medium.  really wish we had gone hotter.  we also did not shake our bags, which after reading a few reviews, could have made a big difference.  geez, aren't we smart?!?\n\non a thursday night, it was super crowded, but we got the last available table, so no wait.  service was really fast, if not overly friendly.   it seemed like we ordered and five minutes later we were opening steaming plastic bags!  food was great, incredibly messy and i thought it was a little pricey.  not sure if i would go back here, but it was definitely an experience.  i feel like i lived a little.  i also feel like i should share this little nugget:  the next morning, my bf says \"what is that smell?\"  it was us.  we smelled like garlic for a good three days. haha", 
            "the food might not be spectacular, but i was with a large group of friends and i had an awesome dining experience here. \n\nyou get a bag of seafood drenched in whatever flavor sauce you want with your level of spicyness. i definitely recommend adding corn to your bag of seafood because it soaks in the flavor and juices and it tastes so good! beware that the shrimp comes out with the heads still attached and you have to peel off the shells yourself. my friend wasn't warned and i think she was a little surprised hahah. \n\nso i tried their crawfish and the shrimp in their signature hot n juicy sauce (which is a mix of all of the sauces) and it definitely satisfied my seafood cravings. i found it so much fun to eat with your hands like a kid. you get a plastic bid and by the end of the meal, my hands were completely messy hahah so much fun! however, the smell did stick around for awhile but the experience was worth it. plus, the food came out so fast. our order was ready in less than 10 mins! awesome!\n\nwe also got some <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> to share which was a nice side to have. so come prepared to be extremely messy and eat your weight in seafood!\n\nprice wise: you pay by the pound. it ended up being around $10/lb for the shrimp and crawfish.", 
            "it's 2pm, and it's time for the only meal of the day. if you've had your fair share of buffets, i think hot n juicey is a great alternative. awesome selection of seafood, sauce with a great spicy kick, and you get to attack your food with all the barbarity you can muster.\n\nsince the four of us were starving, we ordered a portion of <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, a portion of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, a dozen oysters and 4lbs of shrimp. yeah, that's way too much food. the fries had good flavour but to me, they just took up unnecessary tummy space. the oysters were small and scrawny but still had a nice, fresh taste. the shrimp on the other hand, was impressive. they were big and filled us up fast. we went with the spicy hot n juicy sauce, and we were all feeling a little burning around our lips. very satisfying.", 
            "on our most recent trip to vegas, which was just this week, we ventured off the strip and tried hot n juicy crawfish.\n\nit was phenomenal!\n\nwe had never been here before so we were pretty unsure of what to order...the waitress was super helpful in explaining the menu to us.  \n\nwe ordered two pounds of crawfish and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> (mild, hot n juicy) with <mark>Potato</mark> and corn and a few blue moons.\nthe food was so incredible.\nso messy.\nso, so good.\n\nthe spice level was right on with what the waitress said it would be and wasn't too overwhelming.  she said even the medium is a little spicy so we went with the mild.  my lips were tingly...and i liked it!\n\nthe crawfish are a lot of work with not much payoff but it's fun...if you go expecting to get lobster-sized pieces of meat out of a crawfish, well, duh.  it's a crawfish.\n\nthe <mark>Potato</mark> were great...new <mark>Potato</mark> that soak up all the juicy sauce.  same with the corn.  \n\ni can't say enough about this place except that i wish we had found it sooner.  \n\noh...don't go in your fancy club clothes.  you'll leave smelling like garlic and seafood.  \ndo go expecting to have a good time and an enjoyable meal.\nyour palate will thank you!", 
            "first, a disclaimer: i moved here from southern california and my parents still live in orange county so i probably visit them and a crawfish joint there (boiling crab, claws, etc...) at least every month.\n\nhot n juicy has gotten better over the years with their service.  the waiters are very attentive now and you will never experience a crisis of tongue-on-fire and an-empty-drink-in-hand.  the service is consistent and commendable.\n\nhowever, what they improved in service, they still lack in taste.  let me digress for a second: the spine of any seafood-in-a-bag formula is the sauce, something that resulted from vietnamese people living in new orleans, loving crawfish, cajun spice, butter, garlic, and more garlic.  the viet crawfish craze started in houston, jumped to westminster, and spread nationwide.  hot n juicy is the las vegas response to a community that contains a sizable vietnamese population.  they caught their lucky break from appearing on the travel channel.  but they cannot be the representative for the vietnamese cajun crawfish subculture.  which brings me back to sauce: hot n juicy's most popular sauce for any seafood in a bag is far behind.  besides being too watery, it also contains too much garlic (yes, it's possible).  there is having enough garlic to highlight the flavor of the seafood (something boiling crab & claws in orange county do well) and there is suffocating the flavor with too much garlic.\n\nthere is one thing i love here, which are the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, fried to perfection with the right crisp.\n\ni'll go to hot n juicy if my vegas friends crave it; but if it was up to me, i'd ask them to work on improving the sauce, like they have with the service.", 
            "maybe i never come when it's packed but people in lv are sleeping on this place.  foreal tho.\n\nalthough i always seem to get a weird feeling in my head everytime i eat here, i always come back.  flavor, flavor, flavor!! it's so strong and tasty!  i always get 1lb of shrimp, corn on the cob, half dozen sausage, and maybe a couple <mark>Potato</mark>'s all in one flavorful juicy bag. and a side order <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>... or two.  service is alright, they're not on top of their game as opposed to the boiling crab in alhambra, ca.\n\nbeware!! after eating here, your hands, breath and clothes will smell like hot n juicy garlic for days!!  i suggest you ask for gloves and wear clothes you don't wanna wear out that night as it will begin to be smelling like your aunties house who cooks all the time. as for the breath, there's no escaping that.\n\ndon't wear a white shirt either, guaranteed there's gonna be shrimp and crawfish brains splashing everywhere.  the bib they give you is essential.", 
            "need a spicy kick to get over your hangover? well this is the place! outta all of the cajun southern places, i think this is my fav. right when i walked into the restaurant, the aroma of homey seafood spices lingers right into my nostrils like music to my ears.\n\ngot seated, ordered the usual craw fish, shrimp, and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> but the thing that i really enjoyed was the deep fried catfish with fries, it was mm mmm good salty and crispy with fish meat in the middle. towards the end of the gruesome shell tearing lies the shrimp and crawfish graveyard on the table. i poured some corona (in my mouth) for the sea critter homies, rip delicious bunch :)", 
            "flavorful, juicy, and aromatic.  it never gets boring when you're eating a pound of seafood with friends.  although it gets a little messy, i'd say it's a fun social outing to do with friends....now if you're alone, then that's a different story.  i discovered this place a few months after it opened up, and went back every 2 weeks to get it.  i was on the \"hot n juicy\" fever.  you do get a little stench of seafood delight for two days, but it's well worth it to me.  \n\ni usually order:\n- 1 lb of butter garlic shrimp with 1/2 a dozen <mark>Sausage</mark>, and a potato --- no spice, cause somehow it's still spicy. and shrimp, cause it's more meat.\n- cajun and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (cause i can never chose which one i like best)\n\nalways ask for salt, pepper, and lime for the dipping sauce.  to me, it just makes everything taste better, and save some of the lime for your hands.  it tries to remove the smell, just a little bit.",

            "las vegas is sin city for a reason; it celebrates the seven deadly sins. in vegas, your greatest weakness or vice becomes the source of all your pleasures. we were ready to give into our carnal desires and get down and dirty, indulging our voracious, gluttonous appetites. we wanted to get stuffed with something hot n juicy. \n\nhot n juicy is known for their seafood: crab (dungeness, blue, snow), shrimp, and of course, crawfish. you pick the type of seasoning (<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> or the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>) and the level of spiciness (mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy). \n\nwe ordered 2 lbs of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and 2 lbs of crawfish with <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> at medium, 2 pieces of corn, 2 red <mark>Potato</mark>, etouffee (a cajun seafood stew, similar to gumbo), and a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. eating at hot n juicy is not an elegant refine affair. it's messy work because they dump a plastic bag of whatever seafood you ordered and you're only protection is the plastic table covering and a plastic bib. you open the bag and dig in.\n\nthe crab meat was very sweet and juicy. it was perfectly cooked. i found that the spiciness of the food depended on the type of seafood because the seasoning is on the outside of the shell. the meat isn't spicy unless you soak it in the sauce first. i found the level of spiciness in the crawfish much higher because the tail meat was much smaller and there was more shell around it, unlike the crab meat where i could pull out large pieces of meat out of the shell. also i got more spicy sauce from the crawfish because i sucked crawfish heads. after a while my lips got tingly and numb from the cajun spices. \n\ni've never had crawfish whole before. i only had them de-shelled. while i love crawfish and the meat was great, i'll never have them whole like that again. the tail meat is rather tiny (i like 'em big -- size matters when it comes to these things). at the end, we looked at the mountain of shell and agreed that it was more work than it was worth. crawfish is mostly shell and i'd rather pay someone to shell them for me.\n\netouffee was a spicy rice seafood stew. i liked the flavor and the level of spice was just perfect for me. i thought the rice was a tad overcooked and mushy from just sitting in a pot all day, but in general it was enjoyable.\n\nthe boiled red <mark>Potato</mark> were much needed as a break from the relentless cajun spice. they were nice and sweet. the corn is out of season, so not as sweet and juicy as in the summer, but still tasty. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were crispy and tasty.\n\nthe final price for all of us was $30/person for three people. we gorged ourselves on great seafood and left utterly satiated. happy ending for us indeed.\n\nwhat happens in vegas, stays in vegas. but this is one of the few times where you wish you could get crabs and bring them home with you.", 
            "honestly, if i have never been to the boiling crab in san jose this would have easily been a 5 star rating for me.  i just love the atmosphere of the whole place..from the garlic smell (that follows you through your clothing for the rest of your day by the way) to the get-down-and-dirty style.  some things just taste better eating with your hands and this is one of those occasions.  seating did not take very long and our server was very friendly and helpful.  he explained the system to us and forewarned us that even mild has a kick to it since it is a cajun restaurant.  my lips were burning by the end of my meal with mild, so if you don't like spicy food, do not come here!\n\nwe ordered <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> since the <mark>Blue Crab</mark> and the <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> were out (that was upsetting).  we got it with the hot n juicy seasoning, which the server explained did not mean it was spicy, but was a combination of all the other sauces.  it comes in a plastic bag, so we put on our plastic bibs and dug in!  it was delicious...the crab was meaty and the seasoning was just right.  just thinking about the taste right now makes my mouth water.  we also ordered the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  maybe you would have better luck, but if you want my honest advice, do not order those!  they were soggy and gross.\n\nthis is a must try if you have never experienced anything like this.  i would definitely come here again.  do not wear nice clothes here if you plan to go clubbing afterwards, keep an open mind, and enjoy!",

            "not a fluke, the second time proved to be just as good as the first. i am not proud that katrina m. and i came here two days within a three day span, but it was that good.\n\nthis time we came with her family and ordered 4 pounds of shrimp in spicy <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, one pound in medium <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, one pound in extra spicy <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, one pound of spicy hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> crawfish, and one pound of spicy <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> crawfish. out of all the seasonings, their namesake is the best at the second to hottest level. their \"extra spicy\" did not deliver the scorching hot flavor i was expecting and would not make for a decent food challenge. the other two flavors were just mediocre, nothing special. we had also ordered calamari, but they are extremely salty. the sweet potato and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are cooked to a superb crispiness. ask for corn and <mark>Potato</mark> to be cooked with your seafood.\n\nyet again i could not resist the temptation and ordered a blue moon to go along with the meal. i might be completely out of the loop, but it has been a while since i have seen a restaurant offer beers for less than $5.50 a bottle. heineken, heineken light, corona, corona light, sapporo, and blue moon are the beers they offer for $3.\n\ni cannot stress enough that you should get there before 6 because the wait is nonexistent. for a party of six, half of us being present, they sat us right away. yet if another large party came and our group was not all there we would have to give up our table. they cannot be faulted for that. i understand the need to meet the demands. once we were all sat and ordered, the staff were very attentive with refilling drinks and taking our additional orders.", 
            "when you just want lots of shellfish and a casual setting you must go here. we ordered the crawfish, shrimp, and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, all great. we went with the hot and juicy, cajun, and <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauces all in mild and they were plenty spicy! it's fun to just talk and peel! it's a busy place and casual so don't expect 4 star service but the girls are nice and you can just flag someone down if you need a refill or reorder. we also ordered the calamari, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, rolls and rice. the side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> is enough for 2 to share unless you just love rice haha. the fries and calamari were ok i don't think i'd get them again. they also have fresh oysters! i'm not a huge seafood person but i still had fun and plan to go back. don't be snooty, tie on the apron, be patient and enjoy a lazy afternoon of conversation and crustaceans!", 
            "i saw a friend of mine mention hot n juicy on her facebook wall while i was in vegas and quickly googled it.  it looked exactly like the boiling crab in california and right then and there i knew i would be heading down to hot n juicy for a meal while i was in vegas.\n\nit's a seafood place were you order seafood by the pound.  you then choose what type of sauce you want your seafood brought to you in.  they have <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> etc and you can choose a level of spiciness.  you can also get items added to your seafood like sausage, corn and <mark>Potato</mark>.  \n\nthey have the regular sides like rice, fries etc.\n\nonce you place your order they bring you a bib and a few minutes later you're brought a bag of delicious juiciness with the seafood that you ordered.\n\nthis time i ordered a pound of snow crabs in <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce and a pound of shrimp in cajun sauce.  i got my order a little spicy.\n\nthey were both fantastic and at a pretty reasonable price.  the shrimp was $10 and the snow crabs were $17 per pound each.\n\nyou're guaranteed to be a mess after this meal so you might as well get down and dirty!", 
            "so hot, so juicy, so good. so this is what everyone's been raving about. \"i mean, how good can buttered-up crustaceans really be for people to wait in line for long periods of time?\" i wondered to myself as i waited in line, albeit i expected a wait for a party of 14 or so. for people who like to get their hands dirty and have an affinity for head on crustaceans, hot n juicy is 5 stars for sure. \n\nfor me, however, i don't like to get my hands dirty (especially under my fingernails), and i prefer my crustacean to be deveined and decapitated before i devour them. nevertheless, i must say i enjoyed hot n juicy. i ordered a pound of shrimp in the signature <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce, medium-level spicy. if you order two pounds or more, you get corn and <mark>Potato</mark> thrown in the bag. i wish they would include corn and <mark>Potato</mark> with one pound orders though...\n\nwith plastic gloves on and paper towels laid out in front of me, i opened the bag of shrimp and spicy steam, and grabbed a shrimp. the worst part about this experience (other than the mess) is cleaning the shrimp before eating. it takes a long time. but i guess it's good to eat slow. the best part about this hot n juicy experience is the sauce. the sauce is so tasty- savory, buttery, spicy, garlicky, etc. make sure to generously dip the meat in the sauce. the sauce is 5 stars, but the shrimp are probably worthy of 3. while some of the shrimp were plump and firm (a sign of freshness), some others were kind of mushy (a sign of age). i detest mushy shrimp!\n\nwhat would make hot n juicy perfect is if they offered complimentary bread to sop up the delicious sauce that comes with your seafood order. that would be cajun heaven right there!", 
            "after the man vs. food special at hot n juicy how can one not visit this place while in vegas. its location is in chinatown if you are visiting and staying on the strip, but the cab ride is well worth the money to try these succulent crawfish.\n\nwait time to be seated was expected for a restaurant seen on man vs. food, so don't be surprised. the hostess may even tell you to try their other restaurant down the street with \"no wait time,\" but we of course wanted the real deal. when we were finally seated, service wasn't bad at all for a busy tuesday night, food came out consistently as we ordered. which brings me to...the food!\n\ni suggest tightening that bib across your neck because once that food comes out, get ready to lick those juices around your fingers slowly running down the side of your hands because it's going to get a bit messy!\n\n<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>: the perfect balance between sweet and salty. fries came in a basket and had the right amount of juicy flavor, not dry but not drenched in oil either. a great way to start the beginning of the feast.\n\n3 lbs of <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> crawfish and 1 lb of shrimp: better than expected! crawfish come steamed in a bag drenched in their special sauce. full of flavor and deliciousness! the heads don't come with too much juice, but crawfish meat come exceptionally hefty, as do the shrimp. i actually prefer their seafood drenched in so much flavor than the fire burning crawfish we had at new orleans! spice isn't too overwhelming... i think we got the medium. get the potato and corn as they are steamed in with the crawfish too! \n\nwell worth the trip and money! we had a great time getting down and dirty with these crawfish and shrimp. i don't think i'll ever find the perfect blend of spice and flavor! this place is a definite must when visiting vegas!!", 
            "my aunt and cousin are fans of this spot and said we had to check it out!  we ordered the shrimp, crawfish, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>.  needless to say it was all devoured.  we are fans and will definitely hit this spot again when we are in town.\n\nservice was hit and miss.  greeted, check. drinks, check.  ordered food.  check.  but, when our meal was complete it took a bit too long to get our check.  then i had to walk to the register to pay my bill.",

            "holy sh*t, i love this place.!!  literally, sh*t... frankly, having this as one of my favorite digs defies common logic as i know eating here will make me sh*t like crazy later.!\n\n*note this is the same review for their new restaurant.   the only difference is layout.   the service, price, and quality of food does not diminish from one place to the other.\n\ntime spent\nonce a week @ lunch/dinner times.\n\nlayout\nhjnc seems to be a chain and, for vegas, this location is the older of the two found in chinatown.   unlike their newest store, this location has more of a \"dive-in\" look.   it's an open space look with squared tables and 2/3 half moon shaped booth seating towards the back.   \n\ni've stopped coming to this location ever since the new one opened, but i recall the very long lines to get in.   they have a couple of seats to help with the waiting inside, but those fill up quick, and so it leads to many customers sitting around randomly (sp.?) outside.\n\nalso note that ths location has limited parking.!   customers tend to park around a adjacent neighborhood or at the shopping center over (tow warning).\n\nthis issue may be gone with the new store opening...   but, garunteed - hjnc is always crowded nonetheles.^^\n\nservice\nno matter which hnjc you're at, the service is outstanding.   people are cheerful and conversational.   not only do servers ask what you need, but everyone who works there will also eventually ask what you need.\n\nfood\nthere's an arguement here on how good the food is.   as i rave about the taste, my southern friends disagree that it's better back home.^^;\n\nmy one con is the snow crab's \"freshness\" being on par with local buffet quality.   i found the shell soft and flavor off (sauce saves it).    you are basicly paying $16 a 1ib for something you can pay $24 and eat without limit at a buffet ($15 @ rio's world buffet as a local).\n\ni have alot of friends who don't like shellfish, so can recommend their sweet-<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, shrimp etouffe (sp.?), battered shrimp, and battered catfish as alternate foods...  all of which, i don't order, but highly enjoy stealing from those who do.^^\n\npricing\non average, i eat 6-8ibs of various items (crawfish, clams, snow crab) which normally run $50-$80.   i've had friends do 1-2 ibs of things and spend $20ish...  maybe that'll give you a rough idea.\n\nclosing\nhnjc will leave you with a lasting impression.  the service and welcoming you recieve there make it feel like you're eating at home with friends.   it also doesn't hurt that all the waitresses are gorgeous to boot.^^   it's as if they the catalogue of suicide girls were waitressing the establishment.!\n\ntips\n1.  sauces: please don't bother with getting anything under spicey.   the seafood just tastes bland otherwise.    extra spicey will make you cry.\n2.  wear clothes u don't care about so you don't have to wear those ridiculous looking bibs...  some people go as far as wearing hamburger helper gloves to eat.!   please save yourself the embarrassment of looking stupid.\n3.  i like to save whatever sauces is left over and pour them into one bag to go.   i know - it sounds yuck...  but the sauce is great with everything you cook.   omelletes (sp.?), over dry noodles with egg, etc.", 
            "i'm a fan for sure. there aren't that many places in vegas where you can dig into a sack of crawfish, so hot & juicy definitely sets themselves apart. \nwe had oysters, crawfish, shrimp, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and chicken fingers (for the non-seafood eater). the oysters were good, nothing special. i really enjoyed the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce on the shrimp. the crawfish were awesome - pretty spicy and we only got medium! i didn't try the chicken fingers, but i can imagine...\nprices are reasonable, service was good, atmosphere is bustling, like it should be.", 
            "you fucking own the boiling crab! haha. i had this the same week i had boiling crab and i totally noticed the difference. omg, the sauce here is amazing. i usually just order the shrimp-- sooo goood. and don't forget to order a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>!!! mmm mmm! not a fan of crawfish even though that's what the restaurant is known for. funny thing, i saw this place on man vs. food-- the owner is asian, yet the food is cajun/creole...hmm. oh wells- it's still amazing!", 
            "you're gonna have to get your hand dirty on this one!  i could eat the shrimp here all day.  go with the hot n' juicy sauce for a veritable taste explosion!  be sure to supplement whichever shellfish you get with corn or <mark>Potato</mark> they are great as well!\n\nyour food will come steamed in the sauce in a piping hot plastic bag.  gloves and bibs are around for those who need them, but that ruins the fun.  we have taken to saving the sauce and bring it home to put over rice the next day...it gets even spicier but is delicious!  this is a \"must go\" any time your in sin city!",

            "this place gets a crowd, and a big crowd at that. since the latest competition, boiling crab, migrated towards the valley from southern california we could see that the battle of the rivals are still in order. the question is, who serves the best shrimp?\n\ni'll be brutally honest that my point of view is biased because i have yet to taste the savory goodness of boiling crab. so until i have tried its savory goodnes, my critic will rest at recommending hot and juicy until further notice. \n\nbesides the raving hype that adam richman did feature hot and juicy on man v. food, i can say that the feshness and the flavor of the seafood here are just to die for. literally, you eat all the shrimp and crab you can consume until you fall face first first into a food coma (this my ideal way of leaving this earth). \n\ni love the spice and tangy flavor of their famous hot and juicy sauce. my first mistake as a first timer is underestimating their love for hot. so i got the hot flavor of the hot and juicy sauce. my mouth was literally burning with fire, and i couldn't enjoy the flavor of the sauce because the spice was taking over my taste buds. so if you are all for an inferno party in your mouth, i'd suggest the hot  hot and juicy sauce.\n\nmy personal favorite is the less than mild hot and juicy sauce with all the right flavors with just the right amount of spice that i can handle baby! (ow ow!) yes, it may not be on the menu, but there is a less than mild spice. the mild flavor still has a lot of kick in it so beware! \n\ni also love the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. if you love the tasty combination of citrus, tang, and spice, i would suggest the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. it is also the safe zone. a flavor that is sure to satisfy you if you're not sure you're ready to take the risk and commitment of spice.\n\nlastly, this joint is worthy of five stars when you throw a corn in the cob and a <mark>Potato</mark> in the plastic shake and bake bag (shake, don't bake). soak those bad boys up in that sauce baby, and call that a connection! \n\nits all about good food and experience and when you incorporate the thrill of eating off the table with no utensils or a plate (something your mother told you never to do), you're sure to bring out the dangerous and adventurous side of yourself that you didn't know existed! its a great place to take a date, especially if you want to test the daring side of them. i will be a long lived patron of hot and juicy. hat tipped to you! :)\n\n(further update when i try my boiling crab experience....)", 
            "the food is good, fun atmosphere, attentive wait staff. the wife and i tried a pound of crawfish as well as a pound of shrimp. delicious. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were crisp, the calamari a bit bland.\n\ni get it, i just don't like it. i do not enjoy working this hard to feed myself. i do not enjoy how dirty/greasy one gets. i have done this once, i'm good, never again.", 
            "de-fricken-licious. i had never tried crawfish, but i'm a big seafood lover, so i was excited to try it from what is supposedly the best. you order your seafood of choice by the pound and can find the daily market prices on a board by the kitchen. you choose your choice of seasoning and heat level. i went with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> and \"less than mild.\" even at less than mild, the spice level was making my nose run a little bit (i'll admit, i'm a wimp). service was okay. we had to ask the waitress for a refill after she passed our empty cups several times. i promise, i'm not a snob, but as a waiter myself, if a customer has to remind me for a refill, i'm not exactly doing my job. anyways, on to the food:\n\nsnow crab w/ <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>: absolutely amazing. i don't know how, but their crab was some of the most moist i've had. huge chunks were easy to pull out since the meat hadn't dried out. don't forget to dip your crab meat in whatever seasoning you have. it takes it to the next level.\n\ncrawfish w/ hot n juicy: great, but very small. the little bits of meat that you get from each crawfish wasn't very much. as a crawfish newbie, i was surprised, but now i know what i'm in for. if you're here for just crawfish, i'd get at least 2 pounds.\n\nmussels: wow. some of the best i've had. i never knew mussels could be so tender! i'm so used to having them dried out/rubbery as they're generally - and unfortunately - cooked.\n\nsides: corn! get lots of corn with your seafood of choice. shake it in the bag, so it gets coated with the seasoning and save it for whenever you're done with your seafood. it will be all sorts of juicy goodness. my only regret: not getting more. the fries and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were perfectly cooked, but beyond that, weren't anything special. especially if you're trying to eat on a budget, i'd load up on some sides with your seafood, otherwise you'll easily be spending $25+ per person to fill up.\n\nchicken nuggets: as we had a non seafood eater, he got some chicken nuggets which were pretty bad. they looked and tasted like they came from some foster farms frozen bag. however, since this place is meant for seafood, i don't hold it against the restaurant.", 
            "pretty good...for vegas.  here's my recap:  parking could be better.  not a lot of spaces.  available spaces were a little tight.  seated immediately upon entering.  the place was pretty busy.  many tables with chairs, some with booths.  some booth seating was not accessible because the neighboring table was too close.  servers were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.  menu offered crawfish, shrimp, oysters, clam, lobster, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, and snow crab.  all market prices.  seasoning choices were <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.  choice of mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy.  sides: corn, potato, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, rice, rolls, and sausage.  also, appetizers were etoufee and a large variety of fried items: calamari, hot wings, soft shell crab, catfish, shrimp, and chicken nuggets.  we ordered two pounds of boiled shrimp: one <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> medium and the other <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> medium.  bibs were served first.  the bottom of the bib folds over to make a pocket to catch debris you drop.  we also ordered a side of white rice.  the cook time seemed about right, not real fast, but not too slow either.  constant line for men's restroom.  only one person at a time.  many people waiting to get in to wash their hands after eating.  the food comes out as it is ready, not served at the same time.  i prefer this method.  the shrimp is served in a clear plastic bag and the shells are left on the table.  plastic table cloth makes for quick and easy clean up.  the shrimp was good sized, hot, and flavorful.  there was a little extra juice in the bottom of the bag which we used to dip our shrimp once peeled.  also, we ladled some on the rice for a bit of flavor.  the shrimp was head and shell on.  this requires a little work, but is the traditional way to serve, saves the kitchen a bit of time, and leads one to believe the shrimp were alive when cooked.  i lived in louisiana for many years so i know there is a difference between <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> and cajun style, but i don't know why they made the distinction here.  most patrons in vegas won't know the difference.  the difference here is that louisiana had more butter and cajun was more traditional with more spices and less brother allowing the sweet flavor of the shrimp to come through better.  the difference is almost not noticeable, but i prefer their <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>.  the rice was okay.  all in all the food was pretty good.  we really enjoyed it.  on a side note, they did not purge the shrimp.  that is, the gastrointestinal track and the poop were still in the shrimp.  vegas patrons don't know any better.  its kind of gross, but i ate anyways knowing that it won't hurt you (otherwise, the place would have been shut down a long time ago).  there were plenty of paper napkins at each table and wet wipes served at the counter and with the bill, but i would have preferred a washing station, similar to those at cravin cajun.  you get really, really messy eating boiled shrimp and that stuff is super painful if you get it in your eyes.  they do serve alcohol, but we had tap water, which was served in styrofoam cups.  the server did not ask if we wanted lemon, but she brought out a styrofoam bowl with almost two whole lemons (kind of a waste).  shrimp was $8.99 per pound and the side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> was $2.  we really enjoyed this experience and will be coming back.  i tried the crawfish on a previous visit here.  it was the best crawfish in vegas.  flavor was right, but a bit small for louisiana standards.  i love crawfish, but think the shrimp is a better deal because there is much more meat.  i really like this place, but cravin cajun is better.", 
            "this was my first crawfish experience and it was pretty yum!  we had 1lb of shrimp (hot n juicy - medium spice), 1 1lb of shrimp (<mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> - medium spice), and 1lb of crawfish (hot n juicy - medium spice).  also got beers and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.    were told to go less spicy than normal because their spice was hotter than everyone else's, so we went medium.  really wish we had gone hotter.  we also did not shake our bags, which after reading a few reviews, could have made a big difference.  geez, aren't we smart?!?it was super crowded, but we got the last available table, so no wait.  service was really fast, it seemed like we ordered and five minutes later we were opening steaming plastic bags!  food was great, incredibly messy and i thought it was a little pricey.  not sure if i would go back here, but it was definitely an experience.  i feel like i lived a little. i will come back here very soon,all my friends like it .",

            "ok, i'm not a las vegas local (even though my 2 brothers-in-law are).  so i found about hot n juicy from tv, specifically travel channel's man vs food.  knowing that this place was been made famous from this show, i came here for lunch on friday of my last vegas visit.\n\nwe met one of my brothers-in-law for lunch here, arriving in the parking lot 5 minutes before 12 noon.  even though the restaurant wasn't even open yet, there were over a dozen people waiting outside the door already!  \n\nonce the staff let the horde in, we were seated right away and given menus.  as this is an asian-owned establishment, i recommend not ordering all spicy seasoning, unless you can power through the heat.  here's what i ordered for our party of 3:\n\n1 pound of shrimp, with <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, mild spice\n1 pound of crawfish, louisana style, medium spice\n1 order of calamari\n1 order of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\n\nthe fries and calamari came out first; they were good and hot, but not exceptional.  but when the shrimp and crawfish arrived, the real feast began.  the shrimp were big, and the sauce was mild and tasty.  and while the crawfish were cooked in a \"medium\" sauce, it was plenty hot for me and my dining companions.  just be careful not to suck the sauce too quickly; it will clear up your sinuses in a hurry!\n\njust like any of these seafood boil places, be ready to get down and dirty.  they have lobster bibs and full rolls of paper towels on the tables for a reason!\n\noverall, this was one of our favorite meals in las vegas.  it's in chinatown and pretty far away from the strip, so rent a car to get here.", 
            "went here for the first time on a friday night.  we went to the location further west but there is also one closer to the freeway. i assume they are the same.  it was packed but worth the wait. we ordered shrimp, lobster, snow crab, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, corn and rounds of beer. we ordered everything medium and hot n juicy. the food was great and really messy. it was a fun experience and will go here again. just be prepared for the food to stare back at you since they leave the heads on!  also don't plan on leaving without food all over and juice squirting you in the face.", 
            "i have finally had the chance to check this place out and what a disappointment.\n\nlet me start by saying... our waiter, nick... damn. it was almost like he was fed up in being there and just didn't give a fck. once we sat down, he came and yes... threw out menus in our face, threw sugar bags down on the table, and asked us you guys want anything to drink?! daaaamn serious?!?!! why boo??!! why??! wow okay... . came back with our teas and took our orders.. that's the last time we saw his face. \n\nit took numerous attempts to get a runner, server, whoever worked there to ask for refills, which finally was able to be refilled, but with regular tea when i had raspberry. nasty... the whole time we were there... our throats were like a desert and our drinks were empty.. so damn empty,  the melted ice made a few gulps of replenishment to get us through our meals. we had to ask for gloves, we had to ask again for our pepper and  limes on the side, which our server never brought, and we even had to ask the next table to please get their server's attention for us after she was done giving them their food orders, just so we could... ask. even our tools to crack open our crabs were not the right tools, but after trying to get a server's attention. it was more tiring to wave down a server than tear apart our meals. from the frustration on the service here, i tore the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> with my own bare hands and ate like an animal. tearing it with my own straight teeth!!! grrr!!! i ended up doing the.. break the shell with my fingers and gently wiggle wiggle the meat out. several times i showed my great company that i conquered a looooong piece of crab meat ha haaaa! but then she shows off her piece, which was thicker and longer than mine!!! oh yeah?!??!!!! i had that ooo impressed face and nodded my head. we entertained each other... but never once were we checked back upon to see how we were doing or we needed anything. it was literally the worst service for a fun-filled environment. \n\ni heard their other new location has better service, but this experience makes me think twice to even want to give them my business.\n\nthe food was the only thing that made me want to give any stars to this establishment. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> was excellent in texture and taste. the shrimp, crab, and side of sausage we ordered were full of spice and with the combination of asking limes on the side to make your own sauce.. it tasted refreshing, sweet, spicy, peppery, bitter, and ended with a great bite from the acidity of the limes. don't forget to ask for those pepper and limes on the side.. makes a great impact with the flavors of the spices that were cooked in with the crab and shrimp. even if you have to hunt someone down that worked there to get it! i will note that the food deserves high remarks. however, due to the lack of service we received here, it's unfortunate to give it such a low rating. but i must speak the truth and the service here was... non-existence. damn, damn shame if you ask me. it ruined a good meal experience and for us to constantly try to get a server's attention is just bad news. we couldn't enjoy our food and it shouldn't be that way.\n\nand for that reason alone... first and last time dining here. wasn't so \"hot\" after all and that's the juicy part.", 
            "the crawfish here were delicious. and a little warning, please trust them when they tell ya spicy means spicy. believe it or your lips would feel like they are burning.  and their secret recipe (the hot & juicy flavor) is the way to go, sooo hot and soooo juicy! =p \n\nbesides the crawfish, their <mark>Shrimp</mark> are also delicious; tender, juicy, and very flavorful as well. we did not try the <mark>King Crab</mark> leg, which looked amazing when some lady cracked those shells and pulled out a whole long strip of crab meat. holy cow, wish i could go back now and get some! \n\noh oh, and their <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are soooo sooo good. it was the first time when i did not find any soggy fries in the bunch and every single one of them was perfectly fried (crispy) and sweet! oh man...\n\nbesides the food, the service here is very friendly; they are very busy, but everybody still greet the customers with smiles and are knowledgeable with recommendations...another thumbs up. the shadiest part of my dining experience here is that they use all plastic cups for drinks and water. guess it gives you a seafood shack type of feel and most importantly, easier to clean as they can just wrap everything in the paper table cloths and throw away. maybe should consider recycling cuz that's just a lot of paper and plastic everyday? \n\nnow that i've done my let's save earth ad, allow me to highly recommend this place if you know you are a crawfish fan....a must in vegas.",

            "so finger lickin' good. \n\nthe epitome of my dining experience here was not only watching myself and my friends devour the whole menu but the finale to the great dinner began at the restroom's line to wash my hands.. \n\ntwo minutes into my wait in line, the young gentlewoman in front of me helped triple confirmed how delicious this place was when i struggled to keep myself from awkwardly admiring her as she licked her fingers clean. classy woman was ~5 feet away from the restroom and probably only had to wait another minute for her turn at the sink. \n\nwell, ain't no body got time to wash your 'hot n juicy' fingers at the sink when you're here!\n\nstay classy and put your cool bib on before you get your sanitized hands on what we ordered:\n\n-as many lbs of <mark>Shrimp</mark> you can handle\n-dozens of fresh oysters\n-<mark>Sausage</mark>\n-<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\n-fried cat fish\n-calamari\n-fried <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>!\n-beers for the whole party\n\nwe also ordered the crawfish but i'm not a big fan of working so much for a little piece of meat. i did have a couple and it wasn't very impressive so it'd be my last recommendation to order. spicy here is truly spicy - you'll get the heads up before ordering as well!\n\nalso, be mindful not to ask for the 'whole-shebang' here or you'll get some hot n juicy stares from the waiters/waitresses. just kidding, you'll just get kindly reminded that you're not at boiling crab and it's crowned the \"hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>\" sauce here - could've been more saucily creative than that methinks but the taste is very up to par.", 
            "after passing by this place half a dozen times and laughing at the name, i saw it recommended in fodor's, and quickly yelped it to see that  it was indeed a highly appreciated, just two dollar signs, seafood spot.  couldn't wait to go, and it was dee-licious!  \n\ni had a pound of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> in their hot and juicy sauce.  normally i would get the crawfish, but they are out of season right now, so they just had frozen available.  thankfully our server had given us a heads up that their spicy was a notch or two above most other places; i had \"mild\" and my lips were burning with the first bite.  not that i let a little thing like that slow me down.  you have to order corn and red bliss <mark>Potato</mark> by the piece, so i had one of each, and they had also absorbed the awesome hot spicy flavor from the sauce.\n\nthe weak link in this restaurant are the servers.  supposedly every server is yours, not just one.  but we found that meant asking several people for the same item before we actually got it.  happened twice to us with requests for more ketchup and more water, and we heard the table next to us say the same thing.  also, our original server placed our order incorrectly (which she acknowledged immediately) so then one member of our party had to wait 10+ minutes for her food to come out while the rest of us were eating.  and since we didn't have our \"own\" waitress, nobody gave us updates, nobody let a manager know, and we kept having to flag servers down to find out what was happening.  it definitely turned a five star rating into a four star rating.", 
            "this is one of the most fun dining experience i've every had!\nwe arrived right before the place opened, and it was literally packed about 15 minutes after it opened for business.  \nthe is the place where table manner and dress code is optional. by the time you are done, it will be messy with sauce all over your face your hand and piles of seafood on the table. so don't dress to impress, just bring something to cover yourself. :d\ntheir ordering process is simple: just order the choice of seafood, seasoning, level of spicy and add-ons. the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning is absolutely fabulous. it's like a combination of  cajun, black pepper and lots of garlic, so you got lots of flavor in one bag. the spice level is more like those you will find in a thai restaurants, so when you pick spicy, it is really spicy. make sure you order <mark>Potato</mark> as add-ons, it well pick up all the sauces and juices in the bag and you will be in potato heaven. \nwe ordered 2lbs crawfish, 0.5lbs shrimp, extra corn and potato i<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning and spicy. with two drinks it only cost us about 26 dollars. so it not only the best taste you will find in vegas it will also be the best value in vegas.", 
            "as always hot n juicy delivers. i have been here only multiple occasions and have always enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. of course the food is what stands out. delicious fresh seafood in absolutely amazing sauces varying from mild to spicy for the more adventurous types. \n\nwhile i usually go in a group we typically start with two pounds of food and add on as we go. i have had the shrimp extra spicy hot n juicy, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> hot n juicy extra spicy. the lobster (mind you it is served whole) hot n juicy extra spicy. a few sides such as <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, the sausage and corn on the cob. \n\nyes it is a bit of work while eating to de-shell the food, but to me that's part of experience and i don't mind getting my hands dirty (also ask for gloves if you want). i highly recommend this place to seafood lovers or people who just want to have a fun time with dinner. 5/5\n\n-arnold.", 
            "i loves me a good seafood boil. mainly a crab and shrimp boil. i've never eaten a boil at a restaurant but want reserved because this particular place is well known by many. in our boil, <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, whole dungeness, prawns, <mark>Potato</mark> and corn with the sauce that has a mixture of all the sauces. ooohh yes! perfect. my one and only issue...not complaint, was i wish they would've took the helmet of of the <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>. i.could've enjoyed it more", 
            "the crab is finger licking good.  we had the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> crab, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  the crab had so much flavor and spice, i really wanted some more.  the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> was also good, i loved the breading.  i also got a side of potato and corn to go with the crab but i feel like that should come with the bag of crab already since it was so small.  it was like half a corn and a really small potato.", 
            "went to hnj near decataur for lunch on may29, 2014.  coming from hawaii, we don't get to visit as often as we would like, plus there are so many other eateries in lv that we like to try.  we last ate at this location maybe two years ago - they didn't have fresh dunganess crab or crawfish at that time, so we hadn't gone back since, but after trying the fare at other 'crab' restaurants and not being 'thrilled', we decided it was time to go back to hnj (we've only been to this location on two previous visits and have never tried the other location down the road in central c-town).\ni guess you can say that my wife and i are crab people - we love to eat good shellfish and don't mind getting 'up to our elbows' while digging-in, shelling, peeling and devouring good/fresh crab or lobster and now fresh crawfish.  we lucked out on this visit - they had fresh live dunganess crab and crawfish.  so in our excitement with this good news, we ordered one dunganess crab (approx. 1.5#); one pound of snow crab (legs cluster); one pound of crawfish; and one pound of clams - all this prepared in their own 'hot n juicy' sauce, medium hot.  add to that two <mark>Potato</mark> and two corn and one <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>.  talk about plenty of food for two people!?  our server was joie - all the servers carry some type of 'walkie-talkie' equipment and can call the kitchen to weigh the individual dunganess crab and let you know right there how heavy your crab is, because everything is sold by the pound.  joie was super helpful; not only in answering our questions and taking our order, but throughout the entire meal - she would continuously come by our table to see how we were doing and if we needed any more drinks or whatever.\nwife ordered a coke and i ordered a beer - they were at our table in a jiff which was great since the outside temp was in the high nineties.  in good time, they brought each order out in double plastic bags - steaming and super hot.  this was my first experience at eating fresh crawfish and after this, i don't think that i can go back to any of that frozen stuff - totally different in texture and taste.  i would definitely order that again.  my wife kept on commenting how everything was so fresh, meaty and tasty, even the snow crab was solid and sweet.  as you probably have read in earlier reviews, there are no dishes or eating utensils, other than those plier-type crab-crackers and plastic shuckers.  also, they provide plastic bibs and gloves, but if you don't like eating with your hands and getting crab juice on your arms and face, this may not be for you.  definitely not a 'prom date' restaurant, but they provide plenty of paper towels and handi-wipes to address this messy, barbaric and fun experience. for us on this visit the food was definitely five stars.\nbut i must add, what made the experience here even more super was the positive atmosphere and overall vibe in this restaurant.  there was another female server and one male server - and i can't help but observe people when i'm out dining.  they both were like our server joie - super polite (not condescending), always cheery, helping out each other and trying their best to make your hnj meal a great experience - great food and great service.  we've been to too many restaurants where you have one and not the other; and for us on this day hnj was tops.", 
            "i was in vegas with some buddies this past weekend and made it out to hot n juicy.  i got a pound of snow crab, pound of shrimp, corn, and <mark>Potato</mark> in the hot n juicy medium sauce.  everything is fairly priced and cooked to perfection.  the sauce is super tasty.  i don't think you can ask for much more.  ditch the strip and get out to this gem.", 
            "never get enough of it! always have <mark>Shrimp</mark> hot n juicy or <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>. 5/5! <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> is delicious as well. 5/5! my friends always add a corn. i ordered lobster once. 4/5! lol i don't know how to eat it!! they said they can crack it for you. crabs are good, my friends' favorite! 5/5! <mark>Sausage</mark> are optional,  i had them sometimes. 3/5! i have been both places. my friends like it on decatur 4/5!,  but i kinda like it at valley view because it is newer, even though there is wired smells and long queue! 3/5!", 
            "omg so many coworker and even my hairstyle told me about this place! so i finally decided to go on a friday after work. i loved it!! i don't want to sound like a total fatty but i was in heaven the whole time focused on my bag of crab!  the moment you open the bag of yummiest this amazing aroma hits you in your face, and you will just like i knew, it was about to go down!everything was amazing. i ordered the snow crab with the  spicy hot and juicy seasoning; i was told it was the best and most popular, so of course i wanted to try that one first. the extras were very favorable with the hot and juicy seasoning and  is highly recommended,  <mark>Potato</mark>(.60 cent), sausage(1/2 dozen 2.45) and corn( i believe .75) . i now know  any other sides or anything extra aren't needed. i ordered a side of butter( which is a dollar extra) and didn't even touch it. \n\nalso important: the customer service was great! everyone was so nice and smiled with their service. huge plus for me! last comment, i suggest that whenever you go don't come all dressed up because although this meal is  incredible it can also be very messy, which is the reason for the commentary bid and gloves that are given. all im saying is don't come to this place thinking you'll be going somewhere nice after because you will be leaving smelling like hot and juicy, and maybe a little sauce on your clothes.\n\ni really hope your experience is as enjoyable as my experience!", 
            "the only time i eat a pound plus of food is when i come here! my favorite thing to get is the one pound bag of shrimp, <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> flavor, extra spicy. i've tried the other different flavorings but this is by far my favorite. they also have clams, oysters, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, french fries, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, rice, chicken nuggets (for your non-seafood loving friends that tag along), crawfish and other fixings. \n\nin my opinion, this location by decatur, is better than the one off of valley view or off eastern.\n\nif you've never been here before, be prepared to use your hands and get messy. my \"system\" is to lay a couple sheets of paper towels underneath the bag of shrimp to absorb any stray sauce drippings so it doesn't drip off the table and into my lap. i also have my orange soda with a straw within drinking distance so i don't have to grab the styrofoam cup and get sauce all over it. after i put my plastic bib on, i put lemon juice on my fingers and wipe them off, then put the gloves on. after i'm done eating, i put more lemon juice on my fingers to help remove the smell of skrrrimps and seasoning and then wash my hands. \n\nanyway, the food is really good. everything is tasty. service is always pretty decent. whenever i need my fix, i come here!", 
            "finally made it here and we will definitely be back. we had the cajun calamari, 1 lb of shrimp with <mark>Potato</mark> and sausage in the hot n juicy sauce spicy, and 1lb <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> in the garlic sauce. you really need to add the sausage to one of your orders. they were out of the crawfish but the shrimp in my opinion was the best deal for the price.", 
            "first, i've never seen so much wasted food packaging in my life! i'm smiling when saying that humorously, but it's true!!! styrofoam cups. styrofoam bowls. plastic bags. paper napkins. plastic table cloth. \n\nthings to note- if you just got your nails did and are craving your seafood boil fix, never fear. ask for plastic gloves. my mom brings her own dishwashing gloves to crawfish boils, but they will provide you some plastic ones upon request. \n\ntook yelper advice and got half a pound of shrimp. shrimp were slightly overcooked. after you peel it, dunk it around in the sauce so it can get more flavor on it! sauces are nice. \n\nwe also got the fried cajun calamari, and it's really not good... just generic fried frozen calamari that is overly tough. don't get that.\n\ncrawfish itself is not in season now, so expectation management is always important. they will likely inform you that it is frozen. a pound of it won't get you very far though.  \n\nsome of the girls working there will tell you \"mild\" is actually \"medium\" for most people, but i would disagree. mild tastes like \"mild\" with just a minor punch to it.\n\nservice was great. the girls working were all very sweet and nice.\n\nfor calamari, half a pound of shrimp, a pound of crawfish, a half order of sausage, two <mark>Potato</mark>, and a diet coke, our total was $33 before tip. it's not exactly cheap for frozen seafood. a fun experience for locals that have no where else to turn for a seafood boil, but a little on the price-heavy side.", 
            "just taking my own personal time writing this review about hot n juicy makes me want to drive over there right now and get a pound of shrimp. this place is king in terms of asian/creole style crawfish/shrimp/prawns. i think the shrimp is the better than the crawfish. the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce- spicy-  is the best tasting style imo. id recommend requesting the <mark>Potato</mark> and putting them inside the bag. the only negative things id say about this place is that dinner can be very messy and that your hands will smell, sometimes days after you eat. <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> are above average, corn is sweet, and prices are reasonable.", 
            "wish i had read the review about avoiding \"small and soft crawfish\" before i went. otherwise it was great. we had the crawfish, shrimp, oysters, corn and <mark>Potato</mark>. everything was great. the shrimp was the highlight. we had hot and juicy flavor with some mild and some medium. the medium was described as \"tabasco\" level heat. the description was accurate. some heat but not overpowering. staff was helpful and knowledgeable. i will be back to try the crab.", 
            "it's definitely a hint or miss here.  7 out of 10 times coming here the food is really good.  there are some of those shrimp and crawfish off season, they have really small crawfish and bad <mark>Shrimp</mark>.  but more of the time it's very satisfying.  they don't do free <mark>Potato</mark>/<mark>Corn</mark> with your order per lb anymore.  it's all additional, if you want them under a dollar each. \n\nservice was great in my opinion.  you're getting your fingers all dirty, you don't want that much service.  lol  this last time we came in an hour before they closed.  there was no line.  the server took about 5 minutes to seat us, he was busy setting up tables.  we ordered 3 lbs of shrimp, 1 lb of crawfish, 3 <mark>Corn</mark>, 3 <mark>Potato</mark> all hot n' juicy mild and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>.  i have to say, their mild is way, way to spicy for us.  we should have done the baby spice.  i don't remember if being that spicy.  \n\noverall, we were all really satisfy.  happy and stuffed.", 
            "this place never disappoints me... my tastebuds go into party mode everytime!!! my all time fav is the hot $juicy shrimp 1lb w\\corn,<mark>Potato</mark>, and sausage..  oh also with a cup <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>.... and wash it all down with blue moon beer!!!  if your ever in china town vegas i recommend everybody stop and enjoy this gem of s place...  !!! p.s. i love the bib and the fact that you can make a mess when u eat...  great staff great place!!!!!!!", 
            "omg this place is amazing!!!!  we got the lobster with 1lb of shrimp and added corn, sausage, and <mark>Potato</mark> with the mild hot n juicy seasoning and it was on point!!! we also got the fried chicken wing basket which came with fries and that was also amazing! the service is always good here  but make sure you go early cause the wait can be a little long but its worth it.",

            "i've been here serval times before not because i'm a huge crawfish fan but it's because everyone i know is. every time before have been just good but this time i really did enjoyed everything.\n\nthis is the original hot n juicy of las vegas and has always been legit except for the parking. parking kinda sucks but that doesn't stop us or anyone else from coming. the atmosphere is great and service has gotten even better through out the years. that is all because they are staffed with fun young servers to hype the joint up which makes it a exciting experience. \n\nthe music is hip, there are tvs all around and they have plenty of seating for the amount of space they have. to keep the place cool from the hot vegas weather they have tons of ceiling fans which really keeps the resturant comfortable. the day we went was pretty chilly outside so inside it was actually pretty cold, good for the summer days but not that day. \n\nif you are not a big crawfish person like myself not to worry they have other items on the menu like <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>, shrimp, clam, calamari, catfish and nuggets with fries basket. there is also \\u00e9touff\\u00e9e which is like jambalaya and it was really really good. the oysters we ordered was so good, fresh and juicy. the <mark>Potato</mark> and corn that soak in the cajun juice is always amazing and my favorite part of the bag. with the right amount of spice and the right amount of cajun the <mark>Shrimp</mark> was delicious. the craw fish wasn't bad as well i just don't care for them. the fried calamari was battered and seasoned just right and paired with their season fries it really hits the spot. \n\ndon't forget it's always fun to eat at a place where you are required to wear a big plastic bib and gloves to fully enjoy your food. or maybe get a polaroid taken to be put up on the walls to remember a bday celebration or just to say you've eaten at a place that was featured on man vs food. but no matter what don't forget to try this place it's worth it.",

            "i normally don't give 5 stars unless it's really something to talk about it. hot n juicy was really good. the seafood, <mark>Potato</mark>, and corn were seasoned well. my husband and i got 2 lbs of snow crab, 6 <mark>Potato</mark>, and 2 corn on the cob with the hot n juicy seasoning (medium). it was nice and spicy and i don't like very spicy but it was that kind of hot that was hot but so good that you didn't want to stop eating it. next time i'll get baby spice or whatever it's called. lol. the corn and <mark>Potato</mark> were good as well. they brought it all in one bag and we shared it. plenty of food for 2. the seasoning was so hot that i was picking the crab meat and the juice popped in my eyes! wwwoooww! talk about my eyes were on fire !! so beware ... caution * it's hot !! \n\noverall the food was good and i would comeback. definitely a must try while in vegas.", 
            "i love this place! whenever i'm craving seafood this is my go-to place. we usually start off with oysters, i forgot to ask what kind of oysters they were but they usually come pretty quick and they were good, fresh, cleaned well, and a good size. \nand sometimes we get the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> but they can be a little too spicy. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are really good though.\n\nthen the rest of the food.. i like to order one pound snow crabs and a half pound of shrimp in hot n juicy medium sauce for myself. some people like to do family style but it's easier ordering a bag of food per person and everyone can get their own. i also get a half dozen <mark>Sausage</mark> in hot n juicy medium sauce in a separate cup. and a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>.\n\nthey say the sauce is one level spicier than it says, so medium is hot and hot is really hot. they also offer no spice to people that don't like anything spicy since their mild can sometimes be a little spicy. since they make their sauce fresh the spice level can vary. \n\ntheir sauce is very flavorful and not watered down. i've been to places where their sauce mainly tasted like old bay seasoning or it was too watery that it didn't stick to the seafood when you dipped it in the sauce after peeling but hnj's is on point.\n\ni love that they give you bibs and they also offer gloves too. i'm a girl with nails so wearing gloves helps with not getting all the gunk from the sauce stuck under them lol. either way you'll smell like garlic after leaving here but the food is so worth it!"

            "robyn, my future daughter-in-law had her trepidations about bringing me to hot 'n juicy crawfish... in the past few years, virtually every place she thought i would like turned out to me... just average, at best... and she heard from my youngest kids, that dad doesn't like to touch his food - which is mandatory at hot 'n juicy.\n\nwhen your pound of either <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, shrimp, or crawfish is brought out in it's plastic bag... the plastic bib and the paper towels are definitely not enough \"protection\" to prevent yourself from getting messy! in fact, i'm proud to admit after the four of us finished the 2 pounds of combos - we had the largest remnants of \"stuff\" by far of anyone dining that evening.\n\nyou'll receive a free cob of corn and a small potato with every 2 pounds of stuff ordered. but, i recommend more - just for the fact that you'll have something pretty neutral to offset the heat from the crawfish.\n\nhot 'n juicy's recommendation of how to eat crawfish is:\n 1) gently twist the head apart from the tail.\n 2) take the head and suck the juice from inside.\n 3) peel away 2 to 3 segments of shell from the tail to expose more meat.\n 4) pinch the bottom end of the tail while carefully pulling the meat out of the shell.\n\ni have a few modifications to this procedure... why would i suck on a crawfish head when i don't do it to it's bigger cousin lobster? that just.... sucks! i break off the tail from the head section and only retrieve the meat from the tail section.\n\nthe absolute best value is the shrimp...\ni treat the shrimp at hot 'n juicy like the salt & pepper shrimp that is prepared at chinese restaurants. i consume the tail section, shell and all - it's just too much work trying to de-skin the shrimp! when robyn heard that --- eww!\n\nrobyn's recommendation: order a pound of <mark>Blue Crab</mark> legs and a pound of shrimp.\n\nkevin and kathy's (my daughter) suggestion: crawfish and shrimp.\n\nmy suggestion: after a crawfish & shrimp combo... i'd go for a shrimp and shrimp...\n\nsuggestions for sides - bread rolls, <mark>Potato</mark>, <mark>Sausage</mark> are ok. corn on the cob, which is boiled along with the crawfish literally turns into cream of corn - way too soft.\n\nand... don't breathe and eat at the same time! took me a few minutes to recover from the heat going down! kevin tried some of my spicy crawfish and subsequently devloped a heat reaction - blotches of red all over his face and neck. i think for most - spicy is hot enough.\n\nrobyn was totally shocked when i gave hot 'n juicy a yelper rating of 5-stars - despite that fact that you can't avoid getting messy here and despite scrubbing down with virtually all the soap in the restroom afterwards and returning home probably needing a bath / shower... you can't help but have a pretty good time!\n\ni can't think of a more enjoyable time to spend a couple of hours people watching - customers or your dinner companions getting down n' dirty with the crawfish, or just to lower your own clean-freak inhibitions.\n\ni was wondering why this restaurant was located in the un-officially designated chinatown along spring mountain... so far as i could see that evening, there was only one waitress of asian descent... i queried our waitress whether hot 'n juicy was asian-owned - she replied that the owner was thai and resided in texas and was the second crawfish place he owned.\n\nhighly recommended by one who abhors using his dainty fingers....\n\n\ni do have one last thought though.... what exactly is the chemical reaction of flash boiling on a plastic bag? are there any chemical breakdowns of the plastic bag that the usda should be worried about?", 
            "been wanting to come for a while and get this off my list. i was kinda worried as most things hyped can very well disappoint. did a uye here today and it was a ton of fun getting hot n messy with some of vegas finest eaters.\n\nbf and i got some crawfish and shrimp- both with mild hot n juicy sauce....with the hnj sauce- it's a notch up in spice than the others. a mild is more like a medium so keep that in mind if you cant do the spice. it was nicely flavored and garlicky so plan to have time to shower a few times before seeing other people! mmmm garlic. other sauces can be had with zero spice for those who can't do heat (<mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, cajun, etc).\n\nthe shellfish was very fresh. i rarely eat crawfish since the last few places i've gotten it at  it tasted like mud. it was fresh, juicy and \"clean\" (no mud) aftertaste. <mark>Shrimp</mark> were a good size and not overcooked- still succulent and had \"the snap\". we also put half a dozen andouille  <mark>Sausage</mark> in with our shrimp (meaning half a dozen slices- not individuals <mark>Sausage</mark>) which were great in the sauce. ask for some lime/lemons and salt and pepper. i find when it gets a bit too spicy, dipping the meats in lemon helps balance the hnj sauce out.\n\nfor sides i needed my rice! hahaha i swear, a filipino girl can't have <mark>Shrimp</mark> with no white rice. it was $2 for a small bowl and i can easily devastate a few bowls when i'm eating spicy...so in that sense- they are making a killing off this per scoop thing. bf wanted some <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>- pretty good, but for nearly $5 i think it's overpriced for what it is. that's where some places get ya- a la carte sides.  we also had ice teas and a blue moon. it came to nearly $50.\n\nmajor kudos to the staff for accommodating 16 peeps and keeping the service going consistently. i would die if i was eating spicy foods and drinks are neglected. so glad i didn't get a hnj sauce with a medium level!!! they keep up on drinks and kept checking in on us and i definitely appreciate attentive service. \n\nthis place was a fun experience, but definitely brings out the inner ocd where i am hoping for a bucket or a plastic bag even to appear so i can hide the shells from myself and keep the table clean. hell, i even had shrimp brains all over my arms from myself and my table mates so dont wear your finery here!  i understand though why some esteemed yelpers like teri c. are regulars as it is fresh and tasty, but since it's such a messy experience. with a need for a shower to remove the seafood garlic smell, i doubt i can do this too often. i say, what a good call for a uye though. at this point if i can be dripping shrimp juice off my face and squirting my neighbor from the head cracking, then really whats there to be shamed of in front of the yelp crew? \n\n i will come back for <mark>Shrimp</mark> again. i like crawfish time to time, but for the per pound price and naturally small body with a big heavy head it's not always worth the trouble. i can also only eat so much of the head buttery tamal/brains. i feel then the crawfish is slightly wasted since the head makes for half the animal and seems like half the reason to have them. i have a cousin who i know would love this place, so i know there will be a future trek.  i am curious about their fried softshell crab and maybe some oysters i can dip in hnj sauce. \n\ni will bring a lot of wet wipes and a change of clothes for next time.", 
            "i have been to this place twice and ordered 2lbs of crawfish each time. i usually get the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> which is a mixture of all the other flavors. i like spicy foods so of course i had to get it spicy. overall not bad, i've had better for a cheaper price but in vegas you can't go wrong with hot n juicy for your crawfish fix. did not try anything else other than the cajon fries which were pretty good also...\n\ni believe the price is about $10/lb of crawfish, you have to order at least two lbs in order to get the corn and potato which i found odd because i have been to places that gives you corn and <mark>Sausage</mark> with your order. anyhow you have to give this place a try, just don't go here for dinner if you have plans on going out because you will smell like hot n juicy crawfish when you leave haha.\n\nenjoy", 
            "if i lived in vegas, i would be a fan. it just doesn't compare to boiling crab. i ordered crawfish, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and oysters. crawfish was a little tiny. the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning wasn't bad. it had <mark>Potato</mark> at least. we added <mark>Sausage</mark> to it. it tasted weird. like turkey sausage or something. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and oysters were great!", 
            "i never thought i would come across a restaurant that could knock my favorite steak place off the charts, but this is now my #1 favorite restaurant in the whole world - not just for seafood, any food!  i never even liked garlic before hot n juicy; the place permeates with a deep garlicky, buttery smell as soon as you drive up (and so will you for 3 days after you eat here).  get the crawfish, get the shrimp, get the crab, but whatever you do, get it in the special sauce.  there's something in that \"special\" sauce that's indescribable but keeps me coming back week after week - could it be crack, could it be heroin?  i don't know, but i'm an addict for life.  if i ever become allergic to shellfish (knock on wood), my family have specific instructions to put me outta my misery.  or, i'll just die eating at my favorite restaurant hot n juicy.  trust me, you will not be disappointed; the wait is worth it.  go before 6pm to avoid a looooong wait.  it's busy all days of the week.  make sure to get the corn, some <mark>Sausage</mark> and add a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> to catch all the juices as they run off your hands when cracking the crawfish, shrimp, and crab.  squeeze the head juice into the rice for extra flavor.  eat the rice last, yum!  damn you adam richman for telling everyone about las vegas locals' best hole-in-the-wall seafood place.  i feel sorry for the tourists that do try hot n juicy and then go home craving it because it's so amazing - i'm lucky to be living here in lv so i can eat there whenever i want!!!  i'm waiting to hear someone say they moved to lv for hot n juicy lol!\n\ni just checked out the boiling crab in san jose and hot & juicy is stll the winner in my book.  sauce is more buttery and savory and the servers are the greatest here in lv.", 
            "i love crawfish, and seeing as how i go to boiling crab in southern ca all the time, i wanted to give this place a try.\n\nneedless to say my whole family was very disappointed. the sauce was very bland, it was not as good as home.  there was nothing significant about the sauce. it was just essentially a bag of spicy water.\n\nwe ordered 4 pounds of crawfish and 2 pounds of shrimp, 12 <mark>Sausage</mark>, 6 <mark>Corn</mark>, and 2 <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. what made me upset the most was the fact that they weighed in the corn with our shrimp (note to hot n juicy crawfish: when customers order 2 pounds of shrimp, they expect two pounds of shrimp, not .03 pounds of shrimp and the rest were corn and <mark>Sausage</mark>. those items are considered side orders, even if you do put them together in the same bag, you don't weigh them).\n\nhighly disappointed in this place! i will not be coming back.", 
            "flavorful, juicy, and aromatic.  it never gets boring when you're eating a pound of seafood with friends.  although it gets a little messy, i'd say it's a fun social outing to do with friends....now if you're alone, then that's a different story.  i discovered this place a few months after it opened up, and went back every 2 weeks to get it.  i was on the \"hot n juicy\" fever.  you do get a little stench of seafood delight for two days, but it's well worth it to me.  \n\ni usually order:\n- 1 lb of butter garlic shrimp with 1/2 a dozen <mark>Sausage</mark>, and a potato --- no spice, cause somehow it's still spicy. and shrimp, cause it's more meat.\n- cajun and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (cause i can never chose which one i like best)\n\nalways ask for salt, pepper, and lime for the dipping sauce.  to me, it just makes everything taste better, and save some of the lime for your hands.  it tries to remove the smell, just a little bit.",

            "sooooooo goooood!!! most of the places that have been on tv don't live up to the hype, but adam richman definately got it right when he gave this place the thumbs up!!!\n\none warning: it is very messy!!! make sure you don't have any cuts in your fingers before you start eating (they do have gloves, but it's just not as much fun using them!) - other than that, you can't really go wrong with anything on this menu!\n\nwe always get crawfish with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>- with no spice... we do like spicy food in our family, but even the mild has a pretty strong kick that does dull the yummy-ness of the sauce! make sure you get a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> and order some extra <mark>Sausage</mark> to eat with that <mark>Extra Seasoning Sauce</mark>!\n\nnot the best place for hungry kids- we were able to get our girls some french fries & soda, but they got pretty frustrated trying to peel their own shrimp/wait for us to peel shellfish for them... and the craqfish creeped them out!

            "if you've been to boiling crab or red claw in orange county, ca, then you'll find this place is fairly comparable - though maybe with much better service.  but honestly, your opinion on which is better will be based entirely on your own specific tastes and what you're used to. (ex: i was a big fan of boiling crab until i started going to red claw a few times and the garlicky taste grew on me. now i love red claw and think boiling crab is a bit too salty. some may think red claw is too garlicky.  so it all depends. red claw not ever having a wait is the biggest influence in my decision to always go to red claw now anyway.)  \n\nmy husband and i were in vegas and were looking for a place to get good, inexpensive seafood.  most buffets on the strip definitely don't cut it for me (since seafood is my favorite food), and their seafood is usually not fresh.\n\nsince i love boiling crab and red claw, i was very excited to find this place on yelp and we made our way to the original location - as it's a bit more tucked away from the second location, which is a bit more touristy.  i found out later from our server that this location is generally more of a local's spot than the newer location.\n\nso when we arrived at about 7:30 pm on a thursday night, we were a bit sad there was no parking in the small lot. but thankfully a group of people left shortly after we circled the lot and nearby neighborhood for parking. we got in and were quickly greeted and told that the wait would be about 20 - 30 mins, though maybe quicker because they were cleaning up some tables.\n\nokay, so while i was waiting, i noticed a few things. \n1. the mixture of people in the restaurant was extremely diverse.  i'm sure there were at least 10 different ethnicities there!  the age range was also very wide - from young to old.  this was a great sign, as i noticed everyone in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying their food - the food fit, apparently, for varying taste buds.\n2. it was pretty busy in there, but the servers were extremely friendly and were all helping each other throughout the restaurant. no server was strictly confined to only one section or certain tables or customers.  if you stopped any server, they happily got you what you needed. this was honestly rare to see, and i was impressed at how the servers all seemed to interact together as a team rather than stressed out, competitive individuals.\n\nas far as the food, we got our shrimp, sausage, and corn in the hot and spicy sauce at spicy level. the clams, we got in the spicy garlic sauce.\n\nshrimp - mostly fresh, juicy, plump, easy to peel and crunchy (sings of freshness).\n\nclams - were good, though the actual clams were a bit smaller than i hoped they would be. i guess maybe they just use different clams than what i'm used to at red claw.\n\nsausage - were not polska kielbasa <mark>Sausage</mark> as we hoped. :( my husband was very disappointed and didn't like them at all, and he normally loves <mark>Sausage</mark>.  don't get these. even though i ate them, i didn't enjoy them.  they were pretty oily and fatty tasting in a bad way.\n\nhot n juicy sauce - this is similar to boiling crab's sauce.  i would say the spicy is pretty spicy, and a little spicier would make it so that you couldn't taste your food very well.  my husband and i have a pretty high tolerance for spicy food, and the spicy here is in between the medium and spicy spiciness at boiling crab.\n\ngarlic sauce - we got this sauce spicy, and it tasted fairly similar to the cajun garlic sauce at red claw (though red claw uses tons of real chopped garlic and is much better, in my opinion).  my husband liked this sauce over the hot n juicy sauce, which is ironic since i'm usually more of the garlic lover.\n\n<mark>Cajun Fries</mark> - fries sprinkled with cajun seasoning.  the fries were good and crispy and moist on the inside.  the cajun seasoning is pretty spicy, so be mindful of that if you don't like things too spicy.  they were good fries. :)\n\noverall, this was definitely a great place for good cajun-style seafood.   the service was great, and the food really good.  overall, i'd definitely go here again the next time i'm in vegas and craving seafood.\n\nbe warned though that your hair, skin, and clothes will smell like your food.  i suggest you keep jackets and sweaters in your car and wear something you don't mind stinking up.  you'll probably have to take a shower when you get home, unless you don't mind smelling the food on your hair and skin while sleeping. :)", 
            "my brother, wife and kids were in town and spotted this as we drove and bombarded me with questions. it was good the last time i went, but it wasn't impressive that i was dying to go back. i was dreading a very ridiculous wait, but they said 20 minutes and it seemed like we got seated sooner than that. i guess in the recent year they've really ironed out their efficiency since our orders came swiftly was well.\n\nordered shrimp, crawfish, and clams in hnj sauce, andouille sausage in hot butter, and one in lemon butter, half a dozen <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, and rice. i've never been a fan of crawfish since it's a whole lot of shell for a little bitty nub of meat. the shrimp was big, juicy and perfectly cooked. the clams were pretty good but a few had a bit of sand still. i guess that's just a typical hazard with shells. after trying the <mark>Sausage</mark> in other sauces, i still prefer the hnj as my sauce- spicy and garlicky good. i was a tad miffed last time i came here with $2 rice being a piddly scoop- they made the serving bigger which they should. asians rejoice!  my family liked this place so that's good. sometimes being a yelper everyone thinks you know all the things and i feel pressure being different in food taste too. \n\nservice was great. very friendly, checked on us often, fast about getting things. i really think the staff here has finally figured out a groove. only helps them to faster turnover.\n\nof course this is a messy experience, but if you don't like getting your hands all garlicky and seafood smelling, you can request gloves! my nephew wanted gloves so his hands don't smell. they give you bibs of course but this isn't the spot to wear something nice to and avoid long sleeves like white button downs. cracking shells is a splatter hazard. \n\nyeah, this place is hyped to hell and i don't think is the greatest thing to happen to seafood like people make it out to be, but it is solid if you just want simple, fresh seafood. sometimes clambake style food just hits that spot. if only it came with a sea view, i would feel complete.",

            "growing up some of my good friends were louisiana creole, and every so often they'd fly in crawfish from louisiana and cook it right there in their backyard. so i've been wanting to check out hot n juicy since i moved to vegas, but i tend to think of it as a communal eating experience that requires at least a small group. i finally had my chance last weekend when my aunt and cousin came into town with their friends. \n\nfor 5 people (four women, one man) we ordered 3 lbs of crawfish, 4 lbs of shrimp, a dozen <mark>Sausage</mark>, and one corn and potato for each person, all cooked in the hot n juicy house seasonings (as recommended by the waitress when we couldn't decide). the first time you go to a restaurant like this it is hard to know what spice level to choose. we had a mixed group so we played it safe by getting everything mild and asking for a medium sauce on the side. i can handle spicy pretty well, and i think the mild was perfect if you just want to enjoy the flavor of the food with a small amount of kick for the authentic cajun taste. granted, the shrimp hold the spice much better than the crawfish (since you get such a small amount of meat out of crawfish). i think that if i came here with just my husband, we'd probably opt for medium level spice since he puts hot sauce or salsa on everything!!\n\nknow before you go: there are no plates. you are served all your food in plastic bags (to hold in the juices) right on your table which is covered with paper and supplied with plastic gloves and a roll of napkins. you are also given a bib to wear, and you'll need it!!! it is a messy and time consuming meal (for the infrequent crawfish eater) but once you get over getting \"down and dirty\" at dinner, it is well worth it!!", 
            "came here on sunday, right when it opened... so there's no wait! at the beginning, the service was good until i guess they got more people and then our service was basically nonexistent... the water refill game was not on point. we had a party of 7 and our server was the guy with the man bun (forgot his name).\n\nthe food:\ncrawfish isn't in season so frozen crawfish is all they had. fresh crawfish is normally $11.99 and frozen was $7.99 (which isn't that cheap imo since i've had frozen crawfish at other places for $5.99). two pounds of crawfish gives you free potato and corn. my friend ordered 2 pounds and added 6 <mark>Sausage</mark> for $3. the <mark>Sausage</mark> were sliced pretty thinly but they were decent. \n\ni opted out for clams, spicy and hot n juicy style. i underestimated the spicy because i underestimate spicy at a lot of places. this place threw a good kick and i'm satisfied with the level of spice. my friends ordered the mild and the baby spice and they complained that they weren't mild enough or baby spice enough. my 1 lb of clams was $10.99 (market price at the time). i also ordered the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and made sure they were spicy. he says that the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are spicy by default. i was content with the fries while my baby spice and mild friends complained that they were spicy. the fries also had a nice kick to it. \n\nmy friend got a half dozen of oysters ($9.99). they were small and did not taste very fresh. they weren't the woooorst oysters i've ever had but they were far from being the best. \n\nfinal notes:\ngloves and bibs are provided. ask for salt, pepper and lime for a good dipping sauce. the table is able to be split amongst 3 tabs and each tab can be split amongst different forms of payment. \n\noverall, i haven't tried the boiling crab in vegas yet but i'm pretty content with the hot n juicy location in vegas. the ones i've tried in california weren't the greatest.", 
            "this place is the best! people will argue that boiling crab is better but the seasoning and the sausage here just can't be beat! we love getting the shrimp and crawfish with <mark>Sausage</mark> and rice. a lot <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>. you need a whole lot to soak up all that delicious sauce. get the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning if you don't mind having garlic breath, if you don't want that the <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> is just as good. the mild is usually spicy enough so watch out if your not big on hot food. i love having those plastic bibs on and eating with my hands. prices aren't bad at all. i think it's about $12/lbs for shrimp. whenever we come we're seated right away. the servers are always friendly and the food comes out pretty fast. i would suggest coming here in clothes that's ready to go in the laundry coz it will end up smelling like garlic lol so leave your coats and jackets in the car!", 
            "i love this place! whenever i'm craving seafood this is my go-to place. we usually start off with oysters, i forgot to ask what kind of oysters they were but they usually come pretty quick and they were good, fresh, cleaned well, and a good size. \nand sometimes we get the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> but they can be a little too spicy. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are really good though.\n\nthen the rest of the food.. i like to order one pound snow crabs and a half pound of shrimp in hot n juicy medium sauce for myself. some people like to do family style but it's easier ordering a bag of food per person and everyone can get their own. i also get a half dozen <mark>Sausage</mark> in hot n juicy medium sauce in a separate cup. and a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>.\n\nthey say the sauce is one level spicier than it says, so medium is hot and hot is really hot. they also offer no spice to people that don't like anything spicy since their mild can sometimes be a little spicy. since they make their sauce fresh the spice level can vary. \n\ntheir sauce is very flavorful and not watered down. i've been to places where their sauce mainly tasted like old bay seasoning or it was too watery that it didn't stick to the seafood when you dipped it in the sauce after peeling but hnj's is on point.\n\ni love that they give you bibs and they also offer gloves too. i'm a girl with nails so wearing gloves helps with not getting all the gunk from the sauce stuck under them lol. either way you'll smell like garlic after leaving here but the food is so worth it!"

            "not bad at all.  the crawfish was meatier than a similar one in california.  the <mark>Blue Crab</mark> was also good.  the shrimp pieces were nice and big.  what i like about this place is that it has good seasoning to choose from such as <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, house special, cajun style, and one other i can't remember.  they give you a piece of corn and a potato for ordering a 2lb bag of crawfish.  the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are good, but you can get similar tasting fries at a lot of places.  the medium spiciness has some kick to it.  they have actually five levels of spiciness which is ridiculous unless you're a hardcore fan of spicy food.  the service was good, but maybe it was because i went for lunch at a non-busy time.  the prices are just a dollar more than california, but it's still worth it.", 
            "found this joint only because of yelp -- so thanks, guys!  took my neighbor and her 13 yr old and my mother...we were prepared to get down and dirty...\n\nour first impression was that on a friday night, this place should have been much busier -- it almost made us nervous -- but we soldiered on.   \n\nthe four of us ordered 3 pounds of shrimp, a pound of crawfish and a half pound of sausage -- all with mild \"hot n juicy\" (which is all of their sauces combined).  word to the wise, i was sort of bummed about ordering it mild, but we had a \"tendertongue\" with us... maybe i'm out of fire breathing practice because we thought the mild - like others on yelp - was definitely hot enough.  first you have to peel the saucy shrimp or crawfish while it's hot out of the steamer -- but then you realize once things cool down to the touch that your tongue is still on fire.   \n\nwe ordered rolls -- and that was the fun part -- sopping up all the great sauce (since they don't use newspapers on the tables, this is possible...)\n\nwe thought the shrimp was definitely better than the crawfish.  they were out of dungeness and <mark>Blue Crab</mark> tonight -- altho had snow crab but we were worried about the texture -- and honestly the shrimp were really good.\n\nthe 13 year old is a shrimp-oholic...we ended up ordering another pound for him and the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> for us...really good crispy fries, too.  we girls all had beers -- perfect with the shrimp -- but honestly, once you start eating, you have to keep going -- because you're so slimed, you really can't stop and drink...i'd say we easily went through a roll of paper towels.  and they cleared us up before our 2nd round of shrimp and gave us a new plastic tablecloth and fresh drinks.  \n\nservice was genuine -- a little flakey and not really clued into the real reason they were out of crab -- but...does that really matter?  \n\nbeware, it's very easy to miss if you're heading from the strip westbound -- fortunately it's on the right hand side if you're heading west on spring mt before you reach decatur.  then the easiest way to get back to henderson is to take decatur back to the 215 -- another warning -- they're doing some crazy roadwork on decatur headed south -- so be careful -- the road is badly marked, dark and nuts...\n\nwe'll definitely go back -- but this is not for the faint of heart, anyone who doesn't like to eat with their hands or has an aversion to plastic.  \n\nour total bill came to $70 and change before tip.  but we had 4 pounds of shrimp (16 - 20s), 1/2 pound of sausage, 1 pound of crawfish, about a dozen rolls, 1 pc of corn and 1 potato, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, 5 beers and used up more wetnaps than i'm sure any table has ever before...so we thought it was completely fair.\n\n(naturally, we stopped at sheridan's frozen custard on the way home...)\n\nfun friday!", 
            "this place is a direct copy of the boiling crab restaurants in so cal.  everything on the menu is almost exactly the same even the different spices.  the one unique thing that we noticed was that this place had a fried soft shell crab platter, which you only get like 1 crab or just barely more.\n\nthe shrimp didn't seem as fresh as what you'd get at boiling crab as most of the heads were falling off the shrimp in our bags.  the fried fish platter also was on the smaller side, 3 pieces of fish.  the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were not what you'd expect, it looked like they sprinkled on the spices as they were in the basket so the spices are not really distributed evenly on each fry. the service was a step down from boiling crab, it's slower, they aren't really on the ball for drink refills.\n\noverall the food was still pretty good, if i could give it 3.5 stars i would, but for me 4 stars is a place i'd recommend unconditionally.  i'm not sure if i would recommend hot n juicy crawfish, because i know how much better it could be.", 
            "never been to anyplace like this before and we are completely hooked! now we wish that las vegas is only 10 minutes away. the place was cozy, very clean and our server was very gracious and attentive. the food a++++!!! we ordered 1/2 dozen oysters, a lb of <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Shrimp</mark>, and  crawfish, a basket of soft shell crab with <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and three beers - for only $59. unbelievable!!! (yes, we were starving, we just came from the boneyard tour). you can never ever find anything affordable like this in the bay area! and the seasoning, hot n juicy in medium.. arrrghhh. so good!! i can't help dipping my fries and <mark>Shrimp</mark> on this special sauce. now hubby and i can't stop kicking ourselves for not going twice, but it's all good, we're going back to vegas this labor day and hot n juicy is on top of our list!", 
            "this is my first time trying hot n juicy crawfish and i have to agree with the other yelpers when they say that the crawfish yield is not worth it.  my homegirls from nyc came to visit and i suggested that we try this place since none of us have ever tried crawfish.  so here we are 1 guy and 3 girls and we ordered 1 lb of crawfish - hot and juicy spicy sauce, 1 dungenuss crab - hot and juicy spicy sauce, 1 lb of shrimp - <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and 3 corn on the cob.\n\nthe shrimp yields more meat than the crawfish, however the hot and juicy spicy sauce is the way to go if you can take the heat!!  it'll get your lips burning at the end of the meal.  \n\nthe dungenuss crab was the star of the night for us.  it was 1.8 lbs and about $28.  we had it made with the hot and juicy spicy sauce and it came whole, which means you had to do the dirty work yourself.  getting down and dirty with crab is my thing!  i go to any buffet and ill sit there and eat <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> all night long!  anyways, the sauce and the crab was fantastic!  it was sooo good we ended up going to the supermarket the next day and bought 4 two pound <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, one for each of us, so we could make some more crab. lol\n\n anyways, 4 pounds of seafood and 5 beers later, we were stuffed.  we enjoyed our food.  we would suggest the crawfish if you've never had them before, but the shrimp is better.  must get the <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> if you are willing to spend the money.  total charge was $80 including tip, not bad for 4 people.  i will definitely go back there with more out of town friends.", 
            "this place is so good. the quality and price are spot on.  the flavors are amazing and the menu is surprisingly extensive.  we had two pounds of crawfish, and it was exactly as i had hoped: juicy, spicy, savory with just the right amount of acid to cut through the generous amount of butter and not leave you feeling too disgusted.\n\nwe also tried the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, which were delicious and a half order of the andoulle sausage, both of which were delicious.  the main attraction, of course, is the crawfish.  it's fun.  it's messy and i like how the restaurant doesn't try to take itself too seriously.  this place is definitely a gem and i would recommend that everyone go at least once to try it out.", 
            "although i feel like the flavors of boiling crab (in alhambra) are better, i like it.  we ordered 1 lb shrimp of all the the flavors and it was perfect for a friday night pig out.  my favorite was the garlic - all the bits of the garlic and the all the juices dripping of the shrimp.  tasty!  also, the deep fried catfish with tartar sauce was yummy and the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> that come with the catfish were perfect -nice and crispy and seasoned with the cajun seasoning!  yum yum", 
            "let me preface this by saying that i will be forever loyal to cajun <mark>Corn</mark> on brookhurst.   however, anytime i'm craving some cajun in vegas, this would definitely be the place i would go to.  \n\ni came by with my parents when we were visiting vegas over winter break cause my dad is a seafood fanatic and loves any form of seafood.  we started with some oysters which were shucked off the shell and came with plenty of lemon and tabasco on the side.\n\nwe also had the hot n juicy shrimp with extra garlic which was fantastic, but not as spicy as i'm used to from cajun <mark>Corn</mark>.  \n\nthe crawfish was also well seasoned and had a bit more meat than i expected which was a big bonus.  \n\nmy dad had the softshell crab which came with <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> although there wasn't that much cajun seasoning on them which was a bit disappointing because the seasoning was deliciously spicy and salty.\n\nthe corn was alright, only because it somehow didn't soak up the juice as it does at cajun <mark>Corn</mark> (maybe i'm just biased)\n\nthe reason that i'm willing to give this place five stars despite a few minor preference issues is that the wait staff is great.  the waitress who took our order was fantastic, very nice and somehow managed to memorize all of the things that we ordered with modifications and had it all come out correctly.  that was impressive enough in my book considering that our ordered included different levels of spice, amounts of garlic and there was just a bunch of stuff to memorize.  \n\ni will definitely be back when the craving for cajun in vegas strikes",

            "my first experience was a wonderful one.  not a big fan of crawfish, but loved the shrimp soaked in hot n juicy sauce.  i can inhale a whole pound myself.  mmmm... protein yay!!!!! tasted my friend's super spicy crawfish, i swear my lips were comparable to jay z's.  service was fast and friendly.  except for the homeboy with the glue on black nails.  i hope he wasnt the one cooking up of crawfish.  god knows what is in those freakin press on.  yuck.  price is very very reasonable.  the pound of shrimp purchased was only $9.99.  no need for rice.  must get <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> for $1, a dozen of sausage for $4, corn $.60 each, and potato $.60 each (potato is not that exciting, id rather get a corn).",

            "i love hot n juicy. i found out about this place from foodnetwork? or travel channel's mvf? not really sure. \n\nthe 1st time i've ever tried to eat crawfish was here. we ordered 1 lb of crawfish in medium hot&juicy sauce. after trying crawfish i learned that it's too much work for not enough meat, so never again. the hot&juicy sauce was delicious and pretty spicy. i love spicy food, but not so spicy that all you get is heat and no flavor. \n\ni prefer to order the 1 lb of shrimp with 1 dozen sausage in mild hot&juicy sauce. with a side of <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. this is a winner for sure. this entire meal would cost around $30 and good for 2 people. hot&juicy sauce in mild has a good balance of heat and flavor. i love to let my <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> swim in that sauce. the h&j sauce also has the best flavor out of the other flavor options they offer. beware tho cause the garlic and butter in the sauce will make you smell all day. by the end of the day you can still sort of smell the sauce on your fingers. \n\ni've also tried their <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> and you get 1 dozen for $15. it was good but the oysters are kind of small so i wouldn't really recommend it.\n\nthe calamari is ok. cooked well. i tried dipping it into the hot&juicy sauce just because i love the sauce so much. unfortunately it tasted too salty. the calamari is good on its own. \n\ni'm from the bay area so i've tried crawdaddy's and this is way better than crawdaddy's. crawdaddy's sauce is watered down compared to hot n juicy. crawdaddy's shrimp also looks anemic compared to hot n juicy. i haven't tried boiling crab tho.", 
            "i have to start off by saying that i may be a bit biased since i looooooooooovvvvvvveeee boiling crab. \n\nafter we landed, our first stop was to drop off our luggage at our hotel and then we jumped into a cab \"hot n' juicy please!\" this place isn't too far from the strip, a 5-10 minutes ride from where we were staying [venetian], about a $10.00 cab fare. when we arrived there were only a table or two dining which got us worried since we're used to boiling crab always being packed. as we were overlooking the menu i noticed that they serve blue moon, which deserves extra brownie points! \n\nwe ordered 2 pounds of the shrimp in their hot n' juicy sauce which is a combination of all their sauces, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and an order <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>. [fyi: you can't order half pounds here ]the food took quite a while to come out, but once we got to eating we noticed that the shrimp were wayyy over cooked. the skin and heads of the shrimp were falling off, and some pieces of shrimp were definitely too soft for my liking. we were probably only able to get through a pound-if that, of our order. but their sauce weren't too bad, definitely better than most places i've tried, but definitely doesn't live up to boiling crab's whole shabang sauce. \n\nall in all, this place isn't bad; if i'm ever in las vegas having major <mark>Shrimp</mark> cravings i wouldn't mind coming back.", 
            "hot n' juicy is an old favorite of mine located on spring mountain between decatur and jones. hot n' juicy is definitely the messiest eatery in town, and all the more fun because of it. sometimes when i give that description people don't want to try it, but it would be a shame not to. besides the fun of eating here, the food is great. how can you really go wrong with fresh seafood, butter, and cajun seasonings?\n\ntoday i ordered one pound of the crawfish ($9.99) and my husband ordered one pound of the snow crab ($13.99). we both asked for the hot n' <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning, extra spicy! you are free to choose your heat level as well as the style of seasoning you prefer - <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, juice cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, or <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. besides crawfish and snow crab, you can also order <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, or shrimp.\n\nthe first time i had a crawfish boil was at my brother's graduation from university of the south in sewanee, tennessee. i remember them dumping huge buckets of steamed crawfish onto the tables and everyone would just have at them, discarding the shells and heads onto neighboring tables. at hot n' juicy it's a little different, but not much. you are given bibs and your table is covered in white plastic that is accessorized with your own roll of paper towels. they bring your crawfish in plastic bags that are tied at the top to capture the heat. when you open the bag you get an aromatic burst of spicy steam that gets you really excited for what you are about to enjoy. this is where the fun starts. crawfish are peel and eat little buggers that require somewhat of an experienced eater to navigate through them in order to get to the savory bits. first you must detach the tail, which you peel just as you would the tail of a shrimp. then, and this is most flavorful part, you must suck the head by gently squeezing it into your mouth so you can get all the juices and inner goodness out of it. if this sounds totally disgusting to you, go for the crab. they supply you with crab crackers, but ian and i agree they should probably pre-crack them for you to make the experience easier and allow all the seasoned butter to seep into the meat. whatever you decide to get, i'm sure you'll enjoy it.\n\nif you order two pounds of crawfish you get a hunk of corn on the cob and a red potato in your bag, but since we ordered one pound each of different items we opted for the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> ($2.99). these came out hot n' spicy with a side of cooling ketchup. we managed to reserve some of the fries to dip in the juices at the bottom of our bags, and this was way better than the ordinary condiment. who would have thought that you could make french fries even tastier and more unhealthy with the addition of seasoned butter? i guess europeans serve their fries with mayonnaise, so i don't feel too guilty or out of line.\n\nby the time you are finished, it looks like hurricane katrina has hit your table leaving a mass of wet and crumpled paper towels in her wake. this is certainly not a prime location for a wedding reception, but if you don't mind getting your hands dirty in the name of taste, you really should try hot n' juicy almost any other time.", 
            "omg best crawfish of my life!  they really are hella hot and juicy!!\n\n*mouth waters*\n\nseriously though, this place is  bomb!  a must try for anybody that enjoys seafood and is hanging out in vegas.  the restaurant is located near lv chinatown, off the strip on spring mountain road.  it gets really busy in the evening, so i would recommend making reservations before hand.  my group of eight had to wait 45 minutes for a table (but since we were all pretty buzzed it went by extremely fast, lol).\n\nthe d\\u00e9cor inside is very nice; definitely makes you hungry and impatient for the seafood.  the smell of hot, juicy crawfish is mixed in the air... i could not wait much longer to sink my mouth into them!  we ordered three pounds of crawfish (each pound including a potato), calamari, and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>.  the crawfish wasn't too expensive (under $15 a pound), and when they arrived in bags, we were ready to chow down.  i took my first bite of spicy crawfish, and bam!!  juices flowed into my mouth, and i was in crawfish heaven!  everything was delicious!!\n\nthe crawfish pieces were decent (i mean, they don't have a lot of meat on them anyway), but once you start crunching on its shell, the juices come right out and that itself is so tasty.  i definitely plan on coming back here in the future.\n\nvalet parking is not available and is limited, but there is a grocery center across the street where you can park and walk over.", 
            "i suggest to get the crawfish if it's your first time there...and eventually work up to getting the shrimp. i also suggest getting it with the hot & juicy sauce mild (for the first time)..and if youc an handle the heat try it with an extra notch on the heat factor. also...ask the server for salt, pepper, and limes on the side. sqeeze the limes into the bowl of salt and pepper, then dip the crawfish or shrimp in there after soaking into the hot and juice sauce! ooo mouth is watering as we speak! \n\nthe deep fried soft shell crab and calamari was good too. omg...the oysters are my favorite! i love their cocktail sauce and their horseradish that comes with it. nom nom nom!!!! \n\nbe prepared to get messy and to smell like garlic for 2 days straight after eating there. it is so worth it. be careful, dinner time gets busy so good luck on having a \"quick\" dinner. \n\ndon't forget the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, corn and potato on the side. yummm!!!\n\noh you get a 3% discount if you pay in cash too. the crab bibs are famous now. and remember to ask for tons of paper towels!", 
            "awesome place! im always cravin it, mmmm!  it gets a 4/5 just because the server took a little long to get us things like the bill or drinks. this place is sure to get you messy, but the food is absolutely terrific and flavored with true cajun flavors.  the food is spicy, reasonably priced and portioned.  here's what i ordered:\n\n- 1lb of shrimp in the hot n' <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce (combination of all of their  signature sauces)\n\n- 1 corn\n\n-order of <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>\n\nmy total came to about $14  and i was still eating leftovers the next day.\n\nalso, they don't let you get half pounds, so you can either split with someone or get a full.", 
            "ah, vegas. so yeah, i dined at the supremely elegant fleur de lys, downed steak at the trendy n9ne steakhouse, and ate my frites at bouchon - but nothing was quite as satisfying as rolling up my sleeves, donning a bib, and digging into a bag full of hot and juicy crawfish. \n\nafter watching the man vs. food vegas edition, we decided the trek off the strip was worth it for pounds upon pounds of seafood, all seasoned with the house signature, hot and juicy sauce.\n\nthis is interactive dining, not for the faint-hearted. we ordered several pounds of hot and juicy crawfish, hot and juicy shrimp, <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, chicken nuggets, corn& <mark>Potato</mark> and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. while extremely inexpensive and delicious, be prepared to get down and dirty. if you can dig your beer under the mounds of crawfish and shrimp shells, take a long swig because even the mild sauce had my senses in a frenzy.\n\nask for extra paper towels. 3% off your bill if you opt to pay in cash. the wait can be long but at $3 a beer, the time will pass quickly.", 
            "my cousin saw this place on the food channel and added it to her list. we went late on a monday night (they are only open until 10pm.) we ordered 2lbs of crawfish & 2lbs of shrimp, hot & juicy seasoning, medium. they were boiled in a bag and brought to the table in the bag. we also ordered <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> that were hotter than expected. fun place with great food.", 
            "oh, the very moment i stepped into hot n juicy crawfish i knew i'd love it.  i sat down, looked at my foodie friend and said, \"i know i haven't eaten anything yet, but can we come back soon?\" lol.\n\nthe smell of the garlic fills the small restaurant, and the smiles upon everyone's face makes you want to smile along with them.  i go to lunch every saturday at 2:00 pm, and most places are dead, but this place was packed, with movement and chatter...it really has an incredible vibe!\n\nthe service was great for how busy it was and the wait staff was all friendly, our waitress explained the menu to us and also answered our questions thoroughly ( i was really hoping the pictures on the walls were because of some type of eating contest, but...it was just pictures of customers..drat)\n\nwe ordered 1 lb of crawfish, <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> flavor, medium.  i didn't think it was too spicy, but i'm not sure if i'd go up a notch on spiciness, because i'm a wuss.  we also ordered the calamari and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>.\n\nthe crawfish were amazing. i've never had crawfish before, so i honestly can't compare it to others, but it was down-right delish in my book.  i got a kick out of my friend squirting himself in the face with crawfish juice, and wish i went with a group of friends, as most of the people there did. i would order the crawfish again in a heart beat! but i would get 1 lb to myself instead of sharing, because it was sooo nummy! next time i'm probably going to try the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, oooh yess.\n\nthe calamari seemed really good at first, but the more i ate it the more salty it seemed to be...i probably wouldn't order them again because there are so many more appetizers to try! next time i will probably try the fried catfish!\n\nthe <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> weren't my cup of tea, a little too spicy for poor little me.  my dear friend grubbed on them though, said he really liked em.\n\nit was a lot of fun getting down and dirtay, and working for my food. and honestly, i would totally recommend eating here as a first date, whats a better way to get to know someone then being knee deep in delicious crawfish?", 
            "my very first time i went was with the same person i always eat out with if it isn't my boyfriend, so i might as well introduce you to my friend mikhail.. not a yelper, yet! haha.. anyway, it was both our first time & i have never tried crawfish before.\n\nwe ended up getting sharing the two bags [2lbs each?] of <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> crawfish, the <mark>Soft Shell Crab Basket</mark> w <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and calamari. i felt like such a newbie trying to open the crawfish, i splashed myself a couple times, but that's what the bibs are for, right? the flavoring was great; we ordered medium & it was just enough for me. my nose was running a little & my eyes got watery, but i enjoyed it. i think next time i'll stick with <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> cause i definitely have that down to a science ;) the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were straaight up cajun! i'd have to stop myself after a while because it would get a little spicy. soft shell crab was good, just wanted marinara sauce from the calamari instead of the tartar that the soft shell came with :) the calamari was house made, but it wasn't anything fancy for me. there's only a few places where i can say that's great calamari. \n\nthe service was average, it was a sunday & the lakers were playing orlando so we had to wait for a good 20 minutes for a table for two. i didn't realize that the restrooms were in two different spots, but our table was against the wall for the mens restroom & i was washing my hands before & after we ate. my bad fellerz!\n\nthe weird thing is that at the bottom of the receipt says you get a 3% discount if you pay cash.. i don't get it, do you have to present the check with the cash, then get a new receipt with the new balance? they already use enough disposable stuff & use styrofoam cups so i don't really think they're going green anyway. blah, maybe i'm going crazy because i'm yelping & it's already 6am!! random.. and awkward receipt though. i will be back hot n juicy! the simplicity of the menu & your system is definitely working, so much props. i'll probably come back on a weekday because that day was madness~",

            "wow, these places are everywhere! it's funny too because it's like asian cajun! i assume only in california and it's closest neighbor vegas have places like this.\n\ni actually really like this place. the spices they use in their signature hot-n-juicy is off the hook, much better than crawdaddy (in san jose) and right up there if not better than boiling crab (in san jose). we ordered the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs in butter and garlic and hot-n-juicy in mild and medium as we were all wimps, shrimp in hot-n-juicy in medium also, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and corn on the cob and <mark>Potato</mark>! i love that they serve the corn on the cob and potato in the bag with the juices, the other places mentioned above don't and they don't have <mark>Potato</mark> either. they also have <mark>Blue Crab</mark> here which the ones in san jose don't have. can't wait to go here again!\n\nthe service wasn't the best, they forgot the fries and i had to keep asking for water. but all in all this is a good off the strip joint for those staying in town for the weekend. get there early because i hear there is usually a wait, sounds like all the other places too!",

[i forget the rest] and then choose what heat level you want your spice at.\n\nwe're rookies so we ordered what my friend michelle e ordered which was  a lb of shrimp and a lb of crawfish..

            "any place where i need to wear a bib, is an instant favorite! ok, i've been to boiling crab and other comparable places many times and all had their similarities and differences. some people like the flavoring at bc and others like it at this place or that. etc... \n\nso back to hot n juicy. we came here when it just opened for lunch (we knew about the crowds during lunch and dinner), we sat immediately and i ordered crawfish and shrimp both with med hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. and you know what... i liked it. the crawfish was cooked right (not over cooked which i've gotten at other establishments) and there were different sizes of crawfish. a few really large ones to. the shrimp was equally tasty. with a side of salt, pepper and lime juice... oh my. i have my routines.\n\ni also ordered the corn, sausage and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. got a couple of coronas to wash it down with and i was happy. \n\nok, i wasn't really hungry.... ;) jk.\n\nservice was friendly and attentive as well as attractive. dining area is a decent size and i can see it getting a little cramp'd when it's a full house. has a local dive feel. don't expect gourmet here.\n\nsorry to hear about other's bad experiences at this place, as it was a good one for my friends and i. i look forward to going back and right when it opens for lunch. :) if you've never been, give it a try. enjoy! :)",

            "this place was so good that we went twice on our trip to vegas -- the day after we got there and the day we left.\n\nthe crawfish were pretty small when i ordered them (the waitress told us they would be) but they were succulent and sweet and more or less worth it. the shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> were better though. i liked the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> medium (which was super spicy the first time i came and milder the second time) and my boyfriend was a big fan of the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> mild. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were awesome as well. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were a bit spicy which would have been okay but my mouth was already burning from the seafood. beers are cheap.\n\ndefinitely a fun eating experience as well. i would recommend the trip if you are in vegas.", 
            "found out about this place from mvf.  this place is awesome.  service is much better than the boiling crab in cali.  i actually like the seasoning here better as well.  whatever seasoning i choose, i always ask them to not make it spicy; as mild as possible, yes i am a wuss.\n\nthough crawfish is in their name, go for the shrimp because that is the best bang for the buck.  there is more meat and you do not have to fight for the little meat that you get in the crawfish.  the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are tasty also.\n\npros: great service, great food\n\ncons: small parking lot\n\ndefinitely a place to stop by while in vegas.  it is not really too far off the strip.", 
            "great place.  service is friendly.  atmosphere is fun and perfectly set up for a messy, hot and juicy meal.  \n\nwe got the oysters (huge in size) about $17 for a dzn, very reasonably priced and it was delicious.\n\nhow it works:   they sell their crawfish,shrimp,crab,etc. by the lbs.  you get to pick the level of spiciness, and a type of sauce you want to accompany the seafood of your choice.  we chose 1 lbs of shrimp (about$11/lbs) level 3 spiciness in the hot and juicy sauce.  it was amazing, but sauce is heavy with garlic, but i love garlic.  the shrimp was seved head on, served in a plastic bag soaked in in the hot and juicy sauce.  very flavorful \n\ni recommend getting a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> or the an order of the fried soft shell crab (which comes with basket of <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>.)",

            "man v food is one of my favorite shows and you always hear adam say how great every single place he stops off at is. i always wonder if everywhere can be that amazing. i actually came to this place randomly with my girlfriend when we were in las vegas and she was craving crawfish. we came here before we knew it was on the show and we had no idea what to expect.\n\nwe came on a saturday afternoon and the place was completely empty. we were the only customers in the building... for a saturday afternoon i didnt see that as being a good sign. we ordered a pound of crawfish, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and i ordered myself some deep <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>.\n\ni was not a fan of the crawfish, but most notably the sauce. we got mild or medium and it just wasnt very good. the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> was over battered and the shrimp did not taste fresh at all. i ended up not finishing the shrimp, and i ate fries most of the time i was there. my girlfriend finished the crawfish, didnt like it very much. we left and both agreed that we probably wont be back to this location again.\n\nwe were definitely comparing this place to boiling crab and nothing really compares to boiling crab.\n\n\nthe positives. the service was pretty good and friendly :)", 
            "not a fluke, the second time proved to be just as good as the first. i am not proud that katrina m. and i came here two days within a three day span, but it was that good.\n\nthis time we came with her family and ordered 4 pounds of shrimp in spicy <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, one pound in medium <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, one pound in extra spicy <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, one pound of spicy hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> crawfish, and one pound of spicy <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> crawfish. out of all the seasonings, their namesake is the best at the second to hottest level. their \"extra spicy\" did not deliver the scorching hot flavor i was expecting and would not make for a decent food challenge. the other two flavors were just mediocre, nothing special. we had also ordered calamari, but they are extremely salty. the sweet potato and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are cooked to a superb crispiness. ask for corn and <mark>Potato</mark> to be cooked with your seafood.\n\nyet again i could not resist the temptation and ordered a blue moon to go along with the meal. i might be completely out of the loop, but it has been a while since i have seen a restaurant offer beers for less than $5.50 a bottle. heineken, heineken light, corona, corona light, sapporo, and blue moon are the beers they offer for $3.\n\ni cannot stress enough that you should get there before 6 because the wait is nonexistent. for a party of six, half of us being present, they sat us right away. yet if another large party came and our group was not all there we would have to give up our table. they cannot be faulted for that. i understand the need to meet the demands. once we were all sat and ordered, the staff were very attentive with refilling drinks and taking our additional orders.", 
            "every time i come to vegas, i want to try this place but never get the chance. this trip i made it a priority and was the first restaurant to hit on my vegas weekend and i will definitely come back regardless of reeking of garlic after walking out of the place. even the next day i could still smell the garlic on the clothes that i wore to the restaurant.\n\neverything we ate was delicious!! my bf and i ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of the crawfish both in the medium <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce. and let me tell you, the medium was still very spicy. i'm glad i didn't get the hot. my lips were tingling with the medium and i love spicy food. we also got and order of the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and a side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>. i put some of the sauce on the rice and that was super delicious!! \n\nother reviews say how packed this place gets. not the case on a thursday night. we were seated immediately, however there was a good sized line when we left. service was great and the food was wonderful. our next trip out we will definitely be stopping for a bite again.", 
            "i have to say i am a bigger fan of crawdaddy's in san jose, ca than i am of this place - both the service and the food (well, the sauce) is better at crawdaddy's.\n\nwe ordered a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, two <mark>Corn</mark> and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. we ordered both the crawfish and shrimp with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce which is supposed to be a combination of all of the sauces - the crawfish came out with that sauce and luckily they made a mistake and our shrimp came out with just the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce.  i was not feeling the hot n juicy sauce - it tasted weird with the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> and whatever else was in there, it was just too much. the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> that was on the shrimp was really good though, we got medium spice and there were some nice chunks of garlic which is my favorite part :) both the shrimp and crawfish were big - no tiny suckers here which i did appreciate because when you get a tiny crawfish it's quite annoying - all that work for nothing. my favorite part is always the corn because they sit it in the bag with the shrimp and it soaks up all the juice and every bite you get the sweet corn with the spicy <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> taste - absolutely amazing i'll tell ya! i think if we never got the hot n juicy sauce i would have liked the crawfish better.\n\nthe service was okay - we got some jock looking like dude.  he was nice but we had asked for <mark>Extra Seasoning Sauce</mark> and some extra <mark>Corn</mark> - waited about 10 minutes, didn't see the guy and when we finally spotted him he was just kicking it behind the counter chatting it up with the girls. in my head i'm thinking \"come on fool!  i want my corn and <mark>Extra Seasoning Sauce</mark>! wtf you talking for?! that won't get you a good tip!\" haha.. we didn't end up getting our corn until the end of our meal along with the check - i guess we could just call that our dessert ;)\n\nthanks to mvf we came, we saw and we tried some pretty good food but i think if were in vegas again we wouldn't come back.",

            "yummy!!!!! good service!!!! the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce is the best. if you dont wanna wait for too long, better come before 5. the <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are good too.",

            "again, another great off strip foodie find.  i dined here on 9/4/11 with my hubby and his brother and cousins.  we got here around 8:45pm and this place was jammed packed with people inside the restaurant and people waiting outside the restaurant.  we had to wait a good 30-45 minutes before we were actually seated.  staff awesome and helpful.  while we were waiting outside in the desert heat, the hostess came out and served us all ice waters, which was a really nice gesture knowing that it was hot and we were all waiting patiently for a table.  \n\nomg, food here is fantastic!!  everyone in my party loved the crawfish and shrimp.  we ordered both crawfish and shrimp in their <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning.  it was amazing!!!!!  we also ordered crawfish and shrimp in their <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce.  so good!!!!  my brother in law said that this place was way better than boiling crab and had better prices too!  \n\nthey had really delicious <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and their catfish and <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> are very tasty goodie too!  the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were spicy and can sneak up on you!  :)\n\n\ntip:  parking is limited, you may need to park on the street.  try to get there as early as possible as this place gets crazy busy!!!!",

            "again, yelp pointed me towards this gem.  the waitress was kind enough to warn us that the crawfish was out of season before we ordered it so it would all be frozen.  she also walked us through the menu.  the only complaint i have was when we asked us about mild spice vs. no spice for my daughter's crawdads order.  she said mild wasn't too spicy so we ordered it and it ended up not being very \"mild\" at all.  we ordered a new batch with no spice and she \"reminded\" us that the mild was kind of spicy, which was not what she actually said but who cares!  the food was pretty awesome and i didn't go there to argue so i pressed!  i also ordered the fried soft shell crab with <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and it was very tasty.  the fries were pretty good!  get ready to put your plastic bib on and dig in!  overall, very good food and i would definitely check it out again.", 
            "saw this restaurant on man vs. food so wanna give it a try. it's very similar as boiling crab. too bad it's not crawfish season so we didn't order it but the clam and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> are sooooooo good....we ordered <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> souse combination with medium spicy. however, the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> is a soso dish....service...ok. it's a fun place to have barbarian craving fun.", 
            "imagine burger king running out of burgers. that's what happened when we went to this highly touted but somewhat hole-in-the-wall joint just outside of the vegas strip. they didn't have any crawfish, which is what we came for (apparently due to seasonal unavailability...i jokingly told them to rename their restaurant). \n\nwe didn't travel all this way to leave, so we ordered a pound of shrimp, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, corn fries, and fried calamari. don't be surprised if the food is no-frills. <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were regular fries sprinkled with \"cajun\" spices. umm, ok. nothing to brag about, really. decently priced, and portions were better than average. i wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, and neither should you.",

            "pretty good...for vegas.  here's my recap:  parking could be better.  not a lot of spaces.  available spaces were a little tight.  seated immediately upon entering.  the place was pretty busy.  many tables with chairs, some with booths.  some booth seating was not accessible because the neighboring table was too close.  servers were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.  menu offered crawfish, shrimp, oysters, clam, lobster, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, and snow crab.  all market prices.  seasoning choices were <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.  choice of mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy.  sides: corn, potato, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, rice, rolls, and sausage.  also, appetizers were etoufee and a large variety of fried items: calamari, hot wings, soft shell crab, catfish, shrimp, and chicken nuggets.  we ordered two pounds of boiled shrimp: one <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> medium and the other <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> medium.  bibs were served first.  the bottom of the bib folds over to make a pocket to catch debris you drop.  we also ordered a side of white rice.  the cook time seemed about right, not real fast, but not too slow either.  constant line for men's restroom.  only one person at a time.  many people waiting to get in to wash their hands after eating.  the food comes out as it is ready, not served at the same time.  i prefer this method.  the shrimp is served in a clear plastic bag and the shells are left on the table.  plastic table cloth makes for quick and easy clean up.  the shrimp was good sized, hot, and flavorful.  there was a little extra juice in the bottom of the bag which we used to dip our shrimp once peeled.  also, we ladled some on the rice for a bit of flavor.  the shrimp was head and shell on.  this requires a little work, but is the traditional way to serve, saves the kitchen a bit of time, and leads one to believe the shrimp were alive when cooked.  i lived in louisiana for many years so i know there is a difference between <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> and cajun style, but i don't know why they made the distinction here.  most patrons in vegas won't know the difference.  the difference here is that louisiana had more butter and cajun was more traditional with more spices and less brother allowing the sweet flavor of the shrimp to come through better.  the difference is almost not noticeable, but i prefer their <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>.  the rice was okay.  all in all the food was pretty good.  we really enjoyed it.  on a side note, they did not purge the shrimp.  that is, the gastrointestinal track and the poop were still in the shrimp.  vegas patrons don't know any better.  its kind of gross, but i ate anyways knowing that it won't hurt you (otherwise, the place would have been shut down a long time ago).  there were plenty of paper napkins at each table and wet wipes served at the counter and with the bill, but i would have preferred a washing station, similar to those at cravin cajun.  you get really, really messy eating boiled shrimp and that stuff is super painful if you get it in your eyes.  they do serve alcohol, but we had tap water, which was served in styrofoam cups.  the server did not ask if we wanted lemon, but she brought out a styrofoam bowl with almost two whole lemons (kind of a waste).  shrimp was $8.99 per pound and the side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> was $2.  we really enjoyed this experience and will be coming back.  i tried the crawfish on a previous visit here.  it was the best crawfish in vegas.  flavor was right, but a bit small for louisiana standards.  i love crawfish, but think the shrimp is a better deal because there is much more meat.  i really like this place, but cravin cajun is better.", 
            "if you've been to boiling crab or red claw in orange county, ca, then you'll find this place is fairly comparable - though maybe with much better service.  but honestly, your opinion on which is better will be based entirely on your own specific tastes and what you're used to. (ex: i was a big fan of boiling crab until i started going to red claw a few times and the garlicky taste grew on me. now i love red claw and think boiling crab is a bit too salty. some may think red claw is too garlicky.  so it all depends. red claw not ever having a wait is the biggest influence in my decision to always go to red claw now anyway.)  \n\nmy husband and i were in vegas and were looking for a place to get good, inexpensive seafood.  most buffets on the strip definitely don't cut it for me (since seafood is my favorite food), and their seafood is usually not fresh.\n\nsince i love boiling crab and red claw, i was very excited to find this place on yelp and we made our way to the original location - as it's a bit more tucked away from the second location, which is a bit more touristy.  i found out later from our server that this location is generally more of a local's spot than the newer location.\n\nso when we arrived at about 7:30 pm on a thursday night, we were a bit sad there was no parking in the small lot. but thankfully a group of people left shortly after we circled the lot and nearby neighborhood for parking. we got in and were quickly greeted and told that the wait would be about 20 - 30 mins, though maybe quicker because they were cleaning up some tables.\n\nokay, so while i was waiting, i noticed a few things. \n1. the mixture of people in the restaurant was extremely diverse.  i'm sure there were at least 10 different ethnicities there!  the age range was also very wide - from young to old.  this was a great sign, as i noticed everyone in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying their food - the food fit, apparently, for varying taste buds.\n2. it was pretty busy in there, but the servers were extremely friendly and were all helping each other throughout the restaurant. no server was strictly confined to only one section or certain tables or customers.  if you stopped any server, they happily got you what you needed. this was honestly rare to see, and i was impressed at how the servers all seemed to interact together as a team rather than stressed out, competitive individuals.\n\nas far as the food, we got our shrimp, sausage, and corn in the hot and spicy sauce at spicy level. the clams, we got in the spicy garlic sauce.\n\nshrimp - mostly fresh, juicy, plump, easy to peel and crunchy (sings of freshness).\n\nclams - were good, though the actual clams were a bit smaller than i hoped they would be. i guess maybe they just use different clams than what i'm used to at red claw.\n\nsausage - were not polska kielbasa <mark>Sausage</mark> as we hoped. :( my husband was very disappointed and didn't like them at all, and he normally loves <mark>Sausage</mark>.  don't get these. even though i ate them, i didn't enjoy them.  they were pretty oily and fatty tasting in a bad way.\n\nhot n juicy sauce - this is similar to boiling crab's sauce.  i would say the spicy is pretty spicy, and a little spicier would make it so that you couldn't taste your food very well.  my husband and i have a pretty high tolerance for spicy food, and the spicy here is in between the medium and spicy spiciness at boiling crab.\n\ngarlic sauce - we got this sauce spicy, and it tasted fairly similar to the cajun garlic sauce at red claw (though red claw uses tons of real chopped garlic and is much better, in my opinion).  my husband liked this sauce over the hot n juicy sauce, which is ironic since i'm usually more of the garlic lover.\n\n<mark>Cajun Fries</mark> - fries sprinkled with cajun seasoning.  the fries were good and crispy and moist on the inside.  the cajun seasoning is pretty spicy, so be mindful of that if you don't like things too spicy.  they were good fries. :)\n\noverall, this was definitely a great place for good cajun-style seafood.   the service was great, and the food really good.  overall, i'd definitely go here again the next time i'm in vegas and craving seafood.\n\nbe warned though that your hair, skin, and clothes will smell like your food.  i suggest you keep jackets and sweaters in your car and wear something you don't mind stinking up.  you'll probably have to take a shower when you get home, unless you don't mind smelling the food on your hair and skin while sleeping. :)", 
            "we really wanted to try this place because my friend works here and we love boiling crab type crawfish joints!:d \n\nthis is actually my first time getting my hands down and dirty with the seafood because usually i'm too \n::ughhh i don't wanna smell:: \n::ewww its gonna get under my nails and all over my hands::\nyeah... i'm a shame... but i finally decided that i'll get over my prissy self to enjoy some damn good crustaceans hahha\n\ni love shrimp! get the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>!! it's a mix of all their seasonings (<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> and <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>) and its soooo yummy!! i am a wimp and cannot for the life of me take spicy, so the server suggested i try it without spice and yummm it was sooo good!!! my bf is the total opposite and loves spice, so when he got the hot n juicy crawfish at spicy, he said it wasn't spicy enough -.-;;;; he is a fatass and got 4lbs of crawfish and was totally enjoying every last bit of it. a little too excited....\nwe all shared a dozen oysters... mmmm it was a relief and cool break from the spiciness of the <mark>Crawfish</mark> for my  friends.\n\nmy friends got the crawfish too but in medium  hot n juicy. they are big boiling crab fans and said that there was a certain zing to their seasoning that bc doesn't but didn't want to love it more because of how far it is from us (we live in orange county). they also got the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>. the catfish was breaded a little too much, and didn't taste as fresh as the rest of our meal. \n i got the <mark>Soft Shell Crab Basket</mark> on top of my shrimp and that was really good. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> that came with it weren't as impressive but were made better by the leftover hot n juicy sauce that i had. hehehe\n\nall in all, we had a good experience, our waitress was really cool (katherine, kaitlyn?? i don't remember....) pretty attentive, but we had to nudge her for water sometimes. \n\nwe'll probably be back, considering the long list of places we need to try in vegas in our short weekend stays.", 
            "delicious food! i went here with family and we ordered hot n juicy spicy shrimp. oh my gosh we were nearly crying from the heat but it was worth it! servers were kind of distant and standoff-ish but they got our order right so no real complaints. i recommend the hot n juicy spicy for those who can take a little heat but i hear medium is just as good. love their <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> as well. spice overload!", 
            "i think i've been spoiled by the likes of boiling crab in oc and the other 4 cajun seafood restaurants..\n\nwith that said, the service here was great. he went through the menu and let us know what was available. \n\nwe had medium, hot and juicy  sauce 1 pound of crawfish and 4 pounds of shrimp, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and calamari. \n\nlet's just say that no one should ever let me order food. the sauce was pretty good but we couldn't finish 4 pounds of shrimp so ...", 
            "it has been a struggle deciding between three and four stars, but i have settled on four. i feel this place is slightly over-hyped and perhaps part of my let down was attributed to such high expectations due to this hype. i expected to be blown away, and instead i was just barely satisfied. \n\nwe ordered 1lb of shrimp in their signature sauce medium spicy, half a dozen oysters, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>. i also had two beers. the tab was very reasonable for the amount of food we received, hence why i opted for four instead of three star rating. i felt that the price was fair for the quality of the food. the sauce was good as was the shrimp. the fries were nothing special, but the cajun seasoning was very very good. the oysters were tiny and not memorable. the rice was great with the sauce from the shrimp. overall, the meal was fine but i would not seek this place out again or feel the desire to return unless the circumstance calls for it (friends who want to try it, i am in the area and rest of chinatown has burned down, etc).", 
            "my friend loves this place, every time she's in vegas, this place is a must for her. so we finally get to try out this place. i hate the parking, some stupid bitch jacked my spot, so i ended up parking on the side. anyways, the wait was less than 20 minutes on a saturday night for 4 people. we were seated, the atmosphere was nice, different from the usual cf places i go to in socal, and it's so weird because the waiters/waitress are caucasians (i'm used to asians) haha. anyways my bf and i order 1 1/2 of shrimp, medium with their <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> (it wasn't any kind of spice at all, shrimp was huge), <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> (it was good, nothing special), <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> (meh... didn't enjoy it much, not crispy), and a corn (no bueno ): i was pretty sad about it). \n\nservice: not bad, had to ask for stuff, and when we ordered more stuff, they kinda forgot about it, but it wasn't  a long wait..\n\noverall, i would go back, im planning to try the one that open in orange county some day...

            "3.5 stars\n\nits not boiling crab but when your in vegas this'll get your fix\n\npros - crawfish here is awesome, seasoning is great and the service is wonderful.  \n   got a couple of pounds of shrimp and of everything there this was my fav.\n   if you like it hot n spicy this is the place to go... my nose and eyes were running like \n      mo'fo\n\ncons - boiling crab is much better imho\n   the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> werent that good as opposed to b.crabs\n   i like hot food but maybe during my first visit it was a lil too hot for me\n\n\nwill prolly end up back here again... worth a try", 
            "hot n juicy has the best crawfish in vegas hands down! i order 2lbs of hot n juicy flavor crawfish and loved every single bite! the spice is on point! so be ready to sweat lol  <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are great here too! i really only go for the crawfish so i have no clue what else on the menu taste like. the wait on weekends is more then 30 minutes so i recommend going on a weekday. the service is great and fast. love love this place!", 
            "my boyfriend and i were craving boiling crab (bc) while we were in vegas visiting his parents. so we yelped for the new boiling crab in vegas, but stumbled across hot n juicy crawfish so we decided to give it a try. good choice!! i am happy to report that this is my new favorite hot spicy cajun shrimp place to eat! there doesn't seem to be a line here to eat, which is good because i hate waiting for more than an hour for food. \n\nservice is really good here. our waitress explained everything and gave us her recommendations. and when your water is low they come and fill it rather quickly. the waiters and waitresses are usually walking around and asking how everything is. \n\ni think prices were a dollar more than bc but that's okay. totally worth it. we usually order just 2lb of shrimp (i can't even eat half) and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> to share. and we got the medium spicy <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. \n\nthe shrimp: it's so good. it's better than the shrimp at bc because the shrimp here are more plump and drenched more in sauce! sometimes at bc it's either you get small shrimp or not enough sauce. but here, it looked like everyone's bags came with lots of sauce and plump <mark>Shrimp</mark>. i think that is a win.\n\nthe <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>: hot spicy goodness in the mouth. i felt like my mouth was on fire just after a couple! i love spicy food so this was a win in my book. it doesn't look like they just sprinkle the cajun sauce on the fries, but it looks like they cook it while the fries are in the fryer because it is seriously explosion of cajun flavor in your mouth after one bite.\n\nnext time i'm in vegas, i'm going to make a stop here. it's not near the strip so if you are visiting and staying on the strip, get a rental car or taxi it over to the \"chinatown\" of vegas.", 
            "my friends didn't realize that there were two locations which are fairly close together and so what had happened was that one group ended up being at one location while the other was at another, funny story lol. anyways, so we are in vegas and heard that this place was similar to the boiling crab & crab hut so we decided to check it out!\n\nservice: was kind, our waitress was helpful and attentive.\natmosphere: pretty spacious, had a good amount of seating, and it seems to be bigger than the other location next to mr.tofu.\n\nfood: my bf & i shared 1 1/2lb of shrimp, mild, in hot n juicy sauce, <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> w/<mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and two corn. verdict?\n\npro: the hot n juicy sauce has a nice kick to it & pretty flavorful and it was nicely smothered over the shrimp. the two half corn on the cob was nearly drenched into the sauce which made the corn sweet from its own juices yet hot/juicy from the sauce. i also got to try my friend's corn fritters because i was curious to see how it tasted and to my liking it was awesome. i like the creamy yet sweet texture that happens when the corn ball is dipped into the batter and then fried. \n\neh: the \"<mark>Cajun Fries</mark>\" ... about them fries, it clearly wasn't <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> but merely fries with a splash of cajun seasoning over it. it was not the same... not what i imagined and had experienced at the boiling crab. slightly disappointed, but at least the fries were not bad. \n\ncon: from the outside the crust appears to be crunchy but when i bit into the crust of the fried catfish i was in awe. it doesn't appear to be crunchy but semi chewy or had an interesting texture to it. the catfish was okay not as fresh. \n\noverall, i didn't come here for the crawfish because i'm not really a big fan of that but i did enjoy some parts of my meal if not all. it was a good experience to try a new place but i think i have to stick to the boiling crab as still my favorite go to place for this type of meal.",

            "where do i start with this place?  i haven't found a single place that even begins to compare to the awesome seasoning this place uses.  it is hot and juicy, as the restaurant name suggests, and damn delicious. \n\nthe servers all bear a striking resemblance to suicide girls except without the attitude problem. i wish i remembered our girl's name, as she was super friendly and helpful, and even put on some gloves and demonstrated how to most efficiently peel our crawfish for the newbs at the table.\n\nordered the crawfish, shrimp, and sausage (which should definitely be combined!) all in the special hot and juicy seasoning, medium level, which combines all of their flavors and was amazing. we also went through a basket of crispy <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and added on some <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, but i don't remember what kind.\n\nas with most restaurants that serve by the pound, this place can get pricey if you're not careful, but it is so tasty you'll pull out your wallet without a second thought.", 
            "finally, i found a place that is comparable to my favorite boiling crab (bc). i'm talking about crawfish and the fries since that is all i've tried here. \n\nwith great reviews and how it was on man vs. food. it was a must try on my list when i went to vegas. i got the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> crawfish because the waiter said it's similar to bc's \"whole shabang.\" it is indeed 90% similar, and the 10% is that it was overload with garlic. yup!! i was safe from vampires the whole weekend. thank you hot n juicy, but no thanks. my garlic scent caused jeremiah (the dude who sang birthday sex) to not show up at chateau paris night club that night. it was a sad day.  ok, i exaggerate a little, but yeah i was a little overwhelmed with how much garlic is in it (and i love garlic). nonetheless, the crawfish was succulent and fingers licking. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were also so good, a tab better than bc's fries. \n\nthe staff was friendly so that is a plus. \n\ncrawfish was $8.99/lb...expensive! but i guess the price came with fame.\n\ni'd recommend this place if you like bc or/and garlic of course.", 
            "i've been to many boiling crabs across ca so i was anticipating a lot from hot n juicy. i ordered: 1/2 lb shrimp with 1/2 dozen sausage, corn, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and i tried some of my friends' oysters and crawfish. got mild with hot n juicy seasoning. \n\nfirstly, prices were a little steeper than bc, maybe $1-2 higher. dived into the food and after a few bites, my mouth was on fire. seriously. i got mild, the lowest spice setting and i had to stop eating a few times because my mouth was suffering. i got the sweats, corona & water didn't help, and my stomach even hurt a bit. you might call me weak and maybe i am, but i order a mild at bc and i have no problem finishing a whole shabang there. \n\nit was so spicy that i could barely taste the seasoning. the corn was mushy/soggy. the <mark>Sausage</mark> were good, but still had the same level of insane heat. oysters were bigger than i'd like, i prefer mine small and sweet. \n\noverall, the most memorable part of my meal were the <mark>Sausage</mark> and the saltine/oyster/horseradish/cocktail sauce combo. boiling crab over hot n juicy any day.", 
            "omg hot &&&& juicy!!\nwe had the hot and juicy medium crab, galic medium crab, cajun medium shrimp, crawfish and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> everything was super delicious.. and hot!!!!\n\n<mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are spicy... i love spicy but my friend who does not like spicey could not eat hers. so we ate them for her :) \n\ncant wait to go back!", 
            "stopped by on our way home from vegas. the food was good, i actually like their sauce better than boiling crab (la). however, the waitress def could not explain the spice levels to us, they way she talked about the food made me not order as much as i normally do. she basically said the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are too hot, and to order the mild sauce because the medium is too hot for her. this was after i told her i like spicy foods. i def could of gone for the medium sauce, and i probably would of tries the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> if she didn't dissuade me from getting them. not a great way to sell your product! would of given then 4 stars but they made one of my friend <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> instead of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>, it took foreeverrrr for it to get corrected and they still handed is a bill with the <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> (their mistake). would go back but they need to work on their service.", 
            "best seafood restaurant in vegas hands down!!!! end of story. lol great prices the seasoning is amazing, service is great, our <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were forgotten so they brought us some as soon as we reminded them and they gave them for free!!", 
            "messy, but oh so worth it! had <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, shrimp, mozz sticks, rice and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>.  everything was amazing!", 
            "saw this place on man vs food and had to try it.  it was great!  crawfish and shrimp were excellent and the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were terrific too!  service great also.",

            "fiance and i saw this place on the man vs. food ...and we had to try it on our next trip to vegas. we went the day after new years day the place was empty. i was kind of scared we were not at the right location into the menu mentioned that they had been on man vs. food..everything you order is by lb and the price is based on the market price. we ordered kind lobster legs $ 26.99/lb, crawfish $ 6.99/lb, and shrimp $12.99/lb along with some <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. we went w/ the waitress recommendation and ordered all our food with the hot n' juicy sauce, spicy. food was delicious except the crawfish they had warned us it was not fresh, which may explained why it tasted a bit salty. still good but salty... overall experience was great. will come on our next trip to vegas (may skip the crawfish). beware...eating here you will get messy, they give you plastic table cover, bids and gloves to eat (eventually you dish the gloves & start getting dirty). you will smell after leaving this place...", 
            "atmosphere was great. love the fact that you can get messy and not everyone will look at you weird. the waitresses we're ok. i had the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> basket and it was yummy. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> we're so yummy but they fried my mouth but i couldn't stop eating them. \nmy husband had the craw fish and then the shrimp. i wasnt a fan of the craw fish (too much work for to little food) but the shrimp was soo good. also the corn fritters are to die for. it's definitely a place to try and not everyone is going to love.", 
            "love this place, always amazing! i get the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> shrimp spicy it's so good. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are good too. can't go wrong here unless you you don't like sea food.", 
            "where do i begin? i am a little lost for words for this place. unfortunately, i wasn't a fan of boiling crab, so i was looking forward to an improved experience at hot n juicy crawfish. boy, was i wrong! since i'm not a fan of peeling <mark>Shrimp</mark> and breaking off the head, i decided to order calamari. i love calamari, so i was looking forward to them; specially after a four hour drive. unfortunately, my taste buds went through an awful experience. the calamari looked pale, texture was soggy, and undercook! how in the world can you mess up something that goes in the fryer?! second, the batter had no seasoning and it tasted plain. i was so disappointed, because i really wanted to like this place. however, our waitress was very accommodating and apologized; although, it wasn't her fault. the waitress offered to comp my food and asked if i wanted to order something different. i was very pleased with her customer service, but said no after getting something raw. i was afraid of food poisoning; specially, since i'm in vegas. \n\ngreat customer service earned this place two stars and their <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>. the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> tasted fresh and it was fried all the way. in my opinion, they serve better shrimp than boiling crab. as for the seasoning, it tasted the same, so don't expect to be wowed. my sister wasn't in the mood to eat seafood, so she ordered chicken nuggets with <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. the chicken nuggets are not fresh, but frozen, and they taste like they've been in their fridge for weeks. so, parents beware when you take your children to this restaurant. also, if you're the type of person that likes to wait till everyone is served, your food will definitely get cold here. they don't bring all the entrees at the same time, but what ever comes out faster from the kitchen. i was the last one to be served, so you can only imagine how much i was looking forward to their calamari. those of you who like different type of hot sauces for your oysters, they only carry tabasco sauce. i wouldn't recommend this place, but you be the judge!", 
            "all i have to say is omg this is a great place to come eat <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are the best and all food comes by the pound when i saw it on man vs food i knew it looked good but it tastes better than what it looks super fast to bring out the food and the service is the best..... if ur in vegas it's a must!!!", 
            "i searched the food network and found man versus food. i searched for this restaurant. the shrimp was fresh and it was actually tasty. in regards to the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, it was in \"pika.\" i had ordered the clams and they met the taste the i was looking for. \n\ni stayed here back in april and the service was inviting since the store closed and they still allowed me to pickup my to go food.", 
            "this is my favorite place to eat in vegas! i love the cajun - hot n juicy spicy seasoning. highly recommend their <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and \\u00e9touff\\u00e9e. \n\nthe wait can be a little overwhelming, it can be up to 45 minutes or more...and when it's hot, it's not so fun to wait outside for your table.  you do end up smelling like garlic afterward....so ladies leave your nice purses at home ;) \n\ni wish they would give locals some perks, since i eat here so much! literally...i would go 2-3 times a month.", 
            "after seeing adam richman eating crawfish here on \"man vs food\", i made sure this was a place i must visit while in las vegas.i feel kind of left out giving only 2 stars to this place, where there are mostly 5 star reviews for this place. maybe my experience was a fluke?\n\ni came here around 8pm, and waited for around 40 minutes for a table. there were a few tables that cleared up quickly, but the staff didn't clean it up immediately... so the 40 minute wait could have been more of a 25-30 minute wait. they also have a strong garlicky yummy smell in the air which made the wait felt worse.\n\nordered 2lbs of shrimp, 2lbs of crawfish, 1 bag of <mark>King Crab</mark> legs and some <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> in their special spicy hot and juicy seasoning. i felt that their <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are over seasoned... quite salty... their shrimp was the best out of everything, but the shrimp was just okay. the crawfish wasn't juicy as their restaurant name would lead one to believe... maybe it's not fresh that day??? the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs felt rough and overcooked... and it was the blandest one of all... \n\nthe service here was not very good. my group had to flag waiters multiple times to get bibs, crackers, gloves, drinks, refills. i eventually gave up and just walked up to the register to ask for these items... the decor here really sucks too, very dim, simple, and at times looks quite questionable regarding sanitation... i will not be coming back. i personally love the boiling crab much more.", 
            "took my new orleans-native girlfriend here after an unsatisfactory dinner at lola's. hoping to have a better experience...nope. the crawfish were mediocre (my gf thinks she could have made better with some old bay and frozen supermarket crawfish), the server didn't pay much attention to us, the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were way too spicy, and the lemonade was so sweet it was undrinkable. \n\nstill looking for quality new orleans cuisine and good service under one roof. if you know of a place, let me know!", 
            "i have been wanting to try this place for years after hearing such great reviews about this place! i visited vegas with my girlfriends one weekend and was adamant about coming to this restaurant. we started our lunch off with a basket of garlic <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> to share. the fries tasted mediocre and i don't recall tasting any \"cajun\" flavoring. i also ordered a pound of garlic shrimp at mild with added corn and sausage. the bag came out piping hot when our server brought it out to us.  the sauce was mediocre; nothing spectacular that made me wanting to come back for more. my corn tasted 2 days old which of course i told our server! she was at least nice enough to remove it off our bill. :) \n\nafter having such high expectations for this place, i realized this restaurant is totally overrated! i still prefer my boiling crab over this place any day!!", 
            "out of the 3 locations in las vegas, this is my favorite. i feel as if it is the cleanest with the friendliest staff. i also like that you dont leave the restaurant smelling like youve just eaten hnj. the other location on spring mountain - if i eat there and leave to go meet my friends a couple hours later...they can tell what i had for lunch due to the smell seeping out my pores haha the bathroom is always clean as well with plenty of soap! after eating, i always have to go and wash my hands, and the soap always being there is a plus.\n\nfor the food, \nthe crab is usually on point for me. it is cooked all the way through. there was one time where my crab was still cold, but the waitress immediately apologized and made it on the house. i usually get the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> flavor, because you can never go wrong with tons and tons of garlic!!! the hot n juicy flavor is good as well. i also sometimes vary with a pound of shrimp or a dozen oysters. the shrimp is pretty big, so if youre not that hungry, you should get half a pound. the oysters are always yummy and i have yet to get a scrawny puny one. their <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are also very delicious - crispy and ful of flavor. i have not eaten the crawfish, but i hear its good. i feel like its too much trouble to go through all that peeling for a tiny piece of meat. \n\nyou can always ask for lemons and limes with salt/pepper fo rmore flavoring or to wash your hands with after. i like to grab some lemon sliced and rub them all over my hands to take away the smell and dirtiness. you can also ask for bibs to avoid splatter damage. \n\nall in all, i prefer this place over boiling crab even though some people claim they taste the same. i would definitely come pay this place a visit .", 
            "this location is a bit difficult haha but it's in the same plaza as bambu.\n\nit's usually crowded to be prepared to wait but wait usually isn't that long.\n\nbun opt for <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> while i got the shrimp, i believe my shrimp was about uh... $12 or $14 per lb. we also got their <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and oo they were yum. but over time, it did get salty but if i remember correctly, these fries had more of a cajun taste while boiling crab (my next review!) was more of a kick spicy taste, however bun says the exact opposite and he's more sensitive to spicy.\n\nsoda beverages were $1.25 with free refills. sad that they got my flavor wrong but were willing to change it kindly. tbh i couldn't taste to much of a difference in terms of taste between this and boiling crab haha\n\ntotal bill was about $40 with tip. \n\nwill be back!", 
            "one of the better crawfish places i've been to. <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are more kicking than most places, which is good!  not too much garlic in the juices which is nice that it doesn't overpower everything like boiling crab can do at times.  less tourists and families, so that's a plus too.", 
            "love this place! way better than boiling crab\n\nservice is ok. \n\nfood is always great! \n\ni recommend the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and a pound of whatever with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> mild. i can definitely take some heat, but be careful when you order because they definitely take it up a notch!", 
            "it's definitely a hint or miss here.  7 out of 10 times coming here the food is really good.  there are some of those shrimp and crawfish off season, they have really small crawfish and bad <mark>Shrimp</mark>.  but more of the time it's very satisfying.  they don't do free <mark>Potato</mark>/<mark>Corn</mark> with your order per lb anymore.  it's all additional, if you want them under a dollar each. \n\nservice was great in my opinion.  you're getting your fingers all dirty, you don't want that much service.  lol  this last time we came in an hour before they closed.  there was no line.  the server took about 5 minutes to seat us, he was busy setting up tables.  we ordered 3 lbs of shrimp, 1 lb of crawfish, 3 <mark>Corn</mark>, 3 <mark>Potato</mark> all hot n' juicy mild and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>.  i have to say, their mild is way, way to spicy for us.  we should have done the baby spice.  i don't remember if being that spicy.  \n\noverall, we were all really satisfy.  happy and stuffed.", 
            "i've been to multiple locations for hot n juicy and to be honest this was the most disappointing location.  it was very small and located in a janky strip mall.  the service was a bit slacking , as we had to ask 3 different servers to please bring us the salt/pepper/lemon combo before we started to eat our meal.  we also had to ask for water refills, which i hate doing after working in a restaurant that focused highly on being attentive to all customers and anticipating their needs.  but of course, the food was amazing!  i am a creature of habit and ordered a pound of shrimp, hot n juicy style, with medium spice.  we also added some corn and sausage into the mix.  and of course you cannot forget the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>!", 
            "i recently went for a weekend trip to vegas and this is one of the places we stopped at for lunch. one of the best meals i have had in a long time!\n\nmy friend and i shared an order of fried calamari and of <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> (with their <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>!) as an appetizer and both were delicious! the fried calamari is by far the best i have ever had and just going back for that would be completely worth it. the meal didn't stop there though! \n\ni ordered a pound of shrimp with the hot n juicy seasoning and it was out of this world good. i love shrimp and here they were big and juicy and perfectly seasoned! i also got to try some of my friend's crawfish (also with the hot n juicy seasoning) and that was marvelous. \n\ni liked this place because the food was delicious, the staff was friendly, and the restaurant itself was clean. i am absolutely coming back here during my next vegas trip!", 
            "the usual affair: <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> shrimp with baby spice, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> (make sure to dip the fries in the sauce), and a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> (mix in the sauce). it's so heavenly.... later, i will regret, because i will have a dragon breath burping for the next few hours. it's totally worth it though. \n\nall the seafood is sold by the pound, except for shrimp which you can get minimum of 1/2lb. \n\ndont forget to wear the plastic gloves provided. (if not, the sauce will linger in your fingers and you will be sniffing it for the next few hours). to avoid long lines, i usually go between 2 to 4pm for snack. \n\nfor the jetsetters: the crawfish and shrimp is tsa approved as carryon. i guess the sauce is not considered liquid. i've flown with hot n juicy for about 3 times with no problem. make sure to triple bag these suckers or it will stink up your carryon very fast!!!", 
            "favorite go to crawfish place in vegas! got their crawfish & shrimp in their med hot n juicy seasoning with sausage, corn, & <mark>Potato</mark>! and don't forget the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>!! super yummy!",

            "mediocre food. got 1 lb of shrimp with 1/2 a lb of sausage and 2 <mark>Potato</mark> mild..wasn't as spicy as the server said everything was. granted it has flavor but the spice lacked. the rice was hard like it had been sitting in the rice cooker for a while. <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were good but everything else was just eh.", 
            "great experience, the service was excellent, especially michael. it's a little strange with all the plastic table cloths, food bags, and bibs. when the restroom ran out of soap and was a little nasty, they jumped on the cleaning. i really like the responsiveness of the staff. \n\nnow for the food, we had alaskan <mark>King Crab</mark>($27/lb) with garlic and butter, snow crab($18/lb) hot and spicy style, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> with <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and corn fritters. everything was good. the spicy version of hot and spicy was enough to numb my lips for the first 5 minutes. burn baby burn! we needed a few beers to quell the fires in our mouths. don't expect fine dining. the atmosphere is extremely casual with dance/club music playing throughout, basic bench and wood chair seating, aluminum siding accents, tvs spaced out on the walls, and tank top clad young ladies and t-shirt wearing men serving the tasty food in plastic bags. \n\nso, this is not a first date place, wouldn't be very impressive to a potential mate. but for the family, friends, or long-time mate, it's fun. ask for the mild versions and work up to the heat ladder. i can handle straight thai peppers and fresh serranos. so believe me when i say they can make it hot.", 
            "came here on sunday, right when it opened... so there's no wait! at the beginning, the service was good until i guess they got more people and then our service was basically nonexistent... the water refill game was not on point. we had a party of 7 and our server was the guy with the man bun (forgot his name).\n\nthe food:\ncrawfish isn't in season so frozen crawfish is all they had. fresh crawfish is normally $11.99 and frozen was $7.99 (which isn't that cheap imo since i've had frozen crawfish at other places for $5.99). two pounds of crawfish gives you free potato and corn. my friend ordered 2 pounds and added 6 <mark>Sausage</mark> for $3. the <mark>Sausage</mark> were sliced pretty thinly but they were decent. \n\ni opted out for clams, spicy and hot n juicy style. i underestimated the spicy because i underestimate spicy at a lot of places. this place threw a good kick and i'm satisfied with the level of spice. my friends ordered the mild and the baby spice and they complained that they weren't mild enough or baby spice enough. my 1 lb of clams was $10.99 (market price at the time). i also ordered the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and made sure they were spicy. he says that the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are spicy by default. i was content with the fries while my baby spice and mild friends complained that they were spicy. the fries also had a nice kick to it. \n\nmy friend got a half dozen of oysters ($9.99). they were small and did not taste very fresh. they weren't the woooorst oysters i've ever had but they were far from being the best. \n\nfinal notes:\ngloves and bibs are provided. ask for salt, pepper and lime for a good dipping sauce. the table is able to be split amongst 3 tabs and each tab can be split amongst different forms of payment. \n\noverall, i haven't tried the boiling crab in vegas yet but i'm pretty content with the hot n juicy location in vegas. the ones i've tried in california weren't the greatest.", 
            "i love this place! whenever i'm craving seafood this is my go-to place. we usually start off with oysters, i forgot to ask what kind of oysters they were but they usually come pretty quick and they were good, fresh, cleaned well, and a good size. \nand sometimes we get the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> but they can be a little too spicy. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are really good though.\n\nthen the rest of the food.. i like to order one pound snow crabs and a half pound of shrimp in hot n juicy medium sauce for myself. some people like to do family style but it's easier ordering a bag of food per person and everyone can get their own. i also get a half dozen <mark>Sausage</mark> in hot n juicy medium sauce in a separate cup. and a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>.\n\nthey say the sauce is one level spicier than it says, so medium is hot and hot is really hot. they also offer no spice to people that don't like anything spicy since their mild can sometimes be a little spicy. since they make their sauce fresh the spice level can vary. \n\ntheir sauce is very flavorful and not watered down. i've been to places where their sauce mainly tasted like old bay seasoning or it was too watery that it didn't stick to the seafood when you dipped it in the sauce after peeling but hnj's is on point.\n\ni love that they give you bibs and they also offer gloves too. i'm a girl with nails so wearing gloves helps with not getting all the gunk from the sauce stuck under them lol. either way you'll smell like garlic after leaving here but the food is so worth it!"

            "so i just flew into vegas tonight and pretty much headed straight here after checking into my hotel. what can i say, i was fiending. while i was a little skeptical reading some of the reviews from loyal boiling crab fans (because honestly, who doesn't love bc), i decided to give it a shot. so, let me reiterate that i have been to both boiling crab and hot n juicy, and each has their pros and cons. i personally think they stack up pretty well (and i have reviewed both).\n\npros for hot n juicy:\n\n1. wait time was less than 10 minutes for a table for 2. it was a \"slow\" night for them (monday) around 8ish but there was enough space to sit while waiting. while we were waiting, c and i searched their wall of polaroids for adam richman's...of course, he had his own frame.\n\n2. wait staff was friendly. our server amanda was excellent. she checked in with us frequently and let us know that the kitchen was closing and asked if we wanted any more food before then. after it was kind of cooled down a little (we were one of the last to leave) she came over and talked to us and we bonded over our dogs. i think that their wait staff is way nicer than bc's. they say hi as soon as you walk in the door...and they smile. who'd have thought.\n\n3. price is pretty good. after reading previous reviews, we decided to skip the crawfish, and we got 2 pounds of shrimp (with their version of bc's \"whole shabang\" sauce) with sausage (which are bigger), <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and 2 beers a piece and the total was less than $45. i saw complaints about the shrimp being overcooked, but ours was done perfectly.\n\n4. they have a full bar.\n\n\ncons for hot n juicy:\n\n1. their parking lot is tiny...fits maybe 20 cars. we had to park in the lot across the side street and walk over.\n\n2. restaurant is a lot smaller than bc. if you go on a super busy night, it might take you a bit longer to get seated. that's the main reason that we went tonight instead of on a saturday.\n\n3. you walk out of there smelling like crap. but...you would at bc too. so i guess that's not much of a con.\n\nin terms of the food...the level was about the same, although i will say this (and i hope it makes sense): while h&j was a little bit spicier, bc had more flavor to it. my friend and i both liked the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> here better than at bc. the size of the sausage (har, har, har) was bigger at h&j. beer prices were the same, which is a huge plus. you really can't beat $3 for a corona. both places have tvs, which at the time were playing the lakers game.\n\nif i was in town again, i would probably end up going back. it's no bc, but it fills the void.\n\ni'd give it 3 3/4 stars, but i round up because i'm nice.", 
            "after seeing this place on man vs. food and multiple pictures on my friend's facebook page, i had to make a pit stop here while i was in vegas.  the crawfish was good but super duper exceptionally bodaciously spicy.  you order the crawfish by the pound and it was $9.99 a pound and get to choose the <mark>Extra Seasoning Sauce</mark>.  the specialty here is the hot and spicy, which you then get to choose mild, medium or hot.  let me tell you, even if you can eat really spicy food, choose mild because it's going to so burn going in and coming out!  i can usually handle spicy food very well but found the mild here to be really hot.  the garlic in the hot and spicy sauce really came through and made the crawfish really really good!  in fact i think this place is even better than the crawfish boil restaurants that i've been to in both new orleans and houston. \n\nwe came here on a thursday night and found it to be about half full which was to our surprise because we had heard it can be at least a 30-40 minute on weeknights and longer on weekends.  i guess we just lucked out.  3% discount if you pay in cash.  the total for the two of us came to $41 dollars with tax and tip; this included 2 pounds of crawfish, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, beer, rice and extra corn and potato.  \n\nawesomeness is achieved here and this time man won, at least until his visit with the porcelain goddess later in the evening!", 
            "been wanting to come for a while and get this off my list. i was kinda worried as most things hyped can very well disappoint. did a uye here today and it was a ton of fun getting hot n messy with some of vegas finest eaters.\n\nbf and i got some crawfish and shrimp- both with mild hot n juicy sauce....with the hnj sauce- it's a notch up in spice than the others. a mild is more like a medium so keep that in mind if you cant do the spice. it was nicely flavored and garlicky so plan to have time to shower a few times before seeing other people! mmmm garlic. other sauces can be had with zero spice for those who can't do heat (<mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, cajun, etc).\n\nthe shellfish was very fresh. i rarely eat crawfish since the last few places i've gotten it at  it tasted like mud. it was fresh, juicy and \"clean\" (no mud) aftertaste. <mark>Shrimp</mark> were a good size and not overcooked- still succulent and had \"the snap\". we also put half a dozen andouille  <mark>Sausage</mark> in with our shrimp (meaning half a dozen slices- not individuals <mark>Sausage</mark>) which were great in the sauce. ask for some lime/lemons and salt and pepper. i find when it gets a bit too spicy, dipping the meats in lemon helps balance the hnj sauce out.\n\nfor sides i needed my rice! hahaha i swear, a filipino girl can't have <mark>Shrimp</mark> with no white rice. it was $2 for a small bowl and i can easily devastate a few bowls when i'm eating spicy...so in that sense- they are making a killing off this per scoop thing. bf wanted some <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>- pretty good, but for nearly $5 i think it's overpriced for what it is. that's where some places get ya- a la carte sides.  we also had ice teas and a blue moon. it came to nearly $50.\n\nmajor kudos to the staff for accommodating 16 peeps and keeping the service going consistently. i would die if i was eating spicy foods and drinks are neglected. so glad i didn't get a hnj sauce with a medium level!!! they keep up on drinks and kept checking in on us and i definitely appreciate attentive service. \n\nthis place was a fun experience, but definitely brings out the inner ocd where i am hoping for a bucket or a plastic bag even to appear so i can hide the shells from myself and keep the table clean. hell, i even had shrimp brains all over my arms from myself and my table mates so dont wear your finery here!  i understand though why some esteemed yelpers like teri c. are regulars as it is fresh and tasty, but since it's such a messy experience. with a need for a shower to remove the seafood garlic smell, i doubt i can do this too often. i say, what a good call for a uye though. at this point if i can be dripping shrimp juice off my face and squirting my neighbor from the head cracking, then really whats there to be shamed of in front of the yelp crew? \n\n i will come back for <mark>Shrimp</mark> again. i like crawfish time to time, but for the per pound price and naturally small body with a big heavy head it's not always worth the trouble. i can also only eat so much of the head buttery tamal/brains. i feel then the crawfish is slightly wasted since the head makes for half the animal and seems like half the reason to have them. i have a cousin who i know would love this place, so i know there will be a future trek.  i am curious about their fried softshell crab and maybe some oysters i can dip in hnj sauce. \n\ni will bring a lot of wet wipes and a change of clothes for next time.", 
            "first experience at hnj last night as part of the uye (unofficial yelp event) and i had a good time. there were a good 18 or so of us there and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. the servers were very friendly and helpful. the place was packed but the food came out really quick once it was ordered. i had blanche meet me there and neither of us were into the whole eating crawfish and messy thing so we took the easy way out and got some baskets.\ni ordered the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> basket (10pieces) for around $10.00 and a side order of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> for $4.50. blanche ordered the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> that comes with fries for $9 and change.\nthe <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> was delicious. cooked perfectly and nice size pieces of shrimp. however, at pretty much a dollar a shrimp i thought it was very overpriced.\nthe <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> i could eat every day. so good. a bit overpriced at nearly $5 for a medium size basket of fries but oh well.\nbeer was $2.50 for domestics and $3 for imports. not bad. was a little disappointed to have them run out of bud light after the first one i ordered. i usually don't like switching beers once i start drinking one but i made an exception to try a blue moon.\noverall it was a cool place and everyone else seemed to be having fun \"playing\" with their food. or maybe its \"working\" on their food because it seemed like it got difficult at times.\non a last note.. i do wish they would work on the temperature in their. i think it was cooler outside.", 
            "yay! i finally got to have the hot-n-juicy experience.  it took years and family visiting from out of town to go.  i could never get the place to appeal to the hubby.  he was never thrilled with the idea of eating from a bag and leaving the shells on the table.  he's not big into making a mess, but me on the other hand...the dirty just makes it taste better, right?!\n\nso i went with my mom, cousin, and his wife.  i was excited because i've heard so much about this place and the yelpers can't help but to rave.  between us all we ordered the 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 pounds of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> (both <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, mild), 2 orders of calamari, a basket of chicken, and an order of fries.  \n\ni zeroed in on the seafood, i didn't take all this time to get here to eat chicken!!  my mom freaked out a bit about shrimp with heads and made me pull them off for her (this is why no crawfish...no sucking heads for us that day!)  but she did eventually get over it and was able to take of the heads herself without being grossed out.  everything tasted really good, just a bit of a kick that didn't overwhelm (enough of a kick for me, i'm a pussy when it comes to spicy).  i don't even remember how many paper towels i personally went through but i'm glad there was an unlimited number of them.\n\ni think the family enjoyed the experience, but when my mom discovered they had plastic gloves after our meal she was disappointed her hands smelt like garlic and seafood.  i just asked the waitress for some lemons for our hands then went and washed them in the bathroom...good as new.  but my dog has that super sonic smell going on and couldn't get over how yummy my hands were!\n\ni'm quite the happy fat-n-preggers girl after this experience.  baby was definitely happy with all the yummy goodness i fed her.  now that i know they have some pansy plastic gloves for the hubby i think i've got a better chance to get him to come with me for a return trip.  he's also a sucker for anywhere that serves <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. :o)", 
            "we ate here for dinner tonight and yes, i am officially a fan!  we always drive by this place and the parking lot is always packed.  i've also been hearing about it a lot.  it was also featured on man vs. food.  didn't need any more reasons to stop by here.  so we decided on dinner here tonight.  we got here at 9 on a tuesday night, mind you, and the parking lot was packed as usual.  we were lucky enough to get a parking spot and unfortunately there was a 30 min. wait for the 4 of us.  i don't mind waiting for food as long as it's good food!  \nwe actually ran across the street to the crown and anchor to grab a beer while we waited.  the bartender there told us that that was pretty common.   \nso we get seated 30 min later and we're ready!  we started with 2 lbs of crawfish, 2 lbs of shrimp, 2 lbs of <mark>King Crab</mark> legs all wth the hot n juicy marinade, spicy.  we also ordered <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, corn and <mark>Potato</mark> and a round of beers.   the tables are lined with a garbage bag and there is a roll of paper towels for each table.  no silverware.  the food started coming out really fast, within 5 minutes of ordering.  they are deiivered in plastic bags.  oh man, the crawfish was delicious! hot and juicy of course and the seasoning was so spicy and addictive.  my mouth was on fire inside and out!  but i couldnt stop!  everything was really good.  spicy, buttery and garlicy....yum!  we ended up ordering 2 more lbs of crawfish, 1 more lb of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and some more corn.  oh man, the corn was to die for.  sweet, but so spicy. \n a very messy meal and you kinda have to work for your food but it was definitely worth it!  the prices were reasonable as well.  i will definitely go back here.", 
            "finally! i popped my hot n juicy cherry! \n\nfound this place on yelp, and ready many many a review. i decided this was the perfect place to take my southern husband for a surprise birthday dinner, and it turned out to be a big hit! \n\ni took yelper advice and we arrived early on friday night at about 6:15 pm and we were seated right away. this place is pretty no-frills with the table settings, decor and furnishings, but after eating our meal i now see why! \n\nwe took more yelper advice started with 1 lb of shrimp and 1 lb of crawfish with only the hot n juicy seasoning, nothing extra, a side order of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and a couple of frosty adult beverages. the food came out fairly quickly in plastic bags (like i said, no frills!). bib in place, we dug in and were very impressed with the flavor, freshness, and the fact that the seafood was cooked to perfection. not overdone! after round one, we decided on more frosty beverages and another pound of shrimp and 1 lb of snow crab. the snow crab was awesome (except my small injury due to my own stupidity and the fact i was talking instead of paying attention to my crab cracking. btw hot n juicy sauce in an open wound is no bueno)! \n\nour total bill came to about $70 before tip which i felt was fair for the amount of food we ate and the quality of the seafood. it was about the same price we would have paid for beers and ayce sushi at our fave place, and i was equally happy and full and buzzed :)- \n\nadvice:\n*arrive early to avoid a wait (we were there at around 6 and were seated immediately, when we left the wait was about 45 minutes),\n*wear the bib, don't come dressed to the nine's\n*come hungry\n*leave your small kids at home because your hands and forearms will be covered with \"juice\" and i can't imagine trying to eat and care for an antsy little one\n\nwill we be back? you bet! and next time with a crowd of friends who we know will love this place!", 
            "wow, these places are everywhere! it's funny too because it's like asian cajun! i assume only in california and it's closest neighbor vegas have places like this.\n\ni actually really like this place. the spices they use in their signature hot-n-juicy is off the hook, much better than crawdaddy (in san jose) and right up there if not better than boiling crab (in san jose). we ordered the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs in butter and garlic and hot-n-juicy in mild and medium as we were all wimps, shrimp in hot-n-juicy in medium also, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and corn on the cob and <mark>Potato</mark>! i love that they serve the corn on the cob and potato in the bag with the juices, the other places mentioned above don't and they don't have <mark>Potato</mark> either. they also have <mark>Blue Crab</mark> here which the ones in san jose don't have. can't wait to go here again!\n\nthe service wasn't the best, they forgot the fries and i had to keep asking for water. but all in all this is a good off the strip joint for those staying in town for the weekend. get there early because i hear there is usually a wait, sounds like all the other places too!", 
            "this place was just like boiling crab...and we must have gone at a good time because we didn't have to wait for a table.  \n\ni had <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> for the first time and they were really good!  other than that, i had the usual pound of shrimp and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  mmmm, so good but we smelled like garlic for 24 hours!!!", 
            "definitely worth the cab ride from the strip! \ntwo of us shared.\n2 lbs of crawfish\n2 baskets of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\nordered a second piece of corn on the cob because the first one was so yummy.\n\nordered the mild special seasoning and it was pretty spicy still.\n\nwarning: your hands will smell like garlic for days if you're not careful! but it is worth it.", 
            "i was afraid that i would have to wait a few hours to get into this place.  just went here last night with a friend around 6:30pm and we were seated right away.  awesome!  but then again, there were larger groups of people who were still waiting outside, so maybe it's a good idea to come in smaller groups!  it was also labor day.\n\nwe ordered the following items:\n1 lb. of shrimp\n1 lb. of craw fish\na couple ears of corn each\n<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\n\nand we had this in the \"mild\" hot n juicy sauce.\n\nboy was it not mild.  it was super hot!  but it was so good.  the sauce was best paired with the craw fish.  the juice from the shrimp does not take as well, but if you peel the shrimp and then plunge the entire body into the sauce in the bag, then you are good to go with the awesome hot n juicy and very garlicky flavor.  you must love butter, you must love garlic, and you must be able to handle spicy.  \n\nthis place is pretty good, and comparable to boiling crab in the bay area, maybe even better in my opinion.  i have to go back and check as i've only been there once.  \n\nnot sure this would be a good date night, but i like a man who can take in some spice.  i find it very flattering!  so why not, bring your date here, see if he can pass the hot test!  you will have fun with the interactive eating, and the get down and dirty environment; bibs and all!  yum!  i'll be back here soon, once i get this garlic and seafood smell off me for awhile.  it certainly sticks to your clothes so don't bother going out after eating here!", 
            "okay, i can see why this place gets a bunch fo 4 stars.  \n\nthis was my first time eating crawfish as was it for my wife.\n\nso first off, we get there and the place is full, no waiting, just full of people enjoying their dinner.  we had stopped at another \"crawfish\" place nearby and there was litterally no one in the place.  that was the first clue that we didn't want to stay.  then we did a quick yelp and the average rating was 2.5 stars.\n\nwhile yelping the first restaurant we saw this place with an average of 4 stars.  much better, so we headed on over.\n\nlike i said, the first time we've had crawfish. \n\nthe first big plus, we were greeted and sat quickly.  the server asked if we had ever had crawfish before, and when we said \"no\", he brougt out two crawfish and showed us the process.\n\nwe ordered crawfish and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>.  both were great, but beware, the \"mild\" sauce has quite a kick to it.  we also ordered calamari and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  everything was good.\n\nnow, this is not a first date place.  but if you can find someone that will go here and  get dirty with you on the first date...marry them. :-)  half of the fun is you eat your shell fish and just toss the shells on the table.  in fact, it's so messy, they give you a bib and plastic gloves(upon request).\n\nthis place is fun, good food, decent prices and just worth the visit if you haven't had crawfish before, or just want to eat some good ol' southern crawfish, crab(blue, snow, dungenous) and catfish.", 
            "<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> comin right up!\n\ni just came back from las vegas on a quick 23 hour trip and i managed to make it out to hot n juicy in chinatown. my friends heard of it from man vs. food and i thought the pictures on yelp looked promising, so it wasn't very hard to persuade me to go. we go there a little after it opened and were welcomed very excitedly by the staff. of course, since we were there so early, we were seated right away. we ordered the calamari, two orders of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, a half-dozen <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, two pounds of the hot and juicy crawfish, one pound of the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> crawfish and three pounds of the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> crawfish (my personal favorite). \n\nthe calamari was fantastic, it wasn't overly breaded like some places do it. it comes with lemon and some marinara sauce. now i am not a fan of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, but my friends ordered two orders, i was bound to try one. not only did i try one, i tried like eleven! haha.. they were nicely seasoned and went perfectly with the ketchup. believe it or not, i would order them again. (zoinks?! lol). the <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> were so fresh it melted in my mouth. my only complaint is that i usually add a bit of soy sauce with the lemon wedge when i shoot <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> and all they had was lemon. but none the less, melts in your mouth goodness!!! the guests of honor to our luncheon were the crawfish. all the flavors that we had were very flavorful and delicious in their own right. however, the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> was my absolute favorite, and i think everyone elses' as well. mainly because we put in an order for two more pounds after killin' just the one. \n\n*btw you can order different grades of spicyness for your food, however we ordered the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> at just a mild grade of spicy juice and it was pretty intense. even to my spicy-loving thai mates that ate with me :).\n\ni only gave them 4 stars because they only served beer. i'll add that additional star once they start selling wine at least, but with fingers-crossed they'll someday have a full bar.", 
            "this was my first crawfish experience and it was pretty yum!  we had 1lb of shrimp (hot n juicy - medium spice), 1 lb of snow crab (<mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> - medium spice), 1lb of shrimp (<mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> - medium spice), and 1lb of crawfish (hot n juicy - medium spice).  also got beers and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  the lemon peper was good on the crab but not so good on the shrimp.  were told to go less spicy than normal because their spice was hotter than everyone else's, so we went medium.  really wish we had gone hotter.  we also did not shake our bags, which after reading a few reviews, could have made a big difference.  geez, aren't we smart?!?\n\non a thursday night, it was super crowded, but we got the last available table, so no wait.  service was really fast, if not overly friendly.   it seemed like we ordered and five minutes later we were opening steaming plastic bags!  food was great, incredibly messy and i thought it was a little pricey.  not sure if i would go back here, but it was definitely an experience.  i feel like i lived a little.  i also feel like i should share this little nugget:  the next morning, my bf says \"what is that smell?\"  it was us.  we smelled like garlic for a good three days. haha", 
            "the food might not be spectacular, but i was with a large group of friends and i had an awesome dining experience here. \n\nyou get a bag of seafood drenched in whatever flavor sauce you want with your level of spicyness. i definitely recommend adding corn to your bag of seafood because it soaks in the flavor and juices and it tastes so good! beware that the shrimp comes out with the heads still attached and you have to peel off the shells yourself. my friend wasn't warned and i think she was a little surprised hahah. \n\nso i tried their crawfish and the shrimp in their signature hot n juicy sauce (which is a mix of all of the sauces) and it definitely satisfied my seafood cravings. i found it so much fun to eat with your hands like a kid. you get a plastic bid and by the end of the meal, my hands were completely messy hahah so much fun! however, the smell did stick around for awhile but the experience was worth it. plus, the food came out so fast. our order was ready in less than 10 mins! awesome!\n\nwe also got some <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> to share which was a nice side to have. so come prepared to be extremely messy and eat your weight in seafood!\n\nprice wise: you pay by the pound. it ended up being around $10/lb for the shrimp and crawfish.", 
            "it's 2pm, and it's time for the only meal of the day. if you've had your fair share of buffets, i think hot n juicey is a great alternative. awesome selection of seafood, sauce with a great spicy kick, and you get to attack your food with all the barbarity you can muster.\n\nsince the four of us were starving, we ordered a portion of <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, a portion of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, a dozen oysters and 4lbs of shrimp. yeah, that's way too much food. the fries had good flavour but to me, they just took up unnecessary tummy space. the oysters were small and scrawny but still had a nice, fresh taste. the shrimp on the other hand, was impressive. they were big and filled us up fast. we went with the spicy hot n juicy sauce, and we were all feeling a little burning around our lips. very satisfying.", 
            "first, a disclaimer: i moved here from southern california and my parents still live in orange county so i probably visit them and a crawfish joint there (boiling crab, claws, etc...) at least every month.\n\nhot n juicy has gotten better over the years with their service.  the waiters are very attentive now and you will never experience a crisis of tongue-on-fire and an-empty-drink-in-hand.  the service is consistent and commendable.\n\nhowever, what they improved in service, they still lack in taste.  let me digress for a second: the spine of any seafood-in-a-bag formula is the sauce, something that resulted from vietnamese people living in new orleans, loving crawfish, cajun spice, butter, garlic, and more garlic.  the viet crawfish craze started in houston, jumped to westminster, and spread nationwide.  hot n juicy is the las vegas response to a community that contains a sizable vietnamese population.  they caught their lucky break from appearing on the travel channel.  but they cannot be the representative for the vietnamese cajun crawfish subculture.  which brings me back to sauce: hot n juicy's most popular sauce for any seafood in a bag is far behind.  besides being too watery, it also contains too much garlic (yes, it's possible).  there is having enough garlic to highlight the flavor of the seafood (something boiling crab & claws in orange county do well) and there is suffocating the flavor with too much garlic.\n\nthere is one thing i love here, which are the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, fried to perfection with the right crisp.\n\ni'll go to hot n juicy if my vegas friends crave it; but if it was up to me, i'd ask them to work on improving the sauce, like they have with the service.", 
            "need a spicy kick to get over your hangover? well this is the place! outta all of the cajun southern places, i think this is my fav. right when i walked into the restaurant, the aroma of homey seafood spices lingers right into my nostrils like music to my ears.\n\ngot seated, ordered the usual craw fish, shrimp, and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> but the thing that i really enjoyed was the deep fried catfish with fries, it was mm mmm good salty and crispy with fish meat in the middle. towards the end of the gruesome shell tearing lies the shrimp and crawfish graveyard on the table. i poured some corona (in my mouth) for the sea critter homies, rip delicious bunch :)", 
            "flavorful, juicy, and aromatic.  it never gets boring when you're eating a pound of seafood with friends.  although it gets a little messy, i'd say it's a fun social outing to do with friends....now if you're alone, then that's a different story.  i discovered this place a few months after it opened up, and went back every 2 weeks to get it.  i was on the \"hot n juicy\" fever.  you do get a little stench of seafood delight for two days, but it's well worth it to me.  \n\ni usually order:\n- 1 lb of butter garlic shrimp with 1/2 a dozen <mark>Sausage</mark>, and a potato --- no spice, cause somehow it's still spicy. and shrimp, cause it's more meat.\n- cajun and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> (cause i can never chose which one i like best)\n\nalways ask for salt, pepper, and lime for the dipping sauce.  to me, it just makes everything taste better, and save some of the lime for your hands.  it tries to remove the smell, just a little bit.", 
            "came here on a friday night. place was crowded and lively, but we didn't have to wait longer than 15 minutes. \n\n2 lbs of shrimp\n2lbs of crawfish\n<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\n2 sides <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> and corn on the cob\n4 beers\n\ntotal came to less than $80 bucks for 4 people. not bad! \nkey is to get the rice to catch that yummy, buttery, garlicky sauce!\n\nwould definitely come back next time i'm in town...just not on a first date. ;)", 
            "i love this place. be warned. wear comfy clothes. and make sure you don't mind having those clothes smell because once you walk out, people from miles away will be able to smell your new perfume \"eu de shrimp\".\n\nthe wait wasn't too bad. the only reason it took a bit longer was because we had a huge party... and that's understandable. \n\nmy order: 1lb of shrimp (hot/<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, mild), calamari, and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. the shrimp was extraordinary, while the calamari and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were nothing out of the ordinary. i love the yummy  butter garlicky lemon buttery spicy sauce that they boil those bad boys in. a tip: after taking off the shell, pinch the shrimp meat so that it flattens out a bit and then take it on a dunk in the sauce. believe me, it helps to sop up that sauce! \n\nthe fries needed a bit more salt but it was good and crunchy! the calamari was great. needed a bit more uniqueness to it but all in all, it was tasty.\n\nwould i go here again? hell yesssss!!! bring on the bib baby!", 
            "las vegas is sin city for a reason; it celebrates the seven deadly sins. in vegas, your greatest weakness or vice becomes the source of all your pleasures. we were ready to give into our carnal desires and get down and dirty, indulging our voracious, gluttonous appetites. we wanted to get stuffed with something hot n juicy. \n\nhot n juicy is known for their seafood: crab (dungeness, blue, snow), shrimp, and of course, crawfish. you pick the type of seasoning (<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> or the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>) and the level of spiciness (mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy). \n\nwe ordered 2 lbs of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and 2 lbs of crawfish with <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> at medium, 2 pieces of corn, 2 red <mark>Potato</mark>, etouffee (a cajun seafood stew, similar to gumbo), and a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. eating at hot n juicy is not an elegant refine affair. it's messy work because they dump a plastic bag of whatever seafood you ordered and you're only protection is the plastic table covering and a plastic bib. you open the bag and dig in.\n\nthe crab meat was very sweet and juicy. it was perfectly cooked. i found that the spiciness of the food depended on the type of seafood because the seasoning is on the outside of the shell. the meat isn't spicy unless you soak it in the sauce first. i found the level of spiciness in the crawfish much higher because the tail meat was much smaller and there was more shell around it, unlike the crab meat where i could pull out large pieces of meat out of the shell. also i got more spicy sauce from the crawfish because i sucked crawfish heads. after a while my lips got tingly and numb from the cajun spices. \n\ni've never had crawfish whole before. i only had them de-shelled. while i love crawfish and the meat was great, i'll never have them whole like that again. the tail meat is rather tiny (i like 'em big -- size matters when it comes to these things). at the end, we looked at the mountain of shell and agreed that it was more work than it was worth. crawfish is mostly shell and i'd rather pay someone to shell them for me.\n\netouffee was a spicy rice seafood stew. i liked the flavor and the level of spice was just perfect for me. i thought the rice was a tad overcooked and mushy from just sitting in a pot all day, but in general it was enjoyable.\n\nthe boiled red <mark>Potato</mark> were much needed as a break from the relentless cajun spice. they were nice and sweet. the corn is out of season, so not as sweet and juicy as in the summer, but still tasty. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were crispy and tasty.\n\nthe final price for all of us was $30/person for three people. we gorged ourselves on great seafood and left utterly satiated. happy ending for us indeed.\n\nwhat happens in vegas, stays in vegas. but this is one of the few times where you wish you could get crabs and bring them home with you.", 
            "honestly, if i have never been to the boiling crab in san jose this would have easily been a 5 star rating for me.  i just love the atmosphere of the whole place..from the garlic smell (that follows you through your clothing for the rest of your day by the way) to the get-down-and-dirty style.  some things just taste better eating with your hands and this is one of those occasions.  seating did not take very long and our server was very friendly and helpful.  he explained the system to us and forewarned us that even mild has a kick to it since it is a cajun restaurant.  my lips were burning by the end of my meal with mild, so if you don't like spicy food, do not come here!\n\nwe ordered <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> since the <mark>Blue Crab</mark> and the <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> were out (that was upsetting).  we got it with the hot n juicy seasoning, which the server explained did not mean it was spicy, but was a combination of all the other sauces.  it comes in a plastic bag, so we put on our plastic bibs and dug in!  it was delicious...the crab was meaty and the seasoning was just right.  just thinking about the taste right now makes my mouth water.  we also ordered the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  maybe you would have better luck, but if you want my honest advice, do not order those!  they were soggy and gross.\n\nthis is a must try if you have never experienced anything like this.  i would definitely come here again.  do not wear nice clothes here if you plan to go clubbing afterwards, keep an open mind, and enjoy!", 
            "call me crazy, but i can't help but be a little disappointed. ordered a pound of shrimp, mild with the special seasoning, and some <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> to take back to the hotel. mild my a**! i had to have a drink after every few pieces of shrimp. eventually the garlic from the seasoning started to get too intense. took a slight break (oh you know, head over to aria to grab a four loko and back.) before finally finishing up the bag. the fries were a tad soggy, even though they had poked holes through the container to let the steam escape. my room could have been mistaken for another hot n juicy location because it sure smelled like it once i was finished. i'll give myself some redemption and actually eat inside the restaurant next time.", 
            "this place was so good that we went twice on our trip to vegas -- the day after we got there and the day we left.\n\nthe crawfish were pretty small when i ordered them (the waitress told us they would be) but they were succulent and sweet and more or less worth it. the shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> were better though. i liked the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> medium (which was super spicy the first time i came and milder the second time) and my boyfriend was a big fan of the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> mild. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were awesome as well. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were a bit spicy which would have been okay but my mouth was already burning from the seafood. beers are cheap.\n\ndefinitely a fun eating experience as well. i would recommend the trip if you are in vegas.", 
            "great place.  service is friendly.  atmosphere is fun and perfectly set up for a messy, hot and juicy meal.  \n\nwe got the oysters (huge in size) about $17 for a dzn, very reasonably priced and it was delicious.\n\nhow it works:   they sell their crawfish,shrimp,crab,etc. by the lbs.  you get to pick the level of spiciness, and a type of sauce you want to accompany the seafood of your choice.  we chose 1 lbs of shrimp (about$11/lbs) level 3 spiciness in the hot and juicy sauce.  it was amazing, but sauce is heavy with garlic, but i love garlic.  the shrimp was seved head on, served in a plastic bag soaked in in the hot and juicy sauce.  very flavorful \n\ni recommend getting a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> or the an order of the fried soft shell crab (which comes with basket of <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>.)", 
            "tasty down south treat!  the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are \"the business\"! lol\n\nfor those in california, this spot is equivalent to \"boiling crab\" it's a must in vegas too.  the only real downfalls i find with this spot are the average wait time of 30 mins and that you leave with your hands smelling fishy (but whats to expect after you have to peel your way through pounds of shrimp, crawfish, crab and the all!)\n\ni'm craving this spot right now! lol", 
            "love love lovve this place!!! my boyfriend and i eat here once a week. even their servers call us their regulars and they know us by our first names. when i first tried this place i ordered the crawfish. i now get a pound of shrimp because the shrimp has more meat and it's easier to peel than the crawfish. \n\nwhat is so great about this place is their special sauce..hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>! i get it medium spice level, if i do spicy (which i have) my lips start to puff up. but the medium is still pretty spicy. i've also had their snow crab, alaskan crab, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>...all very good. \n\nbeware you will smell like garlic after leaving this place. and your fingers will smell for two days. the secret to getting the smell out of your fingers is to rub lemon juice after u are done (and i mean a lot of lemon juice).\n\nthey are opening a second location which i am very excited for! their staff is very friendly too.\n\nalso the wait is pretty long but well worth it!", 
            "my boyfriend saw this place on man vs. food and it is only about a 5 minute drive from the strip. \n\nnot bad. we arrived at 12:30pm ready for seafood. yet, we were seated, given menus, then as we attempted to order we were informed that they are not currently serving crawfish. the item they are known for! unacceptable! we came here for the crawfish, thats what we wanted, so why would we order something else. the waitress expanded that they just received a shipment so their crawfish are frozen. first off, hearing frozen was a huge turn off. i live in the san francisco bay area so our seafood here is fresh. yet i had to remind myself that vegas is in the desert so fresh seafood here is unlikely. \n\nwe rolled our eyes and blew the joint. i swear i would be back but for the rest of the day i was getting puppy eyes from the honey so i agreed to give them a second try and attempt dinner.\n\nwe arrived again at 5:30 and we were seated after 10 minutes. we ordered a pound of hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> in medium and one pound of shrimp in <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> medium and a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. first off there is not one positive thing that i can recall about the fries so i would recommend ordering a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> instead. yes, order rice over fries. i never thought i would recommend that to anyone. ever.\n\nmy favorite flavor was the hot & juicy! it was packed with flavor and mighty tasty! the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> was good too! i would both order them again. the heat levels here though are a little off, if you want hot, order medium, etc. i would beware the extra spicy! \n\nthe place got pretty crowed around 6:20 and i was happy we arrived fairly early. the service here is lagging. you have to notify your waiter(ess) if you want more water. they don't really pay attention the details. \n\ni would go back if i lived there and needed a crawfish fix, but on my next vegas trip or any after i will not be visiting hot and juicy. it was good, but it wasn't that good. \n\n(i took off a star for not having crawfish when i went initially fyi)\n\noh and yes, my paws smelled 2 days after. the amount of soap didn't matter. the order sinks in! kinda yucky.\n\nhappy ripping off the heads of crawfish! \n\n(=", 
            "a little better than boiling crab in socal. i had the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> crawfish, medium heat. i pretty much inhaled it. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were made perfect. i cant wait to come back for more!",

            "after the man vs. food special at hot n juicy how can one not visit this place while in vegas. its location is in chinatown if you are visiting and staying on the strip, but the cab ride is well worth the money to try these succulent crawfish.\n\nwait time to be seated was expected for a restaurant seen on man vs. food, so don't be surprised. the hostess may even tell you to try their other restaurant down the street with \"no wait time,\" but we of course wanted the real deal. when we were finally seated, service wasn't bad at all for a busy tuesday night, food came out consistently as we ordered. which brings me to...the food!\n\ni suggest tightening that bib across your neck because once that food comes out, get ready to lick those juices around your fingers slowly running down the side of your hands because it's going to get a bit messy!\n\n<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>: the perfect balance between sweet and salty. fries came in a basket and had the right amount of juicy flavor, not dry but not drenched in oil either. a great way to start the beginning of the feast.\n\n3 lbs of <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> crawfish and 1 lb of shrimp: better than expected! crawfish come steamed in a bag drenched in their special sauce. full of flavor and deliciousness! the heads don't come with too much juice, but crawfish meat come exceptionally hefty, as do the shrimp. i actually prefer their seafood drenched in so much flavor than the fire burning crawfish we had at new orleans! spice isn't too overwhelming... i think we got the medium. get the potato and corn as they are steamed in with the crawfish too! \n\nwell worth the trip and money! we had a great time getting down and dirty with these crawfish and shrimp. i don't think i'll ever find the perfect blend of spice and flavor! this place is a definite must when visiting vegas!!",

            "holy sh*t, i love this place.!!  literally, sh*t... frankly, having this as one of my favorite digs defies common logic as i know eating here will make me sh*t like crazy later.!\n\n*note this is the same review for their new restaurant.   the only difference is layout.   the service, price, and quality of food does not diminish from one place to the other.\n\ntime spent\nonce a week @ lunch/dinner times.\n\nlayout\nhjnc seems to be a chain and, for vegas, this location is the older of the two found in chinatown.   unlike their newest store, this location has more of a \"dive-in\" look.   it's an open space look with squared tables and 2/3 half moon shaped booth seating towards the back.   \n\ni've stopped coming to this location ever since the new one opened, but i recall the very long lines to get in.   they have a couple of seats to help with the waiting inside, but those fill up quick, and so it leads to many customers sitting around randomly (sp.?) outside.\n\nalso note that ths location has limited parking.!   customers tend to park around a adjacent neighborhood or at the shopping center over (tow warning).\n\nthis issue may be gone with the new store opening...   but, garunteed - hjnc is always crowded nonetheles.^^\n\nservice\nno matter which hnjc you're at, the service is outstanding.   people are cheerful and conversational.   not only do servers ask what you need, but everyone who works there will also eventually ask what you need.\n\nfood\nthere's an arguement here on how good the food is.   as i rave about the taste, my southern friends disagree that it's better back home.^^;\n\nmy one con is the snow crab's \"freshness\" being on par with local buffet quality.   i found the shell soft and flavor off (sauce saves it).    you are basicly paying $16 a 1ib for something you can pay $24 and eat without limit at a buffet ($15 @ rio's world buffet as a local).\n\ni have alot of friends who don't like shellfish, so can recommend their sweet-<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, shrimp etouffe (sp.?), battered shrimp, and battered catfish as alternate foods...  all of which, i don't order, but highly enjoy stealing from those who do.^^\n\npricing\non average, i eat 6-8ibs of various items (crawfish, clams, snow crab) which normally run $50-$80.   i've had friends do 1-2 ibs of things and spend $20ish...  maybe that'll give you a rough idea.\n\nclosing\nhnjc will leave you with a lasting impression.  the service and welcoming you recieve there make it feel like you're eating at home with friends.   it also doesn't hurt that all the waitresses are gorgeous to boot.^^   it's as if they the catalogue of suicide girls were waitressing the establishment.!\n\ntips\n1.  sauces: please don't bother with getting anything under spicey.   the seafood just tastes bland otherwise.    extra spicey will make you cry.\n2.  wear clothes u don't care about so you don't have to wear those ridiculous looking bibs...  some people go as far as wearing hamburger helper gloves to eat.!   please save yourself the embarrassment of looking stupid.\n3.  i like to save whatever sauces is left over and pour them into one bag to go.   i know - it sounds yuck...  but the sauce is great with everything you cook.   omelletes (sp.?), over dry noodles with egg, etc.", 
            "i'm a fan for sure. there aren't that many places in vegas where you can dig into a sack of crawfish, so hot & juicy definitely sets themselves apart. \nwe had oysters, crawfish, shrimp, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and chicken fingers (for the non-seafood eater). the oysters were good, nothing special. i really enjoyed the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce on the shrimp. the crawfish were awesome - pretty spicy and we only got medium! i didn't try the chicken fingers, but i can imagine...\nprices are reasonable, service was good, atmosphere is bustling, like it should be.", 
            "you fucking own the boiling crab! haha. i had this the same week i had boiling crab and i totally noticed the difference. omg, the sauce here is amazing. i usually just order the shrimp-- sooo goood. and don't forget to order a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>!!! mmm mmm! not a fan of crawfish even though that's what the restaurant is known for. funny thing, i saw this place on man vs. food-- the owner is asian, yet the food is cajun/creole...hmm. oh wells- it's still amazing!",

            "de-fricken-licious. i had never tried crawfish, but i'm a big seafood lover, so i was excited to try it from what is supposedly the best. you order your seafood of choice by the pound and can find the daily market prices on a board by the kitchen. you choose your choice of seasoning and heat level. i went with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> and \"less than mild.\" even at less than mild, the spice level was making my nose run a little bit (i'll admit, i'm a wimp). service was okay. we had to ask the waitress for a refill after she passed our empty cups several times. i promise, i'm not a snob, but as a waiter myself, if a customer has to remind me for a refill, i'm not exactly doing my job. anyways, on to the food:\n\nsnow crab w/ <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>: absolutely amazing. i don't know how, but their crab was some of the most moist i've had. huge chunks were easy to pull out since the meat hadn't dried out. don't forget to dip your crab meat in whatever seasoning you have. it takes it to the next level.\n\ncrawfish w/ hot n juicy: great, but very small. the little bits of meat that you get from each crawfish wasn't very much. as a crawfish newbie, i was surprised, but now i know what i'm in for. if you're here for just crawfish, i'd get at least 2 pounds.\n\nmussels: wow. some of the best i've had. i never knew mussels could be so tender! i'm so used to having them dried out/rubbery as they're generally - and unfortunately - cooked.\n\nsides: corn! get lots of corn with your seafood of choice. shake it in the bag, so it gets coated with the seasoning and save it for whenever you're done with your seafood. it will be all sorts of juicy goodness. my only regret: not getting more. the fries and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were perfectly cooked, but beyond that, weren't anything special. especially if you're trying to eat on a budget, i'd load up on some sides with your seafood, otherwise you'll easily be spending $25+ per person to fill up.\n\nchicken nuggets: as we had a non seafood eater, he got some chicken nuggets which were pretty bad. they looked and tasted like they came from some foster farms frozen bag. however, since this place is meant for seafood, i don't hold it against the restaurant.", 
            "pretty good...for vegas.  here's my recap:  parking could be better.  not a lot of spaces.  available spaces were a little tight.  seated immediately upon entering.  the place was pretty busy.  many tables with chairs, some with booths.  some booth seating was not accessible because the neighboring table was too close.  servers were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.  menu offered crawfish, shrimp, oysters, clam, lobster, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, and snow crab.  all market prices.  seasoning choices were <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.  choice of mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy.  sides: corn, potato, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, rice, rolls, and sausage.  also, appetizers were etoufee and a large variety of fried items: calamari, hot wings, soft shell crab, catfish, shrimp, and chicken nuggets.  we ordered two pounds of boiled shrimp: one <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> medium and the other <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> medium.  bibs were served first.  the bottom of the bib folds over to make a pocket to catch debris you drop.  we also ordered a side of white rice.  the cook time seemed about right, not real fast, but not too slow either.  constant line for men's restroom.  only one person at a time.  many people waiting to get in to wash their hands after eating.  the food comes out as it is ready, not served at the same time.  i prefer this method.  the shrimp is served in a clear plastic bag and the shells are left on the table.  plastic table cloth makes for quick and easy clean up.  the shrimp was good sized, hot, and flavorful.  there was a little extra juice in the bottom of the bag which we used to dip our shrimp once peeled.  also, we ladled some on the rice for a bit of flavor.  the shrimp was head and shell on.  this requires a little work, but is the traditional way to serve, saves the kitchen a bit of time, and leads one to believe the shrimp were alive when cooked.  i lived in louisiana for many years so i know there is a difference between <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> and cajun style, but i don't know why they made the distinction here.  most patrons in vegas won't know the difference.  the difference here is that louisiana had more butter and cajun was more traditional with more spices and less brother allowing the sweet flavor of the shrimp to come through better.  the difference is almost not noticeable, but i prefer their <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>.  the rice was okay.  all in all the food was pretty good.  we really enjoyed it.  on a side note, they did not purge the shrimp.  that is, the gastrointestinal track and the poop were still in the shrimp.  vegas patrons don't know any better.  its kind of gross, but i ate anyways knowing that it won't hurt you (otherwise, the place would have been shut down a long time ago).  there were plenty of paper napkins at each table and wet wipes served at the counter and with the bill, but i would have preferred a washing station, similar to those at cravin cajun.  you get really, really messy eating boiled shrimp and that stuff is super painful if you get it in your eyes.  they do serve alcohol, but we had tap water, which was served in styrofoam cups.  the server did not ask if we wanted lemon, but she brought out a styrofoam bowl with almost two whole lemons (kind of a waste).  shrimp was $8.99 per pound and the side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> was $2.  we really enjoyed this experience and will be coming back.  i tried the crawfish on a previous visit here.  it was the best crawfish in vegas.  flavor was right, but a bit small for louisiana standards.  i love crawfish, but think the shrimp is a better deal because there is much more meat.  i really like this place, but cravin cajun is better.", 
            "this was my first crawfish experience and it was pretty yum!  we had 1lb of shrimp (hot n juicy - medium spice), 1 1lb of shrimp (<mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> - medium spice), and 1lb of crawfish (hot n juicy - medium spice).  also got beers and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.    were told to go less spicy than normal because their spice was hotter than everyone else's, so we went medium.  really wish we had gone hotter.  we also did not shake our bags, which after reading a few reviews, could have made a big difference.  geez, aren't we smart?!?it was super crowded, but we got the last available table, so no wait.  service was really fast, it seemed like we ordered and five minutes later we were opening steaming plastic bags!  food was great, incredibly messy and i thought it was a little pricey.  not sure if i would go back here, but it was definitely an experience.  i feel like i lived a little. i will come back here very soon,all my friends like it .", 
            "i love this place. it offers quite the experience and their <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> is always great with anything. anything you order is awesome. it can be quite pricey depending on what you order, but it is money well spent.", 
            "this place is far from the glitz and glamour of the strip both in location and in style.  gone are the flashing lights, white tablecloths and candles, replaced by beer in bottles, cheesy lobster bibs and food served in plastic bags.\n\ni will say, though, that it was delicious.  i got the crawfish boil with the signature sauce.  the sauce can be ordered to whatever level of heat you desire.  i went for the extra spicy, which i will warn lives up to its name.  \n\nthere is a lot of flavor here, and the sides were no less disappointing.  from the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> to the corn on the cob, everything was excellent.\n\nthis place is obsessed with quality through simplicity, and it's no surprise that the crawfish is shipped in fresh each morning.\n\nfinally, i would be remiss if i didn't mention the prices.  everything here is priced well below what i would consider reasonable for what is delivered, making this a huge value for the dollar.\n\nif you're hankering for something more low key, more down home and (way) less glamourous than what's on offer on las vegas boulevard, stop on in.", 
            "ok, i'm not a las vegas local (even though my 2 brothers-in-law are).  so i found about hot n juicy from tv, specifically travel channel's man vs food.  knowing that this place was been made famous from this show, i came here for lunch on friday of my last vegas visit.\n\nwe met one of my brothers-in-law for lunch here, arriving in the parking lot 5 minutes before 12 noon.  even though the restaurant wasn't even open yet, there were over a dozen people waiting outside the door already!  \n\nonce the staff let the horde in, we were seated right away and given menus.  as this is an asian-owned establishment, i recommend not ordering all spicy seasoning, unless you can power through the heat.  here's what i ordered for our party of 3:\n\n1 pound of shrimp, with <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, mild spice\n1 pound of crawfish, louisana style, medium spice\n1 order of calamari\n1 order of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\n\nthe fries and calamari came out first; they were good and hot, but not exceptional.  but when the shrimp and crawfish arrived, the real feast began.  the shrimp were big, and the sauce was mild and tasty.  and while the crawfish were cooked in a \"medium\" sauce, it was plenty hot for me and my dining companions.  just be careful not to suck the sauce too quickly; it will clear up your sinuses in a hurry!\n\njust like any of these seafood boil places, be ready to get down and dirty.  they have lobster bibs and full rolls of paper towels on the tables for a reason!\n\noverall, this was one of our favorite meals in las vegas.  it's in chinatown and pretty far away from the strip, so rent a car to get here.", 
            "went here for the first time on a friday night.  we went to the location further west but there is also one closer to the freeway. i assume they are the same.  it was packed but worth the wait. we ordered shrimp, lobster, snow crab, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, corn and rounds of beer. we ordered everything medium and hot n juicy. the food was great and really messy. it was a fun experience and will go here again. just be prepared for the food to stare back at you since they leave the heads on!  also don't plan on leaving without food all over and juice squirting you in the face.", 
            "i have finally had the chance to check this place out and what a disappointment.\n\nlet me start by saying... our waiter, nick... damn. it was almost like he was fed up in being there and just didn't give a fck. once we sat down, he came and yes... threw out menus in our face, threw sugar bags down on the table, and asked us you guys want anything to drink?! daaaamn serious?!?!! why boo??!! why??! wow okay... . came back with our teas and took our orders.. that's the last time we saw his face. \n\nit took numerous attempts to get a runner, server, whoever worked there to ask for refills, which finally was able to be refilled, but with regular tea when i had raspberry. nasty... the whole time we were there... our throats were like a desert and our drinks were empty.. so damn empty,  the melted ice made a few gulps of replenishment to get us through our meals. we had to ask for gloves, we had to ask again for our pepper and  limes on the side, which our server never brought, and we even had to ask the next table to please get their server's attention for us after she was done giving them their food orders, just so we could... ask. even our tools to crack open our crabs were not the right tools, but after trying to get a server's attention. it was more tiring to wave down a server than tear apart our meals. from the frustration on the service here, i tore the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> with my own bare hands and ate like an animal. tearing it with my own straight teeth!!! grrr!!! i ended up doing the.. break the shell with my fingers and gently wiggle wiggle the meat out. several times i showed my great company that i conquered a looooong piece of crab meat ha haaaa! but then she shows off her piece, which was thicker and longer than mine!!! oh yeah?!??!!!! i had that ooo impressed face and nodded my head. we entertained each other... but never once were we checked back upon to see how we were doing or we needed anything. it was literally the worst service for a fun-filled environment. \n\ni heard their other new location has better service, but this experience makes me think twice to even want to give them my business.\n\nthe food was the only thing that made me want to give any stars to this establishment. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> was excellent in texture and taste. the shrimp, crab, and side of sausage we ordered were full of spice and with the combination of asking limes on the side to make your own sauce.. it tasted refreshing, sweet, spicy, peppery, bitter, and ended with a great bite from the acidity of the limes. don't forget to ask for those pepper and limes on the side.. makes a great impact with the flavors of the spices that were cooked in with the crab and shrimp. even if you have to hunt someone down that worked there to get it! i will note that the food deserves high remarks. however, due to the lack of service we received here, it's unfortunate to give it such a low rating. but i must speak the truth and the service here was... non-existence. damn, damn shame if you ask me. it ruined a good meal experience and for us to constantly try to get a server's attention is just bad news. we couldn't enjoy our food and it shouldn't be that way.\n\nand for that reason alone... first and last time dining here. wasn't so \"hot\" after all and that's the juicy part.", 
            "the crawfish here were delicious. and a little warning, please trust them when they tell ya spicy means spicy. believe it or your lips would feel like they are burning.  and their secret recipe (the hot & juicy flavor) is the way to go, sooo hot and soooo juicy! =p \n\nbesides the crawfish, their <mark>Shrimp</mark> are also delicious; tender, juicy, and very flavorful as well. we did not try the <mark>King Crab</mark> leg, which looked amazing when some lady cracked those shells and pulled out a whole long strip of crab meat. holy cow, wish i could go back now and get some! \n\noh oh, and their <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are soooo sooo good. it was the first time when i did not find any soggy fries in the bunch and every single one of them was perfectly fried (crispy) and sweet! oh man...\n\nbesides the food, the service here is very friendly; they are very busy, but everybody still greet the customers with smiles and are knowledgeable with recommendations...another thumbs up. the shadiest part of my dining experience here is that they use all plastic cups for drinks and water. guess it gives you a seafood shack type of feel and most importantly, easier to clean as they can just wrap everything in the paper table cloths and throw away. maybe should consider recycling cuz that's just a lot of paper and plastic everyday? \n\nnow that i've done my let's save earth ad, allow me to highly recommend this place if you know you are a crawfish fan....a must in vegas.", 
            "i really enjoyed myself when i ate here the other evening. i saw this restaurant on an episode of \"man vs food,\" so naturally i had to eat here on my trip to las vegas. we ordered a pound of \"crawfish\" with 'hot & juicy sauce (mild)' & a pound of \"shrimp\" with 'garlic/butter (mild)' sauce. they both were amazing and the fact that you eat with plastic gloves (optional) is super fun. be prepared to smell like seafood for a while and do not wear white. shper fun & a must do while in las vegas. \n\n\n\np.s. order a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. yum!", 
            "absolutely flavorful!! my favorite is the snow crabs extra spicy. makes my mouth water just thinking about it. lol. and you must order corn. it so sweet and melts in your mouth. and if you like sweet <mark>Potato</mark> order <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. crispy and sweet.", 
            "i heard about this place from a friend, and during my last trip to sin city, made it a point to come here.  \n\ngot here around 8:00, and waited about 15 mins, which was not bad at all considering i normally wait around 2 hours at boiling crab.  \n\nonce we were seated, we ordered <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>,  the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>, 1 pound of crawfish, 2 pounds of shrimp, both with the hot n' juicy sauce.  \n\nthe hot and juicy sauce lacked flavor, we literally had to add salt to it  to liven it up.  the sweet <mark>Potato</mark> fries were not crispy, and the catfish had way too much batter.\n\neh , maybe i came on an off day, but i am willing to give this place another try.", 
            "i have heard good things about this place for a while and have driven past both locations pretty often. however, i have never really wanted to try hot n juicy crawfish because i am kind of like a cat, lol. i don't like messy eating and if i am going to go out and pay for my food, i prefer all the work to be done for me, if you know what i mean. \n\nthe in-laws were in town and have been wanting to eat here, so we finally came here for dinner the other night. we arrived at just the right time because there were a few tables still open and we were seated right away. 10 minutes later, the restaurant was full and many people were waiting outside. we had no luck with parking. the parking lot is very small and we had to park across the street. \n\nmy husband and the in-laws ordered a variety of seafood: <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, clams, shrimp crawfish, and catfish. \n\ntheir opinions:\n- the shrimp and catfish were the best\n- the crawfish required too much work for too little meat\n- the crab was very hard to take apart\n- \"mild\" was still pretty spicy\n\ni ordered the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. i know, boring right? the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> wasn't very good. i think that the size was decent, but there was just too much breading on them. after eating 2 pieces, i didn't want anymore. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were standard, nothing special. \n\ni'm glad i tried it, but i don't think i would come back again because i didn't enjoy it too much. however, i will give this place 4 starts because my family thought it was alright and had a good time. service was friendly and attentive. we even had nice neighbors who showed us what they had ordered and commented on what tasted good.\n\njust a few tips:\n- do not wear nice clothing because juices will squirt everywhere and you will get dirty!\n-remember to take a shower and do laundry asap because you will smell like the restaurant even after you leave! skin, hair, clothes, everything!", 
            "we came to eat here after our stint with exotic cars at lv motor speedway. my friend saw hot n juicy crawfish in man vs. food. good cajun seafood. definitely better than salty boiling crab but just a tad behind our local ray's crab. we had 2lbs of shrimp, 2bls of clams, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and rice. i liked their clams the best; tender and delightful. big plus on their servers that could definitely strike up some conversation. \n\nwhat i like the most is that their hot is hot and not watered down. its definitely a tingling sensation in my palette that is delightful and pleasing. i am pretty sure their spicy could be a workout. \n\nwe will probably be back if we desire hot cajun seafood and we are in vegas.",

            "a-okay\n\ni wouldn't go out of my way to come here again but i wouldn't rule it out if it was a convenient choice and my group was large. we had a party of 8, ordered lots of things and just shared with the table. the service was friendly and attentive, the prices weren't bad, and the place was pretty clean inside even though both locations on this street are in raunchy strip malls, and this location has very little parking. \n\ncorn fritters: hands down the best thing we had here \ncat fish: yummy corn meal battered and seasoned perfectly\ncalamari: lightly battered fried golden okay on the seasoning\n<mark>Cajun Fries</mark>: a delicious smoldering fire in my mouth\nplan fries: blah\n<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> med spicy, and <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> pounds of shrimp: okay very large juicy shrimp that were fresh, but they should marinate the shrimp in their many sauces or seasonings for a while before boiled or use more seasoning while boiling the sauce just didn't stick making the shrimp pretty bland. \ncorn: pretty good balanced the shrimp, although my mother didn't like that they put her piece in the <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> sauce instead of on the side.

            "am a big fan of a shrimp boil, but this place brought it to a new level.  we ordered shrimp and crawfish--loved them both. as far as flavoring we like hot and juicy which is a mix of all the flavors. wouldalso  recommend adding the sausage to either for a few dollars extra. also the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> are great.  went for lunch and got right in, but we were there when they opened.",

            "never get enough of it! always have <mark>Shrimp</mark> hot n juicy or <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>. 5/5! <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> is delicious as well. 5/5! my friends always add a corn. i ordered lobster once. 4/5! lol i don't know how to eat it!! they said they can crack it for you. crabs are good, my friends' favorite! 5/5! <mark>Sausage</mark> are optional,  i had them sometimes. 3/5! i have been both places. my friends like it on decatur 4/5!,  but i kinda like it at valley view because it is newer, even though there is wired smells and long queue! 3/5!", 
            "the only time i eat a pound plus of food is when i come here! my favorite thing to get is the one pound bag of shrimp, <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> flavor, extra spicy. i've tried the other different flavorings but this is by far my favorite. they also have clams, oysters, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, french fries, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, rice, chicken nuggets (for your non-seafood loving friends that tag along), crawfish and other fixings. \n\nin my opinion, this location by decatur, is better than the one off of valley view or off eastern.\n\nif you've never been here before, be prepared to use your hands and get messy. my \"system\" is to lay a couple sheets of paper towels underneath the bag of shrimp to absorb any stray sauce drippings so it doesn't drip off the table and into my lap. i also have my orange soda with a straw within drinking distance so i don't have to grab the styrofoam cup and get sauce all over it. after i put my plastic bib on, i put lemon juice on my fingers and wipe them off, then put the gloves on. after i'm done eating, i put more lemon juice on my fingers to help remove the smell of skrrrimps and seasoning and then wash my hands. \n\nanyway, the food is really good. everything is tasty. service is always pretty decent. whenever i need my fix, i come here!",

            "ever since i have found the joys of boiling crab in california. ( http://www.kats9lives.com/2008/06/whole-sha-bang.html )\nsince we were taking a family vacation and the parental units like good and cheap foods, i thought hey it would be nice to go cajun and i came across this place.\n\nfor the full review and pics go to http://www.kats9lives.com/2008/07/hot-n-juicy-in-vegas.html\n\ni don't know if this place or boiling crab came first, but i think boiling crab probably because they have a bunch of stores.  either way they are both pretty good and a good value. ^_^ \n\nwe ordered shrimp, crawfish, fried catfish, wings, and more.  the sauce was good for the shrimp and crawfish.  it's light on the celery, which i like.  we got a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> to eat the rice with and that was really good.\n\nit was too bad that they ran out of the gumbo.  the service was friendly and the food was good.  i think we decided that the shrimp is a better deal because you barely get any meat in the crawfish, but those crawfish are good! just too much work! =p lol the prices at boiling crab are cheaper but hot n juicy crawfish was a great find.\n\nmy family really enjoyed it and the bill was very reasonable.  if you like cajun food and you are in vegas then definitely stop by! ^_-", 
            "i have never been to an authentic crawfish place in the deep south but i can say that this tasted fantastic.\n\nit's set up knowing you're going to eat like a slob. the table is covered with plastic. each table gets its own paper towel roll. everyone gets a bib. and afterwards you get handiwipes. i just went to wash my hands in the bathroom.\n\ni had mild, which other places call medium. their mild is good enough for me. good heat without killing my mouth. shrimp and crawfish were 10.99 a pound when we went 1-2 days ago. i had a pound of each. i'm glad i tried the crawfish but my favorite was the shrimp simply because there was more meat and i liked that it was sweeter and larger bits to eat. i was stuffed so next time if having the crawfish only, get 2 pounds as there is more shell than meat. if shrimp, i think a pound is just fine. i saw someone else get the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs and i may order that next time but i have a hell of a time getting the meat out of those so i may not if they are not pre cut down the length.\n\ni had the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> which is a equal mixture of their 3 sauces( cajun, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>). i'm not sure what it was, but there was an underlying orange and it tasted fantastic! maybe it wasn't orange but it didn't taste like lemon. perhaps it's part of their boil, or an accent in their <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce but wow. really complimented the food and went so yummy with the shrimp.\n\ni want to try the sauces alone next time but it's going to be hard to do because i know i like the mixture already.\n\ni ordered ice tea, and a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> in addition to my seafood boils. the ice tea was ok. not fantastic but good, but then i love a really really strong tea.\n\nthe rice was the perfect compliment for peeling seafood over. it caught all of the juices and was tasty eating when i was done peeling. yum yum good!!!\n\nmy husband had the catfish with fries. he finished way before i did and that was a bit of a bummer because the best part about eating there is peeling with your friends. friends don't let friends eat there without ordering a peeling meal.\n\nthe \"man versus food\" guy is going to be there on thursday but i really would only go if you're interested in crowds. nah..not for me. i just want their good food. i don't need a show to tell me something i already know. go if you like but man it's going to be a zoo.",

            "been meaning to visit here when i'm in town on business, and finally was able to come here the other night. thanks to yelpers, i now have another great place to add to my list.\n\nthis was not only a great place to grab some food, but reasonably priced with very friendly servers and a fun experience. just make sure you don't have any paper cuts because you will be using your hands! and if you get some of the spicy seasoning, then beware!\n\nthey do provide you with a bib, which i needed. actually, i needed two since i ripped the first one and it became unusable. fail on my part. coupled with the plastic on the table and the paper towels, you do not wear your sunday best here, unless you'd like it covered in their delicious sauces.\n\ni had the shrimp, calamari, and a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>. wanted to try the crawfish but i had a craving for shrimp. maybe next time, i come to vegas often!", 
            "the is an updated review\n\ni went back a month later..prices the same..food the same. wonderful stuff. this time it was the service that sucked and eating out is and should always be an enjoyable experience..entertaining. food was great. service killed the experience. if you enjoy seafood and are willing to risk some really unpredictable quality of service..then yes go enjoy yourself. sometimes you can let a bad server roll off of your back and eat on because the food is worth it but this time i couldn't even do that because we half of our requests and orders were misplaced or forgotten. great....\n\ni have to drive from lake las vegas to get to the middle of town where this is located. so..number one, the first thing that i ask afterwards is..was it worth the gas money and the time driving. no it wasn't. it's been awhile so the details and the names of my servers are fuzzy but in general what happened was this...\n\n1) i ordered rice with my crawdads and shrimp because i like to catch the juice in the steamed rice and eat it after i've done with the seafood. my order of seafood came but i was never told they ran out <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>. what irritates me most is i ordered long before the table next to me arrived to the restaurant but they got the last of the rice. huh? so i ask about my rice and the waitress tells me they've run out. i ask if they are going to make more and she says no. so i shrug and ask for some bread and a bowl so i could spoon some seasoning into for dipping. she says..we don't have bread but we have rolls. again...huh? okay..so i say that's fine and order a roll. my bread didn't come for a long time so i ask if i may have a roll from another server. he brings the roll finally. no bowl still. i just figure..alright..this is a bad night and drop asking for a bowl.\n\n2) we arrived more than an hour until they were ready to close but were told their kitchen was closing in 5 minutes...so we would be unable to order. i think..strange..but you're open for just over another hour. later she tells other people the kitchen is closing as well but we hear them arguing a bit about ordering and she learns that the kitchen is still open for new and later hours and she comes back to tell me we have more time to eat and order other things. i ask...hint hint hint...are you going to be making more rice? because if so, i would still love to have a bowl. yep! so i put in another order <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>. yay...rice. it just isn't the same without it.\n\n3) finally the rice gets there. the attention to our table is dismal, and there were only 8 tables in total with 2 servers waiting the entire room. we should have had decent service. i cannot comment on if this is abnormal service because in my first review we got there right when they had opened and it was wonderful. it wasn't a matter of flagging anyone down..it was a matter of getting our waiters to remember our orders or requests. my god...if remembering isn't working for you..how about this? a pen and paper.\n\nto gloss over it all we ordered a refill on the iced tea. never got it. we ordered more rolls..never got that. asked for a bowl. never got it. we decided to order something new and asked for an order of calimari. never got that. i'm batting 0 out of 4 here. it wasn't just bad service it was some of the worst i've had in a long time. the sort of bad service that you talk about all the way home because it feels like you just got dropped into the twilight zone and wonder if it were really real.\n\nwe got up and paid for the bill. asked them to cancel our calimari order. they said \"what order?\" just par for the course! lol\nthen we asked for a container and extra bag to put the extra shrimp in to eat later at home because as much as i disliked the service the food was really wonderful. didn't get that. should i have expected any better that night. geez was there some kind of karmic payback at work here??? lol\n\nwe asked again..finally on the 3rd request we got a bag and a container. i finally just broke down and asked if it were an unusually bad day...short one person on staff or something ..anything to explain the really bad experience..the missed orders, the forgetting requests, not knowing their own business hours. etc etc etc\nnope, he said. great....\n\nanyways..i think the thing that finally topped it off for us was having to pay for the stupid <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> after that fiasco...when i think would normally have been comped when a bad experience is actually brought up to staff. what's a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> cost versus having lost 2 customers and telling everyone how bad the experience was? ah well....as an after thought i have to tell you something i discovered that was really awesome.\n\nif you go to the big asian seafood market like manilla seafood or ranch 99 you can pretty often find a really incredible thing. 5 pound bags of frozen crawdads in cajun seasoning ready to cook and eat for only 10.99 or so. mmmmm.", 
            "updated review #2\n\nsummery:\n\na 4 star rating is still excellent dining in my book btw. i reserve one open star for the future if service can be improved. the food is always 5 star however. \n\nthis update is to raise a rating that was lowered due to poor service and dining experience as detailed in a previous review.\n\nthe owners addressed all of my issues, and  was professional in his communication with me. any negative issues i did have were dealt with in outstanding manner.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nif you read my previous reviews you'll notice a negative experience i had reviewed as my first update. it was based strictly on poor service. the food has always been outstanding. what i would like to say in this newest updated review is that, more business ownersshould take up similar customer service. kudos to the owner of hot n juicy crawfish.\n\ni gave this place another chance because the food has always been a delight. (still love the shrimp over the crawfish) if you go, always add a pound of shrimp.\n\nif you decide to eat at this establishment, you can be assured of excellent food. if you have a negative experience, and bring it to the owners attention, you can be assured of excellent customer service. i've learned that there is a difference between bringing it to an employees attention versus the owner when it's really negative. my experience with the owner here proves he cares for his business and the experience of his customers.\n\nwhen i went back, prices on the crayfish were the same as before. stable market pricing probably because he has stable distributors. the crawfish is fresh. the shrimp was sweet and meaty. i had almost the same meal as before but included the calamari that we were not able to order before. that was tender and the coating was light and non greasy.\n\ni think what struck me most was the owner had read my single negative experience and took my negative points and made changes in his operation. when i had said they ran out <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>, he told me he purchased a larger rice cooker. amazing responses. there were a few other things that showed how he cares for his business.\n\nin the few months i've been watching this place it's grown in popularity. there was the man vs food show taping on food network for example and the following viewing party. sometimes one wonders if popularity like that can falsely lift up the appeal of a place but i have to tell you, behind the scenes it's simple, excellent food, and acceptable service that makes this place a gem. \n\ni think what i had experienced was scaling issues. as a place becomes more popular they have to adapt with new ways of coping so there are less nights they run out of what ever ingredients...servers learning how to deal with busier tables..etc etc. they are adapting quickly and solving issues that crop up and maintaining an excellent standard of food.\n\nif you go, do not expect a 5 star quality of service. but....it's not bad. it's average and acceptable if you go with the right frame of mind. what shines here is the food. not quite sure what people are complaining about when they talk about the quality of their crawfish. perhaps my tune would change if i were from the deep south but i am not. my reality is what is around me, and for this area, they have the best crawfish and shrimp. do not compare a place to somewhere across the country. make comparisons with local places to help people that are looking for the -best in that local area-. it makes it easier for people that are just visiting. they don't care about what is better in some other part of the country.\n\nconcerning the bathrooms. objectively, i have never seen a line. perhaps on busier weekend nights you may have to wait your turn, but it's hardly a reason not to go. there is one woman's bathroom and one for the men.\n\namazingly good, comfort food. nothing is as satisfying than a big pile of seafood you eat with your fingers. they get it right, and the food out of this kitchen is always top level. i've tried numerous sauces now, numerous seafoods. different times of day and different days of the week. i find it better than joe's crab shack because it's authentic here. it's just a great place to bring your friends. it's not over contrived, full of themselves, or catering to tourists. it's just good food. go eat!", 
            "i have to start off by saying that i may be a bit biased since i looooooooooovvvvvvveeee boiling crab. \n\nafter we landed, our first stop was to drop off our luggage at our hotel and then we jumped into a cab \"hot n' juicy please!\" this place isn't too far from the strip, a 5-10 minutes ride from where we were staying [venetian], about a $10.00 cab fare. when we arrived there were only a table or two dining which got us worried since we're used to boiling crab always being packed. as we were overlooking the menu i noticed that they serve blue moon, which deserves extra brownie points! \n\nwe ordered 2 pounds of the shrimp in their hot n' juicy sauce which is a combination of all their sauces, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and an order <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>. [fyi: you can't order half pounds here ]the food took quite a while to come out, but once we got to eating we noticed that the shrimp were wayyy over cooked. the skin and heads of the shrimp were falling off, and some pieces of shrimp were definitely too soft for my liking. we were probably only able to get through a pound-if that, of our order. but their sauce weren't too bad, definitely better than most places i've tried, but definitely doesn't live up to boiling crab's whole shabang sauce. \n\nall in all, this place isn't bad; if i'm ever in las vegas having major <mark>Shrimp</mark> cravings i wouldn't mind coming back.", 
            "we've been coming here ever since they opened, you know, before they were uber popular because of man vs. food, before there was an hour wait to get seated,... we'd be the only ones in the restaurant and those days are long gone. \n \nplain and simple, the food is good. we had crawfish and shrimp with <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>- less than mild, 2 sides <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>... ok, i love garlic but there's an abundance of it in the food. if you're not a fan of garlic, you are not going to like this  particular sauce. \n\nthe taste and smell of the food is pretty strong, thanks to the massive amounts of garlic, you can smell like seafood and garlic for a couple days after you eat here... no matter how many times you shower, no matter how many times i tried to get rid of the smell, it just would not go away. so if you've got some where to be and the smell of garlic and seafood will not be so appealing to the people around you, i suggest to come back another day because, it's no joke, the smell sticks for days :) \n\n(i'm doing laundry today, 2 days later and my purse and clothes still smell like garlic)", 
            "3.5\nwas in vegas for the weekend, and a friend of mine came here before, and i wanted to try it...then i found out man vs. food was here to have the crawfish as well...so i was super excited!\nwe came here around 6:30 on a sunday night...and the wait was about 30 minutes...ok not bad, well just have a couple beers while we wait....\nthen the girl come up to us as says...theyre all out of crawfish. \nwhat?!?!? this place says hot and juicy crawfish in the name...hwo can you run out??? -1\nok...so we were debating whether or not to stay, but we did make the trip off the strip to come here (yes..we came a long way..haha) so we decided to stay.\nwe ordered 2lbs of shrimp, and one dungeoness crab, fries, corn, susage....all hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, spicy. i also wanted etouffee, but they ran out of that as well! ugh. so we settled for <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> -_-\n\nwell when the food came, it was prety good and spicy. well let me tell you, normall yi would have gotten 2lbs of crawfish and 1lb of shrimp, and that would have been enough for 2 people, but since there were no crawfish, we ordered 2lbs of shrimp and one crab...\n2lbs of shrimp..is too much for 2 people. 1lb would have been sufficient. \nanyways, the foods was pretty tasty, but i cant help but compare it to boiling crab in california...which i love..and i think it tastes better...and they dont ever run out of crawfish... -.5 \n\nso...yea....thats about it.", 
            "i never thought i would come across a restaurant that could knock my favorite steak place off the charts, but this is now my #1 favorite restaurant in the whole world - not just for seafood, any food!  i never even liked garlic before hot n juicy; the place permeates with a deep garlicky, buttery smell as soon as you drive up (and so will you for 3 days after you eat here).  get the crawfish, get the shrimp, get the crab, but whatever you do, get it in the special sauce.  there's something in that \"special\" sauce that's indescribable but keeps me coming back week after week - could it be crack, could it be heroin?  i don't know, but i'm an addict for life.  if i ever become allergic to shellfish (knock on wood), my family have specific instructions to put me outta my misery.  or, i'll just die eating at my favorite restaurant hot n juicy.  trust me, you will not be disappointed; the wait is worth it.  go before 6pm to avoid a looooong wait.  it's busy all days of the week.  make sure to get the corn, some <mark>Sausage</mark> and add a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> to catch all the juices as they run off your hands when cracking the crawfish, shrimp, and crab.  squeeze the head juice into the rice for extra flavor.  eat the rice last, yum!  damn you adam richman for telling everyone about las vegas locals' best hole-in-the-wall seafood place.  i feel sorry for the tourists that do try hot n juicy and then go home craving it because it's so amazing - i'm lucky to be living here in lv so i can eat there whenever i want!!!  i'm waiting to hear someone say they moved to lv for hot n juicy lol!\n\ni just checked out the boiling crab in san jose and hot & juicy is stll the winner in my book.  sauce is more buttery and savory and the servers are the greatest here in lv.", 
            "hot and juicy is definitely some hot stuff! i came here for the first time with michelle w. last year and i really don't remember it being this packed for a weekend. however, the 20-30 minute wait was well worth the wait. we decided on the hot and juicy snow crabs in medium, the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> shrimp in mild, <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> basket with the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and a side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> for me. i was definitely salivating waiting for the food to come out...which actually didn't take very long! everything was soooooo good! next time though i think i will stick with the mild hotness level. my mouth was on fire by the time i was through...the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were probably not the best idea with all of this hotness going on, but i guess that's why they call it hot and juicy. everything that we ordered totaled up to about 45 bucks plus sodas....not a bad deal. btw....the rice with some sauce is oh so delicious! i will definitely be back for more garlic dousing!",

            "this is a recent discovery of mine. \nit's hard to find a good place that only does seafood, and not just with the plain old butter. as many of stated, you will be expected to get your hands dirty at this place, however they do offer bibs and gloves if needed. and if seeing shrimp with their heads on scares you, then this is not the place for you.  i'm not a big crawfish fan, i just stick to my regular choice when i come here, hot & juicy style, mild, 1 lb of shrimp with corn & sausage with a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> on the side. it comes to less than$15 total before tax & tips. it is cheap considering it's fresh and well-seasoned seafood!\n\nthe only down side i would say is the parking as many have mentioned here. i was lucky couple times and found a spot in their little strip mall parking lot. but other times i had to park in church's chicken lot because all the side streets were taken. and throughout dinner i was nervous that my car would get towed, but luckily it didn't. so my suggestion is carpool, go early if you can! otherwise if you have a big party and go later, be expected to wait at least 30~45 min at least.", 
            "in hawaii, you get shrimp trucks. in vegas, you get hot n juicy crawfish!\n\nthis place is amazing! you order a pound (or five) of whatever seafood you want in whatever sauce you want and they bring it to you in a plastic bag so you can get your hands dirty! oh, and it gets messy (but don't worry, they have a bib for that).\n\nthis place is pretty packed and there's a wait, but it's worth it. there are many types of seafood to choose from (shrimp, crab, crawfish, etc) as well as seasonings and the level of spice you want. <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> was the best. the price is relatively low, the <mark>Shrimp</mark> were decently sized, and the service was excellent. if you don't want to get your fingers dirty, you can always ask for gloves (but where's the fun in that). also, remember to add <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and a side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> (if you're local like me)!\n\nsince there's no place like this back home, i'm going to have to try replicating this in my kitchen. :)", 
            "wow, prepared to be blown away by the intense flavors that are this casual eatery's signature.  we ordered several pounds of crawfish (hot & juicy, mild), shrimp (hot & juicy, mild), <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>, and snow crab.  we also had sides <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> and creole fries.  even though we ordered mild, these crawfish really pack some heat and a lot of garlicky goodness.\nthe corn that comes in the bag is so saturated with the yummy sauce, and i wish there were more corn cobs in the bag.  i also wish i had some bread to sop up all the sauce.\ni actually enjoyed the shrimp and snow crab more than i did the crawfish, probably because there's more meat and the shell is easier to peel.\nthis is a place where you get down and dirty, bibs and all (gloves optional).  really fun and worth checking out.", 
            "i would give this restaurant a three stars. don't take me wrong i like hot n' juicy crawfish.however,if compare it with the boiling crab i prefer the boiling crab to the hot n' juicy crawfish.why? it is because the boiling crab sauce is a bit more delicious and suit my taste better than the hot n' juicy crawfish.a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> here served in a small bowl so if you are a big eater it won't be enough. the hot n' juicy and the boiling crab has a similar menu except the boiling crab have gumbo and the hot n' juicy doesn't. \n\nhowever,if you are an alcohol drinker hot n' juicy crawfish has an alcohol license while the boiling crab doesn't serve alcohol. \n\ni would give this restaurant 3 or 3 1/2 stars.", 
            "pretty good...for vegas.  here's my recap:  parking could be better.  not a lot of spaces.  available spaces were a little tight.  seated immediately upon entering.  the place was pretty busy.  many tables with chairs, some with booths.  some booth seating was not accessible because the neighboring table was too close.  servers were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.  menu offered crawfish, shrimp, oysters, clam, lobster, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, and snow crab.  all market prices.  seasoning choices were <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.  choice of mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy.  sides: corn, potato, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, rice, rolls, and sausage.  also, appetizers were etoufee and a large variety of fried items: calamari, hot wings, soft shell crab, catfish, shrimp, and chicken nuggets.  we ordered two pounds of boiled shrimp: one <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> medium and the other <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> medium.  bibs were served first.  the bottom of the bib folds over to make a pocket to catch debris you drop.  we also ordered a side of white rice.  the cook time seemed about right, not real fast, but not too slow either.  constant line for men's restroom.  only one person at a time.  many people waiting to get in to wash their hands after eating.  the food comes out as it is ready, not served at the same time.  i prefer this method.  the shrimp is served in a clear plastic bag and the shells are left on the table.  plastic table cloth makes for quick and easy clean up.  the shrimp was good sized, hot, and flavorful.  there was a little extra juice in the bottom of the bag which we used to dip our shrimp once peeled.  also, we ladled some on the rice for a bit of flavor.  the shrimp was head and shell on.  this requires a little work, but is the traditional way to serve, saves the kitchen a bit of time, and leads one to believe the shrimp were alive when cooked.  i lived in louisiana for many years so i know there is a difference between <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> and cajun style, but i don't know why they made the distinction here.  most patrons in vegas won't know the difference.  the difference here is that louisiana had more butter and cajun was more traditional with more spices and less brother allowing the sweet flavor of the shrimp to come through better.  the difference is almost not noticeable, but i prefer their <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>.  the rice was okay.  all in all the food was pretty good.  we really enjoyed it.  on a side note, they did not purge the shrimp.  that is, the gastrointestinal track and the poop were still in the shrimp.  vegas patrons don't know any better.  its kind of gross, but i ate anyways knowing that it won't hurt you (otherwise, the place would have been shut down a long time ago).  there were plenty of paper napkins at each table and wet wipes served at the counter and with the bill, but i would have preferred a washing station, similar to those at cravin cajun.  you get really, really messy eating boiled shrimp and that stuff is super painful if you get it in your eyes.  they do serve alcohol, but we had tap water, which was served in styrofoam cups.  the server did not ask if we wanted lemon, but she brought out a styrofoam bowl with almost two whole lemons (kind of a waste).  shrimp was $8.99 per pound and the side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> was $2.  we really enjoyed this experience and will be coming back.  i tried the crawfish on a previous visit here.  it was the best crawfish in vegas.  flavor was right, but a bit small for louisiana standards.  i love crawfish, but think the shrimp is a better deal because there is much more meat.  i really like this place, but cravin cajun is better.", 
            "saw this place on man v food and hubby insisted that we try it..\n\nit's not bad.. but it's not great.. at least in my opinion.\n\nwe ordered two <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> and a pound of shrip.  we got the hot and juicy combo sauce at the mild spice.  we also ordered rice and i got the etouffe.\n\nbeing filipino, we can't really eat anything without our rice.. and sadly, they ran out <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> and we had to wait about 15-20 minutes to get ours.  they were so nice and apologetic about it that they took the rice off of our bill and gave it to us for free!\n \nthe rice came out cooked, but a little on the drier side than i prefer.. i don't know if it was because they were in a hurry to get it out.. or if that's the way they just cook their rice.. either way.. i was glad i had the etouffe to moisten my rice up.\n\nthe seafood was pretty good.  the sauce was a little runnier than what i'm used to.. we got to bucket crabs and crawfish in ontario and their sauce is thicker than here.. and that's something i prefer.  \n\nthe sauce here at hot and juicy was spicy at the mild level and that's how we like it!\n\nif given a choice, i think i would still prefer bucket crabs than here..  it was a nice treat to get to eat at a place featured on tv tho..", 
            "it has been a struggle deciding between three and four stars, but i have settled on four. i feel this place is slightly over-hyped and perhaps part of my let down was attributed to such high expectations due to this hype. i expected to be blown away, and instead i was just barely satisfied. \n\nwe ordered 1lb of shrimp in their signature sauce medium spicy, half a dozen oysters, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>. i also had two beers. the tab was very reasonable for the amount of food we received, hence why i opted for four instead of three star rating. i felt that the price was fair for the quality of the food. the sauce was good as was the shrimp. the fries were nothing special, but the cajun seasoning was very very good. the oysters were tiny and not memorable. the rice was great with the sauce from the shrimp. overall, the meal was fine but i would not seek this place out again or feel the desire to return unless the circumstance calls for it (friends who want to try it, i am in the area and rest of chinatown has burned down, etc).", 
            "if you're a big seafood fan like me, you'll love this place.\n\ni always order 1lb garlic shrimp, fried calamari and a cup <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>. its delicious! the shrimp is a tad too spicy to me but the calamari actually balances it. \n\nthe pricing is a bit too much for me. 1lb shrimp for around $10 and the fried food is also around the $10 range.\n\nits very casual, dim and loud place. go crazy with your food :)", 
            "viva las vegas!!! this has become my favorite restaurant in vegas! i go there every time. fresh crawfish flown in every day...shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> that are to die for, tender clams and the hot n juicy sauce (i prefer this sauce in hot but you get a choice of sauces & heat level) just covers everything with love! \n\nall the seafood is served in bags so it keeps absorbing the flavor of the sauce. the crawfish comes with a potato and corn in the bag, but you can get it added to everything else. i recommend adding these as the corn gets the flavor of the sauce and the potato absorbs the sauce. i also like getting a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> as well and you can pour the sauce on it! \n\nyes, you are peeling and ripping your food apart with your bare hands, so ladies, if you do not want to mess up your manicure, they do provide gloves. i went brazenly bare last time though and it was a lot easier to eat and when i was done all the sauce washed off easily.\n\nthey now have 2 locations... i prefer the one that is furthest from the strip. the one closer is very, very loud because of the building. it's like being in a tin can, so take the extra 5 minutes and head a little further up spring mountain.\n\ni cannot wait for my next hot n juicy fix!", 
            "my friend a'lene took me and my kids to this place similar to boiling crab in the oc. we ordered the garlic lemon flavored shrimp (mild) and cups <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>. the shrimp were huge and the sauce is to die for.  a'lene recommended pouring the sauce to the rice, twas perfect. i almost ate the whole bag of shrimp, almost forgot i was sharing it. hahaha\n\nthe only complaint i have is the 25 minute wait and the noise level in the restaurant. other than that, i highly recommend this restaurant. i could eat here everyday.", 
            "we had to wait about 20 minutes for our seat but it was worth it. the service was super nice. the choices were great! we ordered 4 pounds of crawfish, 2 pounds of shrimp, 1 pound of <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, extra corn and sides <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>. omg. i love it when my mouth is on fire and this was a great experience. they offered gloves if you didn't want to get your hands super spicy and they offered bibs! refills were frequent and the staff were attentive. i really enjoyed everything!!!",

            "whenever we come here, we are usually never disappointed. the sauce is amazing. i wouldn't be eating seafood if their sauce wasn't included. the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and live louisiana crawfish are the best items on their list. the price is surprisingly not that bad either. we ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of crawfish with a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> and paid 27 bucks. the crab and lobster are obviously more expensive but even then its worth it. hot n juicy medium sauce is the perfect heat and flavor. there are other sauces but hot n juicy sauce is a combination of all sauces and just has a much better flavor than competitors sauce such as boiling crab. parking is a bit on the downside but they have 2 other locations in vegas with more leg room and car room if you prefer more space.", 
            "went to hnj near decataur for lunch on may29, 2014.  coming from hawaii, we don't get to visit as often as we would like, plus there are so many other eateries in lv that we like to try.  we last ate at this location maybe two years ago - they didn't have fresh dunganess crab or crawfish at that time, so we hadn't gone back since, but after trying the fare at other 'crab' restaurants and not being 'thrilled', we decided it was time to go back to hnj (we've only been to this location on two previous visits and have never tried the other location down the road in central c-town).\ni guess you can say that my wife and i are crab people - we love to eat good shellfish and don't mind getting 'up to our elbows' while digging-in, shelling, peeling and devouring good/fresh crab or lobster and now fresh crawfish.  we lucked out on this visit - they had fresh live dunganess crab and crawfish.  so in our excitement with this good news, we ordered one dunganess crab (approx. 1.5#); one pound of snow crab (legs cluster); one pound of crawfish; and one pound of clams - all this prepared in their own 'hot n juicy' sauce, medium hot.  add to that two <mark>Potato</mark> and two corn and one <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>.  talk about plenty of food for two people!?  our server was joie - all the servers carry some type of 'walkie-talkie' equipment and can call the kitchen to weigh the individual dunganess crab and let you know right there how heavy your crab is, because everything is sold by the pound.  joie was super helpful; not only in answering our questions and taking our order, but throughout the entire meal - she would continuously come by our table to see how we were doing and if we needed any more drinks or whatever.\nwife ordered a coke and i ordered a beer - they were at our table in a jiff which was great since the outside temp was in the high nineties.  in good time, they brought each order out in double plastic bags - steaming and super hot.  this was my first experience at eating fresh crawfish and after this, i don't think that i can go back to any of that frozen stuff - totally different in texture and taste.  i would definitely order that again.  my wife kept on commenting how everything was so fresh, meaty and tasty, even the snow crab was solid and sweet.  as you probably have read in earlier reviews, there are no dishes or eating utensils, other than those plier-type crab-crackers and plastic shuckers.  also, they provide plastic bibs and gloves, but if you don't like eating with your hands and getting crab juice on your arms and face, this may not be for you.  definitely not a 'prom date' restaurant, but they provide plenty of paper towels and handi-wipes to address this messy, barbaric and fun experience. for us on this visit the food was definitely five stars.\nbut i must add, what made the experience here even more super was the positive atmosphere and overall vibe in this restaurant.  there was another female server and one male server - and i can't help but observe people when i'm out dining.  they both were like our server joie - super polite (not condescending), always cheery, helping out each other and trying their best to make your hnj meal a great experience - great food and great service.  we've been to too many restaurants where you have one and not the other; and for us on this day hnj was tops.",

(if not, the sauce will linger in your fingers and you will be sniffing it for the next few hours). to avoid long lines, i usually go between 2 to 4pm for snack. \n\nfor the jetsetters: the crawfish and shrimp is tsa approved as carryon. i guess the sauce is not considered liquid. i've flown with hot n juicy for about 3 times with no problem. make sure to triple bag these suckers or it will stink up your carryon very fast!!!", 
            "me and the hubbs decided to  go here for an afternoon date. place wasn't so busy and the waitress danielle, was very nice. we ordered a lobster, a whole <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, calamari for an appetizer and a couple of bowls <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>. it seemed like a lot at the time of ordering, but the food just wasn't filling.  i should of ordered shrimp or something else.\nthe calamari was the only thing i really enjoyed. it was all squid, no peppers, and it was light and crispy. \nthe flavor we requested in the lobster and crab was plain, and the waitress explained that the water used to boil it is flavored with seasoning. the flavor was fine, with a hint of old bay seasoning-esque. the crab was a bit overcooked and the lobster was not as tender as i wanted. \nfor $90, i think this place is overpriced and not that great when it comes to the quality of the seafood. the waitress should of checked up on us more and they should consider hiring a cleaning crew for their bathrooms.",

            "i have to say i am a bigger fan of crawdaddy's in san jose, ca than i am of this place - both the service and the food (well, the sauce) is better at crawdaddy's.\n\nwe ordered a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, two <mark>Corn</mark> and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. we ordered both the crawfish and shrimp with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce which is supposed to be a combination of all of the sauces - the crawfish came out with that sauce and luckily they made a mistake and our shrimp came out with just the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce.  i was not feeling the hot n juicy sauce - it tasted weird with the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> and whatever else was in there, it was just too much. the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> that was on the shrimp was really good though, we got medium spice and there were some nice chunks of garlic which is my favorite part :) both the shrimp and crawfish were big - no tiny suckers here which i did appreciate because when you get a tiny crawfish it's quite annoying - all that work for nothing. my favorite part is always the corn because they sit it in the bag with the shrimp and it soaks up all the juice and every bite you get the sweet corn with the spicy <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> taste - absolutely amazing i'll tell ya! i think if we never got the hot n juicy sauce i would have liked the crawfish better.\n\nthe service was okay - we got some jock looking like dude.  he was nice but we had asked for <mark>Extra Seasoning Sauce</mark> and some extra <mark>Corn</mark> - waited about 10 minutes, didn't see the guy and when we finally spotted him he was just kicking it behind the counter chatting it up with the girls. in my head i'm thinking \"come on fool!  i want my corn and <mark>Extra Seasoning Sauce</mark>! wtf you talking for?! that won't get you a good tip!\" haha.. we didn't end up getting our corn until the end of our meal along with the check - i guess we could just call that our dessert ;)\n\nthanks to mvf we came, we saw and we tried some pretty good food but i think if were in vegas again we wouldn't come back.", 
            "sooooooo goooood!!! most of the places that have been on tv don't live up to the hype, but adam richman definately got it right when he gave this place the thumbs up!!!\n\none warning: it is very messy!!! make sure you don't have any cuts in your fingers before you start eating (they do have gloves, but it's just not as much fun using them!) - other than that, you can't really go wrong with anything on this menu!\n\nwe always get crawfish with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>- with no spice... we do like spicy food in our family, but even the mild has a pretty strong kick that does dull the yummy-ness of the sauce! make sure you get a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> and order some extra <mark>Sausage</mark> to eat with that <mark>Extra Seasoning Sauce</mark>!\n\nnot the best place for hungry kids- we were able to get our girls some french fries & soda, but they got pretty frustrated trying to peel their own shrimp/wait for us to peel shellfish for them... and the craqfish creeped them out!

            "hot and juicy crawfish - don't know if there are other places to eat <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> crawfish but this place is pretty good. best place in vegas for now! haha. the <mark>Crawfish</mark> are pretty decent size and the spices are good. unlike other places i have had, when u tell them mild, it is mild. when you tell them medium, its medium and so forth. the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> is so-so here. i have had better, i don't like the way it is breaded. the dungeoness crab is very good. they tend to run out so if you are going there for dungeoness, you may want to call before hand. my boyfriend won a contest with 4 other people.... 20 lbs is 5 minutes! hahahahahah!\n\n\ni prefer boiling crab in oc & alhambra and everywhere (they are a chain/franchise) but this is as good as it is gonna get in vegas til they open one!", 
            "hot n' juicy is an old favorite of mine located on spring mountain between decatur and jones. hot n' juicy is definitely the messiest eatery in town, and all the more fun because of it. sometimes when i give that description people don't want to try it, but it would be a shame not to. besides the fun of eating here, the food is great. how can you really go wrong with fresh seafood, butter, and cajun seasonings?\n\ntoday i ordered one pound of the crawfish ($9.99) and my husband ordered one pound of the snow crab ($13.99). we both asked for the hot n' <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning, extra spicy! you are free to choose your heat level as well as the style of seasoning you prefer - <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, juice cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, or <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. besides crawfish and snow crab, you can also order <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, or shrimp.\n\nthe first time i had a crawfish boil was at my brother's graduation from university of the south in sewanee, tennessee. i remember them dumping huge buckets of steamed crawfish onto the tables and everyone would just have at them, discarding the shells and heads onto neighboring tables. at hot n' juicy it's a little different, but not much. you are given bibs and your table is covered in white plastic that is accessorized with your own roll of paper towels. they bring your crawfish in plastic bags that are tied at the top to capture the heat. when you open the bag you get an aromatic burst of spicy steam that gets you really excited for what you are about to enjoy. this is where the fun starts. crawfish are peel and eat little buggers that require somewhat of an experienced eater to navigate through them in order to get to the savory bits. first you must detach the tail, which you peel just as you would the tail of a shrimp. then, and this is most flavorful part, you must suck the head by gently squeezing it into your mouth so you can get all the juices and inner goodness out of it. if this sounds totally disgusting to you, go for the crab. they supply you with crab crackers, but ian and i agree they should probably pre-crack them for you to make the experience easier and allow all the seasoned butter to seep into the meat. whatever you decide to get, i'm sure you'll enjoy it.\n\nif you order two pounds of crawfish you get a hunk of corn on the cob and a red potato in your bag, but since we ordered one pound each of different items we opted for the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> ($2.99). these came out hot n' spicy with a side of cooling ketchup. we managed to reserve some of the fries to dip in the juices at the bottom of our bags, and this was way better than the ordinary condiment. who would have thought that you could make french fries even tastier and more unhealthy with the addition of seasoned butter? i guess europeans serve their fries with mayonnaise, so i don't feel too guilty or out of line.\n\nby the time you are finished, it looks like hurricane katrina has hit your table leaving a mass of wet and crumpled paper towels in her wake. this is certainly not a prime location for a wedding reception, but if you don't mind getting your hands dirty in the name of taste, you really should try hot n' juicy almost any other time.", 
            "im a big fan and always spoke above and beyond about the awesome food that they serve here.  i usually come to eat about 3x a month and never had an issue with the service until last nights horrible experience with the servers/workers.  \n\nso several of my friends and i decided to hit up the place after a pool concert for a quick fix of hot n juicy shrimp.  we walk in 5 minutes before they close and was promptly greated by our server who ended up later giving us a really bad attitude.  but before i get ahead of myself, she initially tells us that we have 2 minutes to put in our order.  because we come there very often we knew what we wanted and did not hesitate to waste time and gave her our order.  we ordered 4lbs of shrimp, <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, plain with extra spicy hot n juicy sauce on the side along with some lemons and salt and pepper.  the same way we order it every time.  we had also ordered  1/2 a dozen of <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>.  \n \nnot more than five minutes later we get our order, but not how we had ordered specifically.  the extra spicy hot and juicy sauce had come all mixed in with the 4lbs of shrimp that we ordered making it very spicy, painful to the mouth, and unenjoyable.  but because we walked in prior to closing, we did not want to hassle the kitchen and waiter to remake our food.  instead we asked our waiter  for some extra hot butter to help balance out the spiciness in our food. our waiter stated that the kitchen was closed and that there was nothing that she could do.  so i had asked politely to speak to a manager.  but our waiter told me that there was no manager available.  we then asked her if there anything that she can do to make our food less spicy and more enjoyable but she still persisted that there was nothing that she could do and that the kitchen was closed.  regretfully, i was upset and had belittled her in front of my friends using inappropriate language.    \n\nafter getting no response or help from our waiter, we began to remove ourselves from the table and left the mostly untouched food on the table and headed towards the door.  we had barely eaten any food because of how spicy it was.  we were then greeted and cussed out by a  who claimed to be a manager.  he threatened that he would remember us and told us to \"fuck off\".  and i'm sorry to say that he received the same treatment back.  shortly after another guy who also claimed to be the manager tried to listen to the situation and made us believe that he had understood what went wrong.  he stated that he would have this issue taken care of with another manager the following day and we gave him our contact information for them to contact us.  he shortly after sent us on our way.  \n\nsince we were still oh so hungry we went across the street to eat some pho.  five minutes into eating, las vegas metro police walks in stating that the hot n juicy staff claimed that we dined in and ran off with our tab unpaid. we ended up being forced to pay for food we didn't order and eat.  \n\nwhat a way to lose business hot n juicy.  im still working to write a letter to the owner of this place.  what sucks is that i really really love the food and would love to go back to eat there.  it just sucks!  if our waiter knew the kitchen couldn't fully accomodate our needs she should have never sat us down to eat.", 
            "are all the new <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> shrimp/crawfish places the same? hell no!!!\n\na few differences from the research (now that translates to food eating) i have done\n\n1) some places charge $.25 a glass for water\n2) some locations have buy one beer, get the other free (that rocks!)\n3) some places offer disposable gloves for your messy shelling fest\n4) some places offer 3% discount off your bill if you pay in cash\n5) all places have a signature mix, but don't be fooled...the tastes aren't duplicated!\n6) one place is on the man vs. food tour\n\nhmmm, wonder which place that is....hot n juicy offers selections 3-6 of the above list!  the shrimp are plump and yes, juicy. the corn is sweet and succulent.  come early to avoid long lines.  we got there around 5:30 pm and were seated right away\n\nservice is attentive and swift.  parking was kinda hard when we got there, so i can imagine it must be a madhouse when the place gets packed", 
            "went straight to hot n juicy when my friends & i landed in vegas last week. i saw this joint on travel channel & being a fan of <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> crawfish...it was mandatory that we hit up this place. \n\nthe crawfish were ginormous & tasted pretty good. could've used more seasoning, but it was  pretty decent considering the size of their brown river crawfish. i'd say the crawfish & the sauce here is tastier than boiling crab, but i still like crab hut much better. if crab hut served these steroid induced <mark>Crawfish</mark>...i'd be there prepared for high cholesterol. \n\ncustomer service kinda sucked cuz we ordered calamari, which never came out...even after several reminders. other than that everything else was great...we will be coming back the next time we're in vegas & will continue to tell our friends about this place.", 
            "i've been to this place about three times and i'm still not tired of it! i have also been to the boiling crab in san jose, california but it does not compare to our <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> crawfish! if you do not like breaking the shells of the crawfish, <mark>Shrimp</mark> are the way to go! there are also various seasoned flavors that the <mark>Shrimp</mark> or crawfish are cooked in, but be prepared to taste a little spice! oh! another tip, be prepared to wait. sometimes the waiting list is about an hour!! but you'll enjoy it overall. it is one thing everyone must experience! you get hot n juicy bibs and you also can get down and dirty with your hands, so you can choose to wear gloves. if you also like rice with your seafood, a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> is $2.", 
            "we heard about this place spring of 2010 and finally went january 2011 when i was in the mood for some mud-bugs! \nwe moved to las vegas from louisiana. we only lived in louisiana for 2 1/2 years but that's long enough to know about some good southern food! \nmy husband and i got the same thing; 2 pounds of crawfish with spicy cajun (<mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> and <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>) flavoring with medium spice level. i myself noticed the spice level in the corn since we had the corn and potato added to the bag's of crawfish. medium was even spicier than what we ever had in louisiana, but the waiter did inform us to go down a level of what we were used to. \nthe crawfish was pretty good all in all. my husband and i both only had about 5 good sized crawfish in each of our bags, maybe since it's off season. so that was a disappointment. i wish that they would clean the the crawfish before they cook them. it's not fun looking at a crawfish that looks like it still has dirt and sand on it.....ya ya ya i know their called mud-bugs but still. i know that would take some time for them to do but it just looks better. your going to a crawfish joint not a chinese buffet with crawfish. \nit was kinda pricey since we're used to paying a couple bucks a sack in louisiana, granted here they are the ones taking the time to boil them. during off season with live crawfish (the waiter said some night's they're frozen) it worked out to be about $10-$11per pound. (on the menu for crawfish it does say market price, the waiter said during season it might be about $8 per pound) they don't have a kids menu so we had to pay $7.50 for our 3 year old daughter to get a chicken nugget's and fries basket. for all 3 of us we got a total of 4lbs. crawfish, 2 extra corn's, chicken and fries basket, 1 soda and 2 water's and our bill was $65.00 before tip. we will try to get back before we move out of state this summer but we are also planning on having some shipped in from louisiana and doing our own crawfish boil so we'll see. if we were staying here in vegas i'm sure we would go back. \n\ni", 
            "not a fluke, the second time proved to be just as good as the first. i am not proud that katrina m. and i came here two days within a three day span, but it was that good.\n\nthis time we came with her family and ordered 4 pounds of shrimp in spicy <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, one pound in medium <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, one pound in extra spicy <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, one pound of spicy hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> crawfish, and one pound of spicy <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> crawfish. out of all the seasonings, their namesake is the best at the second to hottest level. their \"extra spicy\" did not deliver the scorching hot flavor i was expecting and would not make for a decent food challenge. the other two flavors were just mediocre, nothing special. we had also ordered calamari, but they are extremely salty. the sweet potato and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are cooked to a superb crispiness. ask for corn and <mark>Potato</mark> to be cooked with your seafood.\n\nyet again i could not resist the temptation and ordered a blue moon to go along with the meal. i might be completely out of the loop, but it has been a while since i have seen a restaurant offer beers for less than $5.50 a bottle. heineken, heineken light, corona, corona light, sapporo, and blue moon are the beers they offer for $3.\n\ni cannot stress enough that you should get there before 6 because the wait is nonexistent. for a party of six, half of us being present, they sat us right away. yet if another large party came and our group was not all there we would have to give up our table. they cannot be faulted for that. i understand the need to meet the demands. once we were all sat and ordered, the staff were very attentive with refilling drinks and taking our additional orders.",

            "pretty good...for vegas.  here's my recap:  parking could be better.  not a lot of spaces.  available spaces were a little tight.  seated immediately upon entering.  the place was pretty busy.  many tables with chairs, some with booths.  some booth seating was not accessible because the neighboring table was too close.  servers were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.  menu offered crawfish, shrimp, oysters, clam, lobster, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, and snow crab.  all market prices.  seasoning choices were <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.  choice of mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy.  sides: corn, potato, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, rice, rolls, and sausage.  also, appetizers were etoufee and a large variety of fried items: calamari, hot wings, soft shell crab, catfish, shrimp, and chicken nuggets.  we ordered two pounds of boiled shrimp: one <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> medium and the other <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> medium.  bibs were served first.  the bottom of the bib folds over to make a pocket to catch debris you drop.  we also ordered a side of white rice.  the cook time seemed about right, not real fast, but not too slow either.  constant line for men's restroom.  only one person at a time.  many people waiting to get in to wash their hands after eating.  the food comes out as it is ready, not served at the same time.  i prefer this method.  the shrimp is served in a clear plastic bag and the shells are left on the table.  plastic table cloth makes for quick and easy clean up.  the shrimp was good sized, hot, and flavorful.  there was a little extra juice in the bottom of the bag which we used to dip our shrimp once peeled.  also, we ladled some on the rice for a bit of flavor.  the shrimp was head and shell on.  this requires a little work, but is the traditional way to serve, saves the kitchen a bit of time, and leads one to believe the shrimp were alive when cooked.  i lived in louisiana for many years so i know there is a difference between <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> and cajun style, but i don't know why they made the distinction here.  most patrons in vegas won't know the difference.  the difference here is that louisiana had more butter and cajun was more traditional with more spices and less brother allowing the sweet flavor of the shrimp to come through better.  the difference is almost not noticeable, but i prefer their <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>.  the rice was okay.  all in all the food was pretty good.  we really enjoyed it.  on a side note, they did not purge the shrimp.  that is, the gastrointestinal track and the poop were still in the shrimp.  vegas patrons don't know any better.  its kind of gross, but i ate anyways knowing that it won't hurt you (otherwise, the place would have been shut down a long time ago).  there were plenty of paper napkins at each table and wet wipes served at the counter and with the bill, but i would have preferred a washing station, similar to those at cravin cajun.  you get really, really messy eating boiled shrimp and that stuff is super painful if you get it in your eyes.  they do serve alcohol, but we had tap water, which was served in styrofoam cups.  the server did not ask if we wanted lemon, but she brought out a styrofoam bowl with almost two whole lemons (kind of a waste).  shrimp was $8.99 per pound and the side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> was $2.  we really enjoyed this experience and will be coming back.  i tried the crawfish on a previous visit here.  it was the best crawfish in vegas.  flavor was right, but a bit small for louisiana standards.  i love crawfish, but think the shrimp is a better deal because there is much more meat.  i really like this place, but cravin cajun is better.", 
            "gave this place another chance.  tried to come here for my birthday a few months ago, only to face a 45 minute wait, a trip to their 2nd location, a waitress dumping a full soda on our table and finding out there was no crab - <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, snow crab , <mark>King Crab</mark> - none at all - only when our server took our order.  this time, i called ahead and yes, they had crab available.  \n\npros - \n\nno wait at 6:15 on a friday night\nbeverages refilled promptly\nservers were friendly\nfood was good\n\ncons -\n\ntwo of us ordered <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>; and server gave each of us a claw cracker tool, and that was it.  no fork, no pick, not even a butter knife or even one of those \"sea sheller\" plastic gadgets.  how did they expect anyone to eat crab without any other tools?  one of us ordered the lobster, and he did get the sea sheller tool.  when i asked for two more, the server said she wasn't sure if they had more, but she would look!  come on, it's a seafood restaurant, and you can't give your customers something as simple as a plastic tool to open <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>?  she did manage to bring two more to our table.\n\nonly the crawfish included corn & <mark>Potato</mark>.  i can understand not including sausage with boiled seafood, but one tiny potato and half an ear of corn for three people added $4 to our bill.  how hard could it be to just include this in every boiled seafood menu item?  petty money grab, imo. and . . .\n\nsausage, corn and <mark>Potato</mark> were brought to the table 10 minutes before we got our seafood.  they were cold by the time we ate them with our seafood.\n\nmarinara sauce with mozzarella sticks from appetizer menu was cold.\n\nseasoning description on menu could have had more information.  i have no idea what was in \"<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>\" or \"<mark>Louisiana Style</mark>\" - white pepper?  black pepper?  red pepper?  paprika?  no clue whatsoever with no information in the menu, and server didn't know either.\n\nparking lot is too small for the capacity of the restaurant.  \n\nif you go -\ncall ahead and ask if they have the seafood you want\npark on the street\nif you plan on ordering crab, bring your own crab tools\ntell your server to bring the corn and <mark>Potato</mark> with your seafood.",

            "**confession: the seafood @ this spot is absolutely amazing!!!!!**\n\nof course a pescetarian like myself is always in the mood for yummy seafood. a few weeks ago, my sis recommended that me & a friend check this place out for din din. omg, i fell head over heels in love! \n\nit's always a good sign when you walk up to a place & there are people lined up outside the door, waiting to be seated. there was also a large number of people who placed to-go orders, so this place was jumping with business! we decided to grab a bottle of wine (fetzer riesling) while waiting for our table and all of the staff there were really friendly & funny. i was joking with the guy who gave us the wine before we even had a chance to sit down. lol\n\nit was friday night, so like us, most of the folks dining there were already pretty tipsy (as they rightfully should be). wheee! :-d i remember joking around with a female waitress who was serving a table full of guys about them having another round of drinks! i also interacted with our adorable server before we were seated & decided i wanted to sit in his section. i let the hostess know & she was completely cool with it. all of the fun, goofy interaction with the staff was the 2nd indicator that we were in a good location.\n\nfinally, the food. you select your seasoning, pick a spice level, & select your items. we opted for the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> (combo of <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, & <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>), extra spicy (hot hot hot!!!), & ordered crawfish, shrimp, lobster, & crab (hooray 4 seafood!). the crawfish comes with 1 head of corn on the cob & a red potato, so you can add additional corn & <mark>Potato</mark> to your order as needed. all of the food comes marinated in clear plastic bags, so you literally open up the bags and dig in! everything was seasoned & marinated to perfection! it was hot, spicy, juicy, & delicious as advertised. the service was also impeccable from the moment we stepped into the place! it was one of the server's last night there so we ended up taking silly pics in her memory since she was working instead of enjoying a moving away party. i think i ended up taking pictures with the entire staff by the time the night was done. silly me! lmao \n\nwe ordered shrimp, crawfish, corn, & <mark>Potato</mark> to go for my sis since she wasn't able to make it down there with us that evening. those leftovers were still delicious the following day. :-) i was back in vegas this past weekend (the place was packed again on sunday night) & ordered takeout for dinner one evening because the food is absolutely fantastic! looking forward to eating my leftovers tonight & making plans to visit some of the other locations soon.\n\nbe sure to check this place out next time you're in town. you're sure to love it as much as i do! :-d",

            "first time at hot n juicy crawfish.  service was excellent. we tried a pound of <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> crawfish and a pound of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>.  both were very good although there's not a lot of meat on each crawfish and they are not easy to peel, so you are left wishing you had ordered more.  a fun and unique place to go with a group and the utter messiness of it all is mitigated with the plastic aprons and gloves that the restaurant provides.  i recommend giving it a try.", 
            "at last count there were two hot n juicy crawfish locations in las vegas, but i have it on good authority that this is the one you want, at 4810 spring mountain road. my husband and i were steered towards this one, further away though it is, by a reliable local, which is the kind of good advice you want when choosing an off-strip, local neighborhood place. driving from the strip, you actually have to pass a hot n juicy crawfish (in chinatown) to get to the \"right\" hot n juicy crawfish.\n\nlocated on a busy multi-lane road chock-a-block with shopping centers and fast food, hot n juicy crawfish doesn't look like much from outside. or inside, for that matter -- a decent-sized space looks smaller than it is because of so many ragtag tables squeezed together, it's usually packed, it's loud, and i wouldn't exactly call it clean. you're in the middle of the desert but the vibe is carefree beachside -- the floor is a mess and most diners are wearing plastic bibs, happily covered in sauce. you order at a counter, from a menu posted on the wall overhead, and they call you when your order is ready. \n\nthough you can get baskets of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, wings and chicken nuggets, hot n juicy crawfish put their signature item right in their name. when you order the crawfish, there's a method. no \"crawfish nazis\" here -- the staff will kindly help you out if you're a first-timer. you order your crawfish by the pound, then you pick a seasoning, then you pick a spice level. for seasoning, you pick from <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> or a <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. spice levels range from mild to \"holy s@#t.\" that's not what they call it, that's what i called it. if you like spicy, you love this stuff.\n\nthe best experience is to go off-hours with a group, get an assortment of seasonings and spice levels, get some cold beers and have a blast. wear something washable, yer gonna get messy!"

            "since returning from houston a couple of months ago, i found myself craving crawfish any chance i get.  after experiencing the crawfish craze in the westminster area of southern california, imagine my delight when i saw the sign for \"hot n juicy crawfish\" in las vegas.\n\nthe bf and i anxiously awaited the opening of this first of its kind restaurant in sin city and finally got to sit down to dinner the past sunday.  inviting a couple of newbies made the dining experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nwe started off with a pound each of the crawfish in every flavor - <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and hot n juicy combo.  at $8.99/lb, it was a dollar more than socal prices but we were okay with it.  for every two pounds you order, you get one corn and one potato.  so, we made sure we got our corn pieces and <mark>Potato</mark> and were able to choose what flavor we wanted it in.  (in the end, we ordered additional corn and potato on the side, corn runs about 50 cents each.)  we also threw an order of sausage ($2.50 for half a dozen or $4.00 for a dozen).  depending on the season, they should be offering <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, and shrimp.  you can also order oysters, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> or oyster baskets, catfish po-boy sandwich, or a basket of fries.\n\nthey didn't ask us how spicy we wanted our crawfish, later on telling us they automatically make it spicy unless otherwise stated.  the heat was a good amount, not too hot that it was unbearable and enough where we reached for our beverages.  of the four, i would say the <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> had the least flavor while the hot n juicy combo had the most.  we ordered four more pounds of the hot n juicy combo in this sitting.  the sausage was actually spicier than the crawfish!  we also found the crawfish to be pretty clean overall.  we're ones to suck up all the juices from the heads too, so they gotta be clean.  and i gotta admit, the last two pounds we had were especially good.  they do a good job on having cleaner crawfish than other places i've experienced.\n\nbe sure to get the salt and pepper mixture too.  you get a bowl of cut up limes and you squeeze all the lime juice into the little plastic cup and mix it all together.  this is usually meant for you to dip your crawfish in, but i found myself not needing it that much.\n\nservice was better too.  upon entering, they line your table up with the white plastic covering and lay out a roll of paper towels.  they also provide bibs too.  you can ask for plastic gloves, but they just get in the way.  they asked us often if we needed refills on our beverages and how we were doing overall.  (i would say this is probably because they are a new restaurant, i only hope they continue with this service in the future.)\n\nthey had a steady flow of customers this holiday weekend night.  it didn't get too busy, but they were never empty either.\n\nin conclusion, the four of us were pleased with our experience at hot n juicy crawfish.  it looks like we'll be coming back here a lot!  yay!\n\nside note: there's a 17% gratuity added for parties of six or more.\n\n(you can check out my food photos up above!)", 
            "wow this was as close to home( new orleans ) as you can get here in las vegas. i will start by saying please don't let the location stop you from visiting this restaurant. i live in henderson and do not go across town to often to eat. it is a simple family owned place that we need more of in this town. the food is simple to order its all by the pound. we ordered 2 pounds of shrimp (our favorite), 2 pounds of crawfish (very good) both were mild with the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce. they tasted great but if you want more of the louisiana taste get the 2nd sauce i think it is called <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>. we also tried the fried soft shell crab with fries (oh so good), oysters on the half shell(fresh and good size, from the gulf not salty but i think its because of the season), potato's, corn, and sausage (potato's and corn are a must have, the sausage was ok) and last we got the etouffee (this was ok my wife really liked it i thought it had to many bell peppers but thats just me). there is more on the menu but all i could try this visit. i will return for sure the food is really that good. i put $$$ for the price because i ordered more than we needed but you will spend 25 to 35 per person easy.please visit this restaurant they are doing so much perfect. the service was very friendly. thank you to everyone for your reviews. it was the reason i had to try it.\n\nwent back for some live <mark>Blue Crab</mark> and everything was as good as the 1st time. the <mark>Blue Crab</mark> is now my favorite. the bread rolls also are a must have to eat with the sauce. i know this place is different but if you love seafood please give it a try.", 
            "finally (after the 6th mention of \"i'd really like to try hot & juicy\"), we made it there last night.  we ordered the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark> legs (<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>- mild) and the pound of shrimp (hot & juicy- medium) and corn on the cob. \n\nfirst off, if you don't want to do a little work for your food, don't come here. you have to crack the crabs, peel the shrimp, etc. second, it is messy, but that is part of the fun. we wore the plastic bibs, we went through a roll of napkins and we still had sauce everywhere and we put all the shells right on the garbage bag wrapped table.  \n\nwe both personally enjoyed the <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> sauce on the crab just a little more then the hot & juicy we had on the shrimp. i think it would have been better for us to order mild, because the medium was still really spicy. we liked the catfish, but we took the breading off and dipped it in our cajun sauce. it was really good that way! the fries that came with the catfish were so-so, nothing to write home about. the <mark>King Crab</mark> was a little over $20 for two legs. i would have liked a little more of that, it didn't seem like a whole pound to me but man was it good. i had to have my boyfriend crack it for me though cause <mark>King Crab</mark> legs will stab you repeatedly in the hands if you suck at cracking them. \n\ni have never eaten anything with the head still attached (well at least not that i can recall). i thought it would bother me, but when the shrimp came, i just tore that sucker apart and dug in. well worth the work, i must say.  the corn was delicious as well. yum. overall, a great place and lots of fun. i would really recommend it!!", 
            "my very first time i went was with the same person i always eat out with if it isn't my boyfriend, so i might as well introduce you to my friend mikhail.. not a yelper, yet! haha.. anyway, it was both our first time & i have never tried crawfish before.\n\nwe ended up getting sharing the two bags [2lbs each?] of <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> crawfish, the <mark>Soft Shell Crab Basket</mark> w <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and calamari. i felt like such a newbie trying to open the crawfish, i splashed myself a couple times, but that's what the bibs are for, right? the flavoring was great; we ordered medium & it was just enough for me. my nose was running a little & my eyes got watery, but i enjoyed it. i think next time i'll stick with <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> cause i definitely have that down to a science ;) the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were straaight up cajun! i'd have to stop myself after a while because it would get a little spicy. soft shell crab was good, just wanted marinara sauce from the calamari instead of the tartar that the soft shell came with :) the calamari was house made, but it wasn't anything fancy for me. there's only a few places where i can say that's great calamari. \n\nthe service was average, it was a sunday & the lakers were playing orlando so we had to wait for a good 20 minutes for a table for two. i didn't realize that the restrooms were in two different spots, but our table was against the wall for the mens restroom & i was washing my hands before & after we ate. my bad fellerz!\n\nthe weird thing is that at the bottom of the receipt says you get a 3% discount if you pay cash.. i don't get it, do you have to present the check with the cash, then get a new receipt with the new balance? they already use enough disposable stuff & use styrofoam cups so i don't really think they're going green anyway. blah, maybe i'm going crazy because i'm yelping & it's already 6am!! random.. and awkward receipt though. i will be back hot n juicy! the simplicity of the menu & your system is definitely working, so much props. i'll probably come back on a weekday because that day was madness~", 
            "i wasn't expecting such a large crowd at 8 pm on a monday but we got a table (a big booth for just the two of us) so first thing you do is call ahead and see how the wait is. nobody likes to wait having to smell the delicious garlicky joy of this place while hungry. nobody. \n \nordered some oysters for an appetizer, they were so good we put in for another order. beer is cold and cheap. \n\nnow to the juicy part. three kinds of crawfish were ordered. the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> extra spicy, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> and a garlic one. the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> extra spicy is only for those that love hot foods. i do, so i was happy. to be honest start with the least hot and work your way up because after eating the extra spicy and drinking the beer i couldn't really tell the difference between the juicy and the garlic. my hands smelled like garlic for days after, wear the lobster bib, don't eat on a first date unless you have a great sense of humor, the service is excellent. the only and i mean only downside is we never received any sides we ordered, i would eat here once a week if i lived closer.", 
            "ever since i saw this place on man v. food (one of my favorite food-related t.v. shows), i was determined to try this place during my next vegas trip.  alas the time had come and i dragged my friends to this place before our long drive back home to socal.  there are four different sauces you can choose from: <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. we got two pounds of shrimp, two pounds of crawfish and a pound of snow crab.  they were covered in <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> and the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.  we also got <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and sausage.  everything was so full of flavor.  all the seafood came in plastic bags to seal in the steam and flavor.  the crawfish were a bit hard to eat, but it was still quite delicious.  however, the only bad thing is that you will not get the smell out of your fingers for a couple days..no matter how much you wash your hands...and use hand sanitizer, but that's the price you have to pay for some delicious cajun seafood. :) i would definitely go back during my next vegas trip.", 
            "las vegas is sin city for a reason; it celebrates the seven deadly sins. in vegas, your greatest weakness or vice becomes the source of all your pleasures. we were ready to give into our carnal desires and get down and dirty, indulging our voracious, gluttonous appetites. we wanted to get stuffed with something hot n juicy. \n\nhot n juicy is known for their seafood: crab (dungeness, blue, snow), shrimp, and of course, crawfish. you pick the type of seasoning (<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> or the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>) and the level of spiciness (mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy). \n\nwe ordered 2 lbs of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and 2 lbs of crawfish with <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> at medium, 2 pieces of corn, 2 red <mark>Potato</mark>, etouffee (a cajun seafood stew, similar to gumbo), and a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. eating at hot n juicy is not an elegant refine affair. it's messy work because they dump a plastic bag of whatever seafood you ordered and you're only protection is the plastic table covering and a plastic bib. you open the bag and dig in.\n\nthe crab meat was very sweet and juicy. it was perfectly cooked. i found that the spiciness of the food depended on the type of seafood because the seasoning is on the outside of the shell. the meat isn't spicy unless you soak it in the sauce first. i found the level of spiciness in the crawfish much higher because the tail meat was much smaller and there was more shell around it, unlike the crab meat where i could pull out large pieces of meat out of the shell. also i got more spicy sauce from the crawfish because i sucked crawfish heads. after a while my lips got tingly and numb from the cajun spices. \n\ni've never had crawfish whole before. i only had them de-shelled. while i love crawfish and the meat was great, i'll never have them whole like that again. the tail meat is rather tiny (i like 'em big -- size matters when it comes to these things). at the end, we looked at the mountain of shell and agreed that it was more work than it was worth. crawfish is mostly shell and i'd rather pay someone to shell them for me.\n\netouffee was a spicy rice seafood stew. i liked the flavor and the level of spice was just perfect for me. i thought the rice was a tad overcooked and mushy from just sitting in a pot all day, but in general it was enjoyable.\n\nthe boiled red <mark>Potato</mark> were much needed as a break from the relentless cajun spice. they were nice and sweet. the corn is out of season, so not as sweet and juicy as in the summer, but still tasty. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were crispy and tasty.\n\nthe final price for all of us was $30/person for three people. we gorged ourselves on great seafood and left utterly satiated. happy ending for us indeed.\n\nwhat happens in vegas, stays in vegas. but this is one of the few times where you wish you could get crabs and bring them home with you.", 
            "this place was amazing! w stopped by on our drive back from colorado and its only 5 minutes from the i-15, so it was a quick stop. \n\nit did take a few minutes to be seated and get our order in, but they were understaffed and were all busting their butts to clean tables and get food out. once we got our food in, it only took 10 minutes for it to hit our table. \n\ni order the shrimp with <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> sauce and a corn and potato. the shrimp was huge and delious. my bf ordered the crayfish and they were really small and disappointing. he got the hot and juicy sauce, which was way better then my sauce. overall, i would push the shrimp over the crayfish, but it was a fun eating experience and i can't wait to go there again the next time i am in las vegas!",

            "pretty good...for vegas.  here's my recap:  parking could be better.  not a lot of spaces.  available spaces were a little tight.  seated immediately upon entering.  the place was pretty busy.  many tables with chairs, some with booths.  some booth seating was not accessible because the neighboring table was too close.  servers were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.  menu offered crawfish, shrimp, oysters, clam, lobster, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, and snow crab.  all market prices.  seasoning choices were <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.  choice of mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy.  sides: corn, potato, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, rice, rolls, and sausage.  also, appetizers were etoufee and a large variety of fried items: calamari, hot wings, soft shell crab, catfish, shrimp, and chicken nuggets.  we ordered two pounds of boiled shrimp: one <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> medium and the other <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> medium.  bibs were served first.  the bottom of the bib folds over to make a pocket to catch debris you drop.  we also ordered a side of white rice.  the cook time seemed about right, not real fast, but not too slow either.  constant line for men's restroom.  only one person at a time.  many people waiting to get in to wash their hands after eating.  the food comes out as it is ready, not served at the same time.  i prefer this method.  the shrimp is served in a clear plastic bag and the shells are left on the table.  plastic table cloth makes for quick and easy clean up.  the shrimp was good sized, hot, and flavorful.  there was a little extra juice in the bottom of the bag which we used to dip our shrimp once peeled.  also, we ladled some on the rice for a bit of flavor.  the shrimp was head and shell on.  this requires a little work, but is the traditional way to serve, saves the kitchen a bit of time, and leads one to believe the shrimp were alive when cooked.  i lived in louisiana for many years so i know there is a difference between <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> and cajun style, but i don't know why they made the distinction here.  most patrons in vegas won't know the difference.  the difference here is that louisiana had more butter and cajun was more traditional with more spices and less brother allowing the sweet flavor of the shrimp to come through better.  the difference is almost not noticeable, but i prefer their <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>.  the rice was okay.  all in all the food was pretty good.  we really enjoyed it.  on a side note, they did not purge the shrimp.  that is, the gastrointestinal track and the poop were still in the shrimp.  vegas patrons don't know any better.  its kind of gross, but i ate anyways knowing that it won't hurt you (otherwise, the place would have been shut down a long time ago).  there were plenty of paper napkins at each table and wet wipes served at the counter and with the bill, but i would have preferred a washing station, similar to those at cravin cajun.  you get really, really messy eating boiled shrimp and that stuff is super painful if you get it in your eyes.  they do serve alcohol, but we had tap water, which was served in styrofoam cups.  the server did not ask if we wanted lemon, but she brought out a styrofoam bowl with almost two whole lemons (kind of a waste).  shrimp was $8.99 per pound and the side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> was $2.  we really enjoyed this experience and will be coming back.  i tried the crawfish on a previous visit here.  it was the best crawfish in vegas.  flavor was right, but a bit small for louisiana standards.  i love crawfish, but think the shrimp is a better deal because there is much more meat.  i really like this place, but cravin cajun is better.", 
            "we really wanted to try this place because my friend works here and we love boiling crab type crawfish joints!:d \n\nthis is actually my first time getting my hands down and dirty with the seafood because usually i'm too \n::ughhh i don't wanna smell:: \n::ewww its gonna get under my nails and all over my hands::\nyeah... i'm a shame... but i finally decided that i'll get over my prissy self to enjoy some damn good crustaceans hahha\n\ni love shrimp! get the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>!! it's a mix of all their seasonings (<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> and <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>) and its soooo yummy!! i am a wimp and cannot for the life of me take spicy, so the server suggested i try it without spice and yummm it was sooo good!!! my bf is the total opposite and loves spice, so when he got the hot n juicy crawfish at spicy, he said it wasn't spicy enough -.-;;;; he is a fatass and got 4lbs of crawfish and was totally enjoying every last bit of it. a little too excited....\nwe all shared a dozen oysters... mmmm it was a relief and cool break from the spiciness of the <mark>Crawfish</mark> for my  friends.\n\nmy friends got the crawfish too but in medium  hot n juicy. they are big boiling crab fans and said that there was a certain zing to their seasoning that bc doesn't but didn't want to love it more because of how far it is from us (we live in orange county). they also got the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>. the catfish was breaded a little too much, and didn't taste as fresh as the rest of our meal. \n i got the <mark>Soft Shell Crab Basket</mark> on top of my shrimp and that was really good. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> that came with it weren't as impressive but were made better by the leftover hot n juicy sauce that i had. hehehe\n\nall in all, we had a good experience, our waitress was really cool (katherine, kaitlyn?? i don't remember....) pretty attentive, but we had to nudge her for water sometimes. \n\nwe'll probably be back, considering the long list of places we need to try in vegas in our short weekend stays.",

            "a-okay\n\ni wouldn't go out of my way to come here again but i wouldn't rule it out if it was a convenient choice and my group was large. we had a party of 8, ordered lots of things and just shared with the table. the service was friendly and attentive, the prices weren't bad, and the place was pretty clean inside even though both locations on this street are in raunchy strip malls, and this location has very little parking. \n\ncorn fritters: hands down the best thing we had here \ncat fish: yummy corn meal battered and seasoned perfectly\ncalamari: lightly battered fried golden okay on the seasoning\n<mark>Cajun Fries</mark>: a delicious smoldering fire in my mouth\nplan fries: blah\n<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> med spicy, and <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> pounds of shrimp: okay very large juicy shrimp that were fresh, but they should marinate the shrimp in their many sauces or seasonings for a while before boiled or use more seasoning while boiling the sauce just didn't stick making the shrimp pretty bland. \ncorn: pretty good balanced the shrimp, although my mother didn't like that they put her piece in the <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> sauce instead of on the side.

            "i love seafood and this place definitely has fresh seasonal seafood from <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, crawfish, clams, lobster, oyster, and shrimp. since this place is usually packed, it's recommended that you call ahead for reservations. \n\nthe staff and service is very helpful in recommendations and attentiveness. they will refill your glasses of water when they get a chance, get more napkins whenever they come to your table with more orders, and make sure you order enough before the kitchen is closed. \n\nthe set up is simple: order seafood by the pound. you can choose the seasoning for your seafood (like <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>) as well as the spice level. then, the food is served in clear plastic bags and all you need to do is rip it open and dig in. you can make a mess on the table and not worry about the clean up. it's messy, it's fun, and it's delicious. \n\nbesides seafood, you could order sides like their <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> or rolls to soak up the flavorful broth or sauce that is used to cook the seafood. \n\nfast, fun, and filling, hot n juicy crawfish is the best place for people who want a feast of fresh seafood without the worry of cooking or cleaning up.",

            "since returning from houston a couple of months ago, i found myself craving crawfish any chance i get.  after experiencing the crawfish craze in the westminster area of southern california, imagine my delight when i saw the sign for \"hot n juicy crawfish\" in las vegas.\n\nthe bf and i anxiously awaited the opening of this first of its kind restaurant in sin city and finally got to sit down to dinner the past sunday.  inviting a couple of newbies made the dining experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nwe started off with a pound each of the crawfish in every flavor - <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and hot n juicy combo.  at $8.99/lb, it was a dollar more than socal prices but we were okay with it.  for every two pounds you order, you get one corn and one potato.  so, we made sure we got our corn pieces and <mark>Potato</mark> and were able to choose what flavor we wanted it in.  (in the end, we ordered additional corn and potato on the side, corn runs about 50 cents each.)  we also threw an order of sausage ($2.50 for half a dozen or $4.00 for a dozen).  depending on the season, they should be offering <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, and shrimp.  you can also order oysters, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> or oyster baskets, catfish po-boy sandwich, or a basket of fries.\n\nthey didn't ask us how spicy we wanted our crawfish, later on telling us they automatically make it spicy unless otherwise stated.  the heat was a good amount, not too hot that it was unbearable and enough where we reached for our beverages.  of the four, i would say the <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> had the least flavor while the hot n juicy combo had the most.  we ordered four more pounds of the hot n juicy combo in this sitting.  the sausage was actually spicier than the crawfish!  we also found the crawfish to be pretty clean overall.  we're ones to suck up all the juices from the heads too, so they gotta be clean.  and i gotta admit, the last two pounds we had were especially good.  they do a good job on having cleaner crawfish than other places i've experienced.\n\nbe sure to get the salt and pepper mixture too.  you get a bowl of cut up limes and you squeeze all the lime juice into the little plastic cup and mix it all together.  this is usually meant for you to dip your crawfish in, but i found myself not needing it that much.\n\nservice was better too.  upon entering, they line your table up with the white plastic covering and lay out a roll of paper towels.  they also provide bibs too.  you can ask for plastic gloves, but they just get in the way.  they asked us often if we needed refills on our beverages and how we were doing overall.  (i would say this is probably because they are a new restaurant, i only hope they continue with this service in the future.)\n\nthey had a steady flow of customers this holiday weekend night.  it didn't get too busy, but they were never empty either.\n\nin conclusion, the four of us were pleased with our experience at hot n juicy crawfish.  it looks like we'll be coming back here a lot!  yay!\n\nside note: there's a 17% gratuity added for parties of six or more.\n\n(you can check out my food photos up above!)", 
            "i love crawfish, so we decided to yelp a crawfish place in vegas. this place isn't too far from the strip when you take a cab, just make sure you get the cab's phone number so you can call them when you're done. i would not recommend walking here. when we first walked in, i kind of got a bad vibe from the guy who greeted us first. actually it wasn't a greeting, he just said to where ever. it wasn't what he said, because they say that to everyone, but it was how he said it,. so i was like oh no, will i enjoy what we are about to eat. the waitress that took our order was friendly and smiled a lot, so i felt a little better. we ordered the hot n' spicy,extra spicy, which is basically all the sauces combined and the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, medium, for our crawfish. it was actually pretty tasty. the flavor was good and not overpowering. the group that ate the spicy didn't think it was spicy enough and the group that ate the medium thought that it was a little too spicy. go figure. at first we thought they switched our order, but we ordered some more extra spicy and they still thought that it was not spicy enough. we order the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> medium crab and the crab was cooked well, not overcooked at all. we also ordered cajun fires, which were ok. nothing to brag about. i would for sure come back to this place when come back to vegas.", 
            "this is my first time trying hot n juicy crawfish and i have to agree with the other yelpers when they say that the crawfish yield is not worth it.  my homegirls from nyc came to visit and i suggested that we try this place since none of us have ever tried crawfish.  so here we are 1 guy and 3 girls and we ordered 1 lb of crawfish - hot and juicy spicy sauce, 1 dungenuss crab - hot and juicy spicy sauce, 1 lb of shrimp - <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and 3 corn on the cob.\n\nthe shrimp yields more meat than the crawfish, however the hot and juicy spicy sauce is the way to go if you can take the heat!!  it'll get your lips burning at the end of the meal.  \n\nthe dungenuss crab was the star of the night for us.  it was 1.8 lbs and about $28.  we had it made with the hot and juicy spicy sauce and it came whole, which means you had to do the dirty work yourself.  getting down and dirty with crab is my thing!  i go to any buffet and ill sit there and eat <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> all night long!  anyways, the sauce and the crab was fantastic!  it was sooo good we ended up going to the supermarket the next day and bought 4 two pound <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, one for each of us, so we could make some more crab. lol\n\n anyways, 4 pounds of seafood and 5 beers later, we were stuffed.  we enjoyed our food.  we would suggest the crawfish if you've never had them before, but the shrimp is better.  must get the <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> if you are willing to spend the money.  total charge was $80 including tip, not bad for 4 people.  i will definitely go back there with more out of town friends.",

            "came here during our vegas trip, saw good reviews on yelp so we decided that we have to try it. the crawfish and the shrimp were fresh but the sauces were just ok.   both the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce and the house special sauce had way too much garlic on them (my breath smell like garlic for more than 2 days).  the fried cat fish and the soft shell crab weren't that good either, we had better one before.  i think the crawdaddy in san jose and boiling crab in orange county have much better food than here.", 
            "i saw this place on food network and was surprised we have this famous cajun restaurant here in las vegas. i decided to take my fiancee for a never-before crawfish experience. \n\nwe were there on tuesday night about 8:00pm and there was plenty of open seating. after we were seated, we were given the first-timer instruction on how to order. \n\nwe ordered 2lbs of crawfish(hot & juicy mild) included 1 potato & 1 corn, 1 lb of shrimp (galic butter mild), 1 <mark>Soft Shell Crab Basket</mark> include <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and 2 cokes. we really wanted to order oysters but they ran out, that's why we ordered the shrimp. \n\nthe taste of the spices was very good, and <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> was wonderful. we both loved the seasoning very much. but there was one problem for us, we realized that we don't like crawfish. we never had crawfish before this night, at least not a properly prepared crawfish meal. we manage to finish all 2 lbs of it because the spices was just that good. on the other hand, the shrimp was so good, the large amount of garlic in that buttery sauce made the shrimp so sweet and tasty. we just can not stop eating the shrimp!!! and the soft shell? nothing worth mentioning, except for the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> we dipped and ate with the sauce in the crawfish/shrimp bags.\n\nthe whole experience was pretty good, the whole meal cost us $57 which i thought was a little high. we decided if we go back, we would order shrimp only and call to make sure they have oysters before we go again.", 
            "sorry people but im going to have to be the fly in the ointment here. i got a chance to go to hot and juicy last weekend to see what all the hub bub was all about. and yes i saw it on man v food and it looked interesting. all the great reviews on here didnt hurt either. well i walked in and it was kinda plain but thats fine. the girl seated us and gave us menus to look over. i was going to order the shrimp instead of the crawfish until the waitress came over. she made the crawfish sound so good i caved and ordered a pound of them. i also ordered a pound of the <mark>King Crab</mark> and some sausage. my mom ordered the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and frys. \n    the girl brought out our food and it smelled incredible. i ripped into the bag of crawfish in hopes that i was really in for a treat. well i have come to a conclusion, theres nothing edible on crawfish!!! these things fought me every step of the way. i worked my ass off just to get a \"tinny\" piece of tale meat. the waitress said they were actually bigger than normal. i would hate the see the regular ones. the flavor of the sauce was absolutely fantastic. i went with the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> medium. the sausage dipped in the sauce was out of this world but the crawfish was a miserable failure. i ended up ordering a pound of the shrimp as well.\n    now the shrimp was another issue. i am not a big fan of whole shrimp. i dont want the head on with all the little hairs all over and the whole thing. if they had been cleaned before cooking it would have been much better. i didnt eat allot of them because of this. the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> were pretty good but i should have ordered the same sauce instead of the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>. \n    hot and juicy was kinda fun and the 2 waitresses were really sweet and fun to chat with. i dont think i will be coming but though. i do wish them the best.", 
            "very interesting and good new orleans style boil restaurant.  i prefer the shrimp here (heads on) over the crawfish - add some sausage, <mark>Potato</mark> and corn to the boil and all is good.\n\n1 lb. of shrimp is about $10, add some add-ins and it is around $13, good value, variety of 'boil' sauces are added in - i like the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> mild, which is still pretty hot.\n\nvery casual plastic tablecloth and paper towel joint on the west end of chinatown on spring mountain, reasonable interpretation of a louisiana crawfish/shrimp boil for las vegas - heavily frequented by louisiana ex-pats and chinatown regulars.\n\nvery good option if you like this style of cuisine and don't mind making a mess when you eat.", 
            "when i first walked into this place i noticed everyone wearing a bib and i thought to myself i refuse to look like an idiot and wear a bib. 10 minutes later when the crab came out, i looked like an idiot. i like this place as a nice change of pace in las vegas, it's different and when the food is dumped right in front of you, you have to bypass your usual table manners and just ripping into the food with your hands hoping you don't get juice in someone's eye from all the cracking. i never knew a roll of paper towels could vanish that fast. i didn't get to try much just the crawfish and the crab, marinated with <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> and <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> respectively. the crab was good, what's not to like about <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>? i just wish crab itself was cheaper because i'm hungry and 20 legs deep just makes me want more. the crawfish on the other hand, i can do without. love the juices, but after about 30 crawfish i felt like all i had was a bowl of soup. good place, medium layout, decently clean bathrooms (b-) and the more people the better.", 
            "wow!! hot and juicy crawfish was great. first time there and didn't know what to expect. we ordered 2 lbs of <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> crawfish and 1 lb of <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> shrimp. flavor was awesome!! the spice was to much and it was mild. i'm sucha a wimp. :( i would definitely recommend going there with a bunch of friends. atmosphere was nice. i guess it'd be what you'd expect if you were in lousiana. but i love the food and id go again!!",

            "hot n' juicy is an old favorite of mine located on spring mountain between decatur and jones. hot n' juicy is definitely the messiest eatery in town, and all the more fun because of it. sometimes when i give that description people don't want to try it, but it would be a shame not to. besides the fun of eating here, the food is great. how can you really go wrong with fresh seafood, butter, and cajun seasonings?\n\ntoday i ordered one pound of the crawfish ($9.99) and my husband ordered one pound of the snow crab ($13.99). we both asked for the hot n' <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning, extra spicy! you are free to choose your heat level as well as the style of seasoning you prefer - <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, juice cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, or <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. besides crawfish and snow crab, you can also order <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, or shrimp.\n\nthe first time i had a crawfish boil was at my brother's graduation from university of the south in sewanee, tennessee. i remember them dumping huge buckets of steamed crawfish onto the tables and everyone would just have at them, discarding the shells and heads onto neighboring tables. at hot n' juicy it's a little different, but not much. you are given bibs and your table is covered in white plastic that is accessorized with your own roll of paper towels. they bring your crawfish in plastic bags that are tied at the top to capture the heat. when you open the bag you get an aromatic burst of spicy steam that gets you really excited for what you are about to enjoy. this is where the fun starts. crawfish are peel and eat little buggers that require somewhat of an experienced eater to navigate through them in order to get to the savory bits. first you must detach the tail, which you peel just as you would the tail of a shrimp. then, and this is most flavorful part, you must suck the head by gently squeezing it into your mouth so you can get all the juices and inner goodness out of it. if this sounds totally disgusting to you, go for the crab. they supply you with crab crackers, but ian and i agree they should probably pre-crack them for you to make the experience easier and allow all the seasoned butter to seep into the meat. whatever you decide to get, i'm sure you'll enjoy it.\n\nif you order two pounds of crawfish you get a hunk of corn on the cob and a red potato in your bag, but since we ordered one pound each of different items we opted for the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> ($2.99). these came out hot n' spicy with a side of cooling ketchup. we managed to reserve some of the fries to dip in the juices at the bottom of our bags, and this was way better than the ordinary condiment. who would have thought that you could make french fries even tastier and more unhealthy with the addition of seasoned butter? i guess europeans serve their fries with mayonnaise, so i don't feel too guilty or out of line.\n\nby the time you are finished, it looks like hurricane katrina has hit your table leaving a mass of wet and crumpled paper towels in her wake. this is certainly not a prime location for a wedding reception, but if you don't mind getting your hands dirty in the name of taste, you really should try hot n' juicy almost any other time.",

            "been wanting to come for a while and get this off my list. i was kinda worried as most things hyped can very well disappoint. did a uye here today and it was a ton of fun getting hot n messy with some of vegas finest eaters.\n\nbf and i got some crawfish and shrimp- both with mild hot n juicy sauce....with the hnj sauce- it's a notch up in spice than the others. a mild is more like a medium so keep that in mind if you cant do the spice. it was nicely flavored and garlicky so plan to have time to shower a few times before seeing other people! mmmm garlic. other sauces can be had with zero spice for those who can't do heat (<mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, cajun, etc).\n\nthe shellfish was very fresh. i rarely eat crawfish since the last few places i've gotten it at  it tasted like mud. it was fresh, juicy and \"clean\" (no mud) aftertaste. <mark>Shrimp</mark> were a good size and not overcooked- still succulent and had \"the snap\". we also put half a dozen andouille  <mark>Sausage</mark> in with our shrimp (meaning half a dozen slices- not individuals <mark>Sausage</mark>) which were great in the sauce. ask for some lime/lemons and salt and pepper. i find when it gets a bit too spicy, dipping the meats in lemon helps balance the hnj sauce out.\n\nfor sides i needed my rice! hahaha i swear, a filipino girl can't have <mark>Shrimp</mark> with no white rice. it was $2 for a small bowl and i can easily devastate a few bowls when i'm eating spicy...so in that sense- they are making a killing off this per scoop thing. bf wanted some <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>- pretty good, but for nearly $5 i think it's overpriced for what it is. that's where some places get ya- a la carte sides.  we also had ice teas and a blue moon. it came to nearly $50.\n\nmajor kudos to the staff for accommodating 16 peeps and keeping the service going consistently. i would die if i was eating spicy foods and drinks are neglected. so glad i didn't get a hnj sauce with a medium level!!! they keep up on drinks and kept checking in on us and i definitely appreciate attentive service. \n\nthis place was a fun experience, but definitely brings out the inner ocd where i am hoping for a bucket or a plastic bag even to appear so i can hide the shells from myself and keep the table clean. hell, i even had shrimp brains all over my arms from myself and my table mates so dont wear your finery here!  i understand though why some esteemed yelpers like teri c. are regulars as it is fresh and tasty, but since it's such a messy experience. with a need for a shower to remove the seafood garlic smell, i doubt i can do this too often. i say, what a good call for a uye though. at this point if i can be dripping shrimp juice off my face and squirting my neighbor from the head cracking, then really whats there to be shamed of in front of the yelp crew? \n\n i will come back for <mark>Shrimp</mark> again. i like crawfish time to time, but for the per pound price and naturally small body with a big heavy head it's not always worth the trouble. i can also only eat so much of the head buttery tamal/brains. i feel then the crawfish is slightly wasted since the head makes for half the animal and seems like half the reason to have them. i have a cousin who i know would love this place, so i know there will be a future trek.  i am curious about their fried softshell crab and maybe some oysters i can dip in hnj sauce. \n\ni will bring a lot of wet wipes and a change of clothes for next time.",

            "las vegas is sin city for a reason; it celebrates the seven deadly sins. in vegas, your greatest weakness or vice becomes the source of all your pleasures. we were ready to give into our carnal desires and get down and dirty, indulging our voracious, gluttonous appetites. we wanted to get stuffed with something hot n juicy. \n\nhot n juicy is known for their seafood: crab (dungeness, blue, snow), shrimp, and of course, crawfish. you pick the type of seasoning (<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> or the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>) and the level of spiciness (mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy). \n\nwe ordered 2 lbs of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and 2 lbs of crawfish with <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> at medium, 2 pieces of corn, 2 red <mark>Potato</mark>, etouffee (a cajun seafood stew, similar to gumbo), and a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. eating at hot n juicy is not an elegant refine affair. it's messy work because they dump a plastic bag of whatever seafood you ordered and you're only protection is the plastic table covering and a plastic bib. you open the bag and dig in.\n\nthe crab meat was very sweet and juicy. it was perfectly cooked. i found that the spiciness of the food depended on the type of seafood because the seasoning is on the outside of the shell. the meat isn't spicy unless you soak it in the sauce first. i found the level of spiciness in the crawfish much higher because the tail meat was much smaller and there was more shell around it, unlike the crab meat where i could pull out large pieces of meat out of the shell. also i got more spicy sauce from the crawfish because i sucked crawfish heads. after a while my lips got tingly and numb from the cajun spices. \n\ni've never had crawfish whole before. i only had them de-shelled. while i love crawfish and the meat was great, i'll never have them whole like that again. the tail meat is rather tiny (i like 'em big -- size matters when it comes to these things). at the end, we looked at the mountain of shell and agreed that it was more work than it was worth. crawfish is mostly shell and i'd rather pay someone to shell them for me.\n\netouffee was a spicy rice seafood stew. i liked the flavor and the level of spice was just perfect for me. i thought the rice was a tad overcooked and mushy from just sitting in a pot all day, but in general it was enjoyable.\n\nthe boiled red <mark>Potato</mark> were much needed as a break from the relentless cajun spice. they were nice and sweet. the corn is out of season, so not as sweet and juicy as in the summer, but still tasty. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were crispy and tasty.\n\nthe final price for all of us was $30/person for three people. we gorged ourselves on great seafood and left utterly satiated. happy ending for us indeed.\n\nwhat happens in vegas, stays in vegas. but this is one of the few times where you wish you could get crabs and bring them home with you.", 
            "i can honestly admit i'm a lazy person when it comes to eating. cutting a piece of meat with a knife and/or fork/spoon (when i'm even lazier) is probably the most strenuous work i'll tolerate. using my fork or spoon is enough, isn't it?\n\nthe only, i repeat only, food i'll take time to carefully work at and eat is shellfish...specifically crab, lobster and crawfish. unfortunately, being located in the tri state area, there is a lack of crawfish which saddens me. since i was in town for work i jumped at the opportunity to eat one of my favorite shellfish friends...crawfish!\n\nafter leaving the ces convention center, my colleagues and i hailed a taxi* and requested to go to hot n juicy located in chinatown. a split second later, we realized hot n juicy sounded like a strip club so we joked around with the taxi driver and insisted it wasn't a peep show. we were going to that after we ate.\n\nmy colleagues didn't know it but i was giggling like a little school girl when we arrived. unfortunately for them, they aren't as adventurous when it comes to food so they ordered calamari, <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> and fries which they enjoyed.\n\nour waiter was extremely informative, briefly describing to us (mostly me) how to order the seafood (per pound), by seasoning and spiciness. since i've been to boiling crab i already knew what i wanted...2 lbs of <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> crawfish with medium heat. the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> seasoning is so mouth wateringly good that i could drink it as a side (not recommended though). they serve the seafood in plastic bags with bibs and paper towels. this is the messiest meal you will ever eat but so worth it. i was in business attire but was able to leave without any stains!\n\nas i twisted and separated the head and tail, sucked the head and pushed out the meat from the tail...my colleagues looked at me in complete disgust like i was a monster. did i feel bad? not at all. i easily finished the 2 lbs of crawfish like a true fatty. i ordered medium heat but my mouth was on fire pretty much the entire time i was eating so to counteract the heat, i took big swigs of beer which helped. \n\nthe seafood pricing on the menu says market price so be sure to ask the waiter beforehand. the crawfish was about $10 per pound. currently, they're having a bogo shrimp special because they opened up another hot n juicy location in washington, dc. do i hear a road trip?\n\nmy next visit will showcase their <mark>Blue Crab</mark> legs. if you're ever in vegas or dc, i would highly recommend coming here if you're a seafood lover and don't mind getting messy. it's a freakin' dream.\n\na fun tip, hot n juicy was on man vs. food.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n*in las vegas, taxis aren't allowed to pick up passengers on streets like nyc. they have to pull into a parking lot, hotel, restaurant, etc.", 
            "we heard about this place spring of 2010 and finally went january 2011 when i was in the mood for some mud-bugs! \nwe moved to las vegas from louisiana. we only lived in louisiana for 2 1/2 years but that's long enough to know about some good southern food! \nmy husband and i got the same thing; 2 pounds of crawfish with spicy cajun (<mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> and <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>) flavoring with medium spice level. i myself noticed the spice level in the corn since we had the corn and potato added to the bag's of crawfish. medium was even spicier than what we ever had in louisiana, but the waiter did inform us to go down a level of what we were used to. \nthe crawfish was pretty good all in all. my husband and i both only had about 5 good sized crawfish in each of our bags, maybe since it's off season. so that was a disappointment. i wish that they would clean the the crawfish before they cook them. it's not fun looking at a crawfish that looks like it still has dirt and sand on it.....ya ya ya i know their called mud-bugs but still. i know that would take some time for them to do but it just looks better. your going to a crawfish joint not a chinese buffet with crawfish. \nit was kinda pricey since we're used to paying a couple bucks a sack in louisiana, granted here they are the ones taking the time to boil them. during off season with live crawfish (the waiter said some night's they're frozen) it worked out to be about $10-$11per pound. (on the menu for crawfish it does say market price, the waiter said during season it might be about $8 per pound) they don't have a kids menu so we had to pay $7.50 for our 3 year old daughter to get a chicken nugget's and fries basket. for all 3 of us we got a total of 4lbs. crawfish, 2 extra corn's, chicken and fries basket, 1 soda and 2 water's and our bill was $65.00 before tip. we will try to get back before we move out of state this summer but we are also planning on having some shipped in from louisiana and doing our own crawfish boil so we'll see. if we were staying here in vegas i'm sure we would go back. \n\ni", 
            "i saw this spot on man v. food and thought i'd give it a try when i'm in town.  it smelled delicious when we walked in and reminded me of home.  i missed crawfish so much i made it a mission to visit this place.  they had a variety of flavors to choose from and there are other seafood items on the menu as well.  my favorite was the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> crawfish i just wish i heeded the reviews and ordered the mild instead of the medium spicy.  i feel like i would've enjoyed the flavor more because it was burning my mouth.  everything was good but because i'm from the south it doesn't quite compare.  i'd give this place 3 1/2 stars.", 
            "being a huge fan of boiling crab, it was only natural that i had to try this place out. we ordered 2 lbs of the shrimp with corn, mild spices (i'm a big pansy when it comes to spicy foods) with the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> seasoning and it was delicious. 2 lbs between three was just the right amount and the mild was the right amount of spice for me. maybe next time, i'll be more ballsy and try the medium. thankfully, we got there relatively early, around 5 pm, so we only had to wait a few minutes. it was a great experience and it definitely does not hurt that the beer was cheap too!", 
            "so we went for the first time on a thursday about 12 o clock we went in and it wasnt very busy. the service was good we ordered the 1 pound of shrimp and 1 pound of <mark>King Crab</mark>(not so much in 1lb!) the shrimp were in <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> and  spicy level...yeah they were spicy alright!! and the <mark>King Crab</mark> had the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning and medium spice level and that was good! u dont get plates or silverware other than what u need for the crab. it was great but we didnt have much time to enjoy it since our daughter had a doctors appointment! but next time we go it will be enjoyed better!!!!!!", 
            "3, 2, 1!\n\ni have been hearing about this place for months! i am the last of my friends to venture, but finally, i tried it with a group of 8 tonight, and i loved it!\n\nthe wait is well worth it.  great concept of simplicity.  bag of seafood, bib, paper towels.  i tried <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> and <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauces, they were all delicious!  i must say i am not a lover of crawfish, so that will not make my order next time, but the spices were very robust and the shrimp and crab were awesome!\n\ni cannot say anything that hasn't already been positively reflected, so here are a few tips for the remaining 4 people in vegas who haven't been yet...\n\nyou will get completely messy.  no clean way to do it.  it's an experience, so go with it.\n\nunless you are the magician chris angel, your hands will be subjected to injury if you order <mark>King Crab</mark>. it is spiked and slippery once covered in the sauce and regardless of the aiding utensils, it's a pain.  stick with regular or dungeness.\n\nspicy is spicy.  it has a kick, however, i'm definitely not scared of extra spicy next time...take that anyway you want it.  if you're familiar with archi's thai, i do an 8.5 and i could probably handle a 9, but my stomach would build a small strike picket area amongst my small and large intestine...\n\nfinally, go with friends! a first date is not cute there...you leave smelling like you've been out an entire season of \"deadliest catch,\" and the scent will stay on your hands and nails for days.\n\namazing. bravo.  i'm going again this weekend!",

            "my boyfriend saw this place on man vs. food and it is only about a 5 minute drive from the strip. \n\nnot bad. we arrived at 12:30pm ready for seafood. yet, we were seated, given menus, then as we attempted to order we were informed that they are not currently serving crawfish. the item they are known for! unacceptable! we came here for the crawfish, thats what we wanted, so why would we order something else. the waitress expanded that they just received a shipment so their crawfish are frozen. first off, hearing frozen was a huge turn off. i live in the san francisco bay area so our seafood here is fresh. yet i had to remind myself that vegas is in the desert so fresh seafood here is unlikely. \n\nwe rolled our eyes and blew the joint. i swear i would be back but for the rest of the day i was getting puppy eyes from the honey so i agreed to give them a second try and attempt dinner.\n\nwe arrived again at 5:30 and we were seated after 10 minutes. we ordered a pound of hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> in medium and one pound of shrimp in <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> medium and a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. first off there is not one positive thing that i can recall about the fries so i would recommend ordering a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> instead. yes, order rice over fries. i never thought i would recommend that to anyone. ever.\n\nmy favorite flavor was the hot & juicy! it was packed with flavor and mighty tasty! the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> was good too! i would both order them again. the heat levels here though are a little off, if you want hot, order medium, etc. i would beware the extra spicy! \n\nthe place got pretty crowed around 6:20 and i was happy we arrived fairly early. the service here is lagging. you have to notify your waiter(ess) if you want more water. they don't really pay attention the details. \n\ni would go back if i lived there and needed a crawfish fix, but on my next vegas trip or any after i will not be visiting hot and juicy. it was good, but it wasn't that good. \n\n(i took off a star for not having crawfish when i went initially fyi)\n\noh and yes, my paws smelled 2 days after. the amount of soap didn't matter. the order sinks in! kinda yucky.\n\nhappy ripping off the heads of crawfish! \n\n(=", 
            "my second visit in a week. we only waited 5 minutes for heaven. my wife had the crab, less than mild, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> with corn and potato. she loved it. i had the shrimp, medium, hot & juicy flavor with corn and potato. the flavor was so delicious i will now only go with the hot & juicy flavor for now on. the corn was tender and the beer was cold. they must put something addicting in the flavor because i already want to go back. they were having a special on lobster, 16.99 a pound. i will try that next time.", 
            "not a fluke, the second time proved to be just as good as the first. i am not proud that katrina m. and i came here two days within a three day span, but it was that good.\n\nthis time we came with her family and ordered 4 pounds of shrimp in spicy <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, one pound in medium <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, one pound in extra spicy <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, one pound of spicy hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> crawfish, and one pound of spicy <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> crawfish. out of all the seasonings, their namesake is the best at the second to hottest level. their \"extra spicy\" did not deliver the scorching hot flavor i was expecting and would not make for a decent food challenge. the other two flavors were just mediocre, nothing special. we had also ordered calamari, but they are extremely salty. the sweet potato and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are cooked to a superb crispiness. ask for corn and <mark>Potato</mark> to be cooked with your seafood.\n\nyet again i could not resist the temptation and ordered a blue moon to go along with the meal. i might be completely out of the loop, but it has been a while since i have seen a restaurant offer beers for less than $5.50 a bottle. heineken, heineken light, corona, corona light, sapporo, and blue moon are the beers they offer for $3.\n\ni cannot stress enough that you should get there before 6 because the wait is nonexistent. for a party of six, half of us being present, they sat us right away. yet if another large party came and our group was not all there we would have to give up our table. they cannot be faulted for that. i understand the need to meet the demands. once we were all sat and ordered, the staff were very attentive with refilling drinks and taking our additional orders.", 
            "when you just want lots of shellfish and a casual setting you must go here. we ordered the crawfish, shrimp, and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, all great. we went with the hot and juicy, cajun, and <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauces all in mild and they were plenty spicy! it's fun to just talk and peel! it's a busy place and casual so don't expect 4 star service but the girls are nice and you can just flag someone down if you need a refill or reorder. we also ordered the calamari, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, rolls and rice. the side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> is enough for 2 to share unless you just love rice haha. the fries and calamari were ok i don't think i'd get them again. they also have fresh oysters! i'm not a huge seafood person but i still had fun and plan to go back. don't be snooty, tie on the apron, be patient and enjoy a lazy afternoon of conversation and crustaceans!",

            "again, another great off strip foodie find.  i dined here on 9/4/11 with my hubby and his brother and cousins.  we got here around 8:45pm and this place was jammed packed with people inside the restaurant and people waiting outside the restaurant.  we had to wait a good 30-45 minutes before we were actually seated.  staff awesome and helpful.  while we were waiting outside in the desert heat, the hostess came out and served us all ice waters, which was a really nice gesture knowing that it was hot and we were all waiting patiently for a table.  \n\nomg, food here is fantastic!!  everyone in my party loved the crawfish and shrimp.  we ordered both crawfish and shrimp in their <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning.  it was amazing!!!!!  we also ordered crawfish and shrimp in their <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce.  so good!!!!  my brother in law said that this place was way better than boiling crab and had better prices too!  \n\nthey had really delicious <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and their catfish and <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> are very tasty goodie too!  the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were spicy and can sneak up on you!  :)\n\n\ntip:  parking is limited, you may need to park on the street.  try to get there as early as possible as this place gets crazy busy!!!!", 
            "very good cajun fixin!  as soon as my wife & i landed in las vegas, we went straight to hot n juicy crawfish and it was off da hook!!!  you'll love the entire experience here, the entire staff greets you when you come in and all of the waiters are always checking up on you (great service!!!).\n\nnow, on to the food.  we ordered the 2lbs. of crawfish special (<mark>Garlic Butter</mark> & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> \"spicy\"), <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, hot rolls and etouffee.  i've been to new orleans and always loved cajun/creole food, but this place definately helps get your craving fixed in a hurry.  i absolutely loved the etouffee and craved it everyday that i was there.  after trying hot n juicy, it will be a ritual to go straight here from the airport once we arrive.", 
            "whenever we're in vegas, hot & juicy crawfish is always on our to do list.  in fact, yesterday when i flew in to vegas, it was my first stop after getting my rental car.  besides, what's not to love about food served in a plastic bag with rolls of paper towels on the table right?\n\nmy friend ordered a pound of <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> shrimp, a pound of <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> crawfish, an i ordered my usual hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> shrimp, medium.  that would be the only thing i would warn you about is the spice level.  i like spicy food and even the medium makes me think twice sometimes.  the flavor is a perfect balance of heat, spices, garlic, butter and just awesomeness.  i hope to go one more time before i leave.", 
            "pretty good...for vegas.  here's my recap:  parking could be better.  not a lot of spaces.  available spaces were a little tight.  seated immediately upon entering.  the place was pretty busy.  many tables with chairs, some with booths.  some booth seating was not accessible because the neighboring table was too close.  servers were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.  menu offered crawfish, shrimp, oysters, clam, lobster, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, and snow crab.  all market prices.  seasoning choices were <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.  choice of mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy.  sides: corn, potato, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, rice, rolls, and sausage.  also, appetizers were etoufee and a large variety of fried items: calamari, hot wings, soft shell crab, catfish, shrimp, and chicken nuggets.  we ordered two pounds of boiled shrimp: one <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> medium and the other <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> medium.  bibs were served first.  the bottom of the bib folds over to make a pocket to catch debris you drop.  we also ordered a side of white rice.  the cook time seemed about right, not real fast, but not too slow either.  constant line for men's restroom.  only one person at a time.  many people waiting to get in to wash their hands after eating.  the food comes out as it is ready, not served at the same time.  i prefer this method.  the shrimp is served in a clear plastic bag and the shells are left on the table.  plastic table cloth makes for quick and easy clean up.  the shrimp was good sized, hot, and flavorful.  there was a little extra juice in the bottom of the bag which we used to dip our shrimp once peeled.  also, we ladled some on the rice for a bit of flavor.  the shrimp was head and shell on.  this requires a little work, but is the traditional way to serve, saves the kitchen a bit of time, and leads one to believe the shrimp were alive when cooked.  i lived in louisiana for many years so i know there is a difference between <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> and cajun style, but i don't know why they made the distinction here.  most patrons in vegas won't know the difference.  the difference here is that louisiana had more butter and cajun was more traditional with more spices and less brother allowing the sweet flavor of the shrimp to come through better.  the difference is almost not noticeable, but i prefer their <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>.  the rice was okay.  all in all the food was pretty good.  we really enjoyed it.  on a side note, they did not purge the shrimp.  that is, the gastrointestinal track and the poop were still in the shrimp.  vegas patrons don't know any better.  its kind of gross, but i ate anyways knowing that it won't hurt you (otherwise, the place would have been shut down a long time ago).  there were plenty of paper napkins at each table and wet wipes served at the counter and with the bill, but i would have preferred a washing station, similar to those at cravin cajun.  you get really, really messy eating boiled shrimp and that stuff is super painful if you get it in your eyes.  they do serve alcohol, but we had tap water, which was served in styrofoam cups.  the server did not ask if we wanted lemon, but she brought out a styrofoam bowl with almost two whole lemons (kind of a waste).  shrimp was $8.99 per pound and the side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> was $2.  we really enjoyed this experience and will be coming back.  i tried the crawfish on a previous visit here.  it was the best crawfish in vegas.  flavor was right, but a bit small for louisiana standards.  i love crawfish, but think the shrimp is a better deal because there is much more meat.  i really like this place, but cravin cajun is better.", 
            "recommended by a neighbor we just had to give it a try...\n\nwhat an incredible find...\n\nservice - tim was our server and he rocked. he was on the ball and his support team/other staff were awesome.\n\ndrinks - soda, beer and wine...sapporo $3, can't beat an ice cold japanese beer.\n\nambiance/tableware - no knifes and forks, all you get is paper towels, a bib and unlimited wipes at the end of the meal. decor is rustic, plenty of flat screens, great little bar area, just good clean (messy)  fun.\n\ndon't let plastic bag serving vessels put you off and make as much mess as you want to!\n\nfood - pound of <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, mildly spiced and just friggin off the charts. super succulent and delicious.\n\npound of hot n juicy flavored, mildly spiced with corn and a few red <mark>Potato</mark>. great flavor, really really juicy and plump. getting two pounds the next time!!! corn and <mark>Potato</mark> perfect.\n\npound of mild, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> <mark>King Crab</mark>...omg to die for. nothing really needs to be said just get them and lots of them!\n\nbill was $63 for soda, 3 beers and all that food (<mark>King Crab</mark> was most expensive at $24 per pound), you just won't find a better deal or a better way to spend some time getting covered, literally, in flavor and eating great food.\n\nthanks tim, we will be back!\n\nps. they have a location closer to the strip but according to tim this location is the original, smaller and has a more homey felling to it. the owner is expanding the chain but not franchising. nice to hear.", 
            "i've tried two other places but they can't beat how much flavor hot n juicy has to offer in the sauces they use on their seafood. i definitely recommend getting the shrimp since it has more \"meat\" for the pound rather than all shell but if you're willing to spend the extra bucks for the other shelled fish. why not? any seasoning you get has so much flavor. definitely get the \"hot n juicy\" flavor even without spice it's good. <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> & <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> is delicious too. they also offer delicious calamari.  i'll definitely be back here over and over again.", 
            "we really wanted to try this place because my friend works here and we love boiling crab type crawfish joints!:d \n\nthis is actually my first time getting my hands down and dirty with the seafood because usually i'm too \n::ughhh i don't wanna smell:: \n::ewww its gonna get under my nails and all over my hands::\nyeah... i'm a shame... but i finally decided that i'll get over my prissy self to enjoy some damn good crustaceans hahha\n\ni love shrimp! get the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>!! it's a mix of all their seasonings (<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> and <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>) and its soooo yummy!! i am a wimp and cannot for the life of me take spicy, so the server suggested i try it without spice and yummm it was sooo good!!! my bf is the total opposite and loves spice, so when he got the hot n juicy crawfish at spicy, he said it wasn't spicy enough -.-;;;; he is a fatass and got 4lbs of crawfish and was totally enjoying every last bit of it. a little too excited....\nwe all shared a dozen oysters... mmmm it was a relief and cool break from the spiciness of the <mark>Crawfish</mark> for my  friends.\n\nmy friends got the crawfish too but in medium  hot n juicy. they are big boiling crab fans and said that there was a certain zing to their seasoning that bc doesn't but didn't want to love it more because of how far it is from us (we live in orange county). they also got the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>. the catfish was breaded a little too much, and didn't taste as fresh as the rest of our meal. \n i got the <mark>Soft Shell Crab Basket</mark> on top of my shrimp and that was really good. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> that came with it weren't as impressive but were made better by the leftover hot n juicy sauce that i had. hehehe\n\nall in all, we had a good experience, our waitress was really cool (katherine, kaitlyn?? i don't remember....) pretty attentive, but we had to nudge her for water sometimes. \n\nwe'll probably be back, considering the long list of places we need to try in vegas in our short weekend stays.", 
            "i don't even know why i'm reviewing this. i feel like i can't do it justice because i'm not really crazy about this kind of food to begin with ... but out of an obligation to being a good yelp steward, here goes nothing.\n\nno full bar. only beer and wine. of course, i can't even imagine drinking something else with a seafood boil so i guess that works. the seasoning is really good. i had the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> something something skrrrrimp mild... and even mild was warm so be careful.\n\nit's a super popular place so either go early or prepare to wait. after you order, utensils will arrive in the form of a bib and gloves. get crackin'. hope you enjoy seeing what your insect of the sea delight looked like shortly before its demise because it is fully intact.\n\nthey have a fried selection if that isn't your thing. ;-)", 
            "ok, i'm not a las vegas local (even though my 2 brothers-in-law are).  so i found about hot n juicy from tv, specifically travel channel's man vs food.  knowing that this place was been made famous from this show, i came here for lunch on friday of my last vegas visit.\n\nwe met one of my brothers-in-law for lunch here, arriving in the parking lot 5 minutes before 12 noon.  even though the restaurant wasn't even open yet, there were over a dozen people waiting outside the door already!  \n\nonce the staff let the horde in, we were seated right away and given menus.  as this is an asian-owned establishment, i recommend not ordering all spicy seasoning, unless you can power through the heat.  here's what i ordered for our party of 3:\n\n1 pound of shrimp, with <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, mild spice\n1 pound of crawfish, louisana style, medium spice\n1 order of calamari\n1 order of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\n\nthe fries and calamari came out first; they were good and hot, but not exceptional.  but when the shrimp and crawfish arrived, the real feast began.  the shrimp were big, and the sauce was mild and tasty.  and while the crawfish were cooked in a \"medium\" sauce, it was plenty hot for me and my dining companions.  just be careful not to suck the sauce too quickly; it will clear up your sinuses in a hurry!\n\njust like any of these seafood boil places, be ready to get down and dirty.  they have lobster bibs and full rolls of paper towels on the tables for a reason!\n\noverall, this was one of our favorite meals in las vegas.  it's in chinatown and pretty far away from the strip, so rent a car to get here.", 
            "hot n juicy is the best. ever since my husband and i discovered this place, we have been addicted. my husband loves the crawfish and i love their shrimp. their <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce is to die for.\n\nthe place opens at noon- and by that time, there are usually people waiting to get in. sometimes getting a soda refill can take 10 minutes, but it is sooooo worth it.", 
            "i finally got to try the original hot n juicy crawfish during my recent trip to vegas last week!\n\nafter getting dropped off in a cab at boiling crab and finding out that they were out of crawfish, (!!!) a group of 9 of us literally walked a mile to hot n juicy.  we split our orders into 2, and my group ordered: \n\n- 10 pounds of crawfish, hot, <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>\n- 2 pounds of shrimp, hot, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>\n- 1 pound of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, hot, <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>\n\neverything was flavorful, tender, and juicy.  it was definitely more \"hot\" than i had expected, (i'm used to the \"hot\" here in dc) which wasn't a bad thing at all.  although they messed up our order of shrimp (they gave us <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> instead of <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>) and the server was very unaccomodating towards the mistake, (she asked us: \"are you sure that's the wrong one?\") repeatedly having to ask for things, (salt and pepper and limes, gloves, cleaning out our buckets, etc.) and spilling juices on my back while cleaning up -- everything else was smooth.  i could understand that it was really busy and serving a group of 9 might have been challenging, especially because we all had different drink orders and requests.\n\nthis is definitely a \"must-try\" if you're in vegas and love seafood!", 
            "what else can i say but mmmmmmmm. we had the address on the gps but just happened to see this one before we reached our destination. come to find out, there's two locations super close to each other. we went straight for the seafood. we got a pound of crawfish in <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, mild and a pound of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, in <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> mild. everything was awesome! i would have liked it more spicy, but wifey couldn't have handled it. next time we'll prob both get our own stuff. the seafood was super fresh and cooked to perfection. messy, but super worth it. def go if you want a cool no frills seafood experience. and make it spicy!!!", 
            "they open at noon, we came around 12:30 and it was already packed with only 2 tables open.  our group of 4 was greeted and seated quickly, but getting us menus and our orders took a while.  we saw another group who was seated after us get their menus, orders in, and drinks before we even got our menus.  we finally waved someone down after 15 min of servers walking past us, and he didn't seem very enthusiastic to help us.  he first said \"so is it your first time here?\" and i say yes, he says with (ugh)\"it seems like its everyone's first time here today...\" and goes on about how to order and everything.  we've been to other similar seafood places like this back home so we are not totally new to this type of place, but it was our first time.. still, whatever.\n\nthe hot n juicy sauce here is awesome!  we ordered regular spicy, but i think we could handle extra spicy!  its a nice garlic-buttery-spicy sauce.  my friend ordered the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce but it was not good at all.  \n\nthe <mark>King Crab</mark> legs are huge, and one order came with only 4 legs.  i was a little disappointed because the seafood places back home (very similar to this) serve more legs.\n\nthe food also took forever to get to us.  we got our orders really far apart from each other, and they seemed to forget our rice.  the servers were prompt with filling our drinks though.", 
            "like most yelpers, i first heard of hot 'n juicy from man vs. food but the yelpers seemed mixed on this one so i kept my expectations low. \n\neven during midday, the parking lot was practically full. i could smell seafood-y goodness wafting through the door. i was seated quickly near a fuzzy tv & the waitress even moved me to a cooler seat. i was wary about service but was pleasantly surprised by the kind & attentive servers. \n\nmy friend & i shared 2lb crawfish & 2 lb shrimp mild (my body won't allow me to consume spicy anymore but mild still had a bit of spice). i'm not a fan of boiling crab's the whole shebang-- i prefer <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>-- so i am in the same camp with other yelper who felt the hot & spicy sauce could use more garlic. i also felt the food could have come out a little hotter temperature-wise.  \n\nwater was free, the wait was nonexistent on a saturday afternoon, parking was easy, they carried $3 bottled sapporo (is this because it's near chinatown?), you could add potato, & both they had multiple restrooms (one of my big qualms).\n\nfor me, it comes down to the food. overall impression: good, not quite boiling crab good.", 
            "11/1/12 - 6:30pm - i will admit, i am not a huge fan of <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> seafood. however a large group of us were going out for dinner and this is the place they selected. i am pretty opened minded with food and wanted to give it a good shot. \n\nthe place is busy, i definitely recommend planing to arrive with the possibility you will have to wait a minute for a table. my girlfriend and i had a lb of shrimp mild with the hotnspicy special seasoning and a lb of <mark>Blue Crab</mark> with <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>. we also ordered the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and corn fritters. \n\nthe shrimp showed up in a bag marinating in the sauce, the crab came shortly after in its own bag with the fries and fritters in tow. it was messy to eat and absolutely delicious!! i would definitely recommend the pace to anyone who wants to go enjoy some delicious seafood with incredible flavor. we had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed the food!!", 
            "i love seafood and this place definitely has fresh seasonal seafood from <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, crawfish, clams, lobster, oyster, and shrimp. since this place is usually packed, it's recommended that you call ahead for reservations. \n\nthe staff and service is very helpful in recommendations and attentiveness. they will refill your glasses of water when they get a chance, get more napkins whenever they come to your table with more orders, and make sure you order enough before the kitchen is closed. \n\nthe set up is simple: order seafood by the pound. you can choose the seasoning for your seafood (like <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>) as well as the spice level. then, the food is served in clear plastic bags and all you need to do is rip it open and dig in. you can make a mess on the table and not worry about the clean up. it's messy, it's fun, and it's delicious. \n\nbesides seafood, you could order sides like their <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> or rolls to soak up the flavorful broth or sauce that is used to cook the seafood. \n\nfast, fun, and filling, hot n juicy crawfish is the best place for people who want a feast of fresh seafood without the worry of cooking or cleaning up.", 
            "my favorite are the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>. i like it with <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce. their shrimp is big and their <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce is delicious! i even like to get rice on the side to put sauce on it and eat the rice like that if i'm feeling really hungry. i'm not a fan of the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce though, i think it's a mixture of all the sauces put together and it just doesn't taste good. crawfish is good when in season long enough to grow big. when they're not in season they suck because it's frozen so it's mushy and doesn't taste as good.\n\nextra spicy is reallly spicy! to where its painful, so avoid unless you love very spicy food! i get spicy or medium.",

            "one of my new favorite places to eat in vegas!  i'm a southern girl and grew up eating mudbugs (crawfish) piled high on backyard picnic tables.  it's next to impossible to find really good cajun crawdaddies outside of the deep south so i usually avoid trying because i'm almost always disappointed.  i have found the mudbug holy trail though!!\n\nmy guy is a yankee and my mom and i are on a mission to southernize him as best we can hehe.  so one night crawdaddies were brought up and i realized i had a major hankering for the little red guys i had heard good things about this place so i decided to give it a go so i could quench my craving and take my guy's crawdad virginity, two birds, one stone and all that hullabaloo. \n\nwe got there and there was about a twenty minute wait.  we had to wait outside cause the place is pretty packed with tables.  we were seated and our server was very nice and took the time to explain how things worked.  you order your protein (crawdaddies, shrimp, soft-shelled crabs etc) by the pound and choose your seasoning (cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> etc) and they bring them out in bags.  no plates in this place...the tables are draped in plastic, there are plastic bibs available...you may look sill but they are definitely needed, those suckers might be small but they are seriously messy!  this is not the place to go if you plan to do anything afterwards.  \n\nwe ordered a couple pounds if crawfish with cajun seasoning and an order of corn fritters.  i love spicy food, he doesn't.  it was a hit with us both, not too spicy and not too mild.  the fritters were divine and a good sized serving for the two of us. \n\nthe big bonus was the price.  the market price of the crawdaddies that day was $7/lb, the next day i was at the grocery store and there were frozen crawfish for $6.75 for a little under a pound and you still had to cook them and do the cleaning up afterwards.  i'd gladly pay a quarter more to not have to do the work!\n\ni haven't stopped raving about this place and keep dropping hints as often as i can that i'm jonsin' to go back.  i see some more head suckin' in my future (the heads are where all the yummy bits are, if you don't suck the heads you are mission out!) see y'all soon lil mudbugs!", 
            "first timers..we really enjoyed our meal of calamari, fried catfish and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> mild seasoning of <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>. food was served super hot. come prepared to get messy if you order the crab, served in a plastic bag and comes with a nut cracker,  pick and paper towels. towelettes served after. :)", 
            "i have dined here many times before but was disappointed today when i brought my 5 year old son in for some snow crab and <mark>King Crab</mark>. because i was dining with a child i ordered the mild <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> seasoning. the sauce was nothing close to mild and almost too spicy for me to enjoy.  i asked why it was a red color (garlic and butter are not red) and the server wouldn't tell me specifics and just said it was a cajun spice blend. i didn't order the cajon seasoning flavor and from the menu choices, i chose <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> thinking that's all it would be. the seasonings should be explained better on the menu.", 
            "never get enough of it! always have <mark>Shrimp</mark> hot n juicy or <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>. 5/5! <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> is delicious as well. 5/5! my friends always add a corn. i ordered lobster once. 4/5! lol i don't know how to eat it!! they said they can crack it for you. crabs are good, my friends' favorite! 5/5! <mark>Sausage</mark> are optional,  i had them sometimes. 3/5! i have been both places. my friends like it on decatur 4/5!,  but i kinda like it at valley view because it is newer, even though there is wired smells and long queue! 3/5!", 
            "such amazing flavors!\n\nwe stopped in for lunch and tried the crawfish and the shrimp. we went for very mild spice which was great, but still left a nice lingering burn, and tried the hot n juicy & the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>.  both were excellent - quite literally finger licking good.  this is a messy experience, but that is all part of the fun.\n\na great meal to share with a group of friends so everyone can try a bit of something new.", 
            "out of the 3 locations in las vegas, this is my favorite. i feel as if it is the cleanest with the friendliest staff. i also like that you dont leave the restaurant smelling like youve just eaten hnj. the other location on spring mountain - if i eat there and leave to go meet my friends a couple hours later...they can tell what i had for lunch due to the smell seeping out my pores haha the bathroom is always clean as well with plenty of soap! after eating, i always have to go and wash my hands, and the soap always being there is a plus.\n\nfor the food, \nthe crab is usually on point for me. it is cooked all the way through. there was one time where my crab was still cold, but the waitress immediately apologized and made it on the house. i usually get the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> flavor, because you can never go wrong with tons and tons of garlic!!! the hot n juicy flavor is good as well. i also sometimes vary with a pound of shrimp or a dozen oysters. the shrimp is pretty big, so if youre not that hungry, you should get half a pound. the oysters are always yummy and i have yet to get a scrawny puny one. their <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are also very delicious - crispy and ful of flavor. i have not eaten the crawfish, but i hear its good. i feel like its too much trouble to go through all that peeling for a tiny piece of meat. \n\nyou can always ask for lemons and limes with salt/pepper fo rmore flavoring or to wash your hands with after. i like to grab some lemon sliced and rub them all over my hands to take away the smell and dirtiness. you can also ask for bibs to avoid splatter damage. \n\nall in all, i prefer this place over boiling crab even though some people claim they taste the same. i would definitely come pay this place a visit .", 
            "this location is usually quicker to get seated compared to their other restaurant on spring mountain so i chose this hot and juicy.  i love the green mussels & shrimp.  my preference is <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> with no spice.  baby spice is still a little too spicy for me.  have had issues with their servers not relaying no spice to the kitchen properly.  there is specific verbiage to order my preference which is \"butter & minced garlic only.\"  i couldn't remember the exact verbiage but described what i wanted and the server said she knew what i was describing.  my order came out wrong & i asked to get it corrected.  the manager on duty came to my table & proceeded to lecture me about how she told me the verbiage in the past.  first of all, the servers should be trained better so they know how to accurately write an order.  btw - my server told me she was new and still learning.  secondly, the manager on duty should politely tell the customer the problem will be fixed and not lecture.  its not the customers responsibility to write an order so the kitchen knows what to make.  i would give 5 stars because i love the food here but i'm deducting 2 stars since i've had problems here.", 
            "absolute goodness. my husband and i got shrimp with the hot n juicy seasoning and <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>. both were delicious. staff was ok but we just wanted to eat a big meal in the middle of the afternoon. \nwe will come back again for the juicy seasonings!", 
            "best crawfish and shrimp ever!  i love how i can choose what spice level and flavor. the hot n juicy, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> and <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> are amazing! the staff has always been amazing. who am i kidding everything on their menu is amazing.ive been going here since they opened and i am addicted to them.", 
            "we always get the <mark>Shrimp</mark> with <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> (spicy). the clams were very good too. the catfish does not have a lot of meat (mostly batter) and that sucks. not must of a crawfish fan but love me some clams and <mark>Shrimp</mark>.", 
            "at last count there were two hot n juicy crawfish locations in las vegas, but i have it on good authority that this is the one you want, at 4810 spring mountain road. my husband and i were steered towards this one, further away though it is, by a reliable local, which is the kind of good advice you want when choosing an off-strip, local neighborhood place. driving from the strip, you actually have to pass a hot n juicy crawfish (in chinatown) to get to the \"right\" hot n juicy crawfish.\n\nlocated on a busy multi-lane road chock-a-block with shopping centers and fast food, hot n juicy crawfish doesn't look like much from outside. or inside, for that matter -- a decent-sized space looks smaller than it is because of so many ragtag tables squeezed together, it's usually packed, it's loud, and i wouldn't exactly call it clean. you're in the middle of the desert but the vibe is carefree beachside -- the floor is a mess and most diners are wearing plastic bibs, happily covered in sauce. you order at a counter, from a menu posted on the wall overhead, and they call you when your order is ready. \n\nthough you can get baskets of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, wings and chicken nuggets, hot n juicy crawfish put their signature item right in their name. when you order the crawfish, there's a method. no \"crawfish nazis\" here -- the staff will kindly help you out if you're a first-timer. you order your crawfish by the pound, then you pick a seasoning, then you pick a spice level. for seasoning, you pick from <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> or a <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. spice levels range from mild to \"holy s@#t.\" that's not what they call it, that's what i called it. if you like spicy, you love this stuff.\n\nthe best experience is to go off-hours with a group, get an assortment of seasonings and spice levels, get some cold beers and have a blast. wear something washable, yer gonna get messy!", 
            "the best shrimp by pound that i had and it's only $12 something. it was so juicy and my <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce complements the taste. best of all i was in a hurry because i had to go to work and i told the hostess and within 3 minutes i got my order so fresh, hot and juicy. this is my favorite for seafood and will be back next month."

            "since returning from houston a couple of months ago, i found myself craving crawfish any chance i get.  after experiencing the crawfish craze in the westminster area of southern california, imagine my delight when i saw the sign for \"hot n juicy crawfish\" in las vegas.\n\nthe bf and i anxiously awaited the opening of this first of its kind restaurant in sin city and finally got to sit down to dinner the past sunday.  inviting a couple of newbies made the dining experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nwe started off with a pound each of the crawfish in every flavor - <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and hot n juicy combo.  at $8.99/lb, it was a dollar more than socal prices but we were okay with it.  for every two pounds you order, you get one corn and one potato.  so, we made sure we got our corn pieces and <mark>Potato</mark> and were able to choose what flavor we wanted it in.  (in the end, we ordered additional corn and potato on the side, corn runs about 50 cents each.)  we also threw an order of sausage ($2.50 for half a dozen or $4.00 for a dozen).  depending on the season, they should be offering <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, and shrimp.  you can also order oysters, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> or oyster baskets, catfish po-boy sandwich, or a basket of fries.\n\nthey didn't ask us how spicy we wanted our crawfish, later on telling us they automatically make it spicy unless otherwise stated.  the heat was a good amount, not too hot that it was unbearable and enough where we reached for our beverages.  of the four, i would say the <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> had the least flavor while the hot n juicy combo had the most.  we ordered four more pounds of the hot n juicy combo in this sitting.  the sausage was actually spicier than the crawfish!  we also found the crawfish to be pretty clean overall.  we're ones to suck up all the juices from the heads too, so they gotta be clean.  and i gotta admit, the last two pounds we had were especially good.  they do a good job on having cleaner crawfish than other places i've experienced.\n\nbe sure to get the salt and pepper mixture too.  you get a bowl of cut up limes and you squeeze all the lime juice into the little plastic cup and mix it all together.  this is usually meant for you to dip your crawfish in, but i found myself not needing it that much.\n\nservice was better too.  upon entering, they line your table up with the white plastic covering and lay out a roll of paper towels.  they also provide bibs too.  you can ask for plastic gloves, but they just get in the way.  they asked us often if we needed refills on our beverages and how we were doing overall.  (i would say this is probably because they are a new restaurant, i only hope they continue with this service in the future.)\n\nthey had a steady flow of customers this holiday weekend night.  it didn't get too busy, but they were never empty either.\n\nin conclusion, the four of us were pleased with our experience at hot n juicy crawfish.  it looks like we'll be coming back here a lot!  yay!\n\nside note: there's a 17% gratuity added for parties of six or more.\n\n(you can check out my food photos up above!)", 
            "not bad at all.  the crawfish was meatier than a similar one in california.  the <mark>Blue Crab</mark> was also good.  the shrimp pieces were nice and big.  what i like about this place is that it has good seasoning to choose from such as <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, house special, cajun style, and one other i can't remember.  they give you a piece of corn and a potato for ordering a 2lb bag of crawfish.  the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are good, but you can get similar tasting fries at a lot of places.  the medium spiciness has some kick to it.  they have actually five levels of spiciness which is ridiculous unless you're a hardcore fan of spicy food.  the service was good, but maybe it was because i went for lunch at a non-busy time.  the prices are just a dollar more than california, but it's still worth it.", 
            "i have never been to an authentic crawfish place in the deep south but i can say that this tasted fantastic.\n\nit's set up knowing you're going to eat like a slob. the table is covered with plastic. each table gets its own paper towel roll. everyone gets a bib. and afterwards you get handiwipes. i just went to wash my hands in the bathroom.\n\ni had mild, which other places call medium. their mild is good enough for me. good heat without killing my mouth. shrimp and crawfish were 10.99 a pound when we went 1-2 days ago. i had a pound of each. i'm glad i tried the crawfish but my favorite was the shrimp simply because there was more meat and i liked that it was sweeter and larger bits to eat. i was stuffed so next time if having the crawfish only, get 2 pounds as there is more shell than meat. if shrimp, i think a pound is just fine. i saw someone else get the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs and i may order that next time but i have a hell of a time getting the meat out of those so i may not if they are not pre cut down the length.\n\ni had the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> which is a equal mixture of their 3 sauces( cajun, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>). i'm not sure what it was, but there was an underlying orange and it tasted fantastic! maybe it wasn't orange but it didn't taste like lemon. perhaps it's part of their boil, or an accent in their <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce but wow. really complimented the food and went so yummy with the shrimp.\n\ni want to try the sauces alone next time but it's going to be hard to do because i know i like the mixture already.\n\ni ordered ice tea, and a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> in addition to my seafood boils. the ice tea was ok. not fantastic but good, but then i love a really really strong tea.\n\nthe rice was the perfect compliment for peeling seafood over. it caught all of the juices and was tasty eating when i was done peeling. yum yum good!!!\n\nmy husband had the catfish with fries. he finished way before i did and that was a bit of a bummer because the best part about eating there is peeling with your friends. friends don't let friends eat there without ordering a peeling meal.\n\nthe \"man versus food\" guy is going to be there on thursday but i really would only go if you're interested in crowds. nah..not for me. i just want their good food. i don't need a show to tell me something i already know. go if you like but man it's going to be a zoo.", 
            "after a long day of walking and shopping, we were hungry for some crawfish.  and thanks to yelp, we found a winner in vegas!\n\nthis place truly lives up to their name.  we ordered two pounds of shrimp and two pounds of crawfish...all medium spiciness with <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> seasoning.  we should've ordered a pound with different seasoning and heat....to test our taste buds.  i'm eyeing the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> and <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> seasonings for my next visit.  i think the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> had more garlic than butter....extremely potent!  \n\nthe crawfish was very spicy at medium...but we loved it.  some of these crustaceans were larger in size than at most places i've gone to.  the shrimp was my favorite though.  same spices as the crawfish, but more juicy and meaty.  we also ordered sausage, corn, and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>...which were all just okay for me.  \n\ncustomer service was top notch here...i just wish they were open later than 10 pm.  \n\nwe learned that the man vs. food show will be taping at this restaurant.  with their hot n juicy menu, it's evident why this place will be premiered.", 
            "incredible!  my boyfriend heard about this place from man v. food.  omg it was so amazingly good.  we took a cab from the strip and a cab back to binion's and worth every penny.  the servers were friendly, the owner very attentive and the food was amazing.\n\ni had crawfish for the first time.  not a lot of meat but watch out, they're spicy is super spicy. i'd be afraid to try the extra spicy option. the best thing i had there was the bag of <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> shrimp.  oh, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  this will definitely be a must-eat place everytime we visit vegas. soooo good.", 
            "if i lived in vegas, i would probably hit this place weekly.  i had a pound of the spicy hot n juicy  and yeah it was hot and i couldn't get enough of it.  my wife had the medium hot n juicy and for her, it was just right, not hot enough for me though.\n\nwe also shared a pound of the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> shrimp and omg it was amazing.  \n\ni love this place!!!  keep up the good work yelpers and keep up the great ratings.", 
            "a very enjoyable experience. tonight i went with modest expectations after watching adam richmond eat here on man v. food. the experience was great. i met a few locals who said they eat their once a week, and started eating there before it was on tv. they suggested several dishes: the hot n juicy, medium spice, crawfish and sausage; the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> medium spice shrimp, and the mild spice <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>. everything was very enjoyable. the prices were very reasonable too. the waiters/waitress were very attentive, and the owner even gave us quite a bit of face time. i come to vegas yearly, and this will be a normal stop for me.", 
            "when i first walked into this place i noticed everyone wearing a bib and i thought to myself i refuse to look like an idiot and wear a bib. 10 minutes later when the crab came out, i looked like an idiot. i like this place as a nice change of pace in las vegas, it's different and when the food is dumped right in front of you, you have to bypass your usual table manners and just ripping into the food with your hands hoping you don't get juice in someone's eye from all the cracking. i never knew a roll of paper towels could vanish that fast. i didn't get to try much just the crawfish and the crab, marinated with <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> and <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> respectively. the crab was good, what's not to like about <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>? i just wish crab itself was cheaper because i'm hungry and 20 legs deep just makes me want more. the crawfish on the other hand, i can do without. love the juices, but after about 30 crawfish i felt like all i had was a bowl of soup. good place, medium layout, decently clean bathrooms (b-) and the more people the better.", 
            "wow!! hot and juicy crawfish was great. first time there and didn't know what to expect. we ordered 2 lbs of <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> crawfish and 1 lb of <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> shrimp. flavor was awesome!! the spice was to much and it was mild. i'm sucha a wimp. :( i would definitely recommend going there with a bunch of friends. atmosphere was nice. i guess it'd be what you'd expect if you were in lousiana. but i love the food and id go again!!", 
            "if you find yourself in las vegas, this place is a must go! we were seated right away...i got 1 lb of <mark>King Crab</mark> legs and 1 lb of shrimp with <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> seasoning and mild sauce...the mild sauce alone was hot, i cant imagine getting their hottest hot sauce...if you're not a big seafood person, like my girlfriend, they have chicken nuggets with fries...the chicken nuggets were very juicy, and the fries are indescribable definitely go back if i ever find myself in vegas\n\nfor people in the bay area, hot n juicy crawfish pwns the boiling crab", 
            "hot n' juicy is an old favorite of mine located on spring mountain between decatur and jones. hot n' juicy is definitely the messiest eatery in town, and all the more fun because of it. sometimes when i give that description people don't want to try it, but it would be a shame not to. besides the fun of eating here, the food is great. how can you really go wrong with fresh seafood, butter, and cajun seasonings?\n\ntoday i ordered one pound of the crawfish ($9.99) and my husband ordered one pound of the snow crab ($13.99). we both asked for the hot n' <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning, extra spicy! you are free to choose your heat level as well as the style of seasoning you prefer - <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, juice cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, or <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. besides crawfish and snow crab, you can also order <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, or shrimp.\n\nthe first time i had a crawfish boil was at my brother's graduation from university of the south in sewanee, tennessee. i remember them dumping huge buckets of steamed crawfish onto the tables and everyone would just have at them, discarding the shells and heads onto neighboring tables. at hot n' juicy it's a little different, but not much. you are given bibs and your table is covered in white plastic that is accessorized with your own roll of paper towels. they bring your crawfish in plastic bags that are tied at the top to capture the heat. when you open the bag you get an aromatic burst of spicy steam that gets you really excited for what you are about to enjoy. this is where the fun starts. crawfish are peel and eat little buggers that require somewhat of an experienced eater to navigate through them in order to get to the savory bits. first you must detach the tail, which you peel just as you would the tail of a shrimp. then, and this is most flavorful part, you must suck the head by gently squeezing it into your mouth so you can get all the juices and inner goodness out of it. if this sounds totally disgusting to you, go for the crab. they supply you with crab crackers, but ian and i agree they should probably pre-crack them for you to make the experience easier and allow all the seasoned butter to seep into the meat. whatever you decide to get, i'm sure you'll enjoy it.\n\nif you order two pounds of crawfish you get a hunk of corn on the cob and a red potato in your bag, but since we ordered one pound each of different items we opted for the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> ($2.99). these came out hot n' spicy with a side of cooling ketchup. we managed to reserve some of the fries to dip in the juices at the bottom of our bags, and this was way better than the ordinary condiment. who would have thought that you could make french fries even tastier and more unhealthy with the addition of seasoned butter? i guess europeans serve their fries with mayonnaise, so i don't feel too guilty or out of line.\n\nby the time you are finished, it looks like hurricane katrina has hit your table leaving a mass of wet and crumpled paper towels in her wake. this is certainly not a prime location for a wedding reception, but if you don't mind getting your hands dirty in the name of taste, you really should try hot n' juicy almost any other time.", 
            "ever since i saw this place on man v. food (one of my favorite food-related t.v. shows), i was determined to try this place during my next vegas trip.  alas the time had come and i dragged my friends to this place before our long drive back home to socal.  there are four different sauces you can choose from: <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. we got two pounds of shrimp, two pounds of crawfish and a pound of snow crab.  they were covered in <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> and the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.  we also got <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and sausage.  everything was so full of flavor.  all the seafood came in plastic bags to seal in the steam and flavor.  the crawfish were a bit hard to eat, but it was still quite delicious.  however, the only bad thing is that you will not get the smell out of your fingers for a couple days..no matter how much you wash your hands...and use hand sanitizer, but that's the price you have to pay for some delicious cajun seafood. :) i would definitely go back during my next vegas trip.", 
            "to be honest, i am a graduate of the boiling crab and amongst all the oc crawfish places, bc still reigns supreme!  but there is something to be said of the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce here. since this is my only las vegas experience i'm giving it a 4. with bc being a 5!  come before 6 to avoid the lines!", 
            "so i've tried to go twice already, each time was a 45 minute wait and each time i end up at cajun crawfish (big mistake btw).  i finally decided to do take out, taking that this is the only way i don't have to wait and the food is ready in 15 minutes. the stench of garlic seeped through the bag as i grabbed it and put it in my car.  i knew this was going to be good.  i ordered 1 lb of <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> crawfish + 1 lb of <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> crawfish.  i can't believe i'd been missing out! it was so good!  i ate until my lips were numb.  it was delish.   i can't believe i went to cajun crawfish each time i couldn't get into hot n juicy.  never again!  i paid about 25 bucks for 2 lbs of crawfish i believe?  well worth it tho.", 
            "hot and juicy is definitely some hot stuff! i came here for the first time with michelle w. last year and i really don't remember it being this packed for a weekend. however, the 20-30 minute wait was well worth the wait. we decided on the hot and juicy snow crabs in medium, the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> shrimp in mild, <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> basket with the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and a side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> for me. i was definitely salivating waiting for the food to come out...which actually didn't take very long! everything was soooooo good! next time though i think i will stick with the mild hotness level. my mouth was on fire by the time i was through...the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were probably not the best idea with all of this hotness going on, but i guess that's why they call it hot and juicy. everything that we ordered totaled up to about 45 bucks plus sodas....not a bad deal. btw....the rice with some sauce is oh so delicious! i will definitely be back for more garlic dousing!", 
            "this place was incredible.  after reading about it we went straight there from the airport.  it did not disappoint.  two of us had 2 lbs each of the snow crab, <mark>King Crab</mark> and shrimp.  the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce was delicious, the hot n juicy sauce even better.  service was super attentive.  only negative was they ran out of <mark>Blue Crab</mark> before we'd gotten there.  next time for sure...", 
            "<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> comin right up!\n\ni just came back from las vegas on a quick 23 hour trip and i managed to make it out to hot n juicy in chinatown. my friends heard of it from man vs. food and i thought the pictures on yelp looked promising, so it wasn't very hard to persuade me to go. we go there a little after it opened and were welcomed very excitedly by the staff. of course, since we were there so early, we were seated right away. we ordered the calamari, two orders of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, a half-dozen <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, two pounds of the hot and juicy crawfish, one pound of the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> crawfish and three pounds of the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> crawfish (my personal favorite). \n\nthe calamari was fantastic, it wasn't overly breaded like some places do it. it comes with lemon and some marinara sauce. now i am not a fan of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, but my friends ordered two orders, i was bound to try one. not only did i try one, i tried like eleven! haha.. they were nicely seasoned and went perfectly with the ketchup. believe it or not, i would order them again. (zoinks?! lol). the <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> were so fresh it melted in my mouth. my only complaint is that i usually add a bit of soy sauce with the lemon wedge when i shoot <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> and all they had was lemon. but none the less, melts in your mouth goodness!!! the guests of honor to our luncheon were the crawfish. all the flavors that we had were very flavorful and delicious in their own right. however, the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> was my absolute favorite, and i think everyone elses' as well. mainly because we put in an order for two more pounds after killin' just the one. \n\n*btw you can order different grades of spicyness for your food, however we ordered the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> at just a mild grade of spicy juice and it was pretty intense. even to my spicy-loving thai mates that ate with me :).\n\ni only gave them 4 stars because they only served beer. i'll add that additional star once they start selling wine at least, but with fingers-crossed they'll someday have a full bar.", 
            "this was my first crawfish experience and it was pretty yum!  we had 1lb of shrimp (hot n juicy - medium spice), 1 lb of snow crab (<mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> - medium spice), 1lb of shrimp (<mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> - medium spice), and 1lb of crawfish (hot n juicy - medium spice).  also got beers and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  the lemon peper was good on the crab but not so good on the shrimp.  were told to go less spicy than normal because their spice was hotter than everyone else's, so we went medium.  really wish we had gone hotter.  we also did not shake our bags, which after reading a few reviews, could have made a big difference.  geez, aren't we smart?!?\n\non a thursday night, it was super crowded, but we got the last available table, so no wait.  service was really fast, if not overly friendly.   it seemed like we ordered and five minutes later we were opening steaming plastic bags!  food was great, incredibly messy and i thought it was a little pricey.  not sure if i would go back here, but it was definitely an experience.  i feel like i lived a little.  i also feel like i should share this little nugget:  the next morning, my bf says \"what is that smell?\"  it was us.  we smelled like garlic for a good three days. haha", 
            "thanks to some recommendation from native lv yelpers, we decided to visit hot & juicy for dinner on a recent trip to las vegas. not the best idea to come straight from the convention centre, as the hot & juicy smell permeated our blazers and followed us around all week, but the experience itself was well worth it. \n\nanything that made it onto man vs food is likely the opposite of what i am looking to eat, but we decided to give it a try, for the spectacle alone. as soon as we arrived, finger licking smacking, bib wearing ladies were queuing for the washroom  in need of a quick hand wash. waitresses with big smiles and heavy eyeliner ran around with buckets and plastic gloves on their hands. i was intrigued.\n\nthe two of us sat at our plastic covered tables and ordered beer ($3 for import) 1lb of crawfish medium hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, 1 lb of shrimp medium hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> and 3lbs crab spicy <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. we also had 2 ear of corn, and an order of calamari whose accompanying fries never arrived.  it was a ridiculously too much amount fo food but we were starving after a long day on our feet.\n\neverything arrives in a plastic bag, with sauce puddling along the bottom. the waitress dumps the bag onto your table from her bucket, and will give you a brief demo if necessary. you are instructed to dig in and leave the carcasses in the middle of your table as you plow through. \n\nregarding the spice, i found medium wasn't enough and i regretted my decision. also, i regretted ordering so much all at once, as we ate some got cold, which was less appetizing.\n\nfor the novelty (we barely ever see crawfish in toronto) it was fun. anything that dirty is always a good time of course. the flavor of the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> was really outstanding. it was great.  the service was actually among the best we got in vegas, they were attentive and friendly.  $96 for a mammoth amount of food that could have fed 4 with about 3 beer each.  the crab was good, but i find the crawfish just doesn't give you enough meat. \n\nminus a star for the impact on the environment from all that waste. i would have been happy with bucket, no bags.", 
            "i have eaten several times at this restaurant and have not been disappointed. my first time eating at the restaurant was during the premiere of hot n' juicy's spot on the travel channel, man v. food and i have been a regular since. \n\nmoving to vegas i found it was hard to locate the locally owned, unique restaurants. if you are looking for a unique restaurant with great seafood (hard to find in a desert), then check out hot n' juicy.\n\ni feel like family when i visit and the servers are incredibly helpful in suggestions on what to eat.\n\nthis restaurant has great service, awesome seafood (try the snow crab!!), and offers a one-of-a-kind, affordable experience hard to find in the las vegas area. the best part? your seafood doesn't come out on a plate. how does it come out then? i'll guess you'll just have to go see for yourself. let's just say it is a hands on experience.  \n\na regular meal for me includes at least a pound of snow crabs and a dozen sausage. for those who are looking for a milder juice <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> is the way to go!", 
            "i've been to hot n juicy for the past 4 years as a regular customer. it's become a tradition for my family and friends. i've always had a great experience there as well as great food. the employees are friendly and fun. they provide exceptional food and are extremely clean. i've never had any issues with their food or cleanliness. \ntry the nosebleed sauce if you like spiciness. it's not on the menu. \nmy favorite is <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. \nget 2lbs and you get a free potato and corn =]", 
            "las vegas is sin city for a reason; it celebrates the seven deadly sins. in vegas, your greatest weakness or vice becomes the source of all your pleasures. we were ready to give into our carnal desires and get down and dirty, indulging our voracious, gluttonous appetites. we wanted to get stuffed with something hot n juicy. \n\nhot n juicy is known for their seafood: crab (dungeness, blue, snow), shrimp, and of course, crawfish. you pick the type of seasoning (<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> or the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>) and the level of spiciness (mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy). \n\nwe ordered 2 lbs of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and 2 lbs of crawfish with <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> at medium, 2 pieces of corn, 2 red <mark>Potato</mark>, etouffee (a cajun seafood stew, similar to gumbo), and a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. eating at hot n juicy is not an elegant refine affair. it's messy work because they dump a plastic bag of whatever seafood you ordered and you're only protection is the plastic table covering and a plastic bib. you open the bag and dig in.\n\nthe crab meat was very sweet and juicy. it was perfectly cooked. i found that the spiciness of the food depended on the type of seafood because the seasoning is on the outside of the shell. the meat isn't spicy unless you soak it in the sauce first. i found the level of spiciness in the crawfish much higher because the tail meat was much smaller and there was more shell around it, unlike the crab meat where i could pull out large pieces of meat out of the shell. also i got more spicy sauce from the crawfish because i sucked crawfish heads. after a while my lips got tingly and numb from the cajun spices. \n\ni've never had crawfish whole before. i only had them de-shelled. while i love crawfish and the meat was great, i'll never have them whole like that again. the tail meat is rather tiny (i like 'em big -- size matters when it comes to these things). at the end, we looked at the mountain of shell and agreed that it was more work than it was worth. crawfish is mostly shell and i'd rather pay someone to shell them for me.\n\netouffee was a spicy rice seafood stew. i liked the flavor and the level of spice was just perfect for me. i thought the rice was a tad overcooked and mushy from just sitting in a pot all day, but in general it was enjoyable.\n\nthe boiled red <mark>Potato</mark> were much needed as a break from the relentless cajun spice. they were nice and sweet. the corn is out of season, so not as sweet and juicy as in the summer, but still tasty. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were crispy and tasty.\n\nthe final price for all of us was $30/person for three people. we gorged ourselves on great seafood and left utterly satiated. happy ending for us indeed.\n\nwhat happens in vegas, stays in vegas. but this is one of the few times where you wish you could get crabs and bring them home with you.", 
            "i've always seen this place but i never bothered to stop by. it was after i went to the boiling crab in cali did i finally decide to come here. \n\nit's not nearly as good as the boiling crab, imo. i ordered one pound of shrimp (they don't do half a pound like bc) in spicy cajun, mild. it was the sauce that wasn't really good. hence why i liked bc's more. \n\nmy friends all got different flavors. the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> tasted like cajun to me. i did really like the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, though. i'll probably get that next time. \n\nwe got sweet potato and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. sweet potato was okay, but i preferred the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. they were yummy. \n\nall in all, it wasn't that bad. i would come back in the future. :)", 
            "we heard about this place spring of 2010 and finally went january 2011 when i was in the mood for some mud-bugs! \nwe moved to las vegas from louisiana. we only lived in louisiana for 2 1/2 years but that's long enough to know about some good southern food! \nmy husband and i got the same thing; 2 pounds of crawfish with spicy cajun (<mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> and <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>) flavoring with medium spice level. i myself noticed the spice level in the corn since we had the corn and potato added to the bag's of crawfish. medium was even spicier than what we ever had in louisiana, but the waiter did inform us to go down a level of what we were used to. \nthe crawfish was pretty good all in all. my husband and i both only had about 5 good sized crawfish in each of our bags, maybe since it's off season. so that was a disappointment. i wish that they would clean the the crawfish before they cook them. it's not fun looking at a crawfish that looks like it still has dirt and sand on it.....ya ya ya i know their called mud-bugs but still. i know that would take some time for them to do but it just looks better. your going to a crawfish joint not a chinese buffet with crawfish. \nit was kinda pricey since we're used to paying a couple bucks a sack in louisiana, granted here they are the ones taking the time to boil them. during off season with live crawfish (the waiter said some night's they're frozen) it worked out to be about $10-$11per pound. (on the menu for crawfish it does say market price, the waiter said during season it might be about $8 per pound) they don't have a kids menu so we had to pay $7.50 for our 3 year old daughter to get a chicken nugget's and fries basket. for all 3 of us we got a total of 4lbs. crawfish, 2 extra corn's, chicken and fries basket, 1 soda and 2 water's and our bill was $65.00 before tip. we will try to get back before we move out of state this summer but we are also planning on having some shipped in from louisiana and doing our own crawfish boil so we'll see. if we were staying here in vegas i'm sure we would go back. \n\ni", 
            "love it.  my friend and i had two pounds crawfish and a pound of shrimp plus corn on the cobs.  i was sweating like crazy.  it was very good.  we tried the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> and spicy hot mild on the crawfish.  the shrimp was medium spicy hot.  \n\nthe staff were awesome too.  very friendly atmosphere.  thanks! we will be back!", 
            "mmmm! hot and juicy crawfish is so delicious! just recently i tried their <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> seasoning for the crab, their garlic and butter for the shrimp and of course their cajun seasoning for the crawfish and will do exactly that the next time! everything had so much flavor, the corn on the cob and <mark>Potato</mark> work perfectly and are great for soaking up all the juices! \njust be warned... you wont smell that great for awhile! we learned the first time and now take it to go :)", 
            "this place was so good that we went twice on our trip to vegas -- the day after we got there and the day we left.\n\nthe crawfish were pretty small when i ordered them (the waitress told us they would be) but they were succulent and sweet and more or less worth it. the shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> were better though. i liked the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> medium (which was super spicy the first time i came and milder the second time) and my boyfriend was a big fan of the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> mild. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were awesome as well. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were a bit spicy which would have been okay but my mouth was already burning from the seafood. beers are cheap.\n\ndefinitely a fun eating experience as well. i would recommend the trip if you are in vegas.", 
            "loved it!\n\nwe asked our waitress to recommend a seasoning, since there were a few options. she recommended the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and i'm glad we followed her advice. we got both shrimp and crawfish, one with the hot 'n' juicy, and one with the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. \n\nthe crawfish were incredible. the meat was sweet, with a bit of a floral fragrant aftertaste. i have a friend who swears by crawfish, but i didn't know why until now. we could also de-vein the crawfish just by tugging on the tail of the shell after breaking off the head. i had no idea that was possible, and call me odd but it added an element of fun to the experience. the shells were also thinner than i've previously experienced - i just wanted to crunch into them after carnally tearing off the heads. talk about bringing out my inner beast.\n\nthey give you salt and pepper for dip, and also some lime/lemon. tip from my boyfriend: instead of using just a sprinkling, ask for a ton of limes/lemons, and fill one of the little containers with the juice. then, load it with the salt and pepper. it gives you a flavor option besides the spicy, buttery sauce, and kinda cuts through the grease. that way, you can endlessly rotate between pungent and rich, and citrusy sweet.\n\nthe waitress also wrote \"thank you\" on our receipt. a great, friendly touch. i'll be coming back here whenever i'm in vegas.",

            "i'm a fan for sure. there aren't that many places in vegas where you can dig into a sack of crawfish, so hot & juicy definitely sets themselves apart. \nwe had oysters, crawfish, shrimp, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, and chicken fingers (for the non-seafood eater). the oysters were good, nothing special. i really enjoyed the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce on the shrimp. the crawfish were awesome - pretty spicy and we only got medium! i didn't try the chicken fingers, but i can imagine...\nprices are reasonable, service was good, atmosphere is bustling, like it should be.", 
            "this place gets a crowd, and a big crowd at that. since the latest competition, boiling crab, migrated towards the valley from southern california we could see that the battle of the rivals are still in order. the question is, who serves the best shrimp?\n\ni'll be brutally honest that my point of view is biased because i have yet to taste the savory goodness of boiling crab. so until i have tried its savory goodnes, my critic will rest at recommending hot and juicy until further notice. \n\nbesides the raving hype that adam richman did feature hot and juicy on man v. food, i can say that the feshness and the flavor of the seafood here are just to die for. literally, you eat all the shrimp and crab you can consume until you fall face first first into a food coma (this my ideal way of leaving this earth). \n\ni love the spice and tangy flavor of their famous hot and juicy sauce. my first mistake as a first timer is underestimating their love for hot. so i got the hot flavor of the hot and juicy sauce. my mouth was literally burning with fire, and i couldn't enjoy the flavor of the sauce because the spice was taking over my taste buds. so if you are all for an inferno party in your mouth, i'd suggest the hot  hot and juicy sauce.\n\nmy personal favorite is the less than mild hot and juicy sauce with all the right flavors with just the right amount of spice that i can handle baby! (ow ow!) yes, it may not be on the menu, but there is a less than mild spice. the mild flavor still has a lot of kick in it so beware! \n\ni also love the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. if you love the tasty combination of citrus, tang, and spice, i would suggest the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. it is also the safe zone. a flavor that is sure to satisfy you if you're not sure you're ready to take the risk and commitment of spice.\n\nlastly, this joint is worthy of five stars when you throw a corn in the cob and a <mark>Potato</mark> in the plastic shake and bake bag (shake, don't bake). soak those bad boys up in that sauce baby, and call that a connection! \n\nits all about good food and experience and when you incorporate the thrill of eating off the table with no utensils or a plate (something your mother told you never to do), you're sure to bring out the dangerous and adventurous side of yourself that you didn't know existed! its a great place to take a date, especially if you want to test the daring side of them. i will be a long lived patron of hot and juicy. hat tipped to you! :)\n\n(further update when i try my boiling crab experience....)", 
            "de-fricken-licious. i had never tried crawfish, but i'm a big seafood lover, so i was excited to try it from what is supposedly the best. you order your seafood of choice by the pound and can find the daily market prices on a board by the kitchen. you choose your choice of seasoning and heat level. i went with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> and \"less than mild.\" even at less than mild, the spice level was making my nose run a little bit (i'll admit, i'm a wimp). service was okay. we had to ask the waitress for a refill after she passed our empty cups several times. i promise, i'm not a snob, but as a waiter myself, if a customer has to remind me for a refill, i'm not exactly doing my job. anyways, on to the food:\n\nsnow crab w/ <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>: absolutely amazing. i don't know how, but their crab was some of the most moist i've had. huge chunks were easy to pull out since the meat hadn't dried out. don't forget to dip your crab meat in whatever seasoning you have. it takes it to the next level.\n\ncrawfish w/ hot n juicy: great, but very small. the little bits of meat that you get from each crawfish wasn't very much. as a crawfish newbie, i was surprised, but now i know what i'm in for. if you're here for just crawfish, i'd get at least 2 pounds.\n\nmussels: wow. some of the best i've had. i never knew mussels could be so tender! i'm so used to having them dried out/rubbery as they're generally - and unfortunately - cooked.\n\nsides: corn! get lots of corn with your seafood of choice. shake it in the bag, so it gets coated with the seasoning and save it for whenever you're done with your seafood. it will be all sorts of juicy goodness. my only regret: not getting more. the fries and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were perfectly cooked, but beyond that, weren't anything special. especially if you're trying to eat on a budget, i'd load up on some sides with your seafood, otherwise you'll easily be spending $25+ per person to fill up.\n\nchicken nuggets: as we had a non seafood eater, he got some chicken nuggets which were pretty bad. they looked and tasted like they came from some foster farms frozen bag. however, since this place is meant for seafood, i don't hold it against the restaurant.", 
            "pretty good...for vegas.  here's my recap:  parking could be better.  not a lot of spaces.  available spaces were a little tight.  seated immediately upon entering.  the place was pretty busy.  many tables with chairs, some with booths.  some booth seating was not accessible because the neighboring table was too close.  servers were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.  menu offered crawfish, shrimp, oysters, clam, lobster, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, and snow crab.  all market prices.  seasoning choices were <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.  choice of mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy.  sides: corn, potato, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, rice, rolls, and sausage.  also, appetizers were etoufee and a large variety of fried items: calamari, hot wings, soft shell crab, catfish, shrimp, and chicken nuggets.  we ordered two pounds of boiled shrimp: one <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> medium and the other <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> medium.  bibs were served first.  the bottom of the bib folds over to make a pocket to catch debris you drop.  we also ordered a side of white rice.  the cook time seemed about right, not real fast, but not too slow either.  constant line for men's restroom.  only one person at a time.  many people waiting to get in to wash their hands after eating.  the food comes out as it is ready, not served at the same time.  i prefer this method.  the shrimp is served in a clear plastic bag and the shells are left on the table.  plastic table cloth makes for quick and easy clean up.  the shrimp was good sized, hot, and flavorful.  there was a little extra juice in the bottom of the bag which we used to dip our shrimp once peeled.  also, we ladled some on the rice for a bit of flavor.  the shrimp was head and shell on.  this requires a little work, but is the traditional way to serve, saves the kitchen a bit of time, and leads one to believe the shrimp were alive when cooked.  i lived in louisiana for many years so i know there is a difference between <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> and cajun style, but i don't know why they made the distinction here.  most patrons in vegas won't know the difference.  the difference here is that louisiana had more butter and cajun was more traditional with more spices and less brother allowing the sweet flavor of the shrimp to come through better.  the difference is almost not noticeable, but i prefer their <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>.  the rice was okay.  all in all the food was pretty good.  we really enjoyed it.  on a side note, they did not purge the shrimp.  that is, the gastrointestinal track and the poop were still in the shrimp.  vegas patrons don't know any better.  its kind of gross, but i ate anyways knowing that it won't hurt you (otherwise, the place would have been shut down a long time ago).  there were plenty of paper napkins at each table and wet wipes served at the counter and with the bill, but i would have preferred a washing station, similar to those at cravin cajun.  you get really, really messy eating boiled shrimp and that stuff is super painful if you get it in your eyes.  they do serve alcohol, but we had tap water, which was served in styrofoam cups.  the server did not ask if we wanted lemon, but she brought out a styrofoam bowl with almost two whole lemons (kind of a waste).  shrimp was $8.99 per pound and the side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> was $2.  we really enjoyed this experience and will be coming back.  i tried the crawfish on a previous visit here.  it was the best crawfish in vegas.  flavor was right, but a bit small for louisiana standards.  i love crawfish, but think the shrimp is a better deal because there is much more meat.  i really like this place, but cravin cajun is better.", 
            "this was my first crawfish experience and it was pretty yum!  we had 1lb of shrimp (hot n juicy - medium spice), 1 1lb of shrimp (<mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> - medium spice), and 1lb of crawfish (hot n juicy - medium spice).  also got beers and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.    were told to go less spicy than normal because their spice was hotter than everyone else's, so we went medium.  really wish we had gone hotter.  we also did not shake our bags, which after reading a few reviews, could have made a big difference.  geez, aren't we smart?!?it was super crowded, but we got the last available table, so no wait.  service was really fast, it seemed like we ordered and five minutes later we were opening steaming plastic bags!  food was great, incredibly messy and i thought it was a little pricey.  not sure if i would go back here, but it was definitely an experience.  i feel like i lived a little. i will come back here very soon,all my friends like it .", 
            "omg, drool, yum, drool, and repeat!!!! i chose this for crawfish as i saw it being featured on the travel channel.. so when i was in vegas, i had to come here! the prices are steep but what do you expect!  delicious ice tea unlimited, and delicious crawfish, and delicious shrimp and fries.. thats about all we ate here. don't take folk who want to have a salad or whatnot because they have no other food available. no salads and no rice! lol.. we started off with 3 crawfish sauces (ordered by lb) .. the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, some garlic one, and some other non memorable one. the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> was by far the attention grabber because you get a pang of flavor the minute the juices hit your tongue. however we were not full with just crawfish, fries, and an appetizer of soft shell crab. we decided to get an additional bag of shrimp with lemmon pepper sauce because everyone else was feasting on <mark>Shrimp</mark> and they looked so good! the meal is gona be pricey but it's totally worht it! i wish i knew about the shrimp sooner! either way, a tip: be careful with the spice because even at the lowest level it is freaking spicy!!!!!!!!!! i had to pee 3 times within an hour and the last time we were driving back to the strip and i couldnt hold it so we took a detour to a gas station ready to piss on myself already and the gas station had no bathroom! wtferak??? i was freakingggg out!!!! needless to say we ended up in old las vegas (downtown) since i found a bathroom! that was bad... so make sure you are careful with the spicyness!!!!!",

            "i've tried two other places but they can't beat how much flavor hot n juicy has to offer in the sauces they use on their seafood. i definitely recommend getting the shrimp since it has more \"meat\" for the pound rather than all shell but if you're willing to spend the extra bucks for the other shelled fish. why not? any seasoning you get has so much flavor. definitely get the \"hot n juicy\" flavor even without spice it's good. <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> & <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> is delicious too. they also offer delicious calamari.  i'll definitely be back here over and over again.",

            "**confession: the seafood @ this spot is absolutely amazing!!!!!**\n\nof course a pescetarian like myself is always in the mood for yummy seafood. a few weeks ago, my sis recommended that me & a friend check this place out for din din. omg, i fell head over heels in love! \n\nit's always a good sign when you walk up to a place & there are people lined up outside the door, waiting to be seated. there was also a large number of people who placed to-go orders, so this place was jumping with business! we decided to grab a bottle of wine (fetzer riesling) while waiting for our table and all of the staff there were really friendly & funny. i was joking with the guy who gave us the wine before we even had a chance to sit down. lol\n\nit was friday night, so like us, most of the folks dining there were already pretty tipsy (as they rightfully should be). wheee! :-d i remember joking around with a female waitress who was serving a table full of guys about them having another round of drinks! i also interacted with our adorable server before we were seated & decided i wanted to sit in his section. i let the hostess know & she was completely cool with it. all of the fun, goofy interaction with the staff was the 2nd indicator that we were in a good location.\n\nfinally, the food. you select your seasoning, pick a spice level, & select your items. we opted for the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> (combo of <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, & <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>), extra spicy (hot hot hot!!!), & ordered crawfish, shrimp, lobster, & crab (hooray 4 seafood!). the crawfish comes with 1 head of corn on the cob & a red potato, so you can add additional corn & <mark>Potato</mark> to your order as needed. all of the food comes marinated in clear plastic bags, so you literally open up the bags and dig in! everything was seasoned & marinated to perfection! it was hot, spicy, juicy, & delicious as advertised. the service was also impeccable from the moment we stepped into the place! it was one of the server's last night there so we ended up taking silly pics in her memory since she was working instead of enjoying a moving away party. i think i ended up taking pictures with the entire staff by the time the night was done. silly me! lmao \n\nwe ordered shrimp, crawfish, corn, & <mark>Potato</mark> to go for my sis since she wasn't able to make it down there with us that evening. those leftovers were still delicious the following day. :-) i was back in vegas this past weekend (the place was packed again on sunday night) & ordered takeout for dinner one evening because the food is absolutely fantastic! looking forward to eating my leftovers tonight & making plans to visit some of the other locations soon.\n\nbe sure to check this place out next time you're in town. you're sure to love it as much as i do! :-d", 
            "absolutely delicious! if you love seafood and sucking meat out of shells this is the right place! the crawfish is sooooooooo good, their sauces are so tasty and you can decide on the spice level you'd like.  they sell the seafood per pound, in a bag, with the sauce of your choice.  they offer crab, shrimp, lobster, mussels, and crawfish.  i really crave this once a while::: my 2 pounds of crawfish in the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> or the house sauce, spicy and 2 or 3 blue moon beers....bam! it doesn't get better than this!\nbe prepare to stink like spices after eating here for the rest of the day! lol", 
            "if you want to grub out on a ton of delicious, juicy seafood this is your spot. the concept is simple: choose what type of seafood you want and how many pounds of it you want. you can also choose the type of spice you'd like. they have more than just cajun if you aren't looking for spicy (<mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, etc). i had a pound of the shrimp, cajun style. i got the medium spicy level because i wasn't sure, but it was nothing. i wish i got the most spicy. i also had the oysters on the half shell. the prices are reasonable and nothing beats well cooked seafood and lots of it!", 
            "one of my favorite places in vegas! great quality seafood and delicious sauces and flavors! i'd highly recommend the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce with the shrimp and getting <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> with their famous hot and juicy sauce! though i'd like to think i like spicy foods it turns out the mild on both of these is spicy enough for me ! lots of kick in the best sense! me and my boyfriend usually get a pound or pound and a half of shrimp and a pound of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> but when we are really going big we do two pounds of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>! a little pricey but so worth it and such a fun date place i love picking everything apart for the meat and getting messy and licking sauce of my fingers it's a great time", 
            "as always hot n juicy delivers. i have been here only multiple occasions and have always enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. of course the food is what stands out. delicious fresh seafood in absolutely amazing sauces varying from mild to spicy for the more adventurous types. \n\nwhile i usually go in a group we typically start with two pounds of food and add on as we go. i have had the shrimp extra spicy hot n juicy, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> hot n juicy extra spicy. the lobster (mind you it is served whole) hot n juicy extra spicy. a few sides such as <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, the sausage and corn on the cob. \n\nyes it is a bit of work while eating to de-shell the food, but to me that's part of experience and i don't mind getting my hands dirty (also ask for gloves if you want). i highly recommend this place to seafood lovers or people who just want to have a fun time with dinner. 5/5\n\n-arnold.", 
            "eat here yesterday for lunch. i had the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> spicy crawfish and my boo had the <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark> the food was amazing as usual however we didn't have the best server we asked for gloves 4 times before she brought them. it wasn't that busy. i go only for the food though. i recommend it to anyone who loves seafood and doesn't mind getting messy", 
            "the crab is finger licking good.  we had the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> crab, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>.  the crab had so much flavor and spice, i really wanted some more.  the <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> was also good, i loved the breading.  i also got a side of potato and corn to go with the crab but i feel like that should come with the bag of crab already since it was so small.  it was like half a corn and a really small potato.", 
            "normally people rave about hot n juicy. it's just okay for me. i've been at different times of the day. i have gone at 10:30 and stayed until midnight. the last time i went was in the middle of the afternoon at around 1:30. the service was really good. granted, there were only 3 or 4 tables, but they were still really attentive. i arrived first and waited for my friend. they seated me immediately me and brought me water and my bib. i did have to wait for my friend for a bit as she ran on filipino time. the servers kept checking on me to ask me if i was ready to order.  \n\nwe both ordered a half pound of shrimp. it is very nice that with shrimp, we can order half a pound. my friend ordered the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> medium spicy. i ordered hot n juicy medium spicy as well. i love the taste of mine. whenever i order shrimp, i always get lemons, limes, salt and pepper and dip my shrimp in it. \n\nthis is very very messy, so i would never order shrimp to go because it's a mess. \n\ni think part of the reason is that i get so grossed out because the shrimp isn't peeled and deveinned, so you still that gross line that you can see while you eat. next time, i might just devein all my shrimp after peeling it.  something else that bothers me about the shrimp is that the flavor is all encased on the outside. the actual shrimp has no flavor. after i peel the shrimp, i still have to drench it in sauce. \n\nthe service is very superior here, though!", 
            "best crawfish and shrimp ever!  i love how i can choose what spice level and flavor. the hot n juicy, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> and <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> are amazing! the staff has always been amazing. who am i kidding everything on their menu is amazing.ive been going here since they opened and i am addicted to them.", 
            "the usual affair: <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> shrimp with baby spice, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> (make sure to dip the fries in the sauce), and a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> (mix in the sauce). it's so heavenly.... later, i will regret, because i will have a dragon breath burping for the next few hours. it's totally worth it though. \n\nall the seafood is sold by the pound, except for shrimp which you can get minimum of 1/2lb. \n\ndont forget to wear the plastic gloves provided. (if not, the sauce will linger in your fingers and you will be sniffing it for the next few hours). to avoid long lines, i usually go between 2 to 4pm for snack. \n\nfor the jetsetters: the crawfish and shrimp is tsa approved as carryon. i guess the sauce is not considered liquid. i've flown with hot n juicy for about 3 times with no problem. make sure to triple bag these suckers or it will stink up your carryon very fast!!!", 
            "first of all i went to vegas on a diet... (so what i cheated!) but it was worth the calories. and out of all the expensively ridiculously priced restaurants on the las vegas strip this was the most economical (its worth a car rental/ limo drive). this place came highly recommended from travel channel's man vs food.  ordering from menu was easy and simple. you have to definitely try my fave <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> shrimp! but the crawfish, humugous <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, and oysters are just as good too. it's vegas's cheapest bag of freshest seafood and the best bang for your buck. extremely the highlight of my las vegas trip (off the strip)!\n\nemployees were chill and friendly, don't be afraid to take apart anything with your hands. great service! too bad hot n juicy crawfish isn't closer to my home town... tried a few hot n juicy knock-offs near home (but didn't even the close)",

            "at last count there were two hot n juicy crawfish locations in las vegas, but i have it on good authority that this is the one you want, at 4810 spring mountain road. my husband and i were steered towards this one, further away though it is, by a reliable local, which is the kind of good advice you want when choosing an off-strip, local neighborhood place. driving from the strip, you actually have to pass a hot n juicy crawfish (in chinatown) to get to the \"right\" hot n juicy crawfish.\n\nlocated on a busy multi-lane road chock-a-block with shopping centers and fast food, hot n juicy crawfish doesn't look like much from outside. or inside, for that matter -- a decent-sized space looks smaller than it is because of so many ragtag tables squeezed together, it's usually packed, it's loud, and i wouldn't exactly call it clean. you're in the middle of the desert but the vibe is carefree beachside -- the floor is a mess and most diners are wearing plastic bibs, happily covered in sauce. you order at a counter, from a menu posted on the wall overhead, and they call you when your order is ready. \n\nthough you can get baskets of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, wings and chicken nuggets, hot n juicy crawfish put their signature item right in their name. when you order the crawfish, there's a method. no \"crawfish nazis\" here -- the staff will kindly help you out if you're a first-timer. you order your crawfish by the pound, then you pick a seasoning, then you pick a spice level. for seasoning, you pick from <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> or a <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. spice levels range from mild to \"holy s@#t.\" that's not what they call it, that's what i called it. if you like spicy, you love this stuff.\n\nthe best experience is to go off-hours with a group, get an assortment of seasonings and spice levels, get some cold beers and have a blast. wear something washable, yer gonna get messy!", 
            "first timer at hnj. all around great experience. the servers were attentive, gave good suggestions, and the food was excellent. our table tried the shrimp, crawfish, snow crab, oysters, and jumbalaya. all were delicious. we tried the hnj with baby spice and the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> spice. the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> was my favorite. will definitely be back.", 
            "i've heard from a couple people that hot and juicy is better than boiling crab.  they say its more flavorful so i went with a group of friends to try it out.  i love boiling crab!  the only thing stopping me from eating it so often is the wait, and the calories!\n\nwhen i went on a tuesday night it was relatively empty.  the place looks like a boiling crab and the concept is pretty much the same.   menu is about the same too.  they have fresh oysters, the seafood boils, corn, potato, fried catfish, gumbo, <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> etc.  for the four of us, we ordered 5 pounds of food.  4 pounds of shrimp in every flavor except <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, 4 <mark>Corn</mark>, and 1 pound of clams in the hot and juicy sauce. \n\nthe food came quickly...and we were ready.  this place offers gloves but i say ditch it.  they are big and bulky and get in the way and in the end, your hands get soaked in the garlicky buttery oil anyways.  the hot and juicy flavor is by far my favorite.  we went with medium and there is a spicy kick to it.  not too bad because i'm not one who can handle a whole lot of spice.  some of the shrimp were overcooked so it was crumbling when i peeled it (minus one star).  i forgot what the other flavors were but i remember peeling the shrimp in the other bags and dipping it in the hot and juicy sauce.  corn was really good too!  corn is always my favorite thing to eat at places like this so i'm glad it was sweet and juicy.\n\nthe clams were very flavorful.  they soak in the sauce way better than shrimp.  you just get less food for the money though.\n\nall in all i really like this place and will definitely come back.  i do think that they don't fully give you one pound of food.  i mean we each ate 1.25 pounds of food.  we killed everything!  and at boiling crab i usually only order 1/2 pound of shrimp with 2 <mark>Corn</mark> and am stuffed.\n\nthe sauce here is also a lot thinner.  boiling crab is thick with tons of garlic bits but this was more watery.  i personally like a thicker sauce so its easier to grab with my shrimp.  room for improvement but i would come here any day over the hour wait.", 
            "brought our parents here all craving some yummy crab and catfish. they delivered! we had 6 kiddos with us too. they placed us at a big table, explained the menu & gave us great service. its not a fancy place, casual dining, and thats one of the things we enjoyed about it. eating crab in this setting was perfect! \n\nthey also gave us a brief tutorial on how to eat crawfish (cool experiance for the kiddos too) and brought us samples of it for us all to try (kids included)\n\nfood: <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> (served whole, which means legs and body) with the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce. was over a pound, so cost more but worth it because it tasted so good. the sauce was the  bomb! level of spice we ordered was called \"baby\" (lowest on the scale) it was just spicy enough for us weaklings.\nsnow crab (<mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>) were sweet and large. our 9 year old ordered this with just butter sauce since she doesnt like hot spice. it was delicious just like that.\nthere are 4 different sauces, one of which is all 4 mixed together. my mother in law ordered that with her crab and it was  pretty tasty. \nkids got <mark>Chicken Wings Basket</mark> with fries, they were big so the little ones shared. and the father in law ordered basket of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> and fried catfish. he is a harsh critic, who loved the catfish! i didnt even have a chance to taste it!\nthe only food we didnt like much was the corn fritters. too sweet and batter was not authentic. \n\nservice: great. all the waitresses there seemed on the ball and helped us out.  \n\npretty busy place, not impressive from the outside, but who cares? the crab is tasty and not too expensive. its served in a bag with all the sauce, you wear a plastic bib, even plastic gloves if you want them. the only thing that would make me happier is good beer on tap. they only serve bottles. give it a try. its yummy!"

            "wow this was as close to home( new orleans ) as you can get here in las vegas. i will start by saying please don't let the location stop you from visiting this restaurant. i live in henderson and do not go across town to often to eat. it is a simple family owned place that we need more of in this town. the food is simple to order its all by the pound. we ordered 2 pounds of shrimp (our favorite), 2 pounds of crawfish (very good) both were mild with the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce. they tasted great but if you want more of the louisiana taste get the 2nd sauce i think it is called <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>. we also tried the fried soft shell crab with fries (oh so good), oysters on the half shell(fresh and good size, from the gulf not salty but i think its because of the season), potato's, corn, and sausage (potato's and corn are a must have, the sausage was ok) and last we got the etouffee (this was ok my wife really liked it i thought it had to many bell peppers but thats just me). there is more on the menu but all i could try this visit. i will return for sure the food is really that good. i put $$$ for the price because i ordered more than we needed but you will spend 25 to 35 per person easy.please visit this restaurant they are doing so much perfect. the service was very friendly. thank you to everyone for your reviews. it was the reason i had to try it.\n\nwent back for some live <mark>Blue Crab</mark> and everything was as good as the 1st time. the <mark>Blue Crab</mark> is now my favorite. the bread rolls also are a must have to eat with the sauce. i know this place is different but if you love seafood please give it a try.", 
            "so, me, my bf, and our friend roll up on hot n juicy. when i invited my friend, she says, \"oh, crawfish. i haven't had crawfish since miami. we used to go to crawfish parties all they time and they'd have buckets of crawfish.\" so i'm getting all riled up. i've never had crawfish. \n\nso we get there and each of the tables are covered with a plastic table cloth and there's a roll of paper towels. i'm like, \"aw, shet. things are gonna get messy.\" \n\nso i order a pound of crawfish ($9), <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning, mild. because i'm a pussy like that, i have spice issues. what. bf ordered the same thing, but spicy. \n\nthe waiter gives each of us a bib that says \"let's get crackin'\" and has a lobster on it. let's get crackin' indeed. i thought i was gonna be the only asshole with a bib on, but apparently everyone does it. so it must be alright. like unprotected, premarital sex. and crack. \n\ni was looking forward to this all day long. i had a three-hour long, grueling work out, and all i could think about was some hot n juicy craw daddies. \n\nthe waiter dropped our crawfish in plastic bags. little crawfish in a puddle of awesome spices. \n\nwhen we started to dig in, we realized we didn't know what we were doing. and our friend that went to crawfish parties in miami? didn't actually eat the crawfish there. she just drank beer. so we asked the waiter for help and he obliged. \n\nonce we got the hang of it, it was all cherry. it just seemed like a lot of work for a small meat yield. \n\nin the beginning, i couldn't bring myself to suck the juices out of the head. but then i removed myself from the idea that they were once living animals. with eyes. that stare at you. \n\nthere are places that are good for drinking beer with food. not only is hot n juicy good for beers with food, its not only perfect, its down right necessary. i almost didn't oder a beer, but halfway through my hot n juicy and spicy meal, i had to get a beer. \n\ni ordered fries, too. which came in handy in soaking up the extra juices.  the seasoning was so good. i was licking off the excess from my fingers and pulled away a stub. \n\nfor the two dozen crawfish, four beers, and fries, we paid $46 before tip; average $15 per person. i would not recommend going here hoping to feast on a budget. \n\n(i hit this place up, because of famous teri's review http://www.yelp.com/biz/hot-n-juicy-crawfish-las-vegas#hrid:1kovc8ddqe3xuhdkabbpfw) \n\n* off the strip, non-casino",

(well, not the part that i went without him, but that i was still smelling like it!  haha!) \n\nservice was better, but then again i went during lunch time when it wasn't busy.  brought out of town visitors both times (family ppls) and they were loving this stuff and are craving for it!  \n\n4.5 stars",

            "i have never been to an authentic crawfish place in the deep south but i can say that this tasted fantastic.\n\nit's set up knowing you're going to eat like a slob. the table is covered with plastic. each table gets its own paper towel roll. everyone gets a bib. and afterwards you get handiwipes. i just went to wash my hands in the bathroom.\n\ni had mild, which other places call medium. their mild is good enough for me. good heat without killing my mouth. shrimp and crawfish were 10.99 a pound when we went 1-2 days ago. i had a pound of each. i'm glad i tried the crawfish but my favorite was the shrimp simply because there was more meat and i liked that it was sweeter and larger bits to eat. i was stuffed so next time if having the crawfish only, get 2 pounds as there is more shell than meat. if shrimp, i think a pound is just fine. i saw someone else get the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs and i may order that next time but i have a hell of a time getting the meat out of those so i may not if they are not pre cut down the length.\n\ni had the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> which is a equal mixture of their 3 sauces( cajun, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>). i'm not sure what it was, but there was an underlying orange and it tasted fantastic! maybe it wasn't orange but it didn't taste like lemon. perhaps it's part of their boil, or an accent in their <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce but wow. really complimented the food and went so yummy with the shrimp.\n\ni want to try the sauces alone next time but it's going to be hard to do because i know i like the mixture already.\n\ni ordered ice tea, and a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> in addition to my seafood boils. the ice tea was ok. not fantastic but good, but then i love a really really strong tea.\n\nthe rice was the perfect compliment for peeling seafood over. it caught all of the juices and was tasty eating when i was done peeling. yum yum good!!!\n\nmy husband had the catfish with fries. he finished way before i did and that was a bit of a bummer because the best part about eating there is peeling with your friends. friends don't let friends eat there without ordering a peeling meal.\n\nthe \"man versus food\" guy is going to be there on thursday but i really would only go if you're interested in crowds. nah..not for me. i just want their good food. i don't need a show to tell me something i already know. go if you like but man it's going to be a zoo.",

            "hot n' juicy is an old favorite of mine located on spring mountain between decatur and jones. hot n' juicy is definitely the messiest eatery in town, and all the more fun because of it. sometimes when i give that description people don't want to try it, but it would be a shame not to. besides the fun of eating here, the food is great. how can you really go wrong with fresh seafood, butter, and cajun seasonings?\n\ntoday i ordered one pound of the crawfish ($9.99) and my husband ordered one pound of the snow crab ($13.99). we both asked for the hot n' <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning, extra spicy! you are free to choose your heat level as well as the style of seasoning you prefer - <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, juice cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, or <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. besides crawfish and snow crab, you can also order <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, or shrimp.\n\nthe first time i had a crawfish boil was at my brother's graduation from university of the south in sewanee, tennessee. i remember them dumping huge buckets of steamed crawfish onto the tables and everyone would just have at them, discarding the shells and heads onto neighboring tables. at hot n' juicy it's a little different, but not much. you are given bibs and your table is covered in white plastic that is accessorized with your own roll of paper towels. they bring your crawfish in plastic bags that are tied at the top to capture the heat. when you open the bag you get an aromatic burst of spicy steam that gets you really excited for what you are about to enjoy. this is where the fun starts. crawfish are peel and eat little buggers that require somewhat of an experienced eater to navigate through them in order to get to the savory bits. first you must detach the tail, which you peel just as you would the tail of a shrimp. then, and this is most flavorful part, you must suck the head by gently squeezing it into your mouth so you can get all the juices and inner goodness out of it. if this sounds totally disgusting to you, go for the crab. they supply you with crab crackers, but ian and i agree they should probably pre-crack them for you to make the experience easier and allow all the seasoned butter to seep into the meat. whatever you decide to get, i'm sure you'll enjoy it.\n\nif you order two pounds of crawfish you get a hunk of corn on the cob and a red potato in your bag, but since we ordered one pound each of different items we opted for the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> ($2.99). these came out hot n' spicy with a side of cooling ketchup. we managed to reserve some of the fries to dip in the juices at the bottom of our bags, and this was way better than the ordinary condiment. who would have thought that you could make french fries even tastier and more unhealthy with the addition of seasoned butter? i guess europeans serve their fries with mayonnaise, so i don't feel too guilty or out of line.\n\nby the time you are finished, it looks like hurricane katrina has hit your table leaving a mass of wet and crumpled paper towels in her wake. this is certainly not a prime location for a wedding reception, but if you don't mind getting your hands dirty in the name of taste, you really should try hot n' juicy almost any other time.", 
            "fortunately, both times i've been here, we beat the crowds... the wait can get pretty long, if its crowded. \n\nthe food here is good. i'd say its on par with boiling crab. we got the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. tried both spicy and very spicy. very spicy is not as killer as they hype it up to be, but the heat does build up over time. \n\nminus one star for sometimes slow service.",

            "yay! i finally got to have the hot-n-juicy experience.  it took years and family visiting from out of town to go.  i could never get the place to appeal to the hubby.  he was never thrilled with the idea of eating from a bag and leaving the shells on the table.  he's not big into making a mess, but me on the other hand...the dirty just makes it taste better, right?!\n\nso i went with my mom, cousin, and his wife.  i was excited because i've heard so much about this place and the yelpers can't help but to rave.  between us all we ordered the 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 pounds of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> (both <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, mild), 2 orders of calamari, a basket of chicken, and an order of fries.  \n\ni zeroed in on the seafood, i didn't take all this time to get here to eat chicken!!  my mom freaked out a bit about shrimp with heads and made me pull them off for her (this is why no crawfish...no sucking heads for us that day!)  but she did eventually get over it and was able to take of the heads herself without being grossed out.  everything tasted really good, just a bit of a kick that didn't overwhelm (enough of a kick for me, i'm a pussy when it comes to spicy).  i don't even remember how many paper towels i personally went through but i'm glad there was an unlimited number of them.\n\ni think the family enjoyed the experience, but when my mom discovered they had plastic gloves after our meal she was disappointed her hands smelt like garlic and seafood.  i just asked the waitress for some lemons for our hands then went and washed them in the bathroom...good as new.  but my dog has that super sonic smell going on and couldn't get over how yummy my hands were!\n\ni'm quite the happy fat-n-preggers girl after this experience.  baby was definitely happy with all the yummy goodness i fed her.  now that i know they have some pansy plastic gloves for the hubby i think i've got a better chance to get him to come with me for a return trip.  he's also a sucker for anywhere that serves <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. :o)", 
            "one of my girl friends convinced me to go here and i was sold once i found out that it was the same place i saw on man v. food.  this place is in such an unsuspecting area and the parking lot a  little tiny.  but once you open the door the sweet smell of butter and garlic fill the room.  there was a little wait which i was surprised about bc places like this in la have an hour wait minimum!! \n\nthe food was good!! my bf and i got the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, spicy on shrimp.  i'd get the crawfish but i was too tired to put in the effort for such a small amount of meat.  we also ordered the deep fried soft shell crabs with corn & <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>.  love love loved the soft shell crabs!! they were soo tasty and so crabby!  i just wish they had more in that basket!  i believe it only came with like 8 or something like that but i could have definitely went for another basket if i wasn't concerned with spending too much $$$ there.  the shrimp was awesome but almost too spicy!! i love heart in my food but this made my lips burn so i prob could have went medium on them.  but the shrimp were decently sized and cooked perfectly.  i hate when shrimp are overcooked but hnj did not disappoint in that aspect.\n\ngreat place to go if you are craving some seafood southern style!  be prepared to get down a dirty because eating with your hands is a must!!! get those napkins ready..you'll be needing them =]", 
            "ever since i saw this place on man v. food (one of my favorite food-related t.v. shows), i was determined to try this place during my next vegas trip.  alas the time had come and i dragged my friends to this place before our long drive back home to socal.  there are four different sauces you can choose from: <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. we got two pounds of shrimp, two pounds of crawfish and a pound of snow crab.  they were covered in <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> and the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.  we also got <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and sausage.  everything was so full of flavor.  all the seafood came in plastic bags to seal in the steam and flavor.  the crawfish were a bit hard to eat, but it was still quite delicious.  however, the only bad thing is that you will not get the smell out of your fingers for a couple days..no matter how much you wash your hands...and use hand sanitizer, but that's the price you have to pay for some delicious cajun seafood. :) i would definitely go back during my next vegas trip.", 
            "a review of this place by me is extremely overdue.  honestly, i feared sharing this little desert jewel with everyone and they mama...but i guess when something's that good, word spreads like an la wildfire.\n\nbackground: i'm from ca.  i've never been to lousiana but i have been to crawdaddy's (sj, ca), boiling crab (sj, ca) and hot n juicy.  my first experience eating cajun seafood was at hot n juicy about 4 years ago.  ever since then, i became an instant fan.  i've located cajun seafood restaurants closer to my place of residence, hence crawdaddy's and boiling crab.  anyhow, by far, hot n juicy blows the other two out the water, hands down!!  i just went to hot n juicy over the july 15th weekend and the ish was bomb diggity!!!  their crawfish was huge.  usually i think you get about 13-15 critters per lb, this time the crawfish were so big, we got about 8-9 per lb. but so worth it, i mean they were so big, i even ate the critters' claws...omg! - tell me the last time you had a crawfish so big, you could eat their claws?\n\n** as some of you may be aware, i'm allergic to shell fish but damn, i make sure to bring my benadryl so i can grub out without having to break out in itchy hives.  that's how good hot n juicy is.  \n\nbtw, if you didn't know:  they have now added <mark>King Crab</mark> legs...man, i might die from od'ing on shellfish that i know i really shouldn't be indulging in...gluttony\n\nfor those of you looking to compare:  it has been a toss up between boiling crab in sj, ca and hot n juicy.  after i got back from las vegas, i went to boiling crab to make sure i ate at both places within a short time span so as to keep flavors and experience fresh in my mind....well (drum roll please.....hot n juicy takes the cake).  hot n juicy has at a minimum 2 more secret ingredients that bc doesn't have.  the intense spicy flavors are there at hnj (<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>) without the thick oilyness that bc has in their whole shabang.", 
            "if i lived in vegas, i would be a fan. it just doesn't compare to boiling crab. i ordered crawfish, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, and oysters. crawfish was a little tiny. the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning wasn't bad. it had <mark>Potato</mark> at least. we added <mark>Sausage</mark> to it. it tasted weird. like turkey sausage or something. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and oysters were great!", 
            "this place is one of my favorites on the planet earth and i encourage vegas visitors to take a short ride over to chinatown to experience this place. the garlic scent summons you in from the parking lot and once inside, (if you're a garlic lover), you just want to stay there. we had the shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and i could go on eating them forever!  one tip, do not forget to get the corn. it is brought to you in the bag along with your seafood and garlicky goodness (get the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>). i have never had better corn. oh, and do not wear fancy clothes there. you will smell like garlic for a few days...but i really didnt care. it was worth it!", 
            "<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> comin right up!\n\ni just came back from las vegas on a quick 23 hour trip and i managed to make it out to hot n juicy in chinatown. my friends heard of it from man vs. food and i thought the pictures on yelp looked promising, so it wasn't very hard to persuade me to go. we go there a little after it opened and were welcomed very excitedly by the staff. of course, since we were there so early, we were seated right away. we ordered the calamari, two orders of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, a half-dozen <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, two pounds of the hot and juicy crawfish, one pound of the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> crawfish and three pounds of the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> crawfish (my personal favorite). \n\nthe calamari was fantastic, it wasn't overly breaded like some places do it. it comes with lemon and some marinara sauce. now i am not a fan of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, but my friends ordered two orders, i was bound to try one. not only did i try one, i tried like eleven! haha.. they were nicely seasoned and went perfectly with the ketchup. believe it or not, i would order them again. (zoinks?! lol). the <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> were so fresh it melted in my mouth. my only complaint is that i usually add a bit of soy sauce with the lemon wedge when i shoot <mark>Raw Oysters</mark> and all they had was lemon. but none the less, melts in your mouth goodness!!! the guests of honor to our luncheon were the crawfish. all the flavors that we had were very flavorful and delicious in their own right. however, the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> was my absolute favorite, and i think everyone elses' as well. mainly because we put in an order for two more pounds after killin' just the one. \n\n*btw you can order different grades of spicyness for your food, however we ordered the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> at just a mild grade of spicy juice and it was pretty intense. even to my spicy-loving thai mates that ate with me :).\n\ni only gave them 4 stars because they only served beer. i'll add that additional star once they start selling wine at least, but with fingers-crossed they'll someday have a full bar.", 
            "hot n juicy is one of those places that i never thought i would like.  growing up, my relatives have always been obsessed with <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and other seafoods that you have to work for to get to the good stuff.  as i got older i saw that it wasn't just my family, it was pretty much everybody that was obsessed with peeling their food.  i just did not see the point in having to work so hard for your food!\n\nand then there was hot n juicy.  admittedly, my first visit here was made reluctantly.  if i didn't care much for crab, why would i care for crawfish?  the answer is easy: the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce.  medium spice.  i went from avoiding seafood that requires my hands to eat, to getting serious cravings for hot n juicy.  that sauce is spicy and leaves a (pleasant) burn on your lips as you continue to eat.  the garlic flavor can get pretty strong as it leaves it's mark on your breathe, and infiltrates every article of clothing you're currently wearing.  you'll probably end up doing laundry as soon as possible.  but all of that doesn't matter...because the sauce is worth it.\n\nmy current favorite is the shrimp.  crawfish is good, but their size is inconsistent.  not that that's the restaurants fault or anything, it's just that the first time i went, the crawfish were pretty darn big.  but with each subsequent visit...their size diminished.  but it's okay, i have my shrimp to keep me satisfied.  next time i go i'll have to try the crab.\n\nso has my mind changed about seafood?  no not really.  as it stands, i'm really in it for the sauce.  no <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, no seafood peeling/cracking for me.  five stars for instilling a craving that i never thought i would have, and having consistently delicious sauce.", 
            "it ain't boiling crab but it's the closest we have here in vegas. and this review is much more of a personal preference of which seasoning i prefer between the two. being from cali i might be bias but there is a bit more spice and kick in flavor in the whole shabang sauce than hot&<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce.  but just a bit so the difference is tolerable. everything else as far as the menu goes is the same.\n\nthe biggest difference though between the two is the service.  it's my second time here and i've excused my first experience. slow waiter, you have to request for salt, pepper and lime, and bibs.  in boiling crab, all that is already a given and they tie the bib around your neck for you.\n\nme and my friend were seated right away but a group of 5 or more, expect atleast an hour wait. overall with the exception of the service, food was great.", 
            "thanks to some recommendation from native lv yelpers, we decided to visit hot & juicy for dinner on a recent trip to las vegas. not the best idea to come straight from the convention centre, as the hot & juicy smell permeated our blazers and followed us around all week, but the experience itself was well worth it. \n\nanything that made it onto man vs food is likely the opposite of what i am looking to eat, but we decided to give it a try, for the spectacle alone. as soon as we arrived, finger licking smacking, bib wearing ladies were queuing for the washroom  in need of a quick hand wash. waitresses with big smiles and heavy eyeliner ran around with buckets and plastic gloves on their hands. i was intrigued.\n\nthe two of us sat at our plastic covered tables and ordered beer ($3 for import) 1lb of crawfish medium hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, 1 lb of shrimp medium hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> and 3lbs crab spicy <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>. we also had 2 ear of corn, and an order of calamari whose accompanying fries never arrived.  it was a ridiculously too much amount fo food but we were starving after a long day on our feet.\n\neverything arrives in a plastic bag, with sauce puddling along the bottom. the waitress dumps the bag onto your table from her bucket, and will give you a brief demo if necessary. you are instructed to dig in and leave the carcasses in the middle of your table as you plow through. \n\nregarding the spice, i found medium wasn't enough and i regretted my decision. also, i regretted ordering so much all at once, as we ate some got cold, which was less appetizing.\n\nfor the novelty (we barely ever see crawfish in toronto) it was fun. anything that dirty is always a good time of course. the flavor of the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> was really outstanding. it was great.  the service was actually among the best we got in vegas, they were attentive and friendly.  $96 for a mammoth amount of food that could have fed 4 with about 3 beer each.  the crab was good, but i find the crawfish just doesn't give you enough meat. \n\nminus a star for the impact on the environment from all that waste. i would have been happy with bucket, no bags.", 
            "mmm hot & juicy!  indeed!  i came here for a bachelorette party in the summer.  i took the bachelorette to hot & juicy as we waited for the other bridesmaids to arrive.  there was a long line of people waiting outside.  it was a thursday night.  the staff told it was a 45 minutes wait, so we decided to go cross the street and go grocery shopping.  i wanted to buy some fruits and snacks for the hotel.  by the time we got back, we were directed to our table.  i've heard such good things about this place from my girlfriends who were locals, skinny, extremely glamorous, and they can eat!   the bachelorette ordered 1 lb of shrimp with the hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce, garlic fries, and i ordered 1 lb of crawfish as well as buttered corn on the cob.   they all come out piping hot in a plastic bag.  we received a bib however,  we did not get any gloves as did some of my fellow yelpers.  i guess we didn't order enough food?  my buttered corn was completely soaked in butter and spices, it was so salty and soft.  i couldn't eat it.  i just wanted boiled corn and they said i had to be more specific.  you had to say boil corn or something.  my waiter was horrible.  he wasn't that attentive.  he gave me attitude because he had to take that corn back and gave me a different corn.  my 2nd corn was still super soft and with tons of butter.  i was super disappointed.  i love corn too!   ah, did i forget to mention that i had to ask where my corn was?  he had forgotten to place an order of the corn.  he didn't even apologize for forgetting.  he just brought out that soggy salty corn.  anyway, on to the review of the rest of the meal, it was yummy!  the crawfish was fresh.  all the shells were hard and not soft.  so that's how you would know if the crawfish is fresh or not.  the flavors of the garlic and spices were so good.  it was definitely a finger licking experience.  for the two of us, 1 lb each on <mark>Shrimp</mark> and crawfish was enough.  i don't normally eat that much shrimp, but crawfish i can eat a lot of.  i'd recommend coming to this place for the experience, maybe not so much for the corn.  it was actually kind of neat to see them serving white rice as a side dish.  next time i visit vegas, i'm definitely coming back.  we have a crawfish king in seattle and i do not like that place at all.  i'll do a review on that place later.", 
            "they bleed garlic\n\nwe all have our flavor obsessions.  some of us need lots of salt in a dish, while others tend to follow their sweet tooth.  for those of you who crave garlic, hot n' juicy crawfish is your mecca, you should make your pilgrimage.  \n\nthis place is all about one thing, and that is the food.  generally speaking, you will not use plates or silverware here, just your hands.  the small paper menu features a few items, which can be ordered in a variety of styles.  tables are topped with a roll of paper towels, and a garbage bag as a table cloth.  normally i balk at the idea of wearing a gimmicky bib at a restaurant, but when your server brings you a bib, put it on.  this meal is a hot n' juicy mess.  \n\nlast night we had a pound of the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs cooked \"hot n' <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>\" style (think chinatown meets the bayou, or mulan meets the frog princess if you're a disney fanatic)  we also had a pound of crawfish the same way.  \n\nthe <mark>King Crab</mark> legs ($20 a lb. right now) were huge, meaty, and succulent.  the meat eagerly came out of the shell, as if it was waiting all day for me to eat it. \n\nwe also ordered a pound of the crawfish.  the only issue i had with these tiny dancers was that they're typically out of season this time of year.  the ones brought to the table were small, like the size of a medium shrimp.  they were tasty, but it is a lot of work for what amounts to a mento-sized morsel of meat. \n\nbe ready to emanate garlic from your pores for a few hours after the meal, but its totally worth the aroma.  this is a great alternative date spot, since it is messy, casual, and reasonably priced.  \n\nmessy + casual + reasonably priced = delicious fun!",

            "las vegas is sin city for a reason; it celebrates the seven deadly sins. in vegas, your greatest weakness or vice becomes the source of all your pleasures. we were ready to give into our carnal desires and get down and dirty, indulging our voracious, gluttonous appetites. we wanted to get stuffed with something hot n juicy. \n\nhot n juicy is known for their seafood: crab (dungeness, blue, snow), shrimp, and of course, crawfish. you pick the type of seasoning (<mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> or the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>) and the level of spiciness (mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy). \n\nwe ordered 2 lbs of <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and 2 lbs of crawfish with <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> at medium, 2 pieces of corn, 2 red <mark>Potato</mark>, etouffee (a cajun seafood stew, similar to gumbo), and a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. eating at hot n juicy is not an elegant refine affair. it's messy work because they dump a plastic bag of whatever seafood you ordered and you're only protection is the plastic table covering and a plastic bib. you open the bag and dig in.\n\nthe crab meat was very sweet and juicy. it was perfectly cooked. i found that the spiciness of the food depended on the type of seafood because the seasoning is on the outside of the shell. the meat isn't spicy unless you soak it in the sauce first. i found the level of spiciness in the crawfish much higher because the tail meat was much smaller and there was more shell around it, unlike the crab meat where i could pull out large pieces of meat out of the shell. also i got more spicy sauce from the crawfish because i sucked crawfish heads. after a while my lips got tingly and numb from the cajun spices. \n\ni've never had crawfish whole before. i only had them de-shelled. while i love crawfish and the meat was great, i'll never have them whole like that again. the tail meat is rather tiny (i like 'em big -- size matters when it comes to these things). at the end, we looked at the mountain of shell and agreed that it was more work than it was worth. crawfish is mostly shell and i'd rather pay someone to shell them for me.\n\netouffee was a spicy rice seafood stew. i liked the flavor and the level of spice was just perfect for me. i thought the rice was a tad overcooked and mushy from just sitting in a pot all day, but in general it was enjoyable.\n\nthe boiled red <mark>Potato</mark> were much needed as a break from the relentless cajun spice. they were nice and sweet. the corn is out of season, so not as sweet and juicy as in the summer, but still tasty. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were crispy and tasty.\n\nthe final price for all of us was $30/person for three people. we gorged ourselves on great seafood and left utterly satiated. happy ending for us indeed.\n\nwhat happens in vegas, stays in vegas. but this is one of the few times where you wish you could get crabs and bring them home with you.", 
            "went here in late october with my mother and grandmother.  parking was a bit scarce, and the place crowded, but we were seated quite quickly.  tables were simple and covered with wax paper, which is expected since eating crawfish tends to get messy (they do give you bibs, but you shouldn't go in wearing your best and most expensive clothes).\n\nwe ordered two pounds of crawfish and an order of fried catfish.  prices of the shellfish are market value, so you have to ask the wait staff (when we went, the price of crawfish was approximately $10 per pound.)  you then choose the type of seasoning you want for your crawfish and how spicy you want it.  we went with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning and hot heat level, which was very delicious.  the catfish was decent, but nothing special.  when you come here, stick with the shellfish.  \n\ni recommend this place.  be sure to get here early, as it isn't a big place and fills fast, and expect it to be messy and fun!",

            "this place was so good that we went twice on our trip to vegas -- the day after we got there and the day we left.\n\nthe crawfish were pretty small when i ordered them (the waitress told us they would be) but they were succulent and sweet and more or less worth it. the shrimp and <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> were better though. i liked the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> medium (which was super spicy the first time i came and milder the second time) and my boyfriend was a big fan of the <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> mild. <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were awesome as well. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were a bit spicy which would have been okay but my mouth was already burning from the seafood. beers are cheap.\n\ndefinitely a fun eating experience as well. i would recommend the trip if you are in vegas.", 
            "so we went for the first time on a thursday about 12 o clock we went in and it wasnt very busy. the service was good we ordered the 1 pound of shrimp and 1 pound of <mark>King Crab</mark>(not so much in 1lb!) the shrimp were in <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> and  spicy level...yeah they were spicy alright!! and the <mark>King Crab</mark> had the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning and medium spice level and that was good! u dont get plates or silverware other than what u need for the crab. it was great but we didnt have much time to enjoy it since our daughter had a doctors appointment! but next time we go it will be enjoyed better!!!!!!", 
            "3, 2, 1!\n\ni have been hearing about this place for months! i am the last of my friends to venture, but finally, i tried it with a group of 8 tonight, and i loved it!\n\nthe wait is well worth it.  great concept of simplicity.  bag of seafood, bib, paper towels.  i tried <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> and <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauces, they were all delicious!  i must say i am not a lover of crawfish, so that will not make my order next time, but the spices were very robust and the shrimp and crab were awesome!\n\ni cannot say anything that hasn't already been positively reflected, so here are a few tips for the remaining 4 people in vegas who haven't been yet...\n\nyou will get completely messy.  no clean way to do it.  it's an experience, so go with it.\n\nunless you are the magician chris angel, your hands will be subjected to injury if you order <mark>King Crab</mark>. it is spiked and slippery once covered in the sauce and regardless of the aiding utensils, it's a pain.  stick with regular or dungeness.\n\nspicy is spicy.  it has a kick, however, i'm definitely not scared of extra spicy next time...take that anyway you want it.  if you're familiar with archi's thai, i do an 8.5 and i could probably handle a 9, but my stomach would build a small strike picket area amongst my small and large intestine...\n\nfinally, go with friends! a first date is not cute there...you leave smelling like you've been out an entire season of \"deadliest catch,\" and the scent will stay on your hands and nails for days.\n\namazing. bravo.  i'm going again this weekend!", 
            "love love lovve this place!!! my boyfriend and i eat here once a week. even their servers call us their regulars and they know us by our first names. when i first tried this place i ordered the crawfish. i now get a pound of shrimp because the shrimp has more meat and it's easier to peel than the crawfish. \n\nwhat is so great about this place is their special sauce..hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>! i get it medium spice level, if i do spicy (which i have) my lips start to puff up. but the medium is still pretty spicy. i've also had their snow crab, alaskan crab, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>...all very good. \n\nbeware you will smell like garlic after leaving this place. and your fingers will smell for two days. the secret to getting the smell out of your fingers is to rub lemon juice after u are done (and i mean a lot of lemon juice).\n\nthey are opening a second location which i am very excited for! their staff is very friendly too.\n\nalso the wait is pretty long but well worth it!", 
            "i love hot n juicy! i always get the shrimp medium w. the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> flavor. its so good!! also, the snow crab hot (the shell is thicker so it doesnt soak in as much as the shrimp) also w. the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> flavor. \n\nthere is no place that can compare to this.. so great! if you are ever in vegas you need to make a trip here if you like seafood and spice. sometime there is a long wait so be prepared for that.", 
            "oh em gee. i come here on average at least once a month. i wanna say it's their seasoning that gets me to come back everytime but i can't tell. when i went, crawfish was around $10 a pound and shrimp was a little less. i typically get shrimp because they have more meat and it is easier to get full. crawfish meat is quite tiny once you peel the gigantic shell. if you buy 2lbs of crawfish, you automatically get a free corn and potato. awesome!!! get the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasonsing which is basically a combination of all the other seasonings. i'm usually content with mild and medium spicyness level but my mother in law  get extra extra spicy and lemme tell ya... that kills you. \n\nif you're lucky, you can catch them when they have etouffee (kind of like gumbo). delish! has pieces of crawfish, red bell pepper, celery.. etc. the flavor tastes similar to the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> but i'm not sure. \n\nsurprisingly, they have one of the bessstttt <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> anywhere. it comes out hot and fresh. the skin is super crispy and the inside is hot and juicy. comes with ranch and ketchup and fries if you wish. a must have if you come!!! \n\npros: <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> & fries!!!\n<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning\n\ncons: none really. could be cheaper but business is business. =p", 
            "absolutely delicious, the motto \"pinch and suck\" are very practical here. i've ordered the craw fish and shrimp with <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> medium hotness very yummy, and also the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce spicy! wow very spicy but delicious. the levels of hotness are greater than at other places so try medium first or be brave and go for the spicy or extra spicy.  tried the dungenous <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, not bad, unfortunately the sauce doesn't get soked in to the the legs like it does to the shrimp and the crawfish. but over all its all yummy!", 
            "my boyfriend saw this place on man vs. food and it is only about a 5 minute drive from the strip. \n\nnot bad. we arrived at 12:30pm ready for seafood. yet, we were seated, given menus, then as we attempted to order we were informed that they are not currently serving crawfish. the item they are known for! unacceptable! we came here for the crawfish, thats what we wanted, so why would we order something else. the waitress expanded that they just received a shipment so their crawfish are frozen. first off, hearing frozen was a huge turn off. i live in the san francisco bay area so our seafood here is fresh. yet i had to remind myself that vegas is in the desert so fresh seafood here is unlikely. \n\nwe rolled our eyes and blew the joint. i swear i would be back but for the rest of the day i was getting puppy eyes from the honey so i agreed to give them a second try and attempt dinner.\n\nwe arrived again at 5:30 and we were seated after 10 minutes. we ordered a pound of hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> in medium and one pound of shrimp in <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> medium and a side of <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>. first off there is not one positive thing that i can recall about the fries so i would recommend ordering a <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> instead. yes, order rice over fries. i never thought i would recommend that to anyone. ever.\n\nmy favorite flavor was the hot & juicy! it was packed with flavor and mighty tasty! the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> was good too! i would both order them again. the heat levels here though are a little off, if you want hot, order medium, etc. i would beware the extra spicy! \n\nthe place got pretty crowed around 6:20 and i was happy we arrived fairly early. the service here is lagging. you have to notify your waiter(ess) if you want more water. they don't really pay attention the details. \n\ni would go back if i lived there and needed a crawfish fix, but on my next vegas trip or any after i will not be visiting hot and juicy. it was good, but it wasn't that good. \n\n(i took off a star for not having crawfish when i went initially fyi)\n\noh and yes, my paws smelled 2 days after. the amount of soap didn't matter. the order sinks in! kinda yucky.\n\nhappy ripping off the heads of crawfish! \n\n(=", 
            "got crawfish with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning at spice level medium...the crawfish soak up the flavor well but have little meat on them....my brother got shrimp which do not hold the seasoning as well....my buddy got snowcrab and wouldnt let me try it but said it was great....they bring it out in a plastic bag and you peel and eat with your hands...i had a small cut on my hand and couldnt sleep that night cuz it was burning/throbbing from the second lowest spice level", 
            "hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> shrimp with corn is the only thing i order every time i come here! a few tips i've learned from my previous visits.. wear clothes you don't mind smelling like shrimp in. so definitely don't go in your best outfit and if you have anything to do after your meal! lastly, lemons lots of them, soak your hands in the them to get rid of the <mark>Shrimp</mark> smell. couple things that are a bummer, parking and no phone reservations.", 
            "a little better than boiling crab in socal. i had the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> crawfish, medium heat. i pretty much inhaled it. the <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were made perfect. i cant wait to come back for more!", 
            "not a fluke, the second time proved to be just as good as the first. i am not proud that katrina m. and i came here two days within a three day span, but it was that good.\n\nthis time we came with her family and ordered 4 pounds of shrimp in spicy <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, one pound in medium <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, one pound in extra spicy <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>, one pound of spicy hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> crawfish, and one pound of spicy <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> crawfish. out of all the seasonings, their namesake is the best at the second to hottest level. their \"extra spicy\" did not deliver the scorching hot flavor i was expecting and would not make for a decent food challenge. the other two flavors were just mediocre, nothing special. we had also ordered calamari, but they are extremely salty. the sweet potato and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are cooked to a superb crispiness. ask for corn and <mark>Potato</mark> to be cooked with your seafood.\n\nyet again i could not resist the temptation and ordered a blue moon to go along with the meal. i might be completely out of the loop, but it has been a while since i have seen a restaurant offer beers for less than $5.50 a bottle. heineken, heineken light, corona, corona light, sapporo, and blue moon are the beers they offer for $3.\n\ni cannot stress enough that you should get there before 6 because the wait is nonexistent. for a party of six, half of us being present, they sat us right away. yet if another large party came and our group was not all there we would have to give up our table. they cannot be faulted for that. i understand the need to meet the demands. once we were all sat and ordered, the staff were very attentive with refilling drinks and taking our additional orders.", 
            "every time i come to vegas, i want to try this place but never get the chance. this trip i made it a priority and was the first restaurant to hit on my vegas weekend and i will definitely come back regardless of reeking of garlic after walking out of the place. even the next day i could still smell the garlic on the clothes that i wore to the restaurant.\n\neverything we ate was delicious!! my bf and i ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of the crawfish both in the medium <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce. and let me tell you, the medium was still very spicy. i'm glad i didn't get the hot. my lips were tingling with the medium and i love spicy food. we also got and order of the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and a side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>. i put some of the sauce on the rice and that was super delicious!! \n\nother reviews say how packed this place gets. not the case on a thursday night. we were seated immediately, however there was a good sized line when we left. service was great and the food was wonderful. our next trip out we will definitely be stopping for a bite again.", 
            "ate here yesterday with the hubby. place wasn't packed which was good for us. i saw some tables needed cleaning. so the waiter asked us to have a seat while he cleaned a table for us. we waited for like maybe 10 mins thinking he forgot about us or maybe he decided to clean all the tables before seating us? a waitress walked by and the hubby said something. she was apologetic n sat us right away. she took our order right away. we ordered 4 lbs of the hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> crawfish. came out right away, looked and smelled good! the crawfish were  big but you can tell some of them were dead before being cooked.  we had to ask for bibs and i noticed so did a few other people. so i duno if it's given upon request or what. i thought it was nice that they had gloves available upon request for the non messy eaters. the crawfish was just ok. i ordered medium and it was spicy!!! and too garlicky for me. it was hard to get past the very spicy n garlicky taste to be able to taste any other flavors. they checked on us a couple of times which was nice. but at the end when we wanted to check out no one  paid  attention and we were just sitting  waiting. i saw a few other tables waving their hands trying to get someone's attention. finally i said the heck with this i got up n when to the cashier and paid for my food. i don't care to come back here. but if i'm in vegas again and am dying for a crawfish fix maybe just maybe i'll come back. hopefully the service will have improved!!", 
            "i have to say i am a bigger fan of crawdaddy's in san jose, ca than i am of this place - both the service and the food (well, the sauce) is better at crawdaddy's.\n\nwe ordered a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, two <mark>Corn</mark> and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. we ordered both the crawfish and shrimp with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce which is supposed to be a combination of all of the sauces - the crawfish came out with that sauce and luckily they made a mistake and our shrimp came out with just the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce.  i was not feeling the hot n juicy sauce - it tasted weird with the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> and whatever else was in there, it was just too much. the <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> that was on the shrimp was really good though, we got medium spice and there were some nice chunks of garlic which is my favorite part :) both the shrimp and crawfish were big - no tiny suckers here which i did appreciate because when you get a tiny crawfish it's quite annoying - all that work for nothing. my favorite part is always the corn because they sit it in the bag with the shrimp and it soaks up all the juice and every bite you get the sweet corn with the spicy <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> taste - absolutely amazing i'll tell ya! i think if we never got the hot n juicy sauce i would have liked the crawfish better.\n\nthe service was okay - we got some jock looking like dude.  he was nice but we had asked for <mark>Extra Seasoning Sauce</mark> and some extra <mark>Corn</mark> - waited about 10 minutes, didn't see the guy and when we finally spotted him he was just kicking it behind the counter chatting it up with the girls. in my head i'm thinking \"come on fool!  i want my corn and <mark>Extra Seasoning Sauce</mark>! wtf you talking for?! that won't get you a good tip!\" haha.. we didn't end up getting our corn until the end of our meal along with the check - i guess we could just call that our dessert ;)\n\nthanks to mvf we came, we saw and we tried some pretty good food but i think if were in vegas again we wouldn't come back.",

            "so hot, so juicy, so good. so this is what everyone's been raving about. \"i mean, how good can buttered-up crustaceans really be for people to wait in line for long periods of time?\" i wondered to myself as i waited in line, albeit i expected a wait for a party of 14 or so. for people who like to get their hands dirty and have an affinity for head on crustaceans, hot n juicy is 5 stars for sure. \n\nfor me, however, i don't like to get my hands dirty (especially under my fingernails), and i prefer my crustacean to be deveined and decapitated before i devour them. nevertheless, i must say i enjoyed hot n juicy. i ordered a pound of shrimp in the signature <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce, medium-level spicy. if you order two pounds or more, you get corn and <mark>Potato</mark> thrown in the bag. i wish they would include corn and <mark>Potato</mark> with one pound orders though...\n\nwith plastic gloves on and paper towels laid out in front of me, i opened the bag of shrimp and spicy steam, and grabbed a shrimp. the worst part about this experience (other than the mess) is cleaning the shrimp before eating. it takes a long time. but i guess it's good to eat slow. the best part about this hot n juicy experience is the sauce. the sauce is so tasty- savory, buttery, spicy, garlicky, etc. make sure to generously dip the meat in the sauce. the sauce is 5 stars, but the shrimp are probably worthy of 3. while some of the shrimp were plump and firm (a sign of freshness), some others were kind of mushy (a sign of age). i detest mushy shrimp!\n\nwhat would make hot n juicy perfect is if they offered complimentary bread to sop up the delicious sauce that comes with your seafood order. that would be cajun heaven right there!", 
            "this place is sooo good!  i was hooked after a friend took me here last year.  i ordered a pound of shrimp marinated in the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.  i love eating really really spicy foods and the medium spiciness i ordered had just enough kick for me.  my friends ordered <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and crawfish marinated in the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> but i think the shrimp is able to soak more of the delicious marinade and easier to peel.  heck, i even ate the shrimp's head and i don't normally eat the shrimp's head =)  the marinade is that good!  i'll never be able to go back to hawaii and eat expensive giovanni's or any other shrimp trucks again.  giovanni who?  i can't wait to go back to vegas and eat there again!",

            "i wanted to celebrate my friends birthday on my day off so i decided to treat her and her fiance to some hot and juicy crawfish.  i grew up in so cal where boiling crab reigns supreme, and after moving to vegas i've had an empty void that needed filling.  i saw the man vs food episode and i've read the reviews before stepping in, so i came in excited, hungry and craving crawfish.   \n\nbetween the 3 of us this is what we ordered. dozen <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, <mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>, 2# shrimp <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> very spicy with corn and sausage, and 1# crawfish <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> medium spicy.\n\nthe only complaint about the service was that our <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, which should have been the first thing to come out, showed up on the table last.\n\n<mark>Raw Oysters</mark>- accompanied by cocktail sauce, lemons, horse radish and tabasco.  i'm a big fan of oysters and these were decent in size (comparable to hama hama), but without any accompaniments they were very bland.  oysters are suppose to taste like the sea, but these were washed so much they tasted watery and flavorless.  \n\n<mark>Fried Catfish Basket</mark>- breaded in a <mark>Corn</mark> crust served over a bed of french fries and accompanied by ketchup and tartar sauce.  personally i'm not a big fan of <mark>Corn</mark> breading, but i can't really hold that against the establishment and their recipe.  catfish was moist and flaky and had a hint of cayenne which perfected the \"southern\" flavor.  i actually enjoyed this the most.  \n\nshrimp <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> very spicy-  we ordered this with corn and sausage, both of which were awesome.  the corn was sweet and complimented the spice well. the sausage was spicy and tender and added a bold meaty flavor to the sauce for the shrimp.  the \"<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>\" sauce isn't as flavorful as i expected, and the \"very spicy\" here is comparable to  \"medium spicy\" at boiling crab.  but the flavor was decent and the shrimp themselves were \"okay\".  not the freshest shrimp i've ever had but they weren't rotten or anything, but what can you really expect in the middle of the desert? \n\ncrawfish <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> medium spicy-  i'm debating whether or not i should even review this item just because i should have known better than to order this when i already know that crawfish is out of season at this time.  needless to say we received a previously frozen, bland, rubbery product.  so i'm just going to comment on the sauce, which was the same on the shrimp, but this had significantly less flavor.  perhaps, more spicy=more flavor, or it could be that there wasn't sausage and corn in this bag to add to the flavor.  \n\nmaybe i'm being a bit unfair because i'm comparing this establishment to boiling crab.  however the food was decent and a better alternative to a lot of other restaurants i've been to in vegas.  if i was asked to come here again, i would, but i don't see myself craving hot and juicy crawfish like i do for boiling crab.  i guess my best advice is if you're a boiling crab fan don't expect too much out of this place.  if you're just looking to satisfy a seafood craving this would be a good supplement while you're out in the middle of the desert.", 
            "again, another great off strip foodie find.  i dined here on 9/4/11 with my hubby and his brother and cousins.  we got here around 8:45pm and this place was jammed packed with people inside the restaurant and people waiting outside the restaurant.  we had to wait a good 30-45 minutes before we were actually seated.  staff awesome and helpful.  while we were waiting outside in the desert heat, the hostess came out and served us all ice waters, which was a really nice gesture knowing that it was hot and we were all waiting patiently for a table.  \n\nomg, food here is fantastic!!  everyone in my party loved the crawfish and shrimp.  we ordered both crawfish and shrimp in their <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning.  it was amazing!!!!!  we also ordered crawfish and shrimp in their <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce.  so good!!!!  my brother in law said that this place was way better than boiling crab and had better prices too!  \n\nthey had really delicious <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and their catfish and <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> are very tasty goodie too!  the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were spicy and can sneak up on you!  :)\n\n\ntip:  parking is limited, you may need to park on the street.  try to get there as early as possible as this place gets crazy busy!!!!", 
            "hot n juicy is pretty good. i had a pound of shrimp with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce (which i guess is a combo of all the sauce flavors). the shrimp was slightly overcooked which made them hard to peel, but the flavor of the sauce was excellent!\n\ni'm from cali and i am a big fan of the boiling crab so the sauce is up there with boiling crab's whole shabang. my one complaint about the sauce would be that it was too watery/thin and it didn't stick to the shrimp very well.\n\ni also had the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and it wasn't my favorite as i've had better elsewhere.\n\ni hear they are opening a boiling crab out here in vegas but until then, i'll probably be back if i ever have a craving.", 
            "in hawaii, you get shrimp trucks. in vegas, you get hot n juicy crawfish!\n\nthis place is amazing! you order a pound (or five) of whatever seafood you want in whatever sauce you want and they bring it to you in a plastic bag so you can get your hands dirty! oh, and it gets messy (but don't worry, they have a bib for that).\n\nthis place is pretty packed and there's a wait, but it's worth it. there are many types of seafood to choose from (shrimp, crab, crawfish, etc) as well as seasonings and the level of spice you want. <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> was the best. the price is relatively low, the <mark>Shrimp</mark> were decently sized, and the service was excellent. if you don't want to get your fingers dirty, you can always ask for gloves (but where's the fun in that). also, remember to add <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and a side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> (if you're local like me)!\n\nsince there's no place like this back home, i'm going to have to try replicating this in my kitchen. :)",

            "whenever we're in vegas, hot & juicy crawfish is always on our to do list.  in fact, yesterday when i flew in to vegas, it was my first stop after getting my rental car.  besides, what's not to love about food served in a plastic bag with rolls of paper towels on the table right?\n\nmy friend ordered a pound of <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> shrimp, a pound of <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> crawfish, an i ordered my usual hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> shrimp, medium.  that would be the only thing i would warn you about is the spice level.  i like spicy food and even the medium makes me think twice sometimes.  the flavor is a perfect balance of heat, spices, garlic, butter and just awesomeness.  i hope to go one more time before i leave.", 
            "there are two of these on the same road, so i'm not sure which we went to. i'm not a huge crawfish fan, but my girlfriend is a fanatic. she ate three pounds of the little bugs! the service was fast and friendly, the place smells amazing, and the food was great. i recommend the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning, it was all buttery and garlicky, two of the best things on the planet if you ask me. the girlfriend was a little sad that crawfish was out of season, but she said the frozen ones were almost as good as the fresh, and they were a lot cheaper too!", 
            "we are frequent visitors to las vegas and have really started to find our way around the place.  when we saw hnjc on man v. food we were excited to try a new \"locals\" place.\n\nwhen you walk in you start drooling right away, the aromas coming out of the kitchen permeate the whole restaurant and it is awesome!\n\nevery time we go to lv now the kids want to go to hnjc and so do i!  \nyou will get messy and you'll smell like hnjc for a while after you leave.  \n\nwe always order the hot n juicy mild crawfish.  we all love spicy food but they aren't kidding when they say the mild is pretty hot.  my husband, 13 year old, and i can stand the medium but our 10 year old can't.  that's ok though because the mild has more than enough spice and we'd probably prefer it anyway.\n\nsometimes we get the shrimp, it is very tasty and just as messy as the crawfish.  i prefer the hotnjuicy medium for shrimp.\n\nwe had the <mark>King Crab</mark> once, it was fabulous.\n\nwe've tried most of the flavors but now always go with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.",

            "this is a must try place, if your looking for something different and unique this is the place to go. i did enjoy the different atmosphere this restaurant offers.  you gotta get your hands dirty that's the fun part about this. the best is the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce and i did enjoy that more with shrimp than crawfish and it was just awesome with the dungeons crab, which was a little pricey but that's normal for crab. its all in the sauce i can eat that sauce with anything, it was also great with bread more than rice. just try this place i don't think you will be disappointed.",

            "amazing!  food tastes great and the staff is nice.  hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce with the lobster, <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, shrimp, mussels, and clams is the winner.", 
            "de-fricken-licious. i had never tried crawfish, but i'm a big seafood lover, so i was excited to try it from what is supposedly the best. you order your seafood of choice by the pound and can find the daily market prices on a board by the kitchen. you choose your choice of seasoning and heat level. i went with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> and \"less than mild.\" even at less than mild, the spice level was making my nose run a little bit (i'll admit, i'm a wimp). service was okay. we had to ask the waitress for a refill after she passed our empty cups several times. i promise, i'm not a snob, but as a waiter myself, if a customer has to remind me for a refill, i'm not exactly doing my job. anyways, on to the food:\n\nsnow crab w/ <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>: absolutely amazing. i don't know how, but their crab was some of the most moist i've had. huge chunks were easy to pull out since the meat hadn't dried out. don't forget to dip your crab meat in whatever seasoning you have. it takes it to the next level.\n\ncrawfish w/ hot n juicy: great, but very small. the little bits of meat that you get from each crawfish wasn't very much. as a crawfish newbie, i was surprised, but now i know what i'm in for. if you're here for just crawfish, i'd get at least 2 pounds.\n\nmussels: wow. some of the best i've had. i never knew mussels could be so tender! i'm so used to having them dried out/rubbery as they're generally - and unfortunately - cooked.\n\nsides: corn! get lots of corn with your seafood of choice. shake it in the bag, so it gets coated with the seasoning and save it for whenever you're done with your seafood. it will be all sorts of juicy goodness. my only regret: not getting more. the fries and <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark> were perfectly cooked, but beyond that, weren't anything special. especially if you're trying to eat on a budget, i'd load up on some sides with your seafood, otherwise you'll easily be spending $25+ per person to fill up.\n\nchicken nuggets: as we had a non seafood eater, he got some chicken nuggets which were pretty bad. they looked and tasted like they came from some foster farms frozen bag. however, since this place is meant for seafood, i don't hold it against the restaurant.", 
            "pretty good...for vegas.  here's my recap:  parking could be better.  not a lot of spaces.  available spaces were a little tight.  seated immediately upon entering.  the place was pretty busy.  many tables with chairs, some with booths.  some booth seating was not accessible because the neighboring table was too close.  servers were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.  menu offered crawfish, shrimp, oysters, clam, lobster, <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark>, <mark>King Crab</mark>, and snow crab.  all market prices.  seasoning choices were <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>.  choice of mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy.  sides: corn, potato, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>, rice, rolls, and sausage.  also, appetizers were etoufee and a large variety of fried items: calamari, hot wings, soft shell crab, catfish, shrimp, and chicken nuggets.  we ordered two pounds of boiled shrimp: one <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> medium and the other <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> medium.  bibs were served first.  the bottom of the bib folds over to make a pocket to catch debris you drop.  we also ordered a side of white rice.  the cook time seemed about right, not real fast, but not too slow either.  constant line for men's restroom.  only one person at a time.  many people waiting to get in to wash their hands after eating.  the food comes out as it is ready, not served at the same time.  i prefer this method.  the shrimp is served in a clear plastic bag and the shells are left on the table.  plastic table cloth makes for quick and easy clean up.  the shrimp was good sized, hot, and flavorful.  there was a little extra juice in the bottom of the bag which we used to dip our shrimp once peeled.  also, we ladled some on the rice for a bit of flavor.  the shrimp was head and shell on.  this requires a little work, but is the traditional way to serve, saves the kitchen a bit of time, and leads one to believe the shrimp were alive when cooked.  i lived in louisiana for many years so i know there is a difference between <mark>Louisiana Style</mark> and cajun style, but i don't know why they made the distinction here.  most patrons in vegas won't know the difference.  the difference here is that louisiana had more butter and cajun was more traditional with more spices and less brother allowing the sweet flavor of the shrimp to come through better.  the difference is almost not noticeable, but i prefer their <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>.  the rice was okay.  all in all the food was pretty good.  we really enjoyed it.  on a side note, they did not purge the shrimp.  that is, the gastrointestinal track and the poop were still in the shrimp.  vegas patrons don't know any better.  its kind of gross, but i ate anyways knowing that it won't hurt you (otherwise, the place would have been shut down a long time ago).  there were plenty of paper napkins at each table and wet wipes served at the counter and with the bill, but i would have preferred a washing station, similar to those at cravin cajun.  you get really, really messy eating boiled shrimp and that stuff is super painful if you get it in your eyes.  they do serve alcohol, but we had tap water, which was served in styrofoam cups.  the server did not ask if we wanted lemon, but she brought out a styrofoam bowl with almost two whole lemons (kind of a waste).  shrimp was $8.99 per pound and the side <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark> was $2.  we really enjoyed this experience and will be coming back.  i tried the crawfish on a previous visit here.  it was the best crawfish in vegas.  flavor was right, but a bit small for louisiana standards.  i love crawfish, but think the shrimp is a better deal because there is much more meat.  i really like this place, but cravin cajun is better.", 
            "**disappointed**\n       - boiling crab - ever since boiling crab opened last november, hot & juicy has done the opposite of stepping up their game (http://www.yelp.com/biz/boiling-crab-las-vegas).\n       - watered down - they have been consistently watering down their \"hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>\" sauce. they put so little per bag now, i can't even dip my shrimp back in.\n       - prices - their \"market prices\" are still a dollar or two above boiling crabs.\n       - crawfish - their crawfish are smaller and less fresh than boiling crab's crawfish.\n       - conversion - eventually, all of their patrons will wise up to the other \"crawfish/shrimp in a bag\" place in town and it'll be too late for them to turn it around. i used to favor hot & juicy over boiling crab, but not anymore.\n**recommendations**\n       - i want to give this place a 3.5, so i'll round it up to 4. it's still good, but just a shell compared to it's former self. unless boiling crab has too long of a wait, i'll probably not be coming to hot & juicy anymore.",

            "my boyfriend and i were craving boiling crab (bc) while we were in vegas visiting his parents. so we yelped for the new boiling crab in vegas, but stumbled across hot n juicy crawfish so we decided to give it a try. good choice!! i am happy to report that this is my new favorite hot spicy cajun shrimp place to eat! there doesn't seem to be a line here to eat, which is good because i hate waiting for more than an hour for food. \n\nservice is really good here. our waitress explained everything and gave us her recommendations. and when your water is low they come and fill it rather quickly. the waiters and waitresses are usually walking around and asking how everything is. \n\ni think prices were a dollar more than bc but that's okay. totally worth it. we usually order just 2lb of shrimp (i can't even eat half) and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> to share. and we got the medium spicy <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. \n\nthe shrimp: it's so good. it's better than the shrimp at bc because the shrimp here are more plump and drenched more in sauce! sometimes at bc it's either you get small shrimp or not enough sauce. but here, it looked like everyone's bags came with lots of sauce and plump <mark>Shrimp</mark>. i think that is a win.\n\nthe <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>: hot spicy goodness in the mouth. i felt like my mouth was on fire just after a couple! i love spicy food so this was a win in my book. it doesn't look like they just sprinkle the cajun sauce on the fries, but it looks like they cook it while the fries are in the fryer because it is seriously explosion of cajun flavor in your mouth after one bite.\n\nnext time i'm in vegas, i'm going to make a stop here. it's not near the strip so if you are visiting and staying on the strip, get a rental car or taxi it over to the \"chinatown\" of vegas.", 
            "the next best thing to boiling crab! the last few times i've been to vegas, i have eaten here for lunch. it is delicious! their hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> mix is yummy! the last few times i've been here, the service is great! the waitresses are attentive and very friendly! food comes out pretty quickly, and prices are fair! it surprises me how fresh the crawfish are! i heard they fly them in daily. yum =) \n\nthe oysters are also really good. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are ok. i think the boiling crab ones is way better but what matters most, is the sauce for the seafood (which is delicious!)\n\nmy boyfriend left his credit card here and we were able to come back and retrieve it. so glad the staff didn't steal the credit card =) when we were getting his card back, we noticed there was like 6 other credit cards that people left. they kept it safe in the cash register! thanks hot n juicy!!", 
            "what a way to start a vacation, great tasting crawfish!\n\nthe crawfish was well seasoned and their spicy, <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> wasn't very spicy but it's fine, it was actually my preferred level of hotness.  their <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were good \"enough\", just some cajun spices sprinkled on regular french fries.  their oysters were a good start also, but their chicken nuggets (we had a child with us) sucked.\n\nat 10.99/lb at the time of this writing, ah who cares, you're in vegas, spend a little!", 
            "no matter what boiling crab & hot and juicy will always be compared to each other! their menus & concepts are practically identical yet the 2 are quite different~ \n\natmosphere: i prefer bc! the restaurant is huge with plenty of tvs and i love how you can tag up their walls ~\n\nservice: bc wins! their servers are always smiley & happy! i love how they put your bibs on for you~\n\nquality: i think it's a tie! both places have always had fresh seafood! yummmmmy! and they usually have the same prices~ \n\ncorn/<mark>Potato</mark>/sausage: for some reason they taste better at bc.. they just do! \n\nspecial sauce: i prefer the hot & <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce over the whole shabang! it has a stronger deeper flavor and you can definitely taste the garlic! bc can sometimes be way too salty for me..\n\noverall, the boiling crab wins but not by that much! i still like to eat at both places ~", 
            "i love seafood and this place definitely has fresh seasonal seafood from <mark>Blue Crab</mark>, crawfish, clams, lobster, oyster, and shrimp. since this place is usually packed, it's recommended that you call ahead for reservations. \n\nthe staff and service is very helpful in recommendations and attentiveness. they will refill your glasses of water when they get a chance, get more napkins whenever they come to your table with more orders, and make sure you order enough before the kitchen is closed. \n\nthe set up is simple: order seafood by the pound. you can choose the seasoning for your seafood (like <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark>, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>, <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>) as well as the spice level. then, the food is served in clear plastic bags and all you need to do is rip it open and dig in. you can make a mess on the table and not worry about the clean up. it's messy, it's fun, and it's delicious. \n\nbesides seafood, you could order sides like their <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> or rolls to soak up the flavorful broth or sauce that is used to cook the seafood. \n\nfast, fun, and filling, hot n juicy crawfish is the best place for people who want a feast of fresh seafood without the worry of cooking or cleaning up.", 
            "my favorite are the <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>. i like it with <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> sauce. their shrimp is big and their <mark>Garlic Butter</mark> sauce is delicious! i even like to get rice on the side to put sauce on it and eat the rice like that if i'm feeling really hungry. i'm not a fan of the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce though, i think it's a mixture of all the sauces put together and it just doesn't taste good. crawfish is good when in season long enough to grow big. when they're not in season they suck because it's frozen so it's mushy and doesn't taste as good.\n\nextra spicy is reallly spicy! to where its painful, so avoid unless you love very spicy food! i get spicy or medium.", 
            "i never thought i'd find a better cajun seafood place than boiling crab until i came here. sorry bc but hot n juicy just has their sauce spot on. something about that <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce, it has a similar taste to the \"whole shebang\" but it has a creamy/butter factor that knocks it out of the park. \n\ngot a pound of shrimp and a pound of crawfish with a side of <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. it was awesome!", 
            "what can i say? i love hot n juciy! this restaurant is by far one of my favorite places to eat at. i am going to start off by saying all of their food choices are amazing, however, their shrimp is the best. i always get a pound of the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> and not once have i been disappointed. their sauces are fantastic, the garlic gives it a nice kick. the fact that you can actually interact with your food makes it an even better experience. the prices are great for the quality of food you get, so no complaints there. i must also say that their service is spectacular. all of their servers are very upbeat and always checked on their customers. i go there so much that they now recognize me. they are so much fun, i can safely say that this is one of the better places off-the-strip in terms of service. i highly recommend this place if you are looking for a high-quality cajun seafood place, just make sure to bring gum for that garlicky smell.", 
            "there are not too many places where i feel a bib is necessary to eat, i mean i'm an adult and can handle putting food in my mouth without spilling it all over myself.  hot n juicy is the rare exception to this rule.  breaking into crawfish and sucking the juice from their heads is messier than one would expect.  \n\ni can vouch for the crawfish, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> and lobster.  i'm also a huge fan of the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning.  i have kind of a \"when in rome\" approach to food ... if something is a specialty or a namesake, more often than not it's damn good.  when i lived in vegas, i would frequent this place often and bring visitors from out of town here.  never a dissatisfied experience or visitor.\n\na few thing to keep in mind though ... expect to wear a bib and smell like hot n juicy for the rest of the day ... maybe into the next day.  this place is also crowded, expect to wait ... it's well worth the wait though.  hot n juicy is an experience, be ready to get your hands dirty.", 
            "omgggg so! i kept hearing about these places,them n bc. in vegas i stopped by, paid $11 a lb for <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. 2lb minimum n it came w corn n <mark>Potato</mark>. in total $26 bc i added sausage which was worth it. $26 was super steep bc of the name i suppose. in texas it's the same quality just not as expensive. the food was hot n juicy. for ppl who like spicy,get spicy not mild. i came home from vegas later that night n my bf made me bathe bc i smelled like it lol. it's true it stays on you but yummy. at least go once. at first i was pissed bc some of the fishtails were small.", 
            "oh my gosh. after today's visit, i finally understand the hype around hnj! this place is good. the only thing that sucks is the wait! so it's a good thing it's worth it!\n\nwe had a few people visiting from texas, so my best friend randy and i had to be strategic about getting a party of 10 people in this small space. since they don't take reservations, i planned to put our name down early and wait before everyone else got there. the wait was at least 30 minutes when we got there. by the time everyone showed up, it had been 40 minutes, however, the hostess came out to inform us that they were preparing our table! wonderful timing and within another five minutes, we had a table in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nthe food was delicious and with a large group, the experience was so much fun! i don't normally like getting dirty or using my hands, but with the bibbs, plastic gloves, cracker, sheller, and paper towels, it made dinner very enjoyable. i ordered a pound of the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs (market price today was $25.99/lb) with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> (all the seasonings combined) in medium. oh, it was so tasty and those legs were huge! it was challenging with thin plastic gloves and legs with gigantic spikes, so i utilized three pairs of gloves and several paper towels. i think there needs to be gardening gloves and/or real towels for those heavy duty <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>! it can be pretty dangerous. ruben and i also ordered the calamari and <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>. all delicious! but that <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning/sauce, wow.\n\nwonderful, wonderful place. the service was just okay, but i know they're busy and honestly, you're so consumed with wrestling <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> that you forget your server hasn't checked on you. as long as they remember to keep the beverages filled, there's nothing lacking. can't wait to go back!", 
            "i've heard a lot about this place, so i was really excited to finally try it.  i was told in advance to get shrimp instead of the craw-fish so you don't have to do as much removing of shells.\n\nthe waits are long here and parking is very scarce up front, so be prepared to park on the side street.  the menu is very simple and the waitress is more than willing to explain how everything works.\n\nwe ordered a basket of the hot fries for the table and they lived up to their name.  as tasty as they were it's a good thing to split with a group because i imagine they wear on you in the long-run.\n\ni decided on the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce shrimp.  they bring it out in a hot plastic bag and from there you go to town.  after an intro lesson from someone in our party, i was peeling shrimp faster and faster as the night went on.  it definitely is a lot of work peeling especially when the food is still a little hot, but on the plus side it slows your pace of eating so you don't eat too much!\n\nafter all was said and done the food was ok, it's been 3 days and i still have a hint of garlic smell on my hands and the next day when i went for a run my sweat smelled like the sauce!  for all the effort you put in i wish the food was better, but the experience is something to live.\n\ntip:  make sure to not wear any fancy clothing and possibly ask for gloves so your hands don't stink for days.", 
            "yummy- huge shrimp for about $10 a pound. huge crawfish for same price. my hubby and i ordered 2 pounds of crawfish and 2 pounds of shrimp. yummy. also ordered an extra potato and corn which they brought out in a styrofoam cup with the awesome hit <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce with loads of garlic. yummy. i loved it. we ordered medium and mild hit <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning. it is hot but good. and please ask for gloves because not only will your hand smell like garlic for days but if u have small cuts from peeling crawfish in your hands, all that spiciness will burn your hands. i would go back next time we come back.  u have to come by and try it out. very casual atmosphere and awesome music. wear casual clothing and tie up your hair.0, because u will get dirty from all that sauce on your hands.", 
            "**confession: the seafood @ this spot is absolutely amazing!!!!!**\n\nof course a pescetarian like myself is always in the mood for yummy seafood. a few weeks ago, my sis recommended that me & a friend check this place out for din din. omg, i fell head over heels in love! \n\nit's always a good sign when you walk up to a place & there are people lined up outside the door, waiting to be seated. there was also a large number of people who placed to-go orders, so this place was jumping with business! we decided to grab a bottle of wine (fetzer riesling) while waiting for our table and all of the staff there were really friendly & funny. i was joking with the guy who gave us the wine before we even had a chance to sit down. lol\n\nit was friday night, so like us, most of the folks dining there were already pretty tipsy (as they rightfully should be). wheee! :-d i remember joking around with a female waitress who was serving a table full of guys about them having another round of drinks! i also interacted with our adorable server before we were seated & decided i wanted to sit in his section. i let the hostess know & she was completely cool with it. all of the fun, goofy interaction with the staff was the 2nd indicator that we were in a good location.\n\nfinally, the food. you select your seasoning, pick a spice level, & select your items. we opted for the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> (combo of <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, & <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark>), extra spicy (hot hot hot!!!), & ordered crawfish, shrimp, lobster, & crab (hooray 4 seafood!). the crawfish comes with 1 head of corn on the cob & a red potato, so you can add additional corn & <mark>Potato</mark> to your order as needed. all of the food comes marinated in clear plastic bags, so you literally open up the bags and dig in! everything was seasoned & marinated to perfection! it was hot, spicy, juicy, & delicious as advertised. the service was also impeccable from the moment we stepped into the place! it was one of the server's last night there so we ended up taking silly pics in her memory since she was working instead of enjoying a moving away party. i think i ended up taking pictures with the entire staff by the time the night was done. silly me! lmao \n\nwe ordered shrimp, crawfish, corn, & <mark>Potato</mark> to go for my sis since she wasn't able to make it down there with us that evening. those leftovers were still delicious the following day. :-) i was back in vegas this past weekend (the place was packed again on sunday night) & ordered takeout for dinner one evening because the food is absolutely fantastic! looking forward to eating my leftovers tonight & making plans to visit some of the other locations soon.\n\nbe sure to check this place out next time you're in town. you're sure to love it as much as i do! :-d", 
            "finally, i found a place that is comparable to my favorite boiling crab (bc). i'm talking about crawfish and the fries since that is all i've tried here. \n\nwith great reviews and how it was on man vs. food. it was a must try on my list when i went to vegas. i got the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> crawfish because the waiter said it's similar to bc's \"whole shabang.\" it is indeed 90% similar, and the 10% is that it was overload with garlic. yup!! i was safe from vampires the whole weekend. thank you hot n juicy, but no thanks. my garlic scent caused jeremiah (the dude who sang birthday sex) to not show up at chateau paris night club that night. it was a sad day.  ok, i exaggerate a little, but yeah i was a little overwhelmed with how much garlic is in it (and i love garlic). nonetheless, the crawfish was succulent and fingers licking. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> were also so good, a tab better than bc's fries. \n\nthe staff was friendly so that is a plus. \n\ncrawfish was $8.99/lb...expensive! but i guess the price came with fame.\n\ni'd recommend this place if you like bc or/and garlic of course.", 
            "we saw an episode of man vs food for this place just before our vegas trip, so we brought the hubby here for father's day.  this location had the man vs. food banner  so we knew we were in the right place.  we had to circle to get a parking spot.  it was 90 degrees outside, but comfy inside.  we were able to snag one of the last tables. the other tables had families with kids, couples, and friends. the wait staff was all young and friendly.  we ordered a pound of shrimp in garlic sauce and a pound in the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce, mild for both.  they were nice size shrimp.  the flavor of the sauce was great and the shrimp tasted fresh.  the tables were covered with plastic and they had plastic gloves for us.   a big roll of papertowels was on the table.  it was messy.  the shrimp comes tied up in a plastic bag.  the kids got chicken nuggets and <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark> with fries, which came in a little basket and they were okay.  we didn't like the etoufee with rice that we ordered.  the flavor wasn't what we were use to, but the texture and rice seemed normal.  \nmy family doesn't like the shrimp heads, so lucky me, i got them all.  i didn't eat them all, but i ate quite a few.  i didn't feel well afterwards, maybe it was the shrimp heads.  hubby and kids were fine.  i normally have a pretty iron stomach, so i would try it again.", 
            "so finger lickin' good. \n\nthe epitome of my dining experience here was not only watching myself and my friends devour the whole menu but the finale to the great dinner began at the restroom's line to wash my hands.. \n\ntwo minutes into my wait in line, the young gentlewoman in front of me helped triple confirmed how delicious this place was when i struggled to keep myself from awkwardly admiring her as she licked her fingers clean. classy woman was ~5 feet away from the restroom and probably only had to wait another minute for her turn at the sink. \n\nwell, ain't no body got time to wash your 'hot n juicy' fingers at the sink when you're here!\n\nstay classy and put your cool bib on before you get your sanitized hands on what we ordered:\n\n-as many lbs of <mark>Shrimp</mark> you can handle\n-dozens of fresh oysters\n-<mark>Sausage</mark>\n-<mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>\n-fried cat fish\n-calamari\n-fried <mark>Chicken Wings</mark>!\n-beers for the whole party\n\nwe also ordered the crawfish but i'm not a big fan of working so much for a little piece of meat. i did have a couple and it wasn't very impressive so it'd be my last recommendation to order. spicy here is truly spicy - you'll get the heads up before ordering as well!\n\nalso, be mindful not to ask for the 'whole-shebang' here or you'll get some hot n juicy stares from the waiters/waitresses. just kidding, you'll just get kindly reminded that you're not at boiling crab and it's crowned the \"hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>\" sauce here - could've been more saucily creative than that methinks but the taste is very up to par.", 
            "came here for lunch because i've been wanting to find a good crawfish joint in las vegas and boiling crab just isn't cutting it.\n\nthere are two hot n juicy on spring mountain and we went to the one that isn't next to pho kim long. you are greeted and served by a bunch of attractive girls and they all have head phones on. the crawfish here is pretty good but definitely nothing compare to houston's. (i love crazy cajun) we ordered the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> with level spicy, but next time i'll definitely go for extra spicy. i also tried a little bit of the sausage and it was yummy! \n\ni'd go back again when i'm craving crawfish & i do recommend this place if you're ever in town and craving seafood.\n\np.s they also have chicken nuggets and wings and such for kids.", 
            "i got 2 pounds of crayfish and 1/2 pound of shrimp.  honestly, it's all about the sauce.  you can dip a dirty old sock (i got the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> which is like a combo of all the sauces) and it would taste good.  the crayfish was pretty hard to eat - takes a lot of time to deshell and the meat isn't that tasty to make it worth the effort.  the shrimp is a much better - less work, less shelling, and they give you pretty descent size shrimp for $10.99 a pound.  my only complaint is that they don't really sell any carbs to go with that delicious sauce - like some white rice, or bread or pasta.  i would go find that old sock to dip it in, so i can eat more of the sauce.  it is very messy, so don't go in your sunday best.  and you will probably need a change of clothes, bath and manicure after eating here, but it's pretty well worth the trip.  if i lived in vegas, i would do the take out - because it's kinda embarrassing licking your fingers in public, and walking out with all these little splatters all over your shirt.", 
            "this is one of the most fun dining experience i've every had!\nwe arrived right before the place opened, and it was literally packed about 15 minutes after it opened for business.  \nthe is the place where table manner and dress code is optional. by the time you are done, it will be messy with sauce all over your face your hand and piles of seafood on the table. so don't dress to impress, just bring something to cover yourself. :d\ntheir ordering process is simple: just order the choice of seafood, seasoning, level of spicy and add-ons. the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning is absolutely fabulous. it's like a combination of  cajun, black pepper and lots of garlic, so you got lots of flavor in one bag. the spice level is more like those you will find in a thai restaurants, so when you pick spicy, it is really spicy. make sure you order <mark>Potato</mark> as add-ons, it well pick up all the sauces and juices in the bag and you will be in potato heaven. \nwe ordered 2lbs crawfish, 0.5lbs shrimp, extra corn and potato i<mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning and spicy. with two drinks it only cost us about 26 dollars. so it not only the best taste you will find in vegas it will also be the best value in vegas.", 
            "love this place, always amazing! i get the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> shrimp spicy it's so good. the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> are good too. can't go wrong here unless you you don't like sea food.", 
            "yummy!  yes, good thing for the bibs, becuase it will get messy, but it is well worth it! i recommend getting the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning on your crawfish. awesome flavor.  we also tried the soft shell crab, that was also good.  \nwe will definately return next time we are in las vegas.  excellent service, great food.", 
            "big fan of man vs food and the travel channel, so we had to come try this place out. we don't really like crawfish so we order shrimp instead. we have tried different seasonings they offer but end up liking the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning extra spicy. it has so much flavor.", 
            "the only time i eat a pound plus of food is when i come here! my favorite thing to get is the one pound bag of shrimp, <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> flavor, extra spicy. i've tried the other different flavorings but this is by far my favorite. they also have clams, oysters, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, french fries, <mark>Sweet Potato Fries</mark>, rice, chicken nuggets (for your non-seafood loving friends that tag along), crawfish and other fixings. \n\nin my opinion, this location by decatur, is better than the one off of valley view or off eastern.\n\nif you've never been here before, be prepared to use your hands and get messy. my \"system\" is to lay a couple sheets of paper towels underneath the bag of shrimp to absorb any stray sauce drippings so it doesn't drip off the table and into my lap. i also have my orange soda with a straw within drinking distance so i don't have to grab the styrofoam cup and get sauce all over it. after i put my plastic bib on, i put lemon juice on my fingers and wipe them off, then put the gloves on. after i'm done eating, i put more lemon juice on my fingers to help remove the smell of skrrrimps and seasoning and then wash my hands. \n\nanyway, the food is really good. everything is tasty. service is always pretty decent. whenever i need my fix, i come here!", 
            "defiantly try the shrimp with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce and with any spice level you can handle. just give me a pound of shrimp and beer and i'll be happy :)", 
            "just taking my own personal time writing this review about hot n juicy makes me want to drive over there right now and get a pound of shrimp. this place is king in terms of asian/creole style crawfish/shrimp/prawns. i think the shrimp is the better than the crawfish. the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce- spicy-  is the best tasting style imo. id recommend requesting the <mark>Potato</mark> and putting them inside the bag. the only negative things id say about this place is that dinner can be very messy and that your hands will smell, sometimes days after you eat. <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark> are above average, corn is sweet, and prices are reasonable.", 
            "love this place! way better than boiling crab\n\nservice is ok. \n\nfood is always great! \n\ni recommend the <mark>Cajun Fries</mark> and a pound of whatever with the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> mild. i can definitely take some heat, but be careful when you order because they definitely take it up a notch!", 
            "let me start off by saying i had just come from new orleans, and these guys are doing it right! i got the hot and <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> sauce in medium, spicy and extra spicy. yes i ate 3 pounds of crawfish don't judge they're delicious!", 
            "i absolutely love this place!!!  every time i am in vegas, i make at least one trip here.  they offer a variety of seafood options.  we always start off with a round of oysters, fried calamari, and their <mark>Cajun Fries</mark>.  then we are off to pounds and pounds of crawfish, <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, <mark>Dungeness Crab</mark> and <mark>Shrimp</mark>.  our prefer seasoning is the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> with the spicy level of spice.  boy is it spicy, but sure hits the spot.  the seafood is always fresh here and the fried food stays crispy and is non-greasy.  you really cannot go wrong with this place if you are an avid seafood lover.", 
            "at last count there were two hot n juicy crawfish locations in las vegas, but i have it on good authority that this is the one you want, at 4810 spring mountain road. my husband and i were steered towards this one, further away though it is, by a reliable local, which is the kind of good advice you want when choosing an off-strip, local neighborhood place. driving from the strip, you actually have to pass a hot n juicy crawfish (in chinatown) to get to the \"right\" hot n juicy crawfish.\n\nlocated on a busy multi-lane road chock-a-block with shopping centers and fast food, hot n juicy crawfish doesn't look like much from outside. or inside, for that matter -- a decent-sized space looks smaller than it is because of so many ragtag tables squeezed together, it's usually packed, it's loud, and i wouldn't exactly call it clean. you're in the middle of the desert but the vibe is carefree beachside -- the floor is a mess and most diners are wearing plastic bibs, happily covered in sauce. you order at a counter, from a menu posted on the wall overhead, and they call you when your order is ready. \n\nthough you can get baskets of <mark>Fried Shrimp</mark>, <mark>Snow Crab Legs</mark>, <mark>Raw Oysters</mark>, wings and chicken nuggets, hot n juicy crawfish put their signature item right in their name. when you order the crawfish, there's a method. no \"crawfish nazis\" here -- the staff will kindly help you out if you're a first-timer. you order your crawfish by the pound, then you pick a seasoning, then you pick a spice level. for seasoning, you pick from <mark>Louisiana Style</mark>, cajun, <mark>Garlic Butter</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pepper</mark> or a <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark>. spice levels range from mild to \"holy s@#t.\" that's not what they call it, that's what i called it. if you like spicy, you love this stuff.\n\nthe best experience is to go off-hours with a group, get an assortment of seasonings and spice levels, get some cold beers and have a blast. wear something washable, yer gonna get messy!", 
            "this place is the best! people will argue that boiling crab is better but the seasoning and the sausage here just can't be beat! we love getting the shrimp and crawfish with <mark>Sausage</mark> and rice. a lot <mark>Bowl Of Rice</mark>. you need a whole lot to soak up all that delicious sauce. get the <mark>Hot N Juicy Special</mark> seasoning if you don't mind having garlic breath, if you don't want that the <mark>Juicy Cajun</mark> is just as good. the mild is usually spicy enough so watch out if your not big on hot food. i love having those plastic bibs on and eating with my hands. prices aren't bad at all. i think it's about $12/lbs for shrimp. whenever we come we're seated right away. the servers are always friendly and the food comes out pretty fast. i would suggest coming here in clothes that's ready to go in the laundry coz it will end up smelling like garlic lol so leave your coats and jackets in the car!"
