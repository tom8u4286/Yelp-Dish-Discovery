            "the wicked spoon was wicked good!\n\ni took a few moments to read some of the recent reviews and i am shocked!  i can only speak for the sunday brunch but it was the best brunch buffet to ever hit these lips!!!    \n\nfrom the moment you walk into this building you feel like you have entered a scene from sex and the city.  it is definitely shabby chic!  not my particular style but i loved the energy and attention to detail this place has.  someone said they got lost getting to the restaurant.  hmmmm, i don't want to say they are stupid but they have these little signs that direct you right to it....lol  it is down an unassuming hallway that leads you past the hotel room elevators.  one can reasonably assume that the target audience for this restaurant is guests first.  rightfully so in my opinion.\n\npeople complaining about price....really?  this is vegas people!  sure it is expensive but i can honestly say it was worth every dime.  if you want a cheap but okay buffet, head to the rio.  this is an upscale place and the food was more single serving than buffet quality.  there are plenty of cheap buffets but i assure you that you will get what you pay for.  btw, prime rib is being used as a test to see if a buffet is good?  when did the worst cut of beef become the standard?????...lol  every time i read a review that mentions prime rib i stop reading.  they obviously don't know quality food if that is their biggest topic to discuss.\n\nthe food.....i was in heaven!  individual servings of all you can eat food is not a negative thing.  it is a gift from god!  the temperature and quality are way easier to control and it cuts down on waste.  again, lots of non restaurant people talking smack about things they have no knowledge about.  tons of different options and tons of <mark>Uni</mark> food choices to try.  you want to judge a buffet?  do it by the quality of their bacon!  this place has the thickest, tastiest bacon of any buffet i have ever been too.  for goodness <mark>Sake</mark>, they even had slab bacon they would cut fresh for you!!!!  omelett and egg station prepared any way you want it.  fresh pecan french toast and pancakes.  really?  if it were socially acceptable, i would have just eaten right off the serving dishes!\n\ndessert station.  okay, lots of smaller desserts and most were delicious.  there were so many options that i wished i hadn't eaten that third helping of bacon so i could fit more in.  if you want their best dessert tho, hit up the gelato station first.  their best flavor is the salted peanut.  it was awesome!\n\ni will be back but next time i am wearing sweat pants!!!!!!!!!!"

            "the wicked spoon buffet tends to carry about itself a little different than all of the other buffets in vegas. \n\ni went here on a friday for the lunch buffet, two days after the grand opening. price for lunch was about $19 a person. upon first look, you'll notice that this place is pretty classy for a buffet; all the way down to the plates, glasses and silverware. not surprising, considering how over the top the cosmopolitan already is.\n\nfood isn't as common as you'd see in other buffets. in attempts to \"class it up\" most food is portioned for you, meaning that you won't be slopping food down on your plates. instead, you'll be going around picking up smaller plates/dishes and possibly scooping  some veggies on your plate. this seemed to work, seeing that my plate hardly ever looked messy. in other buffets, my plate always looked like a multicultural plate of diarrhea piled high to my choosing. i always felt like i was eating a classy meal here with each serving.\n\nin conjunction with most buffets around vegas, you'll be getting foods from varying cultures. there's the asian, italian, mexican, american, and middle eastern influences. you'll notice that the chef's put their own little touch on each entr\\u00e9e to make their dishes a little <mark>Uni</mark>. whenever i got meat from the carving stations, it did seem pretty dry and flavorless. the rest of the food here never blew my mind, but they weren't bad either. \n\nthe dessert station was  the highlight of the entire buffet. offering selections such as homemade fudge, crepes, giant chocolate dipped strawberries, and gelato, it was hard to go wrong with anything here.\n\nthere was one little pet peeve though, in which i was told was going to be fixed soon. none of the food was labeled. i was often guessing what i was eating most of the time. you'd have to ask the chef what an item is to truly know what you're eating. it was a bit of a pain to ask the a chef whenever i walked up to a new item.\n\nif the food was labeled and the meat wasn't so dry, this would be a 4.5 star review. i really absolutely loved the atmosphere that the wicked spoon does to set itself apart from the traditional vegas buffet. the buffet is still new, so changes and justifications are probably still going to happen. i do hope that food will also improve over time. a lot of the meats just seemed to be overcooked. overall, i was satisfied with my buffet experience. i may drop by again to try out their dinner in the future after the place settles for a bit.\n\npresentation: a\nfood: c+\nservice: b\nvalue: b", 
            "i went here during cosmopolitan's opening week for lunch.  like many things cosmopolitan, it's a typical las vegas experience, but with a little twist.  in this case, some of the foods are served as prepared plates instead of the food sitting in a tray.  the decor is beautiful like the rest of the cosmopolitan.  like most las vegas buffets, this buffet is multicultural, which basically means it serves italian, japanese, and chinese food.\n\nfood choices ranged from mediocre to really good.  the salad bar was a bit lacking, especially in fruits.  there were, unfortunately, no oysters or crab the day i went.  the sushi selection is, like at most las vegas buffets, very limited, but i was glad they even had sushi there.\n\nthey had six different \"big meats\" to choose from, all of which were forgettable except the roast lamb.  maybe it was because i got the 2nd or 3rd cut of it, but it was some of the best lamb i've ever had at a buffet.  it was extremely juicy, cooked well and carried that distinct lamb taste well.  definitely save room for the lamb if you're a fan.\n\nthe desserts are quite good.  i had a bit of the crepe with bananas foster which is a nice treat i've only otherwise seen in wynn's buffet.  the rest of the dessert section is composed of small tarts and sweets, varied chocolate-dipped apples and strawberries, and a gelato section.  the gelato section contains some <mark>Uni</mark> flavors like \"peanut butter and jelly,\" which was delicious.  stay away from the apples.\n\nservice was friendly, but poor.  our waiter sat us down, took our drink orders, and then disappeared.  we only had one refill on drinks and had plates stacking up at the center of the table.  i remember there being two major spills from the staff, one of which was a tray full of sodas.  once the staff become a little more accustomed to their jobs, things will be really good here.", 
            "my family and i decided to go to the wicked spoon for christmas dinner, since it was new and we were staying at the cosmopolitan- the elevator we took was right next to the buffet, so every time we came out, we saw the nice decor. \n\nthe wait was ok, about an hour to an hour and a half. i really liked the reception. in contrast to bellagio's hustle and bustle and very crowded area around the cashier, the wicked spoon had a separated waiting area and were letting people come through to the cashiers group by group, so we didn't feel harassed by people behind us. someone was already waiting (once we finished paying) to lead us to our table, so we really felt like we got personalized service.  \n\nservice was excellent overall. our waitress was really attentive and was very receptive to any of our requests. (by the way, if you're a fan of hot herbal tea, ask for herbal tea! they have a menthe poivree that is absolutely amazing!) she disappeared for a few moments, but was easily spotted again within the next 10 minutes. she often came by to pick up any empty plates so the table stayed clean and spacious.\n\nthe design of the buffet is really, really nice. i felt that everything was very sophisticated, with large and <mark>Uni</mark> chandeliers as well as artistic photographies against the wall. unlike a lot of other buffets, many of the dishes had their own plating, so when i brought my plate (with cluttered, smaller plates on top), i actually felt it worthy enough to take a picture of. what was even nicer was that we could take the smaller plates and put them in the middle to sample together as a family (as opposed to us eating just from our own plates because other people's plates look really disgusting or something), so we knew which plates to go back for. \n\nthey had a really good salad selection (including kobe beef salad, a really interesting shrimp salad with miso seasoning that instantly became my favorite) as well as a really good bread and cheese selection. they also had some cured meats, which went really well with the bread and whipped goat cheese. \n\nthey did have a carving meat section, but the carver (?) seemed inexperienced, and the wait ended up being really long. i kinda gave up on it, so i can't tell you much on that. i'm sure that'll easily get faster over time. \n\ni didn't try much of the chinese stuff, but they had an excellent pork belly with picked dikon in a bun (?). i went back for seconds, and would've gotten another time if i hadn't been so full. the pho/miso bar wasn't very impressive.\n\nthey also had a good selection of pastas and other similar items. their potato gratin was absolutely delicious. my sister's a really big fan of pasta and she went back for seconds. the majority of the items were labeled, but there were still some that i hesitated to take when they weren't labeled. if you're not allergic to anything, i highly recommend you taking any unlabeled dishes anyways to try! i was really pleasantly surprised by a number of those dishes.\n\nthe desert bar was really impressive. bellagio's selection was impressive in quantity, but not so much in <mark>Uni</mark> and quality. the wicked spoon's, though, was a lot better. each of the deserts seemed really artistic and i really enjoyed a lot of them (including the chocolate covered strawberries)! i sadly ran out of room towards the end (that's what i get for getting too zealous over the main entries and not pacing myself), but they also had a buche de noel (is it called a \"log cake\" in english? haha, i don't know) for christmas which was also a nice touch. they also had a gelato section, which were served to your request in these cute bowls. \n\nso yes, overall, i had a really good time. my dad, who usually just gets a couple of plates and just stops there, actually got up several times to go check if he missed anything and always came back with something that he hadn't seen the first time around. he was really excited, haha. (i think he did mention that some things, you have to actually ask for. i didn't get details, but the meat he brought back was amazing.) i, myself, found myself actually bursting at the seams- my stomach felt like it was pushing against my belly demanding for more room) before desert even started (in contrast to bellagio's, where i just kinda gave up on the main entries and then ate the desserts to get full.)\n\ni will definitely be recommending this to anybody who goes to vegas. :)", 
            "i came here during the week of christmas last year, which was the opening week of the cosmopolitan. for such an upscale and luxurious casino, you would think that their restaurants have to be top-notch and at their best. unfortunately, that was not the case when i went.\n\nthe good: $20 for lunch at a very nice place is not that bad. there was a variety of food, most of which were served in individual plates, which is different compared to most other buffets in vegas that serve their food in big trays for you to scoop out of. there was a good selection of meats (definitely try the lamb if you can), a small sushi bar, some dim sum, and other kinds of food -- they all varied in excellence. there are unusual foods which i have not seen at other buffets before, one of them being pork belly fat wrapped inside a flour bun. nonetheless, the food was presented beautifully, just like the decor around the buffet (curly-glass chandeliers and beautiful silverware). the dessert selection was amazing, and it's not like any other dessert selection you see at other buffets. there were macaroons, chocolate slates, mini chocolate-covered apples (each is <mark>Uni</mark> with different toppings), gelato, unusual tarts sitting in egg shells, and chocolate covered strawberries. you can tell that they put a lot of effort into individually making each piece of dessert.\n\nthe bad: my number one complaint here would be the staff. although friendly as they were, they were not prepared as they should be, both in terms of handling food and as waiters. our waiter approached our table saying, \"my name is uh, ____. *long pause* i am going to be your server today.\" it seemed pretty obvious he was trying to remember his lines, which should have been perfected before the grand opening of such a high-class casino. not only that, but he disappeared after giving us our drinks and never came back to check up on us or refill our drinks. our glasses were empty after a while and we had to call on a random staff to refill it for us. as we were eating, we heard a big clash near the kitchen door and found that the same staff member just dropped the tray with our drinks on it. another clash was heard later on, for another staff had dropped another tray on the floor. our finished plates literally filled up the entire table before the staff took it away. also, the place lacked fruits, which i think is essential at a buffet.\n\noverall: i feel that this buffet has so much potential, but just lacks the proper staffing experience and some food quality/selection at the moment. if you're reading this review in the future, hopefully the staff will be more prepared and the food choices will open up just a little by then. i am a little bit curious myself to see much they will improve in a few months' time.", 
            "interesting concept. for 27 bucks for dinner, one of the cheaper gourmet buffet options on the strip. \n\nwicked spoon's concept is a buffet tapas thing - everything in small portions on small plates. unfortunately, there are several problems: one, the stations aren't very clearly labeled. so you have to wander around a bit to figure out the layout and there are a couple of stations i didn't really get. (i think it's a make-your-own-thai-rice-noodle-soup station at the end of the asian portion.)\n\nthe second problem is that any time you plate several small plates on top of a larger one, they start to slide around as you walk. and it made for stacking the dirty dishes difficult for the waitstaff. who, coincidentally, are not super amazing at their jobs. i can't imagine what the dishwashing looks like behind the scenes.\n\noverall, there was a wide range of food options. i enjoyed an udon noodle stirfry, some korean riblets, and the little shrimp cocktails. lamb chops in olives and artichoke hearts was a stand out, if they could get some more olive flavor into the meat. we also <mark>Uni</mark> enjoyed the sausage in balsamic grilled grapes. (okay, not exactly sure what this was, wish i'd taken better notes. sorry yelp.)\n\ni see that other yelpers have given the asian section bad reviews but i honestly thought it was one of the better asian sections on a buffet in town. less focus on sushi, and more on regional foods that don't always show up on a buffet line. (probably because middle america is just getting around to trying it.)\n\nwe didn't like the already-lumped crab. it was chewy and overdone and we all commented that we preferred the mess of shelling it because it usually tasted better. other misses: lamb ragu with gnocchi. saffron cod barely tasted saffrony. \n\ndessert was eh, but we didn't have any of the gelato. i did like that they had a bowl of mixed berries - should have stuck to this, a bit of fresh cheese and bread off the salad line and gone with a european dessert. the cheese selection is quite nice for a buffet in this price range.\n\ni hate to feel so mixed. i'm sure management will dumb this place down soon, so go experience it for yourself before they do.", 
            "i went into cosmo hotel to grab an early dinner after ces and was blown away by the decor and ambiance of wicked spoon buffet. we got there at right at 5pm with no wait, and the cost was only $27 for dinner. affordable pricing for such an upscale looking buffet.\n\ni loved how all the food was laid out and there were individual platings of all the sides in cute mini plates or pots. definitely an a+ for looks. too bad the taste fell way short.\n\nat first, i though that it was pretty tasty, but alas i was just too damn starving and distracted by the pretty plates to notice. but after my first plate, i noticed that nothing really stood out. i had no favorites to go back to...and i just ended up trying a little bit of everything. which is almost impossible to do.\n\nremember those cute individual platings? terrible idea! sometimes i would only want a bite or two, but because i had to take the entire serving, i ended up with a stack of lil plates and pots on my table. i felt super wasteful, but couldn't bear to eat the entire serving because i didn't like it all that much. \n\nplus those small serving plates avoid you from piling on different things at the buffet creating more than necessary trips back and forth. by then, you just end up getting full before you can get your money's worth. boo!\n\nthe meats were a little dry, and what...no crab legs?? instead they had some kinda peeled crab (i think) in some butter sauce. of course i wouldn't really know because nothing is labeled. but regardless, it was rubbery and weird and tasteless. my favorite thing was the shrimp cocktail, juicy and plump...but it was served in tiny plates of 2 shrimp apiece :\\ whyyyyyyyyy is life so difficult??\n\nmy favorite part of buffets is always the dessert bar. again, everything here looks stunning. miniature works of art. although looking individual and <mark>Uni</mark>, many of their dessert were similar in form...custard base with a fruit gel. nothing spectacular. they also have chocolate covered strawberries which i liked, but my favorite was the gelato. the salted peanut flavor was my top pick.\n\nservice was also on the slow side. it took the waiter 30 minutes before my coffee came out. by then i already fell asleep from the mediocre food -_-\n\npretty face, but lacking in quality substance.", 
            "great vegas buffet!!\n\npretty affordable for quality tasting food! sunday brunch was $23 dollars. the selection was good, and they had just enough variety without being too overwhelming. the dessert bar display was beautiful, anddd they had gelato! except no hazelnut flavor = -1 points for them, but still, lots of sweets to choose from :) \n\nthe interior of the buffet was pretty cool. i don't know how to describe the design inside since it was kind of different/<mark>Uni</mark>, and also kind of random, but it was pretty fancy for such an affordable buffet. \n\nthis buffet was not outstandingly exceptional, however, as in don't expect to find fancy or exotic cuisine here. but you will find all of your main dishes prepared quite well. one of my favorite dishes was the orrechiette pasta, it was absolutely amazing! \n\ni'd say this buffet falls in line with the bellagio buffet. definitely worth a try!", 
            "wicked idea!\n\nbomb buffet with a twist; items are placed in cute lil pots and kettles! great for sharing!\n\nanother pat on the back for wicked...they have a <mark>Uni</mark> menu!  a lovely array of gourmet oohs and aaahs that will leave you highly impressed.\n\nfew things i tried: chicken pot pie, braised short ribs with sweet berry glaze, mushu taco, spinach risotto, mac n cheese with toasted crumbs, some cod dish, clams, mushroom ravioli, sushi etc.  they all came in these adorable little pots and serving dishes =)  everything was extremely rich and flavorful!\n\ndessert looked a lot better than it tasted but again, i was impressed. gold flakes sprinkled on top, the dessert bar looked like willy wonka's factory! choc covered strawberries and mini candy apples were a hit.\n\ni went for lunch and it came out to $22!  very impressed =)", 
            "dear chef, please keep doing what you're doing now.  don't succumb to the bad reviews...they are missing the point.\n\nthis is, by far, the best vegas buffet i have ever been to...the best!\nfor about $29 (tax included) you can eat at a pretty fancy restaurant -buffet style.  the food presentation was awesome.  the variety was unparalleled and <mark>Uni</mark>.  this is some place i would love to take my parents to, and they don't like to eat at buffets very often because they feel gross in the end.  seriously, where else can you get all-you-can-eat polenta, creamed corn, creamed spinach, potatoes with cheese and bacon, bone marrow, lamb, fresh berries, grapefruit & pomelo, those chinese sticky rice tamale things, awesome deserts (my tiny key lime pie was lightly dusted with green limey powder, topped with some kind of red jelly and a gold flake) for under $30 in vegas?  \n\nif you want volume and stereotypical food from everywhere around the world, this is not the place for you.  but if you want to feel human instead of like a pig at the end of your buffet experience, then this is the place to go.\n\n[visit - jan 30 2011, dinner]", 
            "<mark>Uni</mark>. that's the best way to describe the wicked spoon buffet. my husband and i , giddy since we just dropped the kids off at school,had valentines day breakfast at the wicked spoon buffet. the dining room was pretty cool, done up in browns and was very modern in a west elm kinda way. my hubby did make a snide remark about the female wait staff <mark>Uni</mark>. it was a strange brown ginghamy, wrinkled, shirt-dress type deal that was not at all flattering. \nthe breakfast spread was cool, with small individual servings of items like 3 kinds of benedicts, smoothies, yogurt parfaits. the presentation was about the only great thing about this place. the benedicts, though made in small batches, had hard biscuits at the base, dry tough ham and sauces that quickly congealed making them very unappetizing. hubby and i were unable to eat our respective benedicts. they had red velvet pancakes.... babycakes don't even break a sweat... they were just dried up red colored pancakes with dried cream cheese drizzled on. the omelet station had some great fresh looking savory fillings but the avocado topping they placed on mine had a weird tangy taste that ruined it for me! \nwait staff was nice enough but slow, took their time clearing plates and refilling water they serve you water in these glass bottles. i'm sure they refill them but at least you have access to water while they take their time working the room! \n\nthe plu$$es: \ngreat breads especially their tangy sourdough! \ngood granola \nwalnut french toast \nomelet station - just no avocado pleeze! \nindividual cereal boxes... some good kinds not just raisin bran! \n\n$15 dollars for a weekday breakfast.. not so bad.  i can at least say i tried the place.", 
            "my boyfriend and i aren't your traditional vegas types--we don't go to vegas to gamble, or to go to strip clubs--we go to eat. \n\nwe've eaten at every restaurant in vegas, and every buffet. most of the time, we always go to the wynn. however, upon a recommendation we decided to try the wicked spoon. \n\nthis place rocks. bottomless mimosa brunch, fantastic assortment of food options. typically at vegas buffets you find that a chef does one thing particularly well, but wicked spoon hits all the right marks. it's not per se, but it's everything you expect out of a great las vegas buffet and more.\n\nmy favorite dish was the pasta (orecchiette?) with short rib, mushrooms, parm and brown sauce. i can't comm<mark>Uni</mark> how delicious this was--i went back for several second helpings--and i still dream about this dish. i have pregnant lady late night cravings for it. and i'm a man.", 
            "a buffet is really about the quality of the food, so even though the decor, service, etc. was all great, the food was the standout. everything my husband and i ate we mmmed and our eyes rolled back in our heads !\ngourmet cooking from the <mark>Uni</mark> salads-korean beef, miso shrimp, roasted asparagus,etc.the juicy, tasty meats, the individual serving size pots and pans that served up red wine burgundy stew, mac and cheese, chicken asparagus risotto,pastas,etc.  the thin crust pizza,garlic bread,etc, light and moist. tastiest kalbi ribs i've eatenthisnside of hawaii,\nthe pad thai and dim sum pretty good .the desserts are the only thing that's not as good as the bellagios, but the gelato bar and cookies make up for it and though the miniature gelatinous desserts were beautiful, there was no defined flavor, just sweet.this is our favorite buffet in las vegas now and it's kessler expensive to boot!", 
            "i absolutely loved this buffet.  my friends and i chose the option that gave us unlimited mimosas in addition to the buffet, and we could not have been happier.  the food was incredibly fresh, and the presentation was beautiful.  some of my favorites were the macaroni and cheese, truffles gratin, shrimp miso salad, lamb/ricotta gnocchi, and the french toast.  all phenomenal.  in terms of dessert, it was lovely.  almost too pretty to eat!  my favorite was the coconut panna cotta in an egg shell.  a wonderful way to end the meal.  i will definitely return here.  plus, you get the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to walk through the uber-chic cosmopolitan hotel on your way up to the buffet!", 
            "came to cosmopolitan to try this buffet out after hearing it was pretty good from another friend. stopped here for a saturday lunch around 12:30pm and there was no line! we had a large party of 18 so we had to wait for everyone to get charged and we were seated within 10 minutes.\n\nthe restaurant was clean and was beautifully decorated, especially for a buffet, but i guess we were at cosmopolitan where the decor itself in the hotel and casino areas were extravagant.  i thought they had more of a selection but they didn't seem to have as many different items as the carnival buffet. however the quality and look of the food at the wicked spoon does belong on another level. they serve their water in these fancy glass bottles firstly. they have a nice bread bar/salad bar where the salads are already made and dressed and ready to get picked up in small cute modern looking dishware. the wicked spoon is all about presentation and art. it is a <mark>Uni</mark> buffet but it looks better than it tastes. \n\nthey had a nice omelette making station here it allows you to customize your own, and even offer the option of egg whites and smoked salmon which most other places don't have. the miso shrimp salad is tasty and refreshing, and i loved the mac & cheese! its served in a cute silver measuring cup and the top is baked so its crispy and cheesy..yum!\n\nthe highlight was definitely the dessert bar. everything just looked so beautiful and colorful, i was really excited to try a lot of it. macarons let me down, they were dry and tasted weird. the panna cotta was probably the only thing i really enjoyed and chocolate dipped strawberries! oh, and they have an awesome gelato selection! i believe about 14 different flavors to try :) for $26 its comparable to most other buffets but looks a lot better so i'd probably still come back! dinner is only $1 more, at $27.", 
            "this a a pretty good buffet and very <mark>Uni</mark> with the whole small plate servings. i would have given more stars but the desserts really do need to be changed. they look amazing but do not taste amazing.", 
            "wow simply amazing.  decor is nice, and presentation was <mark>Uni</mark>.  this place sets itself above all other buffets.  i mean who would of thought to serve food in little fryer baskets, pans, skillets, cauldrons, dishes, plates, little to go boxes.  definitely different and <mark>Uni</mark> in their own way.  \n\nnot only the presentation and decor is nice, but the food is really good too.  i enjoyed the eggs benedict, chicken and waffles, mac and cheese, their penne pasta with sausage, korean short rib, miso pork, shepards pie, pastrami, and lots of desert.  for the first time i literally felt like i was a kid in a candy store again.  so many selections to choose from, and the sad part was i couldn't eat it all.  the small little cute candy apples and chocolate covered strawberries were amazing. \n\nthe price is decent too, ranging from 20-30.  thumbs up on my buffet list.", 
            "went to vegas with a couple of friends and after one of my friends saw the yelp pics from wicked spoon, we all decided to come check it out. btw, it wasn't very busy but perhaps its the fact that the cosmo is still a pretty new hotel and maybe no one knew about the buffet? nice though since we didn't have to wait long on a sunday evening.\n\nnow this isn't my favorite vegas buffet but i just enjoyed it because it was different and <mark>Uni</mark>. it was nice and clean and the food was presented in these cool, plates, small pans, and were portioned controlled. everything tasted good, but the one thing that stood out was the crab in cajun butter. i am just salivating thinking about it right now as i type. yes, seafood is a must have for any asian person at a vegas buffet. check my pics, pretty awesome huh?\n\noverall, i give a solid 5 stars. the atmosphere was great, and our server was amazing and friendly. we practically chatted it up with her, and she was nice enough to give us tips on where the hot spots were and what places to hit up (even on a sunday). she was amaze! food was delicious, clean, and presented well. you can't go wrong with checking out the wicked spoon. but if your lazy about going up a lot, you might not like it as the plates are small and everything on the buffet line is in a separate pan or mini plates, so be advised that your plate fills up quickly. but you should definitely check it out if you don't mind that. :-)", 
            "by far a new favorite buffet!\n\nthe interior was swanky and glitzy - just like the entire hotel itself.\n\nwe arrived at prime dinner time but didnt have to wait - probably because it was a weds. night.  the price was 36 bucks with tip and tax included for our  8 person party.  from what i hear that's a good deal for dinner buffets in vegas so i was pleased with that as well. we were seated at this nice long high top table that had interesting blue glass art hanging over our heads.  \n\nwhile some aren't a fan of the pre-portioned plates and pots they serve their food in, i kind of love the idea.  it kinda lets you think you're almost eating tapa style dishes rather than a buffet. now dining was the fun part- i literally tasted everything from the different sections - my favorite was probably the pastas.  \n\ni barely had room for dessert but forced myself regardless. they have this cute little gelato bar so of course i got mango gelato.  their desserts were overall very pretty but <mark>Uni</mark> looking. the most normal thing they had was chocolate covered strawberries.\n\nthis is kind of weird too but i just loved the water they served.  it was from these glass bottles that remind you of the old school milk bottles that were dropped at your door.  it just tasted so refreshing.  they served these water bottles all over the hotel.\n\nit's making me hungry just thinking about it. when i return to vegas - i'm def. staying at the cosmo again and eating at wicked spoon!", 
            "i've never been a huge buffet person but i'll admit, this was actually pretty decent!  my stay at the cosmopolitan included a $50 breakfast credit to be used at my choice of the henry, coffee beanery place, or wicket spoon.  i woke up hung over so i wandered down to the buffet.\n\nnow, i don't have a whole lot of buffet experience to compare it to.  i've only been to the plaza's buffet for breakfast years and years ago before i moved here and knew better, makino sushi/seafood at the premium outlets, and the mgm grand buffet for lunch (it was comp otherwise to this day i most likely would still have never been to it).  i left wicket spoon stuffed, because i felt the need to try a bit of everything.  \n\nthe following is what i remember having:\n- seared whitefish eggs benedict\n  *** this was amazing - must try!!!\n- margharita flatbread\n- red velvet pancake\n  *** very disappointing.\n- pecan sticky bun\n  ***  i don't usually eat crap like this, but this was bomb.\n- home fries\n- hash browns\n  *** topped w/cheddar cheese and carmelized onions, which is a plus, but the taters themselves could've been crispier. \n- some type of crepe\n- some type of french toast on sterioids: it was super super thick, had cinnamon, pecans and a think syrup which reminded me almost of caramel sauce.\n  *** pretty yummy, and unhealthy!\n\nside note: they do not have peanut butter!  this is a big no-no for breakfast lovers such as myself, as i eat it every morning!\n\ni believe i tried a few other things but can't remember exactly what.  but...seared whitefish eggs benny...oh, how i adore you.  \n\ni don't eat land-roving meat (only fish/seafood) so i didn't try any of the sausage, bacon or meat related items.  some of the other things i noticed but did not try were made to order omlettes, smoked salmon, various cereals & yogurts, waffles, one or two more selections of flatbreads, fresh fruit, etc.  so, overall there was a good selection to choose from, however i was expecting it to be a bit bigger in size (but maybe that's my buffet inexperience showing).  \n\na lot of items, as you will read from other yelp reviews, are portioned out into individual serving dishes.  this is a neat, <mark>Uni</mark> concept.  the only downfall i found was it made it a tad difficult to gather multiple items in one trip.  maybe that's what they're going for, so people ultimately eat less...i don't know.  what i do know is i must've looked like a pig with all the individual dishes on my table!!!\n\nservice was great.  upon entering and exiting the buffet, the hostesses were very warm, welcoming, and greeted with a smile.  the server was attentive and also very friendly.  like i said, i'm not big on buffets but if i were to go back to one for lunch or dinner, it would most likely be wicket spoon.  if you're a buffet person, you should definitely put this one on your list.  happy eating!", 
            "interesting cute buffet concept! most of the foods are individually portioned into little pots, bowls, or chinese take-out boxes! i came here for brunch ($26) and was able to try a lot of different things, but could only fit at most about 5-6 containers at once on my plate. some things that were memorable included the red-wine mushrooms, pork belly sandwich, and creamed corn. i thought their prime rib was pretty tasty as well. i wasn't too crazy about their pad thai. it was spicy, but lacked flavor in my opinion.\n\nthey have an extensive dessert section with all sorts of cute little bite-sized pastries and a gelato stand. absolutely loved their assortment of chocolate-covered strawberries - white chocolate, milk chocolate, with oreos, with rice krispies, with peanuts...such variety! my friends must've gotten full off just that! and the strawberries were large ones...not those dinky ones you get from the supermarket :)\n\ni agree with one of the reviews below who said that this buffet is definitely a way to win an \"aww\" with the girls. my friends and i must've said \"awww\" more times than i can count during the meal. but this buffet doesn't hit high marks for practicality. you can't fit that many food items on one plate and for people who know what they like and want more of it, they are forced to get multiple pots just to get the portion they want. however, i give it 4 stars for decent food, extensive variety, beautiful desserts, and <mark>Uni</mark> presentation. this buffet is definitely different and i appreciate their attempt to think outside of the box.", 
            "i loved the food here more than my companions did, but one thing we all agreed on was that whoever designed this place was bloody insane. ok they have this non-ironic crap '80s music playing, and these weird little <mark>Uni</mark> on the staff, and the fugliest wall decoration: photos of food wrapped up in clothes. \npicture a shiitake mushroom leaning up against a high-heeled shoe, that sort of thing. bogus.\noh yeah, i'd definitely come back for the chow, but i'd wear blinders and ear plugs.", 
            "talk about a different type of vegas buffet! we decided to check this place out for sunday brunch. \n\nthis place was super trendy and the presentation of the dishes are so <mark>Uni</mark> and super cute! not only does the food taste fresh and flavorful, there is a wide variety of different foods for everyone to choose from. \n\nmy favorite thing were the waffles! i don't know how they prepare the waffles, but they are so light and crispy. almost as if they were deep fried! =) yum. \n\neverything from tiny baskets of fried chicken wings to pint size chinese to go boxes filled with padthai noodles. everything was perfect.\n\nwill definitely go back", 
            "i was promised by my bf that there would be lobster here!! but no, there was no lobster. i would still give it 4 stars though - the quality here is superb, and the presentation is <mark>Uni</mark>. a lot of the entree choices are put in tiny stainless steel pots, and the dessert is actually pretty awesome.\n\ni noticed there were a lot of short rib variations, and not enough seafood. even still, i'd go back again.", 
            "came here for sunday brunch and all i have to say is... meh. it was okay, nothing astounding or worthy of writing home about. they did have a decent selection of breakfast/brunch food, mediocre sushi bar/asian section, salad and small bites, and pretty good dessert spread (but honestly... it's dessert). i've gone to the wynn and bellagio buffets, both which outshine this one.\n\nthey had <mark>Uni</mark> pancakes, such as the red velvet and guinness pancakes, but otherwise lacked anything too noteworthy. i will say though that i enjoyed their small pans/platters of dishes, such as the guyere stuffed gnocchi and other tasty pastas. i woud have liked to see a bigger sushi spread though. \n\noverall, it was good and definitely made me walk out full and satisfied, but compared to the other buffet options in vegas, this wouldn't be my first pick.", 
            "cosmopolitan being an upscale hotel and a part of the city center, i was shocked to find the price of the buffet only $29 on a friday evening.  no half tail of lobster or aycd wine are the main reasons for the disparity in price, as well as the small selection of seafood.\n\nthis is a great buffet and for the price, might be the best $ for $.  all the servings are the right size, large enough to get enough, small enough to allow you to try everything you want.  plus, each dish was served on a <mark>Uni</mark> plate to add to the presentation.\n\nfavorites were the crab claws, truffled potatoes, prime rib with garlic sauce, korean short ribs, marinated prawns, lamb ribs, various salads and soups.  \n\nwould definitely recommend this buffet to friends or bring them here myself and go again.  another small but nice plus is that this buffet has a restroom very close =)", 
            "ever since the bellagio opened up on the strip, their buffet was generally the best in my eyes.  though the paris buffet is arguably just as good from what i remember, i always thought what the bellagio had to offer was the best overall.  well, until now that is; move over bellagio, cuz someone has come along and snatched top billing from you.\n\nnow, don't let the trendy and chic decor distract you...there is some serious food being thrown out here.  while you will might assume it's just the generic sorts of items like salad, chinese food, sushi, pasta/pizza, and carvery items, there is just so much more to it than that.  rather, you can find more <mark>Uni</mark> offerings like kalbi (korean bbq ribs...surprisingly good!), buns with pork belly, gnocchi, risotto, pork loin, beef stews, flatbreads, truffle potatoes, and even a station to build your own bowl of pho.  seriously, how many other places can say that?  a pho station!  it'd be better if it were a ramen station, but still impressive enough!\n\nwhat's really cool about the place though is that it's not your usual sort of buffet where you pile a bunch of food on your plate and then go to town.  rather, like the rest of the hotel, it feels so refined, with a majority of the food being served in small plates, bowls, and mini-pots.  think like an individual tapas plate buffet.  pretty ingenious if you ask me since it's probably better at reducing the amount of food that gets wasted or dumped.\n\nthe food alone makes the price worthwhile, but it's even more reasonable when compared to the other buffets on the strip.  considering the quality and choices, it's not too shabby at $28 a head for lunch (by vegas buffet standards).  wicked spoon has pretty much all you could ask for at a buffet, but i have to admit that the long walk back to the main part of the hotel when you've got a stomach full of food kind of sucks.  in any case, wicked spoon is wicked awesome (so cheesy, i know).", 
            "i like to try new places and read other yelp reviews. they were right on! went for lunch...tried to make breakfast but parked in wrong part of cosmo and took a while to find the buffet so lunch it was. very cute. i like that everything was individually portioned in small pots and little baskets. the chinese was in little to go boxes. the wings, chicken pot pie, and bbq short ribs were tasty. there are many food options and the chocolate dipped strawberries were the size of my fist...no kidding. i would definitely recommend this buffet to anyone wanting to try something a little more <mark>Uni</mark>!", 
            "oh wicked spoon, you ain't that wicked after-all. i thought you might become my favorite vegas buffet but i might just called you the average spoon.\n\nthe food was made in these small individual containers. this was the <mark>Uni</mark> factor that separated wicked spoon from the other vegas buffets. the quality of the food was average, not as fitting to the decor. the meat from the carving station was not tender enough. some of the pasta was chewy and the fried chicken was not cooked properly. the food tend to dry out fast because it was in the individualized portions. the one stand out was their huge chocolate covered strawberries. i didn't care for the rest of their desserts because it was way too sweet but the gelato bar was alright. too bad they didn't have creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e. \n\ni might come back here again next year to try out their dinner buffet. the best feature was the upscale, chic and trendy decor. i would recommend the bellagio, wynn, and paris buffets over the wicked spoon.", 
            "$35 for dinner - totally worth it!\n\nthis is a buffet located inside the new cosmopolitan hotel. my friends and i arrived before 5 pm so we didn't have to wait in line for too long. \n\ni really like the <mark>Uni</mark> style of this buffet! a lot of the food comes in individualized portions in cute little pots and pans! super cute! and i guess it also helps you with portion control if that's your thang... but it's probably not if you're coming to a buffet. hahah..\n\nthey have a pretty good selection of food. crab legs were okay, lamb was tasty, kalbi was surprisingly pretty good, and they even had bone marrow! crazy! but honestly i was not a fan of the bone marrow. i felt like i was eating globs of fat served in a bone. blehh but i admit, it's very <mark>Uni</mark> so i applaud wicked spoon for that! i absolutely loved the fresh mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes. if you're a fan of caprese, you will love this. they also have a mac and cheese bar you can take advantage of. everything else was pretty standard. \n\nmy favorite part was the dessert bar. i ooh-ed and aah-ed at the display of all the beautiful desserts! there was a wide variety of chocolatey things, tart things, fruity things, etc. i loveddd the lemon jello/custard dessert with the pine nuts and mini macaron on top! mmm! they also have gigantic chocolate covered strawberries and a gelato bar among many other sweets.", 
            "i've been sitting on this review for a couple weeks, and it was because i was <mark>Uni</mark> to write.  the experience was just that.  i was not exactly jumping for joy for this buffet.  the presentation was <mark>Uni</mark> and fun, but after closer inspection, a lot of it looked stagnant and sitting there too long.  if i did end up trying it, it was just average in flavor.\n\neaten:\n- stir fried veggies and beef - meh...\n- steam bao and pork  - interesting.  it was like a banh mi flavored bao.\n- deep fried breaded chicken wings - crunchy. tasty.\n- spicy sausage - this was juicy and spicy.  \n- fresh carved bacon - juicy and fatty.\n- pork belly fried rice - pork belly in general makes me jump for joy.  this was joyless.\n- truffle infused potatoes - truffle is another jump for joy item, but could barely taste any essence of truffle.\n- berry cheesecake gelato - no cheesecake flavor.  it was like vanilla icecream with berry swirled in.\n- chocolate mousse mini waffle cone with white chocolate sphere - meh....\n\nconsidered but chosen not to eat due to poor looking texture:\nsoggy looking sticky buns, red velvet pancakes, french toast.  coagulated eggs benedict as well as other sauce looking items.\n\nshould have tried but had no more room:\nmade to order omelets\n\nconclusion:\ninspirational presentation without the matching inspirational average flavors and textures. though i would have thought that prime time brunch at 10:30 am would have presented with the best and the freshest food around, it was definitely not the case for a lot of items here.  i shied away from several items because they looked like they have been sitting there for a while (i.e. sauce coagulating).  it was good for a first experience at a new buffet, but it may be my last as well.", 
            "i was very sad to learn that there was no mac and cheese bar at lunch... however, this place gets 4 stars for:\n\n1. damn good korean bbq!!!!\n2. really really good desserts\n3. beautiful presentation\n4. <mark>Uni</mark> dishes for a vegas buffet\n\nbut i think i'd prefer coming for dinner next time.  the dishes seem more impressive in  way that would be worth the 5 or whatever more dollars you pay.",

(sorry, this salad didn't have a label) but hands down, this was the highlight of my meal! i regret not getting another one :(\n-asiago stuffed gnocchi with spring vegetables in a brown butter sage sauce. so rich, so filling, so delish!\n-cauliflower gratin. i don't even like cauliflower but this was amazing.\n-roasted mushroom polenta. smooth and full of flavor.\n-salty peanut gelato. this is a must-have! it tasted like a snickers bar :) \n\nsadly, there were some misses too:\n-mini eggs benedict. looked downright adorable in its little container but the poached egg just wasn't cooked properly. too runny for my liking & i found an egg shell in it :(\n-slab bacon. i didn't dig the loads of fat on this one.\n-breakfast items such as sausage, hash browns & bacon. i've had better. \n-french macarons. yes, i was very excited to see macarons at a buffet! yes, i was severely let down as well.\n\noverall, this buffet is definitely worth checking out. the downfall to the individual dishes is that i just didn't have room to try everything i wanted to because i filled up so fast! share your dishes & choose wisely, my friends :)\n\nsome extra tips:\n-service was great.\n-the dessert section was <mark>Uni</mark> (except for the gelato!) the wynn & m buffet totally got wicked spoon beat on desserts.\n-don't leave without tasting that amazing burrata salad! you won't regret it :d\n-wide variety of food with high-quality, gourmet ingredients. i would say this is a notch above m buffet, but still not as good as the wynn buffet.",

            "first of all, this place appears to be a step child of cosmopolitan. if you enter through front door, there is no sign whatsoever on where the buffer is. you have to ask around and they will tell you it is all the way in the back.\n\nthe buffet located all the way in the back passing all the banquet rooms. it looks like they neve planned a buffet until they figured out they have too many banquet rooms.\n\nthe place is nice and the price is not too bad. but the food? errrh, 1-star the most!\n\ni have to agree with many reviewer here that most food is not hot, but at room temprature at best. this includes primb rib and soup. the bone marrow (i guess that's what makes them <mark>Uni</mark>) is horrible. imagine a pile of fat with no taste at room temprature. \n\nwhile putting food in single serving container to discourage waste is a fantastic idea, it also makes the food looking dry and ugly for non popular dishes. unfortunated many dishes are like that. saw a dish with onion over a totally black cube. it turned out to be blackened cod. on the oriental secton there is thai green curry over noodle. how could that go wrong? you buy some green curry and put it over the noodle! guess what? their green curry is so green and it makes you think of green paint.\n\nover all, i am totally disappointed  with their hot dishes. nothing is good.\n\non the bright spot, their cold section and dessert bar are fantastic. the cold section seems fansy and clean, featuring interesting dishes. their dessert bar, while not big, is filled with pretty nice stuff.\n\ni would prefer ballagio buffer (next door) over this one any time of the day.",

            "heard and read a lot of good things about this new buffet at the cosmo so i was looking forward to finally trying it. this place gets an extra star for it being only 29 bucks for dinner which is a lot cheaper than what you'd think it'd be with other buffets going for 50 a head. this place is very <mark>Uni</mark> as far as buffets go in that the food is portioned out into little trays, to-go boxes, and pots. it's a very clever idea so that there isn't as much food wasted. the food here isn't as fancy as some of the other big buffets but there is still a lot to choose from which was very tasty. they have all types of foods from asia, to italy, to french. one of my favorite plates was the truffle potatoes which was full of flavor and delicious. the desserts here are also a highlight as they have their own gelato area which has over 10 flavors. overall, i had a good experience eating here and had lots of good food all for a very good price.", 
            "this is definitely not your run of the mill vegas buffet.  you can certainly eat till your belly bursts since this is the primary appeal to these establishments.  everytime i frequent a buffet, it always feels like a mad rush to get to every station to pile on as much as your plate can carry.  this place is not like that.\n\nwicked spoon is more of a sit-down enjoy the full experience type of restaurant.  it has a very modern, contemporary decor with high ceilings, sleek seating, simple yet elegant table settings and very well presented food offerings.  the buffet offers tapas style servings so you don't have to feel like a pig everytime you walk back to your table.  compared to other buffets the food itself doesn't seem like everything's poached in butter.  a lot of <mark>Uni</mark> spins on regular buffet offerings you can tell they put a lot of thought and effort into preparing these dishes.  service is attentive as the wait staff just doesn't check back to make sure you need another re-fill on your drink but your feedback on the food as well.\n\nunlike bellagio ($50/person), the price didn't kill us either.  $29 for lunch, an extra $5 for unlimited mimosas which i definitely would have taken advantage of if our flight wasn't in a couple hours.  oh well, in due time...wicked spoon, i'll be back!!", 
            "for the price paid, i expect perfection. it was very good, but there were a few <mark>Uni</mark> dishes. \n\non the bright side, their dessert bar is highly extensive. i filled up 2 plates with sweet treats. too bad most of them were a bit too tart for my taste. if you have tree nut allergies, keep it safe and grab some gelato instead (it was excellent! flavorful and creamy). the dry treats might have traces of tree nuts.\n\ni will remember wicked spoon buffet as the place where i ate bone marrow. to my surprise, it was pretty good. you just have to add some salt, there isn't much flavor. the texture was interesting though, but better eaten on crunchy bread. it reminded me of eating steak tartare with its soft kind of slimy texture. definitely needs to be eaten with something rough and dry to contrast. \n\nthe corn was delicious, as well as the shrimp cocktail. double yum! the fish with lemon sauce was a bit plain. the stuffing and potato were both too salty, and the meatball was ok.  \n\ni would come back, but make sure i have someone pay for my meal next time around.", 
            "served in mini dishes and totally worth the $$! <mark>Uni</mark>, high quality foods!", 
            "i am not a buffet person, but love wicked spoon.  the quality and presentation of the food is unlike any other vegas buffets i have seen, and the menu options also seem very <mark>Uni</mark>.  i have eaten here for dinner at least twice a month with visiting friends over the past few months - perfect for a quicker dinner with a group of people with varied tastes.\n\ntop dishes i would recommend:\n- starters: ceviche, beet salad\n- main courses: cavatelli pasta with short ribs\n- side dishes: summer succotash, cauliflower puree, polenta with sauteed mushrooms/artichokes\n\ndishes that didn't blow me away:\n- most of the cooked fish (e.g., salmon, cod) - looks good, but tastes bland\n- meatball thing.  i thought this was violently disgusting, but i got over it (the perk of buffets where waste is not a big deal...)\n\nonly lasting complaint is that service has been very slow and negligent, especially when i've been part of large parties with automatic gratuity.", 
            "buffet inside the cosmopolitan?  check.  \n\nwicked spoon is slightly different from your usual buffet.  many of the items are actually served as if you are dining at a tapas or small plates restaurant.  curry in tiny metal pots, fried chicken in small baskets, and pastor tacos on small square plates are just some of the items served this way.  \n\nit's a pretty <mark>Uni</mark> concept for a buffet, and it certainly helps eliminate some of the mess some of these items can create.  when's the last time you saw a clean tacos station at buffet place?  here, it is all prepared for you and all you have to do is add the condiments.    it's also a good way to \"portion control.\"  the small plates prevents going overboard and it prevents them on making a buttload of food, except... i can only imagine how high the water bill is to wash all them plates.\n\nmostly americanized versions of food from around the world.  asian, french, italian, and mexican are some of the easy ones to spot.  everything's fairly solid and not bad, but i do have to say the asian selections is probably the weakest: korean bbq rib tasted a little off to me and the thai curry is bland. the pastor tacos mentioned earlier is prob my favorite out of the ethnic food group.   \n\nthere's also a carving station, with prime rib and the bbq ribs as the standout.  i'm particularly fond of the fried chicken.  it's nothing crazy but i love using the chimichurri sauce with it.  there's a meatball in marinara and goat cheese that i'm a fan of as well.\n\nthe desserts are probably my favorite.  love the gelato here, especially the mango and lemon pomegranate.  the manga tasted like those asian mangos and the lemon pomegranateis just tart enough.  there's also a lot of chocolate covered items such as marshmallow and strawberries.  however, i was extremely disappointed that on my 2nd visit to wicked spoon, they didn't have the macaroons, cause them macaroon shells were bomb.\n\ndefinitely need to try the dinner next time since both times i've been here, it was for the champagne brunch.  the champagne brunch is a good deal since the price different is only $7 from the regular brunch price.  both times also came on a sunday and never really had to wait that long, but still suggest to come early!", 
            "i totally dig the vibe of this place and i would recommend trying it at least once if you hit up vegas.  why?? because it's just so <mark>Uni</mark>, unlike any other buffet.  personally i'm not a huge fan of buffets because i quite frankly cant justify paying $30 for myself to eat one meal.  i have a small appetite and always feel like i never really eat my money's worth.  however, i really enjoyed my experience here.  aside from being super new and clean, i really enjoyed all the different fusions of flavor here.  some highlights include their truffle potatoes, their endless dessert area, the creamed corn, their mac and cheese station, and their prime rib.  everything came out in pretty large portions and in cute little handling trays.  i felt a little guilty for just trying a few bites of each item and tossing it but i really didn't want to waste my stomach space on just a couple items.  \ni wouldn't be as opposed to come back to this buffet when compared to other buffets i've tried in vegas (paris, bellagio, aria, ti).  maybe it's because i refuse to dish out any more than $30 for a buffet but still, i would definitely suggest coming to this buffet above all others so far - best bang for your buck.", 
            "we tried to be sly and show up between lunch and dinner to \"double dip.\" however, they actually shut down the boofet at 3 and reopen at 5. bastards! dinner came out to $44.14 ($35 + tax + mandatory gratuity), quite the violation.\n\nthe selection at ws was smaller than bellagio/wynn. however, food presentation and choices were quite <mark>Uni</mark>. i especially liked the concept of a mac n cheese bar. the lady in front of me kept trying to order an omelet. haha. it would have been waaay better if there was bacon, lobster, crab, and more cheeses to choose from.\n\nthe problem with vegas buffets is everything looks great, but tastes just ok. ws was no exception. i find the made to order items usually taste better.\n\ni really enjoyed the dessert here. the mountain of chocolate strawberries were bomb. loved the bowl of berries and gelato. i also devoured a very delicious chocolate chip cookie. soft, chewy, with huge chunks of chocolate swirls inside. i'd pay $5 to eat that cookie again.", 
            "we have been here twice and both times...all the selections are different. to me, that was good and bad. good because it changes the menu up a little, giving you an opport<mark>Uni</mark> to try something new. bad because all the dishes i loved were not there anymore =(\n\nthis last time we went, which was in the middle of july, they had chicken and mashed potatoes....not just any mashed potatoes...it was green chili mashed potatoes, so yummy! i wanted to eat more of it, but didnt want to be so full right away.\n\nanyways, i will be back. next time i want to try their brunch. hopefully it will impress me.", 
            "this may be a buffet for folks who, like my hubby and me, dislike buffets - for the excess they encourage, for the wasted food, for the lines and carnivore centric formats. this may be a buffet for folks who prefer small plates formats and who like to have interesting vegetarian, even vegan, options in the mix. \n\nwhat we found when we tried wicked spoon during a june trip to las vegas, was it worked for us for a one time stop. whether we'll go back or not on another visit, can't say because overall there are things about buffets that give us heartburn, no matter how good the quality of the food. (if you want to know what that is, jump to end of review.) \n\nbut we're glad we tried wicked spoon once to see what all the buzz was about. overall we think it lived up to its yelp billing. here's our summary assessment. \n\nservice: 5 \nambiance (as buffets go): 5 \nfood (as buffets go): 4 \nvalue (as the las vegas strip goes): 4 \n\nhere's what we enjoyed when we went for brunch on a weekday. (breakfast / brunch / lunch format goes from morning opening to sometime in later afternoon when it transitions to dinner.) \n\nservice: ultra friendly, as with almost all service in the cosmopolitan. top notch. from check in to purchase your pass to seating at the table, to the folks at the food stations. \n\nambiance: not your normal buffet setting for seating ambiance. see photos. in particular when in the cosmopolitan anywhere in the facility look up! the lighting fixtures are diverse and interesting throughout. including here. \n\nvalue: the cost is higher than many others in las vegas. for those who want to chow down on the $14.99 breakfast buffet at flamingo (where our relatives were on this morning), the idea of $22 and change (brunch / $30+ for dinner) for a buffet at the cosmopolitan may seem too much to consider. from our view, you get what you pay for in food quality and options. \n\nlimited crowds if you time it right: there was a good sized line on the monday morning when we first went. so we skipped it and went back at about 10:30 am on tuesday and walked right in. our advice - time it to skip the lines...because if they're not there at check in, they won't be there for the food service either! \n\n<mark>Uni</mark> food: as much as this has small plate formats for some of the items, served in little covered casseroles, there are also open service bins for some things. but somehow the quantities in them suggest fresher food and less \"come on up to the trough to gorge yourself\" consumption. there is also a large carving station for those who enjoy roasted meat proteins. on the morning of our visit it seemed to include things like ham, pork belly, prime rib and so on. \n\nthe set up for the various food stations was as if visiting different continents or countries. \n\nthere were standard offerings too, like pancakes and omelets for the breakfast service, but we leaned to the unusual, which is our tendency. \n\nthings we tried and enjoyed were... \n...spicy tofu with red curry vegetables from the asian / se asian section, \n...creamy polenta with wild mushrooms from the italian / mediterranean section, \n...the very best item of the day, a cauliflower puree with clementines and roasted cauliflower on top (we had seconds!),\n...plump medjool dates with feta, \n...refreshing watermelon salad with cilantro and cucumber.\n...wicked good watermelon gazpacho,\n...beautiful fresh raspberries and blueberries. \n\nthe dessert bar, which was huge, included hundreds of petite sized pastries and also a gelato station. this was the disappointment for us. although we liked the tiny sizes (like 2\" for pastries and maybe 2  oz for containers of panna cotta) the flavors in the fruit tart,  the meyer lemon panna cotta and lavender macaron we tried weren't stellar. \n\nbeverages: too funny that the brunch service is offered with a complimentary mimosa, glass of champagne, or bloody mary but one has to pay for coffee. (pretty decent coffee it is too.) \n\nwhy buffets give us indigestion: even at buffets like this, formatted to encourage reasonable consumption, some folks just can't break themselves of the practice of heaping plates with food and leaving half behind to go get another heaping plate to leave half behind. different strokes for different folks, but this is why buffets, even pretty good ones like this, tend not to be our thing. i'd like to hand out a copy of mr. bloom's book: american wasteland: how america throws away nearly half of its food... wet blanket that i am.", 
            "i ate way more than i should have at this buffet, which is in part a testimate to the delicious food.  there are many selections and many items <mark>Uni</mark> to to this buffet.  duck, bone marrow, numerous fish and seafood dishes really add to the classy feel.  wicked spoon has all the makings of a great buffet at a reasonable price.  i really liked the amount of dishes that were individually plated.  i'm sure it is much more work for the staff, but it gave the meal a much more restaurant feel.  the visual appeal of small composed dishes was much better than the usual \"food mountain\" i usually end up with at buffets.  i do have to mention, however, that for my money the buffet at the m resort is still the best for my money.  great food preperation and selection and of course free unlimited beer and wine.  can't beat that.", 
            "i am glad i don't go to las vegas much....it would be even fatter!\n\nwe wend for brunch (11am) and got right in.  food was incredible.  it seemed that every dish was <mark>Uni</mark> made to order, not old bulky buffet food, but small tasty dishes.  desserts were dainty so you could have several and not fill up!  \n\nso far, my favorite in lv.", 
            "i'll be honest, this place scares me.\n\nit scares me enough to be reluctant to return to vegas, a city that i love.\n\nit scares me because if i return i'll probably eat til i burst...or literally die.\n\ni haven't eaten at a buffet, much less a vegas buffet in years and after a while, no matter how much you dress or class them up, they all seem the same; mass produced, cookie cutter-food meant to feed the gluttonies of an overweight, diabetes-ridden america.  so when friends of mine who i consider to have serious culinary tastes started to rave about this new buffet in vegas' cosmopoliton resort, i had to be skeptical.\n\ni mean, c'mon, can any buffet really be that good?\n\nso on my recent trip to vegas i went with a large group for dinner and with all the hype, i went in with a pretty open mind.  yes the entrance and decor is flashy and fancy as fitting for the new flagship casino/resort on the vegas strip.  ok cool, but what about the food?\n\nit only took me a few minutes of browsing the buffet aisles to realize what the noise was all about.  while some dishes are still served in large 'serve yourself' dishes and pans, the majority of the buffet items are presented in a tapas, small-plates style.  everything from the salad bar, to seafood, to asian dishes were presented in individual dishes and tins which one, looks better and two, encourages portion control so you can avoid overloading on one dish and finding yourself running out of space for others.  i was like a kid in a toys r us store at christmas holding a blank check given by my parents.  basically i was paralyzed with endless choice and didn't know where to start.\n\nsome highlights:\n\nthe mac & cheese station - like an omelette station, you pick your noodles, cheese and fillings and the cook will make your own custom style mac & cheese with results for better or worse and i tried a swiss-gruyere combo with vegetables thrown in for color.\n\ncarvery - aside from the usual roast chicken and prime rib, they also had roast lamb and *gasp* beef bone marrow!  \n\ndessert - full gelato bar and and array of colorful and cool looking premade desserts.\n\nbest of all, this buffet ran $40 for dinner, no more expensive than any of the other top level buffets on the vegas strip.  $12 all-you-can-eat sirloin dinner at the golden nugget this is not, but i wouldn't even compare the two.\n\ni may or may not be back depending how much i want to p<mark>Uni</mark> my stomach again.", 
            "so disappointed by wicked spoon!  i was reading all the raving reviews and drooling over the pictures for weeks before my trip to lv.  boy, was i in for a sad surprise when i came here on friday.  \n\nmy friends and i each paid nearly $40 for dinner and were promptly seated at a booth.  i would recommend that you sit at a table instead for easy in-and-out privileges.  ugh, we had quite a time getting up and scooting around for each other.\n\nanyway, the food was old.  seriously, a majority of the dishes that had sauce on them already had an ugly, old, crusty or filmy look and texture around 6:30pm.  that should be like the prime time for dinner, but they didn't put out fresh food for the longest time.  i get that sometimes business is slow, but if you keep leaving gross looking food out, who will want to eat it?  it's just a never-ending cycle, you know?\n\ni was super <mark>Uni</mark> with the variety of the evening.  a lot of the good food i saw on the yelp albums were not available and nearly everything i ate was super buttery.  i like butter as much as the next person, but shouldn't there be a variety!?\n\nalso, for some reason the food made 3/4 of my girlfriends ill for the rest of the night.  not.  cool.  we came to vegas to stuff our faces, not to cleanse our colons!\n\nin terms of parking, try to park on the west side of the lot.  we parked on the east side and had to walk about 5 minutes to the buffet.  this is not an issue for me, but it's fair warning for those who are lazy or are with people with mobility issues.", 
            "the best buffet i've ever been to hands down! the presentation is gorgeous and the service is really nice. they're <mark>Uni</mark> in their individual portions, which is convenient but my mom pointed out, what if you want less than the pre set amount? i'm not sure, just a side note. nothing major :) they offer water either as still or sparkling in pretty, self serve bottles. their dessert bar is off the chain. looks like something from the willy wonka movie in presentation. i ended up getting this strawberry cheesecake cup with really good pink meringue on top but only liked the meringue. i restrained from picking the yummy pink rolls off of everyone. also, didn't try to the mac and cheese bar, but it seems to be the highlight of the buffet for many.  someone else mentioned the chocolate chip cookies and how they'd pay $5 just to eat one again. i read reviews before we went and had to try the chocolate chip cookies first. he's right! i'd pay $5. cookie corner ain't got nothing on it. try wicked spoon, to me it's awesome, i mean theres lots of buffets in las vegas to get your gluttony on which are fabulous (bellagio, mgm, wynn) but for quality it can't be beat.", 
            "amazing! my sisters and i came here after the spa, and loved every second of our experience. the food is better quality than any buffet food i have experienced, and the choices are nearly endless. this buffet goes well beyond sausage and eggs, pancakes, and prime rib, to include such things as watermelon gazpacho, blt salad, salmon pizza, sushi, truffle potatoes au gratin, asiago-stuffed gnocci, tacos al pastor, and chicken salad sliders. really delicious, <mark>Uni</mark>, and gourmet food.\n\nand the desserts are out of world, and gorgeous, with the same vast selection and attention to detail as the rest of the dishes.", 
            "finally a vegas buffet that gives bellagio's a run for its money. <mark>Uni</mark> presentation that encourages trying new things. truly creative dishes. focus on quality, not quantity. very attentive staff. totally worth the $40.", 
            "this place is so <mark>Uni</mark> from the other buffets in vegas! the food they serve here sort of reminds me of tapas-style, since the dishes are already portioned for you. for example, the lamb meatballs were served in a tiny pot that you could bring back to your table! they had something from each type of cuisine, but what i remember having was korean short ribs, sushi, compressed melon salad, prime rib, crab legs and much more. \n\nthe dessert area was so pretty; our group ended up taking pictures of it! they had chocolate covered strawberries, gelato, and various types of tarts, fudge, etc.\n\ndinner is reasonably priced at $35. this is definitely a place to try at least once!", 
            "i came here after hearing all the rants and ravings to this buffet. i usually don't like buffets at vegas, but it's new and cute and my bff and i just had to try it.\n\nwe paid and got seated before the rush around 6:20pm. everything in here is so cue and <mark>Uni</mark>. most of the dishes were served in tiny pots and pans. the portions were a bit small, but it's an all-you-can-eat place! just get more if you want!\n\ni felt there were a lot of vegetarian dishes... a bit on the healthier and bland side. meat was sparse, so if you're a meat lover, i suggest you stick with bellagio or wynn buffet. there were these interesting smoothie shots with vegetables, honey, and fruit blended into a small cup. another one was a watermelon + vinegrette smoothie? eh, i tried it anyways because i was curious. not too bad. my fave dish had to be the ceviche (as usual), korean short ribs (kalbi!) and their bacon ranch salad. i was super disappointed at how small the crab legs were. \n\nhonorable mentions go to their dessert bar. freshly dipped chocolate oreo strawberries (i had 6 and still wanted more), gelato, a variety of cookies, mousse, and cakes! \n\n\nfor $35/person, this is actually one of the more affordable buffets in a 5-star resort. bellagio and wynn has upped their prices to roughly $47-$50 for dinner!!", 
            "what a wicked and <mark>Uni</mark> way to serve upscale buffet food? creamed corn with jalapenos and bacon in their own teeny, tiny pots... chicken masala with rice in play house sized pots... this place is just too cute! all the dishes look picture perfect, but i wished the taste of the foods matched up a bit more to their appearance. it was definitely an experience, i mean they had bone marrow!!! they had so many exotic dishes.. i can't really pin point what makes me give this place 3 stars.... \n\npros: excellent customer service, very clean atmosphere, love the single plated dishes because you know you are the first person to touch it with a utensil, <mark>Uni</mark> desserts you would only find here like the various strawberries covered in delicious sugary confections\n\ncons: as tasty the foods were listed and described, it was just okay... thats all! \n\nafter reading all the reviews it seems as if we came in here with high expectations... because it is cosmo with high end chefs creating new, inventive gourmet foods. i'll be back for round 2, but i hope it will have improved!", 
            "our first visit to the buffet was for saturday brunch and we definitely left full, but was not that impressed =/\n\nhaving the food in small single serving size is cute but you can't fit much on your plate! i found myself walking back and forth not knowing what to eat. some stuff just looked too dry and overcooked. however, the prime rib, chorizo sausage, and salmon was delish. the dessert bar was just alright and not enough fruits for me to end my meal!\n\nthe buffet concept was <mark>Uni</mark> but overall just an average place. the wynn's brunch by far is still #1 on our list :)",

            "i went here in july with my sister and her friends. i'm not a big fan of buffets, but this place was able to pull it off. :)\n\ntheir breakfast foods were my favorite. eggs benedict? at a buffet? yesss, please! the mac and cheese were yummy too. i remember the ethnic foods (chinese) being very salty... and sadly, i don't remember having a good dessert... i just remember how <mark>Uni</mark> they were and grabbing one of everything. heehee.  \n\ni loved the way they had the buffet foods set up. quick and easy access... what's better than that? instead of scooping, picking, and spilling the food you're about to pick out, they already have the portions already set up for you. they are pretty big portions, but hey, who's complaining? ;)", 
            "i moved away from vegas buffets years ago but occasionally for one reason or another i end up at one.\n\ni kept hearing how amazing this place was when it first opened....and how it's not nearly as good now.\n\nthese buffets are never as good the second time around...and people love to talk about the \"good old days\" since it gives them that i'm better then you feeling.\n\nhonestly, think about it.  every time someone regales you with tales of \"back in the days\" and them \"old school days.\"  what they are really saying is i did x when x was still amazing...and you can never do the same cool things i did because x sucks now.  o.o \n\nanyways, back to the buffet.   it was pretty good, and given my current view of buffets i'd say wicked spoon is up there with the bellagio and wynn buffet.   i can probably go to any one of those three buffets and be equally \"satisfied.\"\n\nthe cool thing about wicked spoon are the small individual portions served in metal saucepan type containers.   they have some more <mark>Uni</mark> dishes like gnocchi with asiago cheese,  kalmato olive oil cod, and green curry clams with basil.\n\nat the end of the day this place delivers what i expect from a ~35 dollar buffet in vegas\n\nsome type of crab legs, a carving station with prime rib, a decent selection of fish/seafood dishes, and sushi that doesn't suck too bad", 
            "a <mark>Uni</mark> buffet to correlate cosmopolitan's personality. the style is suitable for urban foodies to get a break from traditional boring crab legs experience. all done via small plates and each item is constructed with quality and thought. we went for the weekend brunch ($30). next time i'm in vegas, i'm putting my money here.", 
            "i'm in love with this buffet.  i used to have a serious relationship with the wynn buffet, but now wicked spoon has seduced me.\n\nthe usual motive for a buffet is eating until you can't move anymore, and getting your money's worth by stuffing yourself.  however, i look more for the quality versus quantity, and this buffet really does hit the spot.  no, this buffet doesn't have the most types of food available, but it sure does have tasty options and everything is beautifully presented. \n\nmy favorite highlights:\n-fried chicken, which came in individual fryer baskets\n-creamy polenta, in individual mini pot. so good. i couldn't believe how great it was for a buffet.\n-sushi was surprisingly good. not nobu, but for a buffet it was pretty damn good.\n-tri-tip (and all other meats) - amazing. if you were to stock up on a food, i'd suggest getting a few cuts of these!!! very juicy, again very surprising for a buffet. good quality meat.\n-vietnamese sandwich - skip. bread was soggy which threw off the whole sandwich.  definitely not worth space in your precious stomach.\n-brown rice & cranberries - so delicious. not the best but definitely up there!\n-chocolate covered strawberries. a noob to las vegas buffets. i was in shock and heaven when i saw these. \n-<mark>Uni</mark> flavored ice cream, including almond joy. delicious.\n\n****important announcement: complimentary mimosa upon request!!!!!!!!!!\n\nwill be returning during my next visit to vegas!", 
            "the wicked spoon was wicked good!\n\ni took a few moments to read some of the recent reviews and i am shocked!  i can only speak for the sunday brunch but it was the best brunch buffet to ever hit these lips!!!    \n\nfrom the moment you walk into this building you feel like you have entered a scene from sex and the city.  it is definitely shabby chic!  not my particular style but i loved the energy and attention to detail this place has.  someone said they got lost getting to the restaurant.  hmmmm, i don't want to say they are stupid but they have these little signs that direct you right to it....lol  it is down an unassuming hallway that leads you past the hotel room elevators.  one can reasonably assume that the target audience for this restaurant is guests first.  rightfully so in my opinion.\n\npeople complaining about price....really?  this is vegas people!  sure it is expensive but i can honestly say it was worth every dime.  if you want a cheap but okay buffet, head to the rio.  this is an upscale place and the food was more single serving than buffet quality.  there are plenty of cheap buffets but i assure you that you will get what you pay for.  btw, prime rib is being used as a test to see if a buffet is good?  when did the worst cut of beef become the standard?????...lol  every time i read a review that mentions prime rib i stop reading.  they obviously don't know quality food if that is their biggest topic to discuss.\n\nthe food.....i was in heaven!  individual servings of all you can eat food is not a negative thing.  it is a gift from god!  the temperature and quality are way easier to control and it cuts down on waste.  again, lots of non restaurant people talking smack about things they have no knowledge about.  tons of different options and tons of <mark>Uni</mark> food choices to try.  you want to judge a buffet?  do it by the quality of their bacon!  this place has the thickest, tastiest bacon of any buffet i have ever been too.  for goodness <mark>Sake</mark>, they even had slab bacon they would cut fresh for you!!!!  omelett and egg station prepared any way you want it.  fresh pecan french toast and pancakes.  really?  if it were socially acceptable, i would have just eaten right off the serving dishes!\n\ndessert station.  okay, lots of smaller desserts and most were delicious.  there were so many options that i wished i hadn't eaten that third helping of bacon so i could fit more in.  if you want their best dessert tho, hit up the gelato station first.  their best flavor is the salted peanut.  it was awesome!\n\ni will be back but next time i am wearing sweat pants!!!!!!!!!!",

            "holy amazing batman!\nmy husband and i got married in las vegas and wanted something nice but affordable to eat for our dinner. buffet style seemed to be the only way to go for 30+ picky eaters and chefs. we were a little put off by the size of the line when we arrived but what could we expect for not making reservations. once we got towards the front of the line and they realized we were still decked out in wedding gear and we were immediately greeted by the restaurant manager and shots! they even took the time to open another cashier station so that our guest were able to pay for their own means instead of 1 large messy check. \nwe had no intentions of all sitting together since again we had no reservations and we were a large party, but somehow they worked their magic and had us all seated in 1 large area. \nthe food was outstanding. my husband is a chef, so pleasing him and 10 of his closest chef buddies is a hard task and yet everyone seemed to really enjoy all of the offerings. i did not quite make it to my favorite area (the dessert station) because i filled up on so much great food, but everyone that did eat dessert assured me that i missed out. \ni will eat here every opport<mark>Uni</mark> that i have, and still get calls from friends asking what restaurant we ate at for the next time they visit vegas.\nlove love love the wicked spoon!", 
            "let's start with the name. it's trying way too hard. wicked spoon? at the cosmopolitan? trying tooooo hard. like, whatever (that's what i imagine people who read cosmopolitan to say at least fourteen times per hour).\n\nafter waiting in line for over an hour (after being told that this is, by far, the best buffet in vegas), we finally got seated. i was a bit annoyed, because i noticed that there were a ton of tables, cleaned off and ready to go, but they still weren't seating parties. methinks this is some kind of cheap attempt to make people wait a really long time so that they run out of buffet time and have to leave early in order to follow through on their other plans. \n\nstill, buffet's a buffet and i can't expect some perfectly-tailored experience... but i don't think it's too much to expect really good food. some of the stuff was pretty good. and by \"some of the stuff\", i mean just the mac and cheese and the sausage. everything else? about what you'd expect at any other buffet. <mark>Uni</mark> \"asian\" dishes, decent desserts, downright nasty pork and turkey options, and various filler pastas and breads that (of course) turned out to be the tastiest. \n\nis it worth the $30/person you pay at lunch? well, yes. service was friendly, the place was clean, and it didn't feel hectic and disgusting everywhere.  \n\nis it worth the $30 and the wait? no way. like, whatever.", 
            "new competitor to the wynn buffet???? \n\ni think so...\n\ni was a bit turned off with the long line as this is the new and trendy buffet at the moment.  the price was a bit on the steep end ($30). however, the long awaited came to an end and definitely enjoyed the various and large range of dish selections.\n\nthe chicken adobo was surprising close to home cooked filipino style chicken adobo atop of rice. chicken was unexpected not oily but moist and flavorful. the chilean sea bass was airy and light. the mac and cheese was absolutely simplistically delicious and cheesy. \n\none <mark>Uni</mark> thing of wicket spoon is their mini pots that holds some of their food.\n\nto end things on the greatest high note, the chocolate lava cake and top it with coffee gelato. \n\nour waiter who served our drinks seemed a bit slow and was not up to par on following up serving our table. the guy who scooped the gelato was pretty awesome and hilarious when he helps people out. \n\nthis buffet can definitely get you the run for your money if you choose the right foods. in this case, almost all the foods were served hot and fresh. \n\ndefinitely would hit this buffet when the trendy hype dies down a bit.", 
            "just like what everyone else is saying ... the dessert selection is presented in a very beautiful and <mark>Uni</mark> way ... i would def say they score very high on presentation. \n\ni came here for brunch on a saturday. we waited in a very long line but not as long as the line for lunch and dinner was. i would def come back here because i like the way they plated the food and portion control was just what i need! \n\ni remember there were a lot of fish dishes. i hope they expand on their dim sum selection because i was very disappointed. overall, a pleasing experience! i would come here again to try the lunch buffet.", 
            "with the money spent on the new cosmopolitan, i expected nothing by <mark>Uni</mark> and greatness from their hip named wicked spoon buffet.\nto set the mood.......dissapointment\ni am a foodie! trained chef yada yada yada. i love great food and dont mind paying for it.\nfirst is the decieving waiting line. its not the real line, its just the line to pay and then go stand in line, wait time at lunch about 40 minutes, play on your smartphone.\nnow the food. their niche apparently is to serve most everthing in cute little one portion varying vesself from porcelain cups, plastic cups, little metal pots, skewers etc. but they give you at best a 8inch square plate to put these 5 inche round cupped servings = you can only get about three of these tapas sized portions on the plate and are forced to put not cupped item around the cups and touching the sides. the whole thing weighs about 4 lbs on your way back to the table and contains about 8 ounces of food. the shrimp items were delicious and actually tasted like shrimp and you did not have to peel the shells. very few vegetables. i repeat very few. all of the fish was set out in this portion concept and i nearly choked from their dryness and overcooked status. pizza right out of the wood fired oven is great, but when it sits out one lonlely slice under heat lamps you get it, dried out. the good. salads were excellent and unusual, great little shrimp cocktails, mashed potatoes, sake turkey roast, hand carved country bacon, sushi very plain but decent, lots of food turnover on popular items, but the not so popular items sit, and sit.\ndesert area is very <mark>Uni</mark> with some real memorable items like giant white and dark covered strawberries that would go for about $3 each outside of the buffet. good cookies, but seriously are you going to this buffet for cookies? i did not try the dim sum, or any of the breads. the stinger is the buffet cost about $24 including one alcoholic beverage that you cannot opt out of. while the concept is <mark>Uni</mark> and you will probably not see another display of foods in this format, your appreciation of quality fine food will not permit you to return. in summary, novel concept, expensive for what you get, food choices limited compared to other vegas fine buffets, and fairly long wait time. too many trips of heavy plates full of tiny portions for $24 and i didnt want the bloody mary. since a bloody mary the same size in one of their bars cost $12 the buffet would be worth $12.\nparis, is superior food for about 30% less money.", 
            "$23 for the lunch buffet!\n\ni came with my friends and we waited in a lonnngggg line to get in. actually, the line wasn't all that long but the wait was! we were getting a little frustrated because there were obviously empty tables inside but they were just not filling them for some odd reason, and we were dying of thirst. we were so dehydrated and just wanted some water. so when we got towards the front, we complained to who i'm guessing was the manager because he was wearing a suit and dressed differently from the others, and he actually brought us cups of water to sip on while waiting in line! so nice of him! i really wasn't expecting that.\n\nas for the food, it was great! i actually liked the food better this time around more than my first trip here when i came for dinner. this time, they didn't have the bone marrow or crab legs, and only one kind of mac & cheese though... but everything i tried was delicious! i really liked the shrimp cocktail which comes in shotglasses with the cocktail sauce in them already. the tritip was pretty good too! i even loved the edamame because it had this addictive seasoning on it. this buffet is <mark>Uni</mark> because everything comes in small portions already and you can just grab the little plates to place on your tray. no scooping necessary, which is awesome.\n\ntheir gelato bar is so cute and a must try! the scoops and bowls are super mini so you don't feel so guilty trying all these different flavors. ;)", 
            "my favorite buffet in vegas!!\n\nthe line to get in may be long, but it moves at a decent pace if you go early enough. it's also quite a walk far into the hotel, wayyyy past marquee. their seating is <mark>Uni</mark>, with tables and then high-legged bar tables. they also organized their buffet in a very smart and easy way. \n\nloved the macaroni & cheese station- i got mine with mushrooms, tomatoes, and bacon, and i couldn't stop eating it. it's made personally for you so it's pipin hot and cheesy.\n\ntheir mashed potatoes are bomb, they're probably 70% butter, but who cares? \n\ni was seriously disappointed in their spaghetti though.. how can you mess that up?? the sauce was flavorless and their lamb meatballs were in dire need of salt. so sad. \n\ntheir asian food isn't bad, they have a sushi station where you can get hand rolls. i got spicy tuna (of course), and it was delish. their kalbi wasn't too shabby either! \n\ni love that almost everything was served in individual dishes. it seriously helps with portion control, plus it just makes everything seem more sanitary. it kinda sucks that their plates are small though, because those individual dishes take up so much room on it, and you can only get so much food at a time. \n\nalso, i love crabby legs at buffets, but the ones here were hit or miss. some of them were fresh and delicious, and some of them were an off-white, brownish color, flakey, and tasted old. tsk tsk. \n\nhowever, can we talk about their desserts? seriously, some of the most gorgeous desserts i've ever seen. they're all presented beautifully, in cute, small sizes to maximize the desserts you can try. my faves were the beignets (so light and delicious) and the chocolate cups with berries and chocolate pudding. yummmmmmmmm!! they have gelato too. amazing.\n\nwe used to frequent the wynn and mandalay bay's buffets, but now it's all about wicked spoon!", 
            "food:\nmost buffets in las vegas are very standard and unoriginal:  you got your same old slab of meats, salad bars, and desserts. at wicked spoon, every dish is <mark>Uni</mark> and attentive. i love how all the dishes come in little 5 in skillets or dishes. makes the experience that much more exciting. my favorite dish was probably the shrimp and grits. i also loved their wild mushroom risotto. my only complaint would be that their dessert bar can be a little better (i wish they had an array of french macarons). but i really do think that this is the most hip and modern buffet in vegas.\n\nambiance:  \ni went there on thanksgiving day at around 2:30pm. we only waited about an hour. by the time we were done eating, it was around 5:00pm, and the line was out the door, around the corner, and another corner, and another corner, and another corner. it looked like they were in for another 4 hour wait.\n\nservice:\nour server was extremely fast and accommodating.", 
            "i had such high hopes for wicked spoon being that it's located in the newest and most trendy hotel on the strip!  then again, a lot of that \"bling\" factor about the aria just transcends into wicked spoons...all looks, but that's all you've got goin for ya.\n\nthe cousins and i had dinner on a thursday night so, it was kind of slow.  it was $35.99 per person, which i thought was decently priced, but slightly lower than the buffets at the bellagio and wynn but, my expectations of the food quality were equal.\n\nwhile perusing the various stations of the buffet, the food looked flirtatiously delicious.  just about all of the food were all portioned as individual servings and presented in their own plates and bowls.  instead of dinner plates, they seriously should just have trays, so you can put all the items on, because you can barely fit four plates/bowls on one plate.  (on a side note, i'd hate to be a busser, server or the poor dishwasher!)\n\nthe food offerings were <mark>Uni</mark> as they offered chicken adobo, which had a latin and filipino influence, bone marrow which i had no clue how to eat, cooked to order mac and cheese.  i did like their salads and oh snap, who doesn't like freshly cooked beignets with dipping sauce?!  but overall, the food was just okay, but a far cry from being considered mind blowing.  again, the only positive about wicked spoon was the presentation, that's it.  i'm glad i got to try ws but, that's where it ends.  if i ever get dragged back, it's bs.\n\nthe bellagio buffet is still the winner, winner...chilean sea bass that'll melt in your mouth...dinner!",

( thank goodness for that).\n\nfor the regular carnivores the spread is fantastic. crab, wild boar, lamb and tons of delicious sides.\n\ntheir serving style is very <mark>Uni</mark> and nice. most dishes are served in their own single serving utensils which reduces the mess on your plate and at the table.\n\nlunch was about $30 and dinner was about $40. we arrived at the end of the queue at 2:30.. paid for it at 3:45 and were seated at 4:45.  dinner starts at 5 pm.\n\ngood choice for vegetarians.",

            "best buffet in vegas hands down... after having eaten at almost every buffet on the strip, this buffet is basically heaven for me!  the wynn buffet and m buffet used to be tied for first, but wicked spoon dominates!  they don't have all the typical things that any other buffet on the strip has, but the quality is so much higher, and the dishes they offer are definitely more <mark>Uni</mark>!!!\n\nthis is quite random, but i have to say the best thing i ate at the entire buffet is their mini pecan pies in the dessert section... it was so good i wanted to go back the next day and only eat that!  (of course i didn't...)  they also have the most amazing array of chocolate-covered strawberries!  it's divided into 3 sections of ones with peanuts, oreos, and heath bars.  they are so amazing my bf ate literally 35+ of them... kinda crazy and gross :) there are also chocolate covered pears!!!  \n\nalso they give you one complimentary mimosa, champagne, or bloody mary for the brunch meals!\n\nthere's a personal omelette bar that turns into a pasta bar at night i think... or maybe a salad bar... not sure!\n\ni love how everything is divided into tiny portions, so you feel like it's individualized for you.  also, it's perfect for me because i really just like to sample but not eat anything in particular, so they have a whole section of pastas put into miniture pots for you to try!  there's gnocchi, ravioli, polentas... it really helped my self control because i could share with my boyfriend without grabbing a bunch of food that looked good and just piling it only my plate and feeling to full too eat it in about 20 minutes.  \n\nanother thing i loved is the gelato bar!!!! it's so cool how there are really <mark>Uni</mark> flavors like pink grapefruit... the pistachio literally tasted like gelato i had in rome... unbelievable!!!  it also comes in these really tiny scoops, so you are basically just sampling each flavor... perfection.\n\ni am definitely ditching all other buffets in vegas and only coming to this one... it's just not worth stuffing yourself unless you are going to do it with wonderful food!!! and the price is extremely reasonable too... $22.99 for the brunch buffet!  if you're in vegas... go!!!!!",

            "don't have any other vegas buffets to compare this to, but this was good.  small but hearty portions of just about anything.\n\nmy favorite part of the meal?  the mac and cheese station.  looks like an omelette station but what you get it 10000x better.\n\nsome of the dishes i had:\ngnocchi in lamb ragu\nspaghetti and meatball\nrisotto with truffle oil\nhummus, tzatiki and pita chips\ncharcuterie\ncreamed corn with bacon\nchocolate covered strawberries\n\nthey have a gelato bar.  was i not totally stuffed i would have indulged.  did taste the mango gelato and it was great.  lots of other desserts too.\n\nthey have limited alcohol offerings - house red or white wines, few beers, and a few cocktail options.  i was <mark>Uni</mark> by the mojito.\n\na friend and i arrived a little after 6 on a saturday night and waited maybe 15-20 minutes.  not too bad.  the restaurant never really got super crowded inside so i wonder if they have the line to create demand.\n\nthe design of the place is really nice.  most dishes are served in tiny little pots.  adds a lot to the experience.", 
            "this place is pretty insane. i have been to heaps of las vegas buffets and this one is tops in my book.\n\ni signed up tor the players card because we were staying there and we recieved a free buffet in doing so. we also received resort credit for booking online, soooo that equaled two free buffets for my wife and i. we could have enjoyed this just as much at full price.\n\nas i hope you already know the cosmo's decor is eye candy. so walking through hotel to get to the buffet is an adventure in itself with many art installations to entertain you along the way. the buffet room itself is also very well decorated with tvs offering fun info about the foods you are eating. as we all know life is in the details and this is where the wicked spoon buffet shines. the vessel for coffee cream for example, is a small steel milk carton. this is just one of the many neat little containers that is used here. my wife loves these types of things. that is one way this place is different from most of it's kind. the dishes are already portioned into these cool little holders for you to just grab and bring back to your table. no messy trays to scoop out of, no taking too much, just enough to try and if you like get another one. plus it helps with your table neatness until the busboy arrives.\n\nthe food selections were both <mark>Uni</mark> and traditonal at the same time. crab legs were present, warm and deliciously served with drawn butter. there was a carving station with bone marrow, among other things. fried chicken in mini fryer baskets. spare ribs and miso soup and edamame. a mac and cheese bar replaces the omelet station for lunch. i could go on and on.\n\n\nthe desert area was huge. a solid ten flavors of house made gelato. every killer pastry under the sun. the largest chocolate covered strawberrys i have ever seen and marshmallows on a stick dipped in chocolate and rolled in butterfinger or something like that. pretty nice.\n\nthe service was on point. so bravo to the cosmo for this. just one more thing they are doing well in vegas. visit this place if you haven't already", 
            "i had heard great things about this buffet and given the limited lunch options at the cosmopolitan i decided to try this out.  i visited during a regular week day and i liked that they were still serving breakfast along with lunch items.  a <mark>Uni</mark> item this buffet had that i rarely see was kimchi and had a nice selections of asian cuisine, including asian slaw.  i loved the variety but the actual flavor wasn't anything outstanding, i had the ribs, orange chicken, asian slaw, and dumplings, and none of those were left on my plate but i wasn't inspired to go back for seconds.  what i did like most was that the service was great including a carafe of water available at the table and a bathroom location within the buffet.  i do like the decor and high ceilings since you can enjoy your food without having to smell everything combined at once.  i think i need to try this again perhaps for dinner in hopes of a more flavorful experience.", 
            "i wanted to try this buffet, but had decided not to based on the mixed reviews. then i won a complimentary buffet through spinning the wheel at the cosmopolitan. the husband didn't want to spend $22 to eat breakfast, so i went and ate there by myself the morning we were leaving, because hey, i'm not going to turn down free food at a place i kind of wanted to try.\n\ni got there at about 8:30am on a wednesday morning and there wasn't a line. i was promptly seated by a pleasant hostess, who said my server would be with me in a couple of minutes. i waited...and waited...and waited. finally she came back and said he would be a couple more minutes and would i like some coffee or orange juice? i said yes to the orange juice and she brought it back. i continued to wait for the server, as i wanted to order something else to drink. after about 5 more minutes of waiting, i got sick of it and decided to get some food. a few minutes after getting back to my seat, he finally came over to take my drink order. i believe the buffet was supposed to have included a glass of champagne, a mimosa, or bloody mary, but this was never offered to me, and i didn't see that on my receipt until the end of my meal. oh well.\n\nas for the food, some hits and some misses. there were some inventive/<mark>Uni</mark> items, which is always nice to see. they had some delicious chicken apple sausage, which i really enjoyed. i was so excited to see salted caramel pancakes, but they were not good at all, unfortunately. i had some gelato (yes, i know it was early, but it looked good), and it was delicious. also had a mini strawberry smoothie which was very refreshing. i had some other stuff too, but i don't remember what it was.\n\noverall, this buffet had some high points and low points...i didn't mind the lack of service too terribly since i didn't pay for the buffet, but i would have been pretty annoyed if i had. i am not sure if i would go back or not.", 
            "the wicked spoon has to be my favorite buffet in vegas.  it's an experience to go there and that's why i enjoy it so much.  i wanted so badly to give it 5 stars, but i could not due to just a few shortcomings.\n\nthe food:\n\nwicked spoon has some amazing selections.  their salad bar is top notch.  they always have quite a few selections.  everything tastes fresh and good.  they have the delicious staples of any high-priced vegas buffet, such a prime rib and crab legs.  both are delicious of course.  other highlights include the pork tostadas and any fish dishes they have.  although it wasn't out this time, i really enjoy their general tsao's chicken.\n\nthe mac and cheese station fails in that the mac and cheese oddly enough comes out too cheesy.  no one who got something at that station liked it.  unfortunately, i think they fail with many of their <mark>Uni</mark> and obscure dishes that you probably wouldn't find at other buffets.  they put out these dishes in hopes of being different and appeasing to different tastes.  unfortunately, the food is usually not too good.  and the fact that these dishes and rarely touched and pile up in the buffet line goes to show that not too many people are interested.  most of the unpopular dishes can be found in the italian/pasta area.  i would hope that they track the popularity of their dishes and adjust accordingly.    they could come up with tastier offerings.\n\nthe dessert:\n\ndelicious!  the cookies are great.  the chocolate-dipped strawberries are good as well.  although, i think they offer too many of the mini-cup desserts.  i'm sure those help them keep costs low, but they don't taste good.  \n\nthe drinks:\n\ni like that they leave the giant water bottles on the table and that they're cold.  they have a huge alcoholic beverage selection and also feature happy hours.\n\nthe service:\n\nlacking.  we had the 18% auto-grat added as we had a party of 11.  i'm totally cool with paying that, as it's the norm everywhere in the us.  unfortunately, the service did not match.  while our busser/server was pleasant, she rarely came by.  our dishes would stack up and non-water drinks would get empty.  i think i saw for our area of about 50 tables to the right of the dessert station, there were only 2 bussers/servers.  this was a saturday night and st. patrick's day.  they were way over worked.  the buffet was busy but did not have a line to get in, so maybe that's why they were a little understaffed.  that would not keep me from coming back.  i am a water drinker and don't mind the dishes piling up.\n\nthe price:\n\nfor $35, you get what you pay for.  i also liked the fact that they didn't jack up the price for st. patrick's day.  the m buffet was $50!  really?\n\noverall, i like this buffet a lot and would recommend everyone try it at least once.", 
            "there are so many reviews here!!! so i do believe that this is my favorite buffet so far, and it's because of the whimsical nature of the buffet. the food is <mark>Uni</mark>, and they are placed in cute individualized dishes: fried chicken in mini baskets, rissoto in mini pans, chow mein in to-go-boxes. i love how things are portion controlled so you don't scoop a ton onto your plate.  great options for dessert.  you don't come here for seafood sadly, stick to bellagio or rio.\n\ni came here for breakfast and dinner, yes it was a little much. here are the highlights of what i ate:\nbreakfast\n- bacon slab - oh damnnn\n- short rib benedict \n- pecan french toast \n- chocolate covered strawberries \n\ndinner\n- mac and cheese bar\n- truffle rissoto\n- bone marrow", 
            "after reading the reviews here on yelp we were pretty excited to try this buffet.  well it was a big disappointment.  if you only want something fancy to look at this place is for you.  many of the items are very <mark>Uni</mark> displayed in little pots, or basket.  otherwise, my advise is to skip it.  the food wasn't very good.  nothing was labeled, and there wasn't as many choices as most of the buffets on the strip.  the line for the omelet bar was about 20 minutes long.  they also had some breakfast taco, but no sour cream.", 
            "one of the most spectacular buffets you can ever experience, even by las vegas standards.\n\ni honestly don't think there was a dish that i didn't like, and i certainly tried to try them all.  some items were standard-fare that were delicious without any particular twist to them, like the korean bbq short-ribs, but that doesn't earn you the coveted 5th star, it really was the <mark>Uni</mark> items that did it for me.  items like the wicked mac-&-cheese and wicked fried chicken have a <mark>Uni</mark>, delicious twist to them. here's a tip: if you see something that is served on its own little special container, try it!\n\nand of course, the desserts, oh my god the desserts!!! a magical medley of tiny-portioned gourmet cakes, souffles, pastries, fudges, cookies, and if that isn't enough they've got like 12 different flavors of gelato.", 
            "the wicked spoon buffet is located in the far depths of the cosmopolitan hotel. could it be placed in a more remote location?! it's hard to compare this buffet to others, but i think it goes on the same caliber as the wynn buffet but i can't compare because they just do different cuisines and different things. \n\nthis buffet is a pricey penny at $35 for dinner when there is not that much seafood at all. dinner starts at 5pm and they close from 2pm to 5pm i believe. \n\nthe sushi sucks here, so don't expect much. it's true what other reviewers stated that they put most of their food items in individual bowls/plates/pots. so it's already portioned out individually which is good for not wasting. but at the same time, if you only want very little of it to try you can't do that either. i thought the food being placed in individual bowls and plates was a neat idea until i got there and 3 or 4 items takes up your entire plate! so you just have to make more trips but i guess that's good because it makes you really rethink if you really want the food item. \n\ntheir food is a different type of caliber and cuisine. there were items like bone marrow, gnocchi, couscous, lamb sliders, fish and chips with waffle fries, etc... the only seafood that i remember them having was skinny/short <mark>King Crab</mark> legs and mussels. i believe that was it? \n\nthe item that stole the show for me here at the wsb was the dessert section! i'm not a huge dessert person either but they had some very <mark>Uni</mark> items here like the almond joy gelato! mhmmm that was soo delicious! they had like 15 different flavors of gelato for your picking which was nice. \n\nthe service by the food staff was sparse, i hardly saw any of them behind the counters and i would have questions or there was no tongs for food. \n\ni'm deducting a star because of the price of the buffet, the food service and location of how far into cosmopolitan it is located. and also the food quality was either no taste or overcooked and we went a little after 5pm. a lot of the food items looked better than they tasted which is too bad. and there's hardly any seafood to warrant the price tag.", 
            "i heard so much about this place that i had to try it on my last vegas trip.  we went for sunday brunch and i opted to pay an extra $8 for unlimited mimosas.  while walking around to see what they have, i was a bit disappointed to see that they didn't have an crab legs, which is always a highlight for me when visiting vegas buffets.  however, they made up for the lack of crab legs with the delicious food served in cute little pans.  this was the most <mark>Uni</mark> buffet i have ever been to.  they served more gourmet type dishes that you wouldn't normally see.  my favorites were the butternut squash ravioli and the mac n cheese with sausage.  the waitress was pretty good about refilling my mimosa.  i would definitely come back.", 
            "love love love!!!!!!! \ni'm officially under the spell of the wicked spoon. i love the small portions and the whimsy of the mini pots and fryer baskets. it makes you not load up on a particular thing so you have room to enjoy the other things they've prepared. not your average buffet fare of crusty eggs, bacon, and packaged salad. the food is very <mark>Uni</mark> and ever changing, so if you go two days in a row you'll definitely have different things. i appreciate that. they even changed out some items while we sat. definitely go for the all-you-can-drink package for $8 more. the drinks aren't strong at all, but it's still not a bad deal. \ni really enjoyed eating here and will come again, perhaps it will be my only buffet stop in vegas!", 
            "i am not a buffet person, so i try to avoid going to buffets in general. but it being vegas i thought i'd try one of the highly rated ones...\n\nso let me just tell you up front. wicked spoon is great. tucked away in the back of the cosmopolitan, it was a hidden gem for a foodie on a budget. the food matched the modern and beautiful decor. for only $29.00 for weekend brunch, you definitely get your money's worth. when you eat, try to tally up the price each dish would normally be worth out in the real world. it will quickly add up to more than what you've paid for.\n\neach dish is served in small taster portions, and are <mark>Uni</mark>. there was goat cheese ravioli. chicken apple sausages. the most amazing pancake (in my friends' and my opinion.) galbee (korean short ribs). mussells cooked in a basil garlic sauce. fresh fruits, fresh breads. fried chicken that had a light breading with a hint of spice that was definitely tasteful. prosciutto pizza. any salad you could possibly want. lamb, prime rib, pork ribs. pasta with sweet tomato sauce and spices. small take out boxes containing <mark>Uni</mark> asian noodles. seriously, my friends and i scrambled to get as much on our plates as possible before the 3:00 closing time. and i hear that wicked spoon changes up its menu, so the choices are always different each visit. \n\nand the dessert. oh. my. goodness. definitely leave room for dessert. freshly baked apple cobbler, and fresh baked fudge brownie! there was even a man working the gelato area, working to serve each individual with their orders. almond joy gelato, vanilla bean gelato, mint chocolate gelato, and the list goes on... i don't even like eating sweets, but everything had the right amount of sugar; not too sweet.\n\nwicked spoon wants you to be able to enjoy all their food, and they have a smart, strategic method to do it: 1) using small portions, and 2) giving just the right amount of flavor & savorness so your pallette isn't overwhelmed.", 
            "so there were two lines -- one to pay, which was moving by quickly, and another to get seated, this one not so quick.  fortunately, after paying, when the hostess asked how many were in our party (10) and if we were all present (yes), she just had us stand off to the side and had us seated within about 5 minutes.  possibly they have a separate section of the dining area reserved for larger parties and there was already a table open.  came up!\n\nnow onto the food.  there was a huge variety of deliciousness and lots of <mark>Uni</mark> items that aren't normally found at a buffet (korean bbq short ribs and edamame anyone?).  not only that, but the presentation was <mark>Uni</mark> and the portion sizes were perfect!  just enough to try everything, without wasting food if i didn't like it.  one thing i loved was the goat cheese ravioli -- went back for 2 more helpings!  i also paid extra for the unlimited champagne/mimosa/bloody mary's and the waitstaff was always there for a refill!  i was only slightly disappointed that there weren't any macarons in the dessert section (maybe only offered at dinner?) but the pecan tart and salted caramel gelato (in a waffle bowl to boot!) more than made up for it.  great experience here.", 
            "christine g and sheila m nailed it in their reviews... we tried the wicked spoon based on word of mouth and stellar yelp reviews also, but i was very disappointed. at $35 pp, it's not cheap, and i really was expecting better quality food\n\nfor that price, you do get to choose from an extensive variety of higher-end food items, but it's all merely average, and certainly not \"chef quality\". i would compare it to some of the better cruise ship buffets that i've experienced, but that isn't a compliment. \n\nthough supposedly known for having <mark>Uni</mark> asian dishes, wicked spoon's sushi, korean, and other asian items were sparse and unappetizing. the gazpacho was bland, beet salad was decent, crab legs were ok, prime rib was very dry (borderline inedible), fruits were old/bruised, and the desserts were forgettable.\n\nluckily, our server was very attentive and friendly, so that salvaged the evening for me.\n\nwicked spoon is overpriced and clearly values quantity over quality. it's sad to see the huge amounts of food being thrown away because it doesn't taste good, with homeless people just steps away from the front door... would not return", 
            "good value and <mark>Uni</mark> offerings.\n\ni've been for both brunch and dinner and have been happy with each visit. pricing is on par with the town's top buffets and it's not a \"cheap\" meal but if you consider the cost of an app, entr\\u00e9e, dessert and non-alcoholic beverage at a restaurant serving the same caliper of food - it's a good value.\n\ntable service has always been prompt and attentive. food at the stations always fresh which i believed is helped by the individual servings you are presented. something for everyone and certainly a top choice in town (i believe it has surpassed the wynn buffet.)", 
            "we ended up eating at wicked spoon because we thought it would be a nice experience with good variety of delicious and <mark>Uni</mark> food. i was sorely disappointed.\n\nwe went over the memorial day weekend so it ended up costing a little over $40 plus tax per person. i wouldn't have minded the price, but the food was very sorely lacking.\n\nultimately buffets are about the variety of the food and, in this case, the quality. \n\nthe good:\nbeautiful desserts, lovely presentation. gelato, fresh macaroons, cookies, marshmallows, cheese cake, etc. modern decor, attentive wait staff. good lemonade and orange juice. \n\nthe bad: \nvalue/<mark>Uni</mark> -nothing out of the ordinary. far too expensive for what you get. i would not pay more than $25 for this stuff--even for vegas.we came for bruch and the selection was very sub par and unremarkable. pancakes, fresh toast, omellete station, breads, 2-3 cheeses), cereal and fruit. nothing worth $40. they didn't have a belgian waffle section, or  any out of the ordinary breakfast offering. very sparse and a major disappointment...and i love breakfast food. \n\nvariety - the lunch food selection is what really upset me. my fiance is big on meats and there were hardly any meats there (lamb, pork ribs, and tri tip), poor selection of salads, vegetable options, and general main dishes. i felt like i was eating a bunch of side dishes and fillers (i.e., mac n' cheese -not that great, risotto, pizza, spaghetti--seriously?), a big beef was that  their sushi  was no better than what you can get at the market--not fresh, dried out, flavorless. on top of that, the little asian foods they had were also inedible. \n\ni really wanted to love wicked spoon. it had so much potential and had really great reviews. i am guessing most of these people were just there for the dessert, cause that's all i saw that was worth eating.  it just really let me down. i'm sorry, my fiance gave this place a shot for me cause he knows i like pretty food, but i really owe him a buffet at the bellagio. wicked spoon, you really let me down. it's embarassing. we couldn't even enjoy our food. i even lost my appetite because the food was so bad. considering it was memorial day weekend, i can't imagine what disappointing menu they normally would have for a cheaper price. huge disappointment. if you don't mind shelling out 35-40 for cute little desserts then go ahead, but otherwise i'd skip this place and do the bellagio buffet instead.", 
            "um yeah this place is hellza good. especially when you are hungover, need to grab some quick food, are ready to hit the cosmo pool, & want to look like a hungover beached whale.\n\ntheir presentation is all individual portions made in little crock pots or little saucepans. it's really cute, very <mark>Uni</mark>, and you don't feel like you are eating at a horse troff.\n\nthey have almost anything one could want here! my friend's a veggie and she chowed down here. i'm a carnivore and made it my bi@tch.", 
            "went to wicked spoon last night for dinner and was impressed by the overall quality of foods. each station had something very <mark>Uni</mark> that you can't find in buffets like wynn and bellagio. \ni also liked the individual mini metal \"pans\" that had single serving dishes which kept the quality of foods high, but the plates were kind of small so you could only put like 3 or 4 metal \"pans\" on your plate. heh", 
            "i write this thinking this should be a 3.5.....\ni have been to the wynn brunch at least 4 times and it's always a go-to. when my group learned there was a new one with a <mark>Uni</mark> theme we decided to try it! it definitely didn't disappoint...but i think the wynn still wins this battle.\n\nwhat i liked:\n*clever packaging in <mark>Uni</mark> containers\n*clever food ideas and <mark>Uni</mark> food combinations (whereas wynn features more of the classics)\n*fav dishes - moroccan chk w. couscous, angry mac and cheese, chicken wings, french toast\n\nwhat disappointed:\n*a handful of dishes were really blah. i've rarely had something at the wynn that was blah. eggs benedict was meh. green curry noodles - i've never tasted curry so bland.  corn with cojita cheese just ok.\n\nso while some of the clever dishes at wicked spoon were really interesting and clever and cute in packaging, when you factor in the blah-dishes it is only 3/3.5\n\nno don't get me wrong i definitely got my money's worth in the dishes that were good, but it needs to up its consistency across its offerings.\n\ntip - go before 11a. the line gets crazy afterwards!!", 
            "when i hear the words \"vegas buffet,\" the first three things that come to mind are 1) long lines, 2) it all tastes the same and 3) not worth it.  however, i overwhelmingly fell in love with my experience at the wicked spoon because of 1) the non-existent line (we went at 11:30 a.m. on a saturday), 2) every item had a <mark>Uni</mark> taste and flavor and 3) it was totally worth the $29.95 for lunch.\n\nfrom salmon sushi, to kbbq, to angry mac n' cheese....they have it all!  my favorite part is that everything was in bite-sized dishes/ pots/ pans, like the kind that you used to play with in the playskool kitchens, except fancier.  i was impressed with how many people i saw taking pictures of the food...unfathomable in a buffet, i thought.  must try's include the mouth-watering ravioli goat cheese, the peanut butter gelato and the salted peanut butter gelato.   come up with a strategy to takle on the gelato before you go: i'd recommend having everyone get a different flavor and then doing a swap so that you can try a little of everything.\n\nwicked spoon taught me to \"eat my words\" when i said that i would never go to another vegas buffet - next up: their dinner buffet!", 
            "the theme for most of the hotel buffets seem to \"let's present the food to make it look like 5 star quality, but the taste is actually 2 stars.\"  wicked spoon has a <mark>Uni</mark> business model.  individual portioned servings are set so that customers don't overplate their plates and waste food. \n\nthe food is presented well.  what i noticed about wicked spoon was that they have higher end food items available then other buffets.  roasted bone marrow, suckling pig, prime rib, lamb chops, and shrimp ceviche to name a few.  they offer different cuisines from various regions.  there's a salad bar, shell fish, meat, pasta, asian, italian, bread, antipasta, and dessert section.  just by looking through the pictures on yelp shows you that the food looks absolutely great.  just remember the taste isn't at par with the presentation.\n\ni've only tried wicked spoon and the wynn buffet, so i have no idea how wicked spoon compares to the bellagio or the rio, but what i can say is that the wynn fares slightly higher then wicked spoon.", 
            "on the last day of our vegas family vacation my family wanted to make sure we ate at a buffet before we left. with all the options available on the strip we turned to yelp and decided on the wicked spoon based on its positive reviews and its proximity to our hotel. \n\ni must say that i was not disappointed. we went on a thursday afternoon for the brunch and it wasn't crowded at all. at $22 with a mimosa/bloody mary/champagne i thought the price was more than reasonable. for an additional $8 you could make it bottomless. \n\ni really enjoyed the <mark>Uni</mark> variety of food the buffet provided. it had the traditional breakfast items such as omelet station, bagels and lox, bacon, sausage, etc. however, it provided some <mark>Uni</mark> items as well such sushi/asian, tacos, and various fish dishes. i thought that the tapas-style servings were <mark>Uni</mark> and provided the perfect portion for trying everything out. \n\nsome of my favorite dishes included the pork belly buns and the curried mussels. the dessert bar is phenomenal! it had a gelato station and various miniature desserts such as tiramisu and french macaroons which finished the meal very nicely. and of course i can't forget to mention the plump and juicy chocolate covered strawberries! they were of course delicious!\n\noverall, i would say that the wicked spoon is great brunch! i didn't get to try out some of the options that others had mentioned (i.e.: bone marrow and mac and cheese bar--maybe they're only available on the weekend?), but still enjoyed myself with a <mark>Uni</mark> brunch experience!", 
            "if you want a buffet with all the regular staples of a buffet then this might not be for you.  we decided to do it based on the reviews we read here and weren't dissapointed. we came for  breakfast/brunch and there was no line and we were seated right next to the buffet which my husband loved as there was lots of eye candy for him to gaze at...hehehehe...  so much food to choose from and a lot was portioned out which is good.  they have different choices like goat cheese ravioli etc.. so you need to be experimental when eating here.. desserts were wonderful.. tiny, which was good so you could try a couple. the only thing that wasn't tiny was the chocolate dipped strawberries.they are huge!!   the omelet staion was wonderful too..  they were too big for me so you might consider sharing.  i did notice a sign that for $16.99 (i think) for a buffet take out so i thought that was <mark>Uni</mark>.  if you have a couple of people this would be a great way to try different items if everyone picks different items and go back to the room and partake.", 
            "if you could do only one buffet in vegas, this is it. not just your ordinary vegas buffet, everything here is done a little <mark>Uni</mark>. leg of lamb, bone marrow, rotisseries pork, crab legs, made to order clam, shrimp or mussel. like how they served the sides on a mini pot, instead on a huge bowl after hundred other people went through it. some asian food is served in a little carry out container. save room for dessert, if you're a chocolate lover, you won't be disappointed. try the chocolate covered bacon? place is a little pricy, but is worth it. but schedule your visit though, they are closed during mid day, and the lunch menu is different.", 
            "i have only been to the wynn buffet in vegas, as a comparison.  and the wynn buffet imo is so much better.\n\nthe wicked spoon i felt lacked variety.  the wynn definitely had more choices.\n\nalso i felt their food was not very flavorful, or special.  i distinctly remember the bone marrow - thinking this is something <mark>Uni</mark> to offer at.  but then when i actually tried it, it was actually pretty bland.  it left me pretty disappointed.\n\ni would skip, hope to try bellagio buffet next time!", 
            "forget the bellagio, wicked spoon is  what's up. \n\nthe food is fresh, <mark>Uni</mark>, cutely/smartly served in tiny portions, and sophisticated for a buffet. \n\nthe options are unlike any other buffets - it felt as though i was going to a 5 star restaurant and their entrees were buffet items. example, they serve gelato. you won't find that at the bellagio or ocb. \n\nit was also refreshing that there wasn't a huge line. it told me they were more about the service rather than showing off.", 
            "have made two trips here. a strong challenger for the lead of best buffet vs bellagio and wynn. every dish had <mark>Uni</mark> flavors and most are served in <mark>Uni</mark> pots or containers. favorite dishes: short rib cavatelli, make your own mac & cheese, citrus marinated olives, babaganoush, truffle risotto, goat cheese ravioli.\n\nattentive friendly servers.\n\nbest was the pastry chef introducing us to every single dessert. we sampled 14 treats! nutella mousse rocked!", 
            "wicked spoon buffet took my las vegas buffet virginity and i'd like to confirm that it was a very tasty experience. the restaurant itself is very lovely and large and their presentation of food in mini servings is <mark>Uni</mark>.\n\npros\n\n+ bacon\n+ bacon\n+ bacon\n+ tri-tip was delicious\n+ home style fried chicken\n+ asian style pork ribs had great char taste and addicting\n+ hash browns were great\n+ orange chicken\n+ curry mussels\n+ pork bun was good\n+ cocktail shrimp\n+ easy to eat fried rice\n+ made to order omelette\n+ lots of ice cream\n+ macaron\n+ complimentary champagne\n+ nice bathrooms\n\ncons\n\n- no bone marrow for lunch\n- very limited japanese food selection\n- street tacos were whatever\n- pork and beans were mostly beans and rice\n- came 1 pm, pulled food at 2:15 pm\n\nconclusion\n\ni hope to return for dinner! check it out if you're into buffets done a little different.", 
            "i always learn anew that buffets are a place of plenty rather than good. as far as buffets go, the wicked spoon has well above average buffet quality food. their <mark>Uni</mark> thing is to have servings in cute miniature pots and serving dishes. there are big wood boards with five pieces of different cheese. it makes it special to have a little cheese course, rather than gobbling piles of artery-jammers onto your plate. there were tiny deep frying dishes that held a portion of fish and chips.\n\nthe one disappointment was that there was no fruit. i'm a big fan of fruit. i usually load up big time on fruit at the end. there were only chocolate covered strawberries. i didn't feel like scraping the chocolate of the strawberries to get a bowl of strawberries.", 
            "i love this place! the food is great and so <mark>Uni</mark>. its not your typical vegas buffet, they serve small portions in little bowls and pans. desserts were yummy! its kind of pricey but what can you say it is pretty fancy! :)", 
            "wow. that is all i can say!\n\nnever have i been to a buffet that has such a wide selection of all kinds of delicious food. from asian cuisine, european, to soul food, this buffet has everything! they have an omelet bar, so you can request the chef to create your own. i also love that wicked spoon serves dishes in certain portions so that you won't over stuff yourself. not only will you save a ton of calories like this, but this will give you a chance to try out everything this buffet has to offer!\n\ni will admit that this was my first buffet in vegas lol. however, i was pretty bummed that i didn't get to try everything out. some of the dishes that were to die for were: the ribs, mac-n-cheese, and pasta dishes. i loved that the ribs were very smokey and the meat was very moist. the mac-n-cheese was probably the creamiest mac-n-cheese i've ever tried (even better than roscoes!), and the pasta dishes were very <mark>Uni</mark> in their own ways. i also loved their desserts, especially their cheesecake! but one thing that sucked was that they didn't have a huge selection. however, definitely do not try out their asian cuisine though. i may be biased because i'm asian, but their vegetarian fried rice was very salty!", 
            "my bf and i really enjoyed this buffet. our favorite has been the wynn but after trying out the wicked spoon, we both agreed that we now have two favorites! the presentation of the food at this buffet is so <mark>Uni</mark> and fun... some serving sizes are already prepared for you- each one in its own little pot or asian carry-out box etc.\n\ni've been to a few las vegas buffets and all of them are terrible at doing asian food. it's always cooked strangely or lacking flavor. this is not the case at wicked spoon. all of their asian food tasted great. they had fried rice and a couple different chicken and pork dishes that i loved. they also have sriracha and anyone who loves spicy will appreciate that. the only asian food i didn't care for here was their sushi. too small with barely any fish/crab in the rolls.\n\ntheir dessert section.... so many different sweets for you to try. i particularly enjoyed the apple pie with a scoop of vanilla gelato on top and their chocolate strawberries. if you're at the city center, i would highly recommend this buffet over aria's.\n\nmy only complaint would be that we arrived around 9pm (they closed at 10) and we noticed that many dishes were gone but they were not refilling them. we knew because there were still place cards out with the names of other dishes not on display anymore. some of them sounded intriguing and we wished we'd been able to try them! this would not stop me from coming back here though, next time we'll just get there earlier.", 
            "vegas and buffets kind of go hand in hand. that being said, most are just okay and a little overpriced. while wicked spoon is still in the price range, their food is surprisingly really good. lots of people had raved about it and all you would see on facebook was how pretty the food looked. well the food def tastes as good as it looks! it's a little more <mark>Uni</mark> than the other buffets place but it never repeats itself and the restaurant is huge! definitely delicious and really makes you wanna stay there for a long time.", 
            "easily our favorite buffet in vegas. this buffet is quite <mark>Uni</mark> because some items are already portioned into adorable mini pots and pans. this helped move the line quickly and stopped you for piling glutinous heaps of everything only to find you don't like it or can't finish it. of course, if you want more, you can get more but we found d the portioned servings to be helpful; we left without that \"good god why did i do that to myself\" feeling. \n\nthe food was great as was the selection. we would pick this over the bellagio buffet any day. oh, and did i mention a glass of champagne came with our lunch. they really knew the way to my heart.", 
            "sorry wicked spoon you got downgraded in stars due to your buffet closing at 3pm, yet you still seat people at 2:15pm. we arrived later in the afternoon, come on... it's vegas, people wake up late and go for a brunch. anyways we get in there around 2:15 and here we are trying to scramble to get some food and it's very overcrowded and you guys stop refilling the food around 3pm... it was kind of a bust. the food is <mark>Uni</mark> but it's wasn't all that.", 
            "i find wicked spoon to be a very stylish buffet at a very chic casino (the cosmopolitan).  be warned, it is quite pricey and definitely not casual fare.  if you have a giant appetite and want giant portions to match, you may want to try something less expensive.  but if you aren't put off by smaller portions and appreciate the the ability to sample more exotic selections, then you will love wicked spoon!  \n\nthe food itself is very good, and as someone who leans towards eating more vegetables and grains, i think there is a bigger selection of healthy fare here that may make you more mindful of what you eat.  how many buffets have that distinction?  my absolute favorite part is the dessert area, and i highly recommend the gelatos.  the  flavors are really <mark>Uni</mark> (pb&j, almond joy, etc.) and absolutely delicious.", 
            "what's <mark>Uni</mark> about wicked spoon compared to all other buffets is that they are already pre-plated single servings. you can grab a small basket of chicken, a small plate of salad, a plate of red velvet pancakes with a side of cream cheese syrup...without using serving spoons/tongs/other utensils. they have a nice variety of food. the desserts are pretty especially the macarons...but they're not all as yummy as they look which is the only flaw this place has.", 
            "me and my wife wanted to see what all the hype was about so we went at 5pm on a sunday. it actually doesn't open for dinner until 5pm daily and there was no line and was not busy at all, however not sure how friday and saturdays are.\n\nfood was excellent and presentation was very <mark>Uni</mark>. most of dishes are served in mini dishes to proportion them out which is a <mark>Uni</mark> idea. there was wine at the table ($20 extra if you want) and a bottle of water that is filtered on site. so when you want more water, pour yourself. the only buffet that i've been to that served bone marrow....but it was good...lol. it was just an overall excellent experience. i will have to say this is by far the best buffet i've been to in vegas, with the wynn and m resort buffets sitting at second. although at $35/person ( a little pricey), i believe friday and saturday is a little more, you need to at least experience this once and you may not even think about the price afterwards.", 
            "best buffet in las vegas. period. \n\nmy only dislike about this place is the lack of good seafood choices. the sushi was pretty fresh. the clams/mussels/shrimp bar is a neat and delicious idea. the trout salad, salty fishy crostini, and seared salmon were alright. but the crab left something to be desired. i'm a huge crab-bie!!  \n\nall that aside, everything else was pretty darn good for buffet food. tomato/ corn risotto. angry mac n' cheese. lamb. carnitas. ginger chicken. gnocchi. cheese plates. pork belly sliders were nom nom.  \n\nthe highlights for me were : crispy pork ears, grilled peaches and goat cheese crostini, and bone marrow. \n\ncrispy pork ears were so crunchy and salty, can be added to some dishes like the mac n cheese or kimchi fried rice to blast the flavors. grilled peaches were delectable and light. all-you-can-eat bone marrow?! even though it wasnt the best i've had, it was still legitimate bone marrow. damn. i want more! \n\nall the beautiful plating they did for their dishes definitely gave some of their food a playful and <mark>Uni</mark> dimension from other places. their service was great too. cleaned and refilled drinks like ninjas! friday night lines weren't unbearable. \n\nall that aside ...\n\ntheir dessert had a shortcoming for me. their gelato bar was incredible with the amount of flavors they had (thai ice tea and almond joy being my recommendations), but their cupped desserts just did not do it for me. what balanced out the disappointment was their homemade marshmallow. it had a delicious fluffiness all 'mallows should have with a hint of mango; as well as their chocolate covered strawberries crusted with toffee pieces. other than that. the dessert was nehh.\n\noverall. this place is definitely one of those ones i want to come back to. don't go in over-hyped by everyone's reviews. go in with an open heart and empty stomach and you'll enjoy many of their dishes. i've been to the m and bellagio and rio ... and i must say, (if they had better seafood .. oysters like m, or lobster like rio) this may be my most favorite buffet ever", 
            "love this place! dishes were <mark>Uni</mark> and delicious. very cute and clever on the presentation. i fell in love with everything.\n\n**foursquare users: important tip**\nif you get the cosmoplitan vip badge, it will grant you vip access to wicked spoon meaning you will not have to wait in line. when i went there was a huge line fortunately i had the badge. there was a lot of unhappy people giving me and my friends a dirty look. lol!\n\ni had a little bit of everything, no favorites, everything was good. a pretty decent spread on the dessert table. one of the best buffets in vegas.", 
            "wicked spoon easily gets to be in the top tier buffets at las vegas in my book, along with wynn and bellagio. for value, i think studio b buffet at the m, rio buffet, and planet hollywood buffet needs to be mentioned. \n\nanyways, if i could, i would rate this place 4.5 stars. the plating and presentation was phenomenal and \"cute,\" the ambiance felt like more of a restaurant than a buffet, which was nice, and the service was good. however, the food, in my opinion, is trying to play catch up to the other glowing areas of this buffet. the food itself was good with certain dishes, not so much with others. \n\nhowever, i will say that upon  seeing their dessert bar, i probably had an existential experience. the gelato was awesome and the other sweets were great as well. definitely an anchor to wicked spoon. one specific criticism: the crab legs were a bit small and the shrimp sizes in the shrimp cocktail could have been a bit bigger.\n\ni've been to almost every buffet on the strip and many others off the strip, and wicked spoon is a quality buffet. if you're a hater of wicked spoon, giving it one or two stars and using terms such as \"execution\" and \"<mark>Uni</mark>,\" i would like to control some expectations (we sometimes tend to play make believe that we are judges on iron chef). this is, after all, still a buffet, not a fine dining 3 star michelin establishment. i'm sure expectations of textures and inspiration will be satisfied with 300 dollar tasting menus at those restaurants, and vegas is filled with them.", 
            "my family and i refer to wicked spoon as, \"the best buffet ever of my life!\"\n\nwe dined on a saturday night. with the tax and everything, it was $44 per person. and it was very much worth it!!\n\nthe decor and setting is beautiful.  felt so posh, which is fitting considering the 44 dollar price tag haha!\n\nthe presentation of the food was just as stunning! like the things you see on the food channel! take lots of pictures, because they sure are photogenic!\n\nnow to the most important factor: taste of the food. um, everything we tried was good. like, everything. haha! i dont know what else to say, we loved it! delicious and <mark>Uni</mark>.  i was able to eat foods here that i had never even thought about before.  lamb gnocchi, duck ravioli, thai tea gelato.... as expected, you cant love every single thing you eat, but honestly, whatever foods we did not care for, were still pretty good! i myself am not a fan of bone marrow, but my mom ate so much of it!  to sum it up, our least favorites foods were still pretty dang good! and for the foods that we loved, lets just say we ate 3 servings of each of them!\n\nwe will definitely be coming back.  every trip to vegas must now be accompanied with a trip to wicked spoon.", 
            "this is the best buffet in vegas, and that's really saying something. i wish i got the unlimited wine - they have some really nice options including stuff like a red from peju, one of my favorite napa wineries. i had duck confit ravioli, tomato risotto, a scalloped generously truffled potato dish, chocolate lava cake, macarons, mango sorbet - a lot of stuff that is <mark>Uni</mark> or hard to pull off in large quantities. wicked spoon feels like you're having 10 upscale dining experiences all at once.", 
            "if you love gourmet food and do not love buffets, this will be the buffet for you.\n\nwicked spoon does a nice job with the details of each item, the section to choose from and by far i got the best service thus far from any buffet in vegas. they present \"typical\" buffet items, then rock your socks off with pigs tail, bone marrow and angry mac and cheese. the desserts were by far the hit of every table! i almost don't want you to look at the pictures, because it  may lessen the surprise!\n\nservice was <mark>Uni</mark> great for a buffet and much much more difficult then other restaurants. dishes are all different sizes and shapes and heavy!\n\nmy one less star goes to two things: \n1. although i likes the pigs tail in the asian section, i think they should either reconsider other offerings or just replace it with more of their other <mark>Uni</mark> foods that are not asian. it was not great at all.\n2. although i did love the style of how the food was presented, the dishes were very heavy and hard to carry.\n\ni highly recommend this buffet when you are there and if you like <mark>Uni</mark> types\nof foods to try. if you just want prime rib, crabs leg and shrimp (which they do have)...you might not fully appreciate this buffet. happy eating!", 
            "i've been to all the major buffets in vegas (bellagio, wynn, m resorts), except the new bacchanal buffet at the caesar. but i will go real soon...\n\nso far, this one is my favorite, the dishes are placed in small containers, which is a nice touch. it's very well portioned, it's small so it allows you to try different things.\n\nmy problem with buffets is this: what to eat, and what not to eat. some people go for what they think is the most expensive stuff and gorge themselves to make it worth it... and there are so many things to try, once you've tried most of what you wanted to try, you're already full.\n\nand while buffets are made for quantity, i like to take my time to try different things, i know i shouldn't eat the salad, but having a balanced meal matters to me so leave me alone if i don't eat the crab legs by the boat load!!!\n\non the variety side, this place really shines, pretty much all major cuisines represented, from chinese japanese french italian american... whereas most buffets have the whole wall in the back with some station before the wall, most of them only have original items on half the spread, and the items are repeated on the other half of the wall. not here, the whole buffet is <mark>Uni</mark>, no food is repeated anywhere!!!\n\nof the few items that people keep talking about, namely angry mac an cheese and bone marrow, i found these item s to be meh. i actually liked the pork sliders, fried oysters, rib tips, parpadelle, kim chi fried rice, crab salad, mushroom salad...\n\nthe pasta was fresh and had good texture, worthy of an italian restaurant!!!\nkim chi fried rice was so good, i actually had seconds, i know i know don't eat rice at a buffet!!! lol\n\nsadly i never finished sampling the whole spread and was actually full before i tasted all the stuff i wanted to try. on the dessert side, i really like the coconut flan, and the thai iced tea gellato. and never before seen is the chesse plate among the dessert spread, very nice touch.\n\ni had a total of 6 plates, which is 3 plates more than i usually have. nice buffet i would definitely go again.", 
            "this rating combines 2 visits. \n\nwhen i first read about the wicked spoon on yelp, many complained about the long lines to get in.  that just built up more anticipation. as luck would have it, a drive from la took just enough time to arrive in vegas around 1:30, perfect time to feed that hunger and avoid the lines. it took us about 10 minutes to get in on our first visit. \n\nthe size of the buffet with the modern decor greeted us, along with rows of dishes displayed in <mark>Uni</mark> ways. example, small pieces of golden friend chicken served in a little metal basket not only controls the portion, it also saves me plenty of room to sample everything else i've been eyeing. unfortunately, the lunch rush was probably over and the kitchen became slow in refilling some of the empty slots. \n\nthe dessert section was a bit impressive, full of properly proportioned sweets and ice cream.  my only complaint is they put these tiny malt balls in their otherwise awesome coffee ice cream. ruined! it's like pouring ketchup on steak. yes, anything-to-do w/ coffee snob here.\n\nthe second visit a few months later was better. it was nearing the lunch hour as the line was longer this time, about 20 minutes. the line staff kept most of the trays filled as swarms of hungry people fought for prime position in front of certain stations. i passed and went for the immediate satisfaction. still very good flavor. \n\nwe were very surprised to find french macarons at the dessert station this time. the server told us they bring it out early and once it's gone, that's it. this explains why we didn't see it the first time. so being a greedy sneak, i grabbed a few extra for later to go w/ a cappuccino. real good! \n\nwill i go back? hell yea! is it my favorite? nah. but this is one impressive buffet from my 2 visits. definitely worth the trip and if your time is flexible,  avoid going at 12 and the long lines", 
            "i've been to a few buffets in vegas including the bellagio buffet, but this one is <mark>Uni</mark> in that most of the dishes are served in individual portions, not in big chafiing dishes. the portions are the right size for trying many dishes. the dishes are also very aesthetically pleasing.\n\nthere's a few made-to-order sections, but the seafood station took forever! \n\nthere many things to try like sushi, seafood, salads, cold dishes, a meat station with bone marrow, a variety of asian cuisines, and a huge dessert bar with gelato. if you come here, definitely save room for dessert. the small portions for dessert are great too, so you can try plenty of items.\n\nhonestly, some of the stations weren't fantastic though. there could have been more seafood and the asian dishes weren't great. also, i had heard about the famous mac and cheese bar which i was super jazzed about trying, but it wasn't there! there was just one dish of average mac and cheese. \n\nthe cold gazpacho soup (think it was like a chili watermelon soup?) was absolutely amazing and very memorable. \n\ni would come again, but first i have to try the wynn buffet which is next in line on a future trip to visit. i'm not convinced it's better than the bellagio buffet, but it's probably a tie.", 
            "i was under an impression that wynn buffet is the best buffet in vegas strip but after visiting wicked spoon at cosmopolitan, i have my doubts... \n\nprice: price is comparable. i think wicked spoon is little more expensive by maybe 4 dollars or so. i paid $42 including tip. \n\ninterior: wicked spoon wins hands down. its interior goes hand to hand with the cosmo interior and i really liked it. wynn buffet's interior is nice too but to me, it doesn't appeal much. \n\nfood selection: here is where things get interesting. i'm not sure if wicked spoon has less selection but i think the kitchen area is smaller. wynn buffet has more \"stations\" to go to and pick different kinds of food. in terms of selection, wynn buffet wins by hair. it didn't help that my friend and i went to the buffet an hour before the last serving time, which was 9:15pm. \n\ntaste / quality: i think this is where wicked spoon gets my vote over wynn buffet. the presentation and the taste of the food served at wicked spoon were amazing. portions were smaller for some dishes and i actually like it that way since it helped me to control the amount of food i ate. the dishes at wicked spoon were more exotic and <mark>Uni</mark> than the dishes at wynn buffet. \n\nservice: i think service were equally good at wynn buffet and wicked spoon.. however, the service i got from wicked spoon were extremely good. dishes were taken away really quickly and drinks were served almost right away. they asked if we needed anything few times and were very cordial. \n\nthanks cosmo and wicked spoon for a great dining experience!", 
            "went here with my family for thanksgiving, and through some ingenuity avoided a terrible 2-hour wait time. considering it's part of a pretty ritzy hotel, the markup is understandably steep per head. as other reviewers have mentioned, the selection isn't grand--and usually a smaller menu comes with better tasting items. in wicked spoon's case, however, that sentiment holds only partially true. \n\nmy personal favorite spot of the buffet was the macaroni stand. if you've ever eaten at a <mark>Uni</mark> lunch or dinner room, it's basically one of those tell-a-guy-to-make-awesome-things stations, albeit with better quality ingredients (i particularly appreciate the inclusion of feta and steak), but it's really nothing extraordinary. the cooks are awesome though, they strike up conversation easily. if you manage to get on their good sides, they pile stuff on for you. \n\nthe seafood was surprisingly dull, but it was nice that all the typical elderly folk that camp the crab legs weren't around the few times i've been here. maybe that's because they know there are better places? who knows.\n\nhot items were also a plus; the prime rib was nicely seasoned and none too tough, and pretty much everything that had to do with steak was delicious. \n\ni think the real winner for ws, in my opinion, was the infinite gelato. nutella, thai iced tea, raspberry, stracciatella (basically vanilla and chocolate) -- totally worth the short lines to get 'em. the other desserts were pretty much \"meh.\"\n\nservice, despite being a crazy packed thanksgiving day, was very attentive and friendly--we even had a no-show to our dinner; but the waiters gladly refunded that charge without any hassle.\n\nall in all, a good place, but for the price-to-taste ratio, i'd make the trip out to the m for the studio b buffet over this any day.", 
            "okay... so there are about 1,900+ reviews that have been written before me so no, i don't expect to be original or anything. i'm seriously just writing this for myself so i know what to expect/anticipate the next time i come around. and believe me there will be another visit to wicked spoon when i'm in vegas. :p  but feel free to read it anyways! \n\ni came here around 1:00pm on a saturday with a group of 6 people because we were all starving. and who doesn't go to a buffet at least once when you're in vegas? \n\noriginally, we were supposed to have 10 people and thus when we got in line and was asked the number of people in our party, we told the staff 10. we ended up skipping the long line, paid extra 15% for gratuity(applicable to groups of 8 or more), and was seated fairly quickly to our surprise. yay! \n\nlet's get eating shall we? \n\ndisclaimer: my inner child is indeed a fatty but i by no means tried everything that was out there. these are just a few i jotted down during my eating, sitting, piling-my-plate routine: \n\nmatsutake shoyu ramen: ew. don't get it. :( it was bland... i liked the earthiness that came from the mushrooms but aside from that, it was a waste of tummy space. \nwater spinach with garlic: nom! can't go wrong with vegetables and galric tehe :3\nsteamed clam with white wine, tomatoes, garlic, and parsley: it was pretty good. simple, clean, deilsh. plus it was fun forking out the meaty bits from the clams. \nduck confit ravioli: pretty good. the flavor was rich, though by the time i got to my ravioli, it was a bit cold :( i think the sauce was made of brown butter and butternut squash, which complimented the ravioli well. again, try to get this when it just comes out because dry cold pasta is unappetizing. \nbraised short rib with comm<mark>Uni</mark> grain polenta: not my favorite. it had a savory taste to it, but the polenta was a bit too grainy for me. \nasiago gnocchi: love. love love love! every piece of gnocchi yielded this cheesy goodness that i couldn't get enough of. i had to pace myself to prevent from gobbling them down in order to really appreciate the taste. \nbroccolini rabe: can't go wrong with broccolini either! \nkale salad: probably one of my favorite vegetable based sides. it was seasoned well and i loved how fresh it tasted. \ncurry roasted cauliflower: meh... a bit too soggy for me. \nsalmon plate: don't get it. i love salmon and this was just a dishonor to all the fishies in the sea. \nroasted sweet potatoes: love! simple and sweet! \nleg of lamb: it tasted good for something found at a buffet. cooked with just the perfect amount of redness too. the only thing was that it quickly got tough and dry as time passed... i like to be able to enjoy my food slowly but i couldn't really eat it because my knife wouldn't cut through :( \n\ndesserts: get the gelato! it's soooo worth it! other desserts weren't as great sadly, but feel free to taste a bit of everything!\n\noverall impression: pretty yummy. beautiful presentation of the food. though the price tag of ~40.00 was a bit excessive, it was worth the experience and the overall quality of the food.\n\ni was in love with the fact that most of the food was portioned out in small individual dishes already so you can easily get a little taste of everything :) i wasn't too happy with the fact that i waited a good amount of time before my cranberry juice came out, but that's minor. \n\nbe sure to anticipate a wicked food coma by the end of the mea and happy noming :d", 
            "this was a bit overkill for me. i went with a bunch of pharmacy friends because they suggested this for a night out. i had been to other buffets in vegas and i heard this was one of the best.\n\ni wasn't overly impressed.\n\nit was insanely expensive. i was expecting around $25 per person. my husband and i paid $90 to get in in the evening.\n\nthe food, while the ingredients were <mark>Uni</mark> like wild boar sloppy joes and truffle potatoes, i didn't find that they tasted any better than other buffets i was at. it's like they traded weird ingredients for taste.\n\nmaybe this place was just too fancy for me. i wasn't impressed.", 
            "the food was <mark>Uni</mark> (boar meat sliders, bone marrow, crab legs, octopus) and included asian (japanese, chinese, korean), french, italian, southern and new american (including prime rib). the salad and dessert bars were excellent - especially the gelato. the food was tasty, non-greasy, freshly made, and in small tapas-sized portions (so you could taste most things without pigging out - although that said, it is ayce). the service was right there to replace empty plates before returning to your seat, and the free non-alcoholic drinks were promptly refilled. the best buffet i every ate at in lv. $40 for dinner midweek.", 
            "yeah, this is pretty much the best buffet in vegas. they have <mark>Uni</mark> and original dishes that straight up rival anything you are going to find at any sit down restaurant.   and it's not just typical buffet food which is totally refreshing. when my wife said \"take me to this buffet that will cost $60 a pop\" i thought \" baby you are completely insane\". then i went. now i feel stupid, because it is worth every penny \n     also the service was stunning for a buffet. most buffets have the obligatory former bartender or cocktail server reaching their twilight years, but the service was effective and personal. i don't normal tip the typical 15%-20% for buffet service because my rational is that their role in the experience is limited. i think i tipped that guy like 25% of the total check. that how great the service is. go here if you can. end of story.", 
            "3.5stars\n\nambiance: keeps in theme with the cosmopolitan casino/hotel, very modern decor with feminine touches. \n\nprice: about $40/person (cheaper if you're a rewards member)\n\nfood: for a different and <mark>Uni</mark> vegas buffet, i'd highly recommend wicked spoon. they offer tapas style american comfort food using novel ingredients (i.e. cow liver shepherds pie). i'm torn on their dishes' lack of freshness as you can tell they've been sitting on the counter for a length of time, but you expect this for a buffet. however, they do have some great made to order stations (i.e. mac 'n cheese bar) and the novelty of the offerings (you can get bone marrow and ramen in the same meal?) makes me want to overlook this flaw. overall, definitely worth a trip if you're looking for something different from the other vegas buffets! \n\nservice: great! no hunting down servers for extra drinks/napkins etc.", 
            "delicious and <mark>Uni</mark>. who knew a buffet can be that nice? i was very impressed by the selection. i really liked the macaroni bar. the downside of the night :(sunday night)they didn't have anymore bone marrow and the risotto was undercooked. nothing worse than getting a spoonful of creamy uncooked rice! also the service was really slow. i had to keep clearing our plates for us because they never came to clear our plates the entire time we ate. and i'm still giving it 4 stars because their buffet is really impressive. the selection, ambiance, and food was good enough that i can still forgive them for slow service and uncooked rice!", 
            "after reading great reviews i was super excited to try this place out.  for some reason, i was expecting michelin-rated food in a non-buffet environment.  with very high expectations, i was disappointed in the quality of the food.  people keep reminding me though that it's a buffet- mass produced quantities of food.  after considering this, i'm raising my rating. i like how the majority of the selections were pre-plated in individual bowls/plates.  my pet peeve at buffets is when dishes all meld together.  \n\ni'm a bread and cheese person and loved their selection.  writing this review a month later, nothing else stands out in my mind.  nothing was inedible, but um-memorable either.  wish i would have tried the more <mark>Uni</mark> dishes like the bone marrow.  next vegas trip, i would probably do this buffet again.", 
            "i have never wanted to try a las vegas buffet as much as i wanted to go to wicked spoon.  the concept of individualized containers and high-end items really appealed to me. after a couple of failed attempts and massively long lines, i got my chance.  \n\nthe individualized containers were all that i could have ever hoped for.  little ramekins, bowls, and cups of pasta, meats, and salads were so cute and portioned for grazing.  those containers also made handling a plate really difficult since you could never put more than 2-3 containers on a plate at any one time. \n\na major disappointment was how quickly wicked spoon ran out of \"the good stuff.\"  someone walking out of the buffet at the end of his lunch warned me that they had run out of both salmon and bone marrow.  when i returned for the first seating of dinner, they were still out of bone marrow.  i managed to try the salmon and beluga lentil dish, which was delicious.  they one measly plate of macarons which i later discovered they had no intent of refilling.  they udon noodle bar never seemed to have any noodles.  \n\ni enjoyed the prime rib, fried oysters, gelato bar, marshallows, kale salad, and variety.  it was very heavy in carbs - lots and lots of pizzas and filling pastas as per buffet usual but they were well-done too.  \n\nmy major gripe was that it didn't seem luxurious or interesting enough.  no bone-marrow, sweetbreads, lamb chops, macarons, rilletes, pork belly, xiao lung bao, all of which i saw in other yelp photos.  one of the more <mark>Uni</mark> items on our visit was the calves liver and onions.  just because it's offal doesn't make liver and onions a desirable dish! \n\nit's still up there as an interesting and delicious buffet but at $42 dinner and $37 lunch plus the long lines...just know what you're getting yourself into.", 
            "i think every group has that bru that's always like 'omg, we absolutely totally have to go to this place when we come here omg i've heard so many good things about it wowzors woah omguhh'. yeah. it was one of those dus that suggested we come out to wicked spoons out in vegas.\n\npretty big mistake imo. me and 15 other kiddies agree (the 16 other people i went with ... minus the one guy who really wanted to come -- i didn't ask for his opinion on whether he liked it or not cuz i was too salty at him for dragging us there ---oh and yeah i have at least 16 friends holy cow right?) \n\nbut here, this review is finna be slightly on the irrelevant side for most of y'all reading this tonight because i came around new year's eve time. i guess two days before. but the head honchos over at wicked spoonz figured it was still considered \"holiday time\" so they jacked them prices up. \n\ni still have the receipt in one of my jackets. the receipt paper it was printed on was high qual as fuc*. in fact, that was hands down the most high qual thing i got from this place. no questions asked. bar none. i ain't even hyperbole-ing on y'all. thick glossy supple paper, ya feel? any way, the buffet cost us $45 each. i woulda paid 45 cents for the receipt paper i guess. then i woulda wrote \"overrated\" on it and plastered it on the face of the cashier. jk, i ain't that mad. i'm a innanet warrior ~\n\nyo i'm dyin here cuz i'm reading this du's review before me and he got flowery ass words like 'fab' and 'delish' and i'm sure if i scrolled down further i'd see a 'fabulooouuuuusssss' but i ain't about to p<mark>Uni</mark> my eyes like that. they don't deserve it. \n\nnothing was fab or delish or anything close to that. \n\nprime rib was clammy and cold. not prime at all. not even rib really. just cold red meat. our waiter bru was kinda weird. he was kinda nice i guess but he kinda sucked at taking away our plates. i think he asked us how the food was three times and my responses were exactly as follows:\n1st time:\"great!\"\n2nd time: *nods head*\n3rd time: *absolutely no response *look down with a mixture of anger and disgust\n\nwicked chicken was also pretty chilly. i mean, yeah it's a buffet but invest in yo heat lamps sons. take a page from the colonel and keep ya chickenz warm. they taste better. real rap. \n\ni mean everything seemed exciting, but was actually really boring. like duck confit ravioli? yes pls. but no, not really. because it tasted like slightly sweet slightly savory chef boyardee's. bone marrow? nope.\n\ni guess the dessert section was decent. saving grace really, otherwise i'd stick em with a cold hard one star. they had like cute gold dusted cake pops. and fancy gelatos hand scooped for you by an unenthused chef looking guy (at least he's got the poofy hat).\n\ni guess the only fate worse than eating here is losing those 45 bucks to the casino. but at least you'd have vague amounts of fun doing so (assuming you play 45 bucks worth of penny slots or some shit ... if you a big balla, then the 45 bucks ain't even the small blind in your poker game, mirite?). i just feel disappointment and head-shakery. but yo if you like what all these other sheep have to say about the buffet then i say go for it bruh bruh. try it out! give it a whirl!\n\nthen you can come back and lament to me later about how you coulda bought yourself a pair of vans or some poppin' get up with the 45 bucks you blew on this joke of a buffet.", 
            "as usual we enjoyed the innovative dishes at this lv buffet.  everyone in our party of seven found something to like, and everyone agreed this buffet experience was <mark>Uni</mark>.\n\ni came here a few months ago.  the dishes that were mediocre last time were surprisingly good this time around.  beef tongue shepards pie was hot, buttery and very tender.  snow crab legs were sweet and tasted fresh, without excess salt.\n\nother winners were asian green beans saut\\u00e9ed with xo sauce and scallops. savory without being salty.  roast leg of lamb was juicy, as were the duroc pork baby backs.  \n\none new dish that was really good was the mediterranean grilled octopus salad.  the olives, onions, and very soft octopus chunks were a real palate cleanser, very refreshing.  it went well with a side of beet salad which added some sweetness.\n\ndesserts excellent as usual.  i had about eight of those little chocolate cones and half a cup of pistachio gelato.  down it with some of their house black coffee and i'd say the meal is complete!\n\nthe positives of our dinner far outweighed the negatives.  it's hard for a buffet to execute everything well.  btw i gave the calf liver a try but it didn't agree with me :(", 
            "i went to the breakfast buffet on saturday, 2/16/13; while my family and i were in vegas.  we all were in awe of the selection, quality and quantity.  some reviewers are stating they paid less than us, but the price is $38 per person.  i hope cosmo doesn't read this; as they can charge more for this treat!  \n\nthe staff was terrific.  however, we would've like some more plate clearing help.\nthe food was so exciting and the portions were \"sample\" size and perfect for a brunch sitting.  i hate to waste food and only take what i might eat, so i loved the smaller portions.  i was able to try a variety of dishes that i would not normally imbibe.\n\ni read the other reviews on here, but everyone one has a different experience.  our beef stew was so moist, delicious and succulent.   \n\nmy sister is a chef and was admiring some of their <mark>Uni</mark> dishes and presentations.\n\ntheir dessert selection is amazing.  i had to take pictures, while we had assortments on our plates, as they are pure art (to see and eat:))\n\nthank you ,cosmo, for having such a wonderful locale!", 
            "meh.\n\ni don't understand the hype about this place. yes, the food is super cute (mini baskets of fried chicken) but what's more important than presentation? the taste! the food here was so bland and subpar. <mark>Uni</mark>. go to bacchanal.", 
            "i'm definitely impressed!\n\nfor an extra $10ish you can add on unlimited mimosas, champagne, or bloody marys for the sunday brunch! yes please, it pays for itself in 2 drinks! (i drank 4) only bad thing is, i drank on an empty stomach and didn't feel at all buzz or drunk, so it means there's barely any alcohol in the bloody mary's! still a great deal though!\n\ni suggest you try the korean short ribs, prime rib, eggs benedict, crab cakes, bone marrow, and their delicious desserts (mmmm chocolate covered strawberries!)! all their options were <mark>Uni</mark> and really tasty. their desserts have great options (except fresh fruit they need more) definitely beats the bellagio!", 
            "great buffet! the selection and <mark>Uni</mark> of foods here is great. we arrived at 10 on a thursday for brunch. no wait and paid $52 for 2. we had everything from duck ravioli to sushi, eggs benedict to korean shortribs, caramelized onion and cheese hashbrowns, spicy mac and cheese, fried chicken, bahn mi, espresso and lavender cheese... for desserts there were huge chocolate dipped strawberries, gelato, tiramisu, cheesecake, cake, marshmallows and more. the originality of this buffet really shows. it isn't your typical dishes that you find everywhere which we liked.", 
            "prime rib was probably the highlight of the buffet along with the dessert section.  everyone loved the nutella gelato.  peach cobbler was good but chocolate lava cake was disappointing.  \n\nthe seafood selection could have been better.  the crab legs were really scrawny and cocktail shrimp was average.  the shrimp ceviche was <mark>Uni</mark> and tasty.", 
            "i've had wicked spoon bookmarked for the longest time.  i had plenty of opport<mark>Uni</mark> to eat here, but promised my teenager that i wouldn't eat here without her. \n\nso it's set. she's in town for a couple of days and wicked spoon was on her radar this time around (i swear, she's a yelper in training).  we purposely arrived about an hour near closing because i figured that the lines wouldn't be as bad then.  i was right, only waited about 20 minutes to get into our seats.  overall service was great and for that i cannot complain.  i feel the ambiance and the decor.  i even love their tables and wish i had that pattern at home.  but this review is about the food, right? \n\nin my opinion, if you've been to one buffet in las vegas, you've been to them all.  the dishes here are served in mini-portions, which i think is great for pictures.  but lousy for a buffet.  when i think buffet, i think as much as i want.  give their fried chicken wings as an example.  you get two pieces presented in a cute stainless steel strainer.  but if i wanted 6 pieces, i would have to grab 3 of these bad boys, really? how about their angry mac n' cheese.  the portions are small and if i wanted a little more, than i'm grabbing multiple tins of these.  again, great for photos, but not convenient for eating.  this is pretty much the experience with all their mini-dishest.  by the time i was done, i've tried their fried chicken, roasted chicken, salmon, sushi (don't do it), mac n cheese, and their garlic pizza.  all were just about par with every one else on the strip.  not bad in taste, not the greatest either.  \n\nnow for dessert...this is where wicked spoon has their one shining moment.  it's all about desserts here.  from presentation to taste, you really can't go wrong with their desserts. their macarons weren't that great, but everything else disappeared once it made it to my table.  \n\noverall, i have to give wicked spoon just 3 stars because it's just okay compared to the rest of the strip buffets out there. for $35 a person for lunch, i think i could get more bang for my buck outside of the strip.  i'm sure i will eventually be back.  just remember, i'm not paying for dinner.", 
            "this buffet is awesome!! it ruined all other buffets for me forever.\n\nthe highlights were the huge pile of crab legs and the mashed potatoes were so awesome!!  the dessert selection was good, i expeced a little more( probably because of the pic on yelp) but it was still amazing ( the salted peanut  caramel gelato was the best)!! the coffee was really good too..\n\ncons: \n-service was lacking friendliness a bit but oh well, im still giving it 5 stars.\n-pricey ( luckily i had a coupon 2 for 1 price that i got on my <mark>Uni</mark> flight out).\n-they charge extra for espresso or a cappucino which i though was weird since its a buffet.\n\n i will definitly return on my next trip out!!!!!!!", 
            "wicked spoon gets four stars from me for quality variety. not just variety, but quality variety.\n\nit's nestled in the \"back\" of the cosmopolitan. so i feel like it's in an overlooked spot in an overlooked casino? there are signs, but you'll need to follow them upstairs and through some hallways in order to reach wicked spoon. while it is out of the way, it's also not right off a casino floor, which is nice, a bit less hectic.\n\nit markets itself as a little more of a foodie buffet, and i think it's delivers. for sunday brunch, they had things like gnocchi in tomato sauce, polenta with braised lamb, and wild mushroom risotto. there was their \"wicked\" fried chicken and mac & cheese (legitimately spicy, in the case of the mac & cheese), as well as a large buffet of cold cheeses and meats. good shrimp dumplings and dry fried green beans were also available. while you could get \"american\" breakfast, i was <mark>Uni</mark> in the face of their italian and asian counters. there's also several carving stations with good beef and pork options. i was stuffed by the time we got around to dessert, where there's a gelatto counter and dozens of small cakes, cookies, macaroons, and even bitter chocolate cakes, swimming in mini-cast iron skillets of caramel.\n\nfor about $15 extra, you can get unlimited mimosas or bloody marys, which, we figured, meant we'd have to get two drinks over the course of the meal to break even. easy deal when you consider the waiter was bringing two at a time for everyone at the table...we had a forest of mimosas by the end of the meal. so even if the drinks were a bit weak by reports, we had no problems getting them.\n\nbrunch ran me (sans alcohol option) about $38. was it a lot for brunch? maybe. but i'd never been to a buffet before, as most of my vegas trips are for conferences where lunch is provided and we're away from the casino floors and restaurants during the day. and the food was very good with great variety. so i'm perfectly content. i would consider a return on a future visit if i was nearby.", 
            "the food was great. service is excellent. they have quite a lot of selections. their small portion of each dish make it more <mark>Uni</mark>. try to go early if you don't want to wait in line.", 
            "what can i say, you are at a buffet which means it is your duty to indulge. now if you are like me, i would much rather indulge in my senses, slowly savoring all the flavors and taking tiny bites so you can try a little bit of everything. this is all in theory of course because what actually happened is quite a different story. we had to wait in line for 2 hours, it felt so long because i was honestly so starving. i noticed by around 2pm, the line was super short so i think it might be a good idea to come around then. \n\nthe food was nicely displayed and the dining area is of course nothing less than the extravagance that is expected in vegas. i nibbled my way through the food from <mark>Uni</mark> salads to meats to the asian foods. it was all very very good, but i did not think it was outstanding in any way. overall, the food offerings simmered but did not boil with the exception of a few dishes which stood out for me. however, i think the desserts were extremely tasty! i don't know why but the chocolate rice crispy really stood out to me. i have no idea why i liked it so much but i kinda wish i started with that because i was too full by dessert so i could only manage 2 bites of it. \n\noverall, recommend. relax and enjoy, feast away! oh! random side note, the milk for our coffee was in this mini tin metal milk carton, i appreciate that since i'm a super fan of random cute things.", 
            "came for sunday brunch...walked away a very satisfied customer. this place is one of the best buffets my wife and i have ever been to. loved the little plates since they allowed us to try almost everything in smaller portions. flavors were fresh and <mark>Uni</mark>, and there was something for every type of eater - even picky ones! the dessert island was also quite impressive, especially the gelato! the only reason this place gets a 4 and not a 5 is due to the service - took quite a while to get our drinks, and a little slower on clearing plates between rounds (likely due to how busy the place was). would definitely return, absolutely worth the $$!!", 
            "i give two stars because i'm comparing it to the other vegas buffets in the area. wicked spoon used to be good when i ate here about 3 years ago, but the quality has gone downhill since then. i was excited to see some <mark>Uni</mark> dishes like the bone marrow and the risotto, but everything else was pretty plain. \n\nthe asian section was the largest and had decent korean bbq and noodles, but the other dishes were packed in take out boxes. i think its supposed to be artsy but it came off as really cheap looking to be picking up takeout boxes at a $40.00 buffet. \n\nthe seafood section had the usual crab legs but that was about it. it would be the same stuff you would get at an asian buffet in california.\n\nthe soups were labeled as \"soup du jour\". i didn't know what that meant but one looked like gravy and the other tasted like clam chowder without the clams. i guess it was just cream. \n\nthere was little in the salad area and had mini dishes of seasoned mushrooms instead.\n\nanother buffet that has a similar concept but much better food is bacchanal at caesar's. that place is worth the $40.", 
            "i'd been looking forward to trying this <mark>Uni</mark> buffet and wasn't disappointed. the food was great and i had the chance to try at least 10 thing that i'd never tasted before and would never think to order in a restaurant (like cevice and shrimp and grits for example). the mac and cheese bar was great too.\n\nwicked spoon is a fraction of the size of other buffets, which is fine for the food part, but the desert offerings were underwhelming...\n\nwe got there at 8:30 and they told us \"last call for food is at 9:15\".  we noticed they shut the lights down even on the desert table at 9:15--which is where people were finishing up (and plenty were still eating). we were pretty much done by then but it felt pushy and cheap that they'd shut down desert at the same time as the rest of the buffet.", 
            "oh wicked spoon...\nyou have ruined me for life.\n\nthis is no ordinary vegas buffet.  in fact it probably doesn't even deserve to be grouped in with the category of typical vegas style buffets. the food is so <mark>Uni</mark> here, and you're telling me that i can eat as much as i like?  goodbye diet.\n\nkorean kalbi ribs - really good. bits of charred caramelized sauce covering the tender meat\n\nchinese style ribs - didn't have high expectations on this but fall off the bone yummy.\n\nchinese style crispy shrimp - nicely done.  eat the shells!  thats where the seasoning is.\n\nfried chicken wings - 2 to a basket.  nicely seasoned but wish the skin could have been crisped up a bit more.  still, the meat was really juicy inside.\n\ncrab legs - i was all crabbed out by the time we ate here but the crab legs are already sliced open for you to scoop out the meat.  none of that crack, bend and hope to pull out the meat bs.\n\nsushi - i'm glad there wasn't many sushi offerings here since buffet sushi is rarely good.  avocado roll for the kid was perfect.\n\nbone marrow - i tried it.  i don't get it.\n\nshepherd's pie  and beef brisket - by the time i got to these, i was already overstuffed.  i just had to taste it.\n\nsalads - kale salad, beet salad, smoked trout salad - all good\n\nshrimp with pea sprouts - holy moly good!\n\nmac and cheese station - got mine with green onion and bacon.  so tasty and the button sized noodles are perfect to poke with a fork.\n\ndesserts - cakes, mousses, gellato, chocolate covered strawberries.  so pretty and some with gold leaf or stamped with chocolate pictures.  \n\narnold palmer tasted kind of odd.  i'll order something different next time.\n\nservice was top notch.  waiter was great and another dude picked up the plates that were ever finished.  \n\nso for the price you pay, it is well worth the extra $5-10 splurge over the average strip buffet.  this will be the only buffet i'll be eating at on my next trip.", 
            "i am usually devoted to the wynn las vegas buffet, \"the buffet.\"  however, i am curious about trying alternatives.  i really like the wicked spoon buffet.  i am a huge fan of \"good presentations\" of food (perhaps that is one reason i like apple products, but that is another story for another day).  even before tasting the food, i fell in love with the way that the food is presented.  it just has a fun, approachable, and good natured vibe to the way that the food is presented.  to me, the small things matter a lot.  i also like the fact that this buffet likes to use creativity by adding items to the menu that are not found at other buffets, such as the bone marrow (which i normally would never order, and which even now, i still have mixed feelings about, but i did relish the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to try it).  i like the angry mac and cheese, korean kalbi ribs, salad, chicken pizza, prime rib, etc, etc.  i think they could use some practice on the sushi.  i had the spicy maki roll, but it didn't have much flavor.  i like that the environment itself was also \"upscale and chic\" and decidedly modern in style.", 
            "i've never experienced a buffet like this one.  it is truly <mark>Uni</mark>.  \n\nhave you ever been to a 5 star restaurant?  one of those fancy places where you pay $30 for some amazing culinary delight that comes beautifully arranged on a plate the size of a thumbnail?  great, now picture that that place was $35 per person and all you can eat, and you get the wicked spoon.  \n\nevery item on their buffet line is individually plated to give you that 5 star dining experience, but the restaurant is set up buffet style, so you can select whichever plates look tempting, and try it all...as much as you care to eat.  \n\nwe've eaten there 6 or 7 times, and have never had a bad experience.  their desserts are delightful, their mac & cheese bar is awesome, and their whipped potatoes are some of the best i've ever eaten.  my wife loves that they serve bone marrow (which is really hard to find) and that they have really high quality sushi.  \n\nthe atmosphere is upscale but not anywhere near black tie.  i wouldn't be comfortable there in shorts and a tee shirt, but business casual is appropriate.  the seats are very comfortable and spaced so you aren't sitting on top of the table next to you.  the noise level is not at all hushed, but it is quiet enough to easily carry on a conversation with those at your table.  their wine selection is much better than you'd find at a normal buffet, but nothing that would draw in a true vinophile.  \n\nif you are looking for a traditional buffet, this is not your place - but if you are in the mood for something a bit more upscale, wicked spoon at the cosmo offers a spectacular evening that will bring a tear to the eye of any foodie.", 
            "one would think that after a night of gambling losses and drunken debauchery in vegas, the last thing you'd want to do is throw down some more bones on a buffet brunch. well, if you keep thinking like that you'll be dead soon. medical science has proven it. what's worse, you'll have died without getting the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to gorge yourself on the gastronomic feast -- and excellent hangover cure -- that is wicked spoon.\n\ni found myself in that very same scenario recently. i was staying at aria and i met some friends down at mandalay bay for a \"pub crawl\" of casinos, where we stay at each resort long enough to enjoy two drinks before moving to the next one. by the time we got to monte carlo we were hammered. and i started chatting to this canadian cheerleader at the blackjack table. we took some tequila shots and had a cartwheel competition. shortly after that i blacked out*\n\nthe following day i awoke to a phone ringing. a guy i know who lives locally was waiting for me at the cosmopolitan so we could grab brunch. i forgot we'd made plans. i was in no mood to eat, but i couldn't cancel at the last minute, so i rinsed off and brushed my teeth and trudged over to meet him. he brought me to the wicked spoon, and spent the next three-plus hours stuffing our faces. i love the individual servings you can grab instead of having to pile mountains of unrelated foodstuffs on your plate. and there were breads, and meats, and mac and cheeses, eggs in little skillets, french toast, huevos rancheros...and then suddenly we went back up to refill our plates and (gasp) the menu had changed to lunch. so we got to eat even more food in addition to the already disgusting amount of breakfast we'd put away. there were pastas, and gnocchi, and brussels sprouts, and different mac and cheeses, and more meats. before we left, natch, we had to have dessert too. chocolate chip cookie sandwiches filled with gelato. it was gluttony plain and simple, and i loved every delicious bite.\n\n* it turns out what happened was i went back to the cheerleader's room with her, and stayed there for a few hours, but passed out on the bathroom floor before i could seal the deal. she rifled through my jacket for my phone and used it to call the last number i'd dialed (which luckily was my roommate) and he came and fetched me and took me back to my room. apparently in the whole ordeal took some amount of time, because she called my roommate later to complain that i'd made her miss her flight back to canada.\n\nmy mom was right. i really am a catch!", 
            "had dinner here on a tuesday night and we were seated immediately.  service was great - drinks brought out quickly, plates cleared efficiently and waitress was very pleasant. we enjoyed how everything was pre-portioned out in cute individual servings dishes, which included tiny fry baskets and tiny pots. good selection of seafood, veggies and pastas.  they also had crab legs which were pre-split in half lengthwise, which made it nice & easy to get the crab meat out.  i also had a good share of the bone marrow, which was also split in half lengthwise for easy access.  the tiny slice of margherita pizza was surprisingly good - but they ran out by the time i made my 2nd go-around. be sure to save room for the large dessert selection.  my favorite desserts were the macarons, the gelato and the giant chocolate covered strawberries.  they had a large gelato selection with flavors ranging from pistachio, chocolate & berries.  however, the panna cotta was more like a pudding and not at all like panna cotta, but at least it wasn't overly sweet.  my one complaint is that the hot foods seemed to cool down really quickly.  everything i ate seemed to be room temperature by the time i sat down, which makes me wonder how hot they are keeping everything.\ni would recommend this buffet for everyone at least once.  the various salads were <mark>Uni</mark> and well plated, there was a large variety of different types of food and the restaurant was well laid out and decorated nicely.", 
            "this is now my favorite buffet in vegas.\n\nlove the way they hand out nicely portioned <mark>Uni</mark> of dishes in little containers. they had these micro pots of short rib with polenta that were definitely the best thing in the whole place. wicked spoon may not have the breadth of the carnival world buffet at the rio, or the seafood offerings of bacchanal, but what it has is all pretty tasty (and all come in cute containers!).\n\nthe dessert section is amazing, too. chocolate-covered strawberries for days. gelato bar? yes please. when we went, we had a huge group, and we all got the all-you-can-drink option, so they just gave us a few bottles of champagne and juice mixers, and let us go to town. amazing.", 
            "wicked spoon isn't bad at all for a buffet. it averages $30/person. they have a good variety in entree choices but it's their dessert selection that makes this place good.\n\nif you're a big seafood person, then this may not be the buffet for you because there isn't a big seafood area with crab legs spilling over, shrimp and mussels.  however, they do come out with other <mark>Uni</mark> dishes. and there is what seems like an endless choice in desserts. i loved their chocolate covered strawberries, macaroons, cheesecake bites and gelato. \n\nanother plus about wicked spoon is that most of their selections come in individually portioned plates since that makes it less messy and so you aren't picking around at food that other people touched.", 
            "it's funny. i had breakfast here a few months ago. the food was fine, but i walked out thinking that the staff just seemed....well, dickish. my server brought me one water and i never saw him again. i stopped a different server to ask if perhaps my guy was on break. he said, \"no,\" and walked away. not, \"i'll get him for you\" or even the ideal answer: \"how may *i* help?\" \n\nbut wicked spoon has a bunch of solid reviews, so i held off on writing mine until i could go back for a second opinion.\n\ntoday was that day.\n\ni walked in with three friends and approached the cashier shortly after 2pm. her greeting to us? \"did you hear what she told those people?\" \n\nhuh? did we hear what who told whom?\n\nrolling her eyes to the next cashier, the bundle of hospitality sneered, \"she said we're closed. we close at two.\" \n\nwell excuse the flying fock out of us. maybe someone could post a sign to that effect at the entrance? maybe you could get off your lazy ass and click the velvet rope thingy across the entrance to the zig-zag waiting line chute? either of those would work since you clearly do not have the personality necessary to comm<mark>Uni</mark> the information verbally.\n\ni hadn't told my buddies about my first impression of the service here. but every one of us left with a lasting impression this time. \n\nthe cashier could have used fewer words and, frankly, done her job by simply being, oh, i dunno...polite. she could have said, \"i am so sorry, gentlemen. buffet seating ends at 2pm daily so we can begin setting up for dinner service. please come back and see us.\" but she'd rather be a bitch. no, not just a bitch. a bitch who was so goddamn lazy, she tried to get us out of there by relying on the other cashier's verbiage to some other guests that we never saw.\n\ncosmopolitan? my ass.\n\nactually, i'm sorta happy things went down this way. the bitchy clerk managed to confirm everything i walked away feeling the first time. and i didn't have to blow $25 on the buffet this time.", 
            "we had a reservation to go to this buffet! since, we had a party of more than 12 people we simply walked in & paid.  it was pricey, but worth it.\n\nfrom all the buffet i have been in las vegas, wicked spoon is far the most <mark>Uni</mark> ones i have ever been to.  i really loved that they had their servings in tiny pots or pans.  i thought it was a genius idea because it helped with \"portion-control.\"  i was able to try more food items than i usually do in buffets! \ntheir desserts were pretty awesome as well!  \n\nthe service was consist and i love how they had a cute water pitcher on the table already.  \n\noverall, a great buffet.  just be ready to wait in line!", 
            "presentation was really wonderful. individual portions for some dishes really give it a nice touch! however it was a hit or miss with our party. the men in our group wasn't too impressed by the whole thing, mostly because lack of variety. \n\ni personally thought that wicked spoon is pretty <mark>Uni</mark> from other vegas buffets. their salad station was excellent. i loved the caesar salad and the kale salad, and really appreciated that they had brie, cheeses, and fruits. oh! and bagels with smoked salmon! i also got to try bone marrow for the first time (i always think that buffets should be an opport<mark>Uni</mark> to try lots of new foods!), and the fact that they had chocolate dipped strawberries was all sorts of fabulous. \n\ni would skip their lava cake because it's not lava cake... take it if you want a chocolate cake though. i loved their cheese cake,  and everyone seemed to like the gelato. i kept coming back for the strawberries though, even if i had to scrape the chocolate off. the strawberries really were nice and sweet!", 
            "i was very very very underwhelmed by this place. really folks... the deal is not what it used to be and they are living on lost reputation... kinda like a chicken that is running around after its head is cut off. \n\nyes they have some intriguing and great items here. however when i was just here, not 1 person was impressed. when i see the prices that people used to pay of $22 for brunch/breakfast, i can agree my whole outlook would likely be different. however the price is not $39+tax & tip. so realistically you are looking at a $50 meal. is this place worth that? to be bluntly brutally honest, ohhh hell no! it's a standard vegas buffet.\n\nthe good: \nbangers n mash - hands down the best tasting item on the menu. the sausage snapped when taking a bite. even on a precut portion. the gravy was perfect. however the mash was one of the best, if not the best, that i may have ever had.\n\nstir fry beef - my second favorite item on the menu. but you can get the same results from just about any good chinese restaurant for $10-15.\n\nwatermelon juice - super tasty, but i cant remember what exactly that they called it\n\nkalbie ribs - if you like strong flavors (perhaps over the top) this was an awesome thing to eat as well. there was no subtlety here it was in your face taste and i loved it.\n\ngelatto - hit and miss, but the mint chip was outstanding and the best of the 5 flavors that i tried.\n\ncheesecake - very rich moist and extremely filling in small portions\n\nbacon! just the right level of crispy and soft. very flavorful, and tasted more how i make my bacon than i almost ever find at a restaurant.\n\nthe ok:\nprime rib au jus\nblue cheese\ncream corn with red n green peppers\nmost of the deserts\n\nthe <mark>Uni</mark>:\nangry mac n cheese - bad day? the cheese wasn't creamy and seemed to be separating, very oily\nlinked sausage from the carving station - no snapping, no taste, no interest\nfried chicken - no taste hardly at all. the colonel 's chicken is ten billion times better than this. (several of the yelpers i was eating with agreed that this is the worst that they have tasted chicken from wicked spoon)\ngnocchi - very very bland with an unanticipated consistency, almost grainy if that makes sense. definitely different from when i have had this in the past\nthe asian riblets - very weird tasting and i only took a small niblet to figure that one out\n\nthe five billion little dishes for food to come in. this is an utter nightmare. i do like that all the dishes can be tasted separately, but it's still a royal pain in the derri\\u00e8re!  this is easily solved by plates with dividers on them as an option... it is a buffet err cafeteria after all. ohhh wait, does it matter? they ran out of all of these lil pint size dishes and started putting out large bowls for things previously in mini dishes.\n\nthe service sucked. i had to ask for more juice several times and they didn't want to take the dirty dishes even though we had piles of mini bowls, baskets, plates, etc... then when they did take plates from us, they just grabbed everything from you including what you may still have been working on.\n\nin summation, for the money spent, this place is not worth it to go to again for me. perhaps it was a bad day. at least i didn't wait in line for this crap like so many others were doing. drop the price, kills the stupid excess dishes, improve service, make sure you don't have an off day in the kitchen, and i bet i may like it. i would have been satisfied in the $20 range. but at a base price of double that, it simply does not even remotely contemplate being a good deal...\n\none last thing, being it was brunch, if you wanted champagne, mimosa's, or alcohol period, that was an additional fee. bottomless mimosa's was an additional $10 per person!", 
            "forget the casino where your wallet takes a pounding, this is where your body takes p<mark>Uni</mark>. but look at yourself in the mirror, man, you did it to yourself. leg of lamb, prime rib, wild boar, kalbi ribs, spicy shrimp, mac-n-cheese, gnocchi, cheeses, salads, breads, and then the... ok stuff, which is too much too mention. eye in the sky sees you eating like a gluttonous pig. pace self with sanctity. #foodslut",

            "2 years later and still the best buffet in las vegas hands down.  the presentation of the dishes, the quality, and the variety all make for an enjoyable experience.  the design of the restaurant in also so beautiful !!  they make all their ice creams in-house, offering <mark>Uni</mark> flavors like thai tea and peanut butter and jelly.  sooooo good!  save room for dessert!",

            "awesome buffet. i had heard good things about this buffet, so naturally i had to try it. everything was very delicious up until the third round when i hit the italian and asian cuisine areas. unfortunately some of the pasta sauces were too strong, and the sushi area was mediocre. that was a bit of a buzzkill, but thankfully the dessert station more than made up for it. the desserts were bomb.com. our server was also very nice and kept checking up on us making sure we were doing ok and taking our used plates. i will definitely come back if the opport<mark>Uni</mark> arises.",

            "going to vegas buffets is always a pleasure, can't think of any city i have been to that has better buffets. but comparatively, as i've gone to a majority of vegas buffets, this was just average for me. i thought it was a rather small buffet and i was expecting a larger selection of  <mark>Uni</mark> foods. but i found a lot of the same kinds of foods i commonly saw in vegas buffets. but did end up stuffing myself - a bit too much for my own good i'd think.\nservers, staff and cooks were great and friendly though, for the most part. and oddly enough, when i went on a saturday night at 7, there was no line; but that could be due to the fact there were protests by employees (or ex-employees) outside for some reason.", 
            "just got back from vega and i went to wicked spoon on a sunday night, the food quality was fantastic but the variety was limiting. overall i would still give it 4 stars just on the quality of the food as well as the quality of the service. i think we pad $41 per person but i got a buy one get one free coupon on my <mark>Uni</mark> airlines flight. i would recommend to anyone to go to this buffet if they get a chance.", 
            "talk about a buffet you must go to! this is the place to go for endless portions of high quality food. there are tons of options to choose from when it comes to buffets in vegas and a lot of people that the buffets at rio and bellagio are hard to beat, and if that's the case, wicked spoon definitely gives those places a run for its money. if you the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to go to wicked spoon....don't argue, just go! .....now! haha\n\nthe place -\nthere isn't anything too special about the place; however the tables and chairs are definitely of good quality and they keep the place really clean. if it weren't for the obvious buffet stations and people constantly getting up for their 3rd of 4th plates, you can sometimes forget that you're in a buffet at all!\n***** 5/5 stars *****\n\nthe service -\ni was in town for a conference and, coming here before, i just knew i had to come here again to their delicious brunch options. even though it's a buffet, that does not mean excellent customer service is not required and wicked spoon definitely delivers. the cashiers were all very friendly and always had smiles on their faces. the hostess who took me to my seat was very social, nice, and struck up general conversation as we walked. as soon as i sat down, i was approached by the waiter responsible for my section and he immediately took my drink order. the drinks stayed full and he was always asking if i needed anything else or if everything was ok. really great job, guys!\n**** 4/5 stars ****\n\nthe food -\nif i wrote about all the food options they offer, i'm sure i would exceed the character limit for yelp reviews and would also be forced to split it into various chapters haha. so with that being said, everything here is delicious and of great quality. what really makes wicked spoon <mark>Uni</mark>, however, is their method of presenting certain entrees. some dishes, like the fried chicken, come in their own miniature deep fry basket that you put on your plate and others come in ramekins or miniature griddles, such as the mac & cheese and others. there's a typical carvery with fresh cooked meats and during brunch, there's an omelette station that also offers egg white omelettes should you want one. the salads and fruit options are all fresh and in that same section, freshly carved deli meats are available as well....reminded me much of a charcuterie. before this portion goes on forever, i'm just gonna leave it at wicked spoon not having a bad thing on their offerings. like i said, everything is delicious and everyone should be able to find something appealing to their taste buds and palette.\n**** 4/5 stars ****\n\noverall -\ni try and make it a point to come to wicked spoon every time i come to vegas. while the bellagio buffet is still pretty good, it's outdated...and while the rio is regarded as having one of the best buffets in vegas, it's a little ways off the strip and can sometimes be an inconvenience. wicked spoon is situated, conveniently, on the strip and offers great food on top of that. if you're looking for a buffet that separates itself from the rest with delicious food, look no further and come to wicked spoon! i promise, you won't regret it! thanks!", 
            "all i can say is, wow, wow, wow.  now, don't get me wrong, the wicked spoon was not the perfect buffet, but i can tell you this: it was without a doubt the best buffet i have been to in las vegas in years, and that is a lot of different buffets.  just to make sure, we went again the next night because my wife had won a free dinner on the identity member wheel and we thought \"well, lets use it because we dont want to lose it in 7 days\", plus, it was just that good the first time to go back the next night.\n\nthe choices include typical buffet foods such as prime rib and cold crab legs, but after that the differences range from subtle to what i would consider, broad.  sublle differences included ricotta creamed spinach (aswesome, silky and flavorful), shrimps sauteed to order in mango butter or a selection of others, and our favorite: roaste bone marrow.  broad differences included grilled cowboy bacon (pork belly in a  zesty bbq sauce) to deep-fried pig's tail.\n\nall of the food was really, really good and at times bordering on great.  seasoning was spot on in most cases, what also  makes this <mark>Uni</mark> is the portioning: much of the food comes already in these great little containers that look like littel saute pans or pots.", 
            "nothing great and feels like your in a convention center. at 41 per person go upstairs to many of the fine restaurants and enjoy your meal. bone marrow was disgusting.  crab legs, skimpy. the only thing i enjoyed was the octopus salad. it was just odd and <mark>Uni</mark>.", 
            "this is the best buffet u can find in vegas! the decor phenomenal. the food is great and there's so much variety that you would not ever see in another buffet. this is a <mark>Uni</mark> buffet that is worth the $42! i've been to several buffets in vegas including the wynn but wicked spoon was the best in my personal opinion.  dessert section is wonderful. great gelato choices.", 
            "i love this buffet. have done it three or four times now. have taken folks right from mccarran. especially love the small creamy polenta....how do they do that?\n\nbut here's the gripe...those are the most hideous <mark>Uni</mark> i have ever seen on the female wait staff. not one woman looked attractive in them...they seem to highlight everyone's worst feature! i can't imagine putting that on every day! geez, beautiful place...give the staff attractive <mark>Uni</mark>. ihop has better outfits.", 
            "the best buffet i've ever been too.  the food presentation is very <mark>Uni</mark> & makes the food appear irresistible.  tons of desserts & a wide variety of great tasting food to choose from.", 
            "the first time i went to the wicked spoon, i was so excited and happy from the food and experience.  i feel like now the quality has gone down.  it is good to try at least once because of their <mark>Uni</mark> way in which they present the dishes, but the food quality is definitely not as high anymore.", 
            "it's one wicked buffet indeed! hip and trendy, this is located inside the very chic cosmopolitan hotel. \n\ni've frequented this buffet quite a handful of times now so my review here is long overdue. my last visit was over thanksgiving and it was only by default that we came because our original plan was to hit up bacchanal buffet (the new and very hyped up buffet at the caesars palace) which had a ridiculous wait of 3-4 hours at 2pm. sorry, i'm not that crazy to stay in line that long. wicked spoon here we come! ohhhh yeah!!\n\n45 minutes of waiting in line to pay and another 45 minutes to get seated, not bad! we paid about $50 per person for dinner as opposed to $60 in bacchanal for their thanksgiving rate. you have to pay extra $$ if you want mimosa included. \n\nso among the plethora of food choices to choose from, arranged by cuisines from all corners of the world, below is an outline of the reasons why i love wicked spoon. \n\nfor starters, i went crazy over these:\n-pumpkin soup---not sure what else is in this soup aside from the pumpkin but it's hearty and addicting! \n-<mark>King Crab</mark> legs---fresh and sweet! \n-shrimp cocktail---succulent! \n\nfrom the carving station:\n-bone marrow---i ate this like there was no tomorrow. i probably need to see a heart doctor soon but it was all worth it. \"a moment on your lips, a lifetime on the hips!\" \n-roast beef---yummm...\n-lamb---cooked perfectly, not gamey, tender, juicy, tasty...need i say more!?\n-turkey---not a turkey fan but it was thanksgiving so i had to eat some. it was great! \n\nseafood entrees:\n-shrimps---cooked in butter, garlic, and other spices. i got down and dirty eating these crustaceans. delicious!\n-mussels mariniere---i had 3 bowls of these. the sauce was fantastic! i was literally slurping it down. \n\nasian corner:\n-roasted pork belly---5-spice infused, the pork was beautifully cooked. it was juicy, tender, and flavorful! the crispy skin was a nice added touch. \n\ncarbo loading:\n-paella\n-mushroom risotto\n-mac n cheese---dude!! they have a made-to-order station for this! it's amazing! you get to pick what you want in your mac n cheese. sooooo goooood!\n\ndessert:\n-chocolate covered strawberries---this is one sight to behold and an indulgence to partake. a must!\n-gelato---a myriad of flavors to choose from...you'll go crazy! thai iced tea and nutella were my top two favorites! \n-macarons---last but not the least, these are not to be missed. they had the mango flavored that day and it was divine! sad to say, the next batch didn't have the same perfect consistency as the first ones i've had. all's well though because i may have had as much as my heart's content before the 2nd batch came out.   \n\nserving:\nmost of their dishes are already pre-plated in small portions. it's nice how they do this because not only does it minimize waste, it also allows you to try small portions of all the food selections they have to offer without over filling yourself. i like their concept: <mark>Uni</mark> and practical! \n\nservice:\n-from the people at the register, to the receptionist, and to the server, everyone were all smiles and efficient in what they do. our plates were cleared whenever needed and our drinks were always filled. top-notch service! \n\nfor now, i think wicked spoon is the best buffet in vegas. quality food and service. then again, i have yet to try what bacchanal has to offer. until then...", 
            "stayed four nights at this hotel and on last night of my stay, finally dined at their buffet. it wasn't crowded but the place was somewhat busy. the food wasn't spectacular, but good enough for me to finish everything i brought to my table. disappointed with the crab legs. otherwise, they had some items to make me consider coming back next time. the price was reasonable. the suite i stay in and the style of the hotel are what attract me here. and the buffet is convenient. the ambience at the buffet is appealing and somewhat <mark>Uni</mark>. they think outside the box to some extent and it works. it's not the best buffet in vegas, but i wouldn't mind eat here, especially if i stay at the hotel.", 
            "wicked spoon is not your typical buffet. they offer a variety of well thought of gourmet dishes. the dishes reflect cosmopolitan's \"right amount of wrong\". from the bone marrow, lamb shanks and truffle risotto, it's just the right amount of wrong to look for in a good dining experience.  i can see how a lot of people wouldn't like it because you don't find the usual stuff you get from a typical buffet. they do have a lot of stuff that you don't typically find on other buffet/restaurant. quality of food is excellent. fresh and prepared creatively. if your looking for a <mark>Uni</mark> dining experience this is the place to go.", 
            "warning: i'm about to go into full detail of every aspect of wicked spoon so if you just want the quick version skip to the bottom!\n\ni kid you not, i sampled almost everything. so here goes.\n\nasian: don't be lured in by the ridiculously cute takeout boxes. the ddukboki, or korean spicy rice cakes were horrendous. any korean who tried that probably swore shibal because they were absolutely horrible. i don't ever eat rice or panda express type dishes at buffets, that's just dumb. sushi rolls looked unappealing. nigiri had a lot of rice but the salmon was fresh. kalbi short ribs were pretty decent, tender and marinated well maybe a little under seasoned. star of the section was pork belly. i really had to stop myself from eating a whole block. slather on the hoisin sauce, how did they know it would complement the fatty cuts so well?!\n\nitalian: bleu cheese and short ribs pizza was a no go. the meat was tough, under seasoned, and dry. mussels had no flavor even though they were swimming in sauce. risotto was rich and creamy but i'm no connoisseur. pasta cavatappe next to it was yummy. meatballs were tender, nothing spectacular. rice was bland. brussels sprouts were not good. \n\nmeat station: shepherds pie had a really funky taste that i didn't enjoy. they were really cute served in a mini skillet though. candied yams are my weakness. i mean marshmallows and yams, hello. prime rib was sooo delicious. get two slices minimum. bone marrow intrigued me but i didn't like the texture. it was just really fatty and oily in my mouth. not pleasant at all. the huge ribs next to the prime rib were sad. not tender, not seasoned, overcooked. the fingerlings in duck confit were not good. i didn't taste anything <mark>Uni</mark> or duck-like. fried chicken was ok. not super crispy or spectacularly seasoned, once again. man, i think the head chef might have been sick cause i'm now seeing a pattern. i'm asian, we like our food well seasoned!!!\n\nsalads: watermelon with balsamic dressing was a nice, juicy, and refreshing bite. kale salad was worth trying. and the soup, which was unlabeled, was ok. nothing else worth trying except maybe the ceviche. \n\nseafood section: get the mac and cheese with prime rib. those were like little nuggets of gold swimming in a cheesy pool. tender and a little fatty and oh so delicious with the cheese sauce. salmon was cooked perfectly with this tangy white sauce and buttery butternut squash bed. \n\ndessert: this was the absolute star of the show both in taste and presentation. see the picture of my plate to see how much i enjoyed myself here. two words: pistachio gelato. hands down, the best pistachio flavor i've ever tasted. seriously like eating a mouthful of toasted pistachios in every spoonful. it was so nutty and creamy. this is how pistachio gelato should taste. strawberry balsamic was <mark>Uni</mark> but i didn't get that much of the balsamic flavor. salted peanut caramel really fell short for me. the apple caramel puff is really deceiving to the eye because it looks like a toasted meringue sitting on a little tartlet. the puff is filled with this tangy and slightly sweet green apple custard on a thick, gooey caramel. it was a beautiful sensation of flavors and textures in your mouth. skip the molten chocolate cake (and most of the chocolate desserts actually) and go for the warm apple crumble. that warm apple crumble was heavenly, i couldn't stop eating it! it was warm and cinnamony with the perfect crunchy topping, ugh, magical. the white chocolate mousse cone brought the child out in me. it's like the bottom part of the drumstick cone that's filled with the surprise chocolate nugget but instead with yummy white chocolate mousse. the carrot cake was perfect. orange macaron was too crunchy and sugary.\n\nfinal verdict: wicked spoon did not wow me as i had hoped for. maybe i had my expectations set too high but if i'm going to be paying $50+ for a buffet it better be damn good. i think i really expected for this buffet to be filled with <mark>Uni</mark> and innovative dishes. there was mostly traditional dishes that they attempted to revamp but failed to execute well. i would not wait more than 30 min on a normal weekend and 1 hour on a holiday weekend. if it's going to take longer, go somewhere else. if you are looking for lots of variety and amazing seafood, this is not the buffet for you. however, this buffet is worth checking out if you love dessert and appreciate beautiful presentations of food. the ambiance is gorgeous and hip. the staff is friendly. but the food is just ok. this buffet is slightly overhyped. a cool scene to hang out in since it's in the new cosmo hotel and all, but overhyped, definitely overhyped. my advice: do the $18 express take out box deal if you're not willing to commit $40+ on the buffet. you get to sample as much as gourmet food you can fit in a togo box (without overeating too much) for less than 20 bucks. i don't know if you get to forgo the line but it's a pretty sweet deal if you ask me!", 
            "one of my favorite buffets in vegas and i consider myself a buffet-lover!  wicked spoon is on the high-end of the buffet spectrum with individual servings, <mark>Uni</mark> (but tasteful) combinations of food, great service, and impeccable presentation.  it is expensive, but you're paying for quality of food and convenience of having a huge variety of quality foods.  you expect crappy food at a cheap buffet, right?  exact opposite at wicked spoon.", 
            "3.5 stars. weekday dinner for $38 is a pretty great deal for a fairly <mark>Uni</mark> and diverse spread of selection, but the food was just okay.\n\nhits:\n- lamb: omg amazing. amazingly tender and flavorful.\n- desserts: what a spread! it helps that everything is dark chocolate + raspberry which is the best combination known to mankind (or at least my taste buds)\n- antipasti: they had some nice little dishes like marinated beets and balsamic glazed watermelon, as well as a nice selection of cheese and charcuterie\n\nmisses:\n- prime rib: it was really inconsistent to downright bad - pieces were mostly rubbery and flavorless\n- bone marrow: props to them if just for having it because the pieces are really bony and flavorless \n- italian: i had some polenta thing with beef tongue (i think) and a risotto, and both were really bland. good thing they're served as small plates so i didn't waste that much food.\n\nthis is far from vegas's best buffet, but the ambience is fun, the small plates make it different, and the price is right. however, if you're gonna do a vegas buffet, you might as well go all out and hit up one of their top rated joints (bellagio caesars palace etc.) instead.", 
            "yum! an expensive buffet! probably in the top 10 \"on the strip\" buffets. \n\nambiance: 4 - an organized setting for food and seating. there's quite a lot of space to walk around with a mess of plates and food. \n\nservice: 4 - service was good until we reached almost the end of our dinner. the server stopped visiting our table, and i never received my tea. \n\nfood: 4 - quality food; some cooked well, some not. many dishes are aesthetically designed on separate dishes, which can sometimes be difficult to balance on your plate while grabbing other foods. \n\nthe dessert and salad sections were the most pleasing foods out of the whole selection, and they are prepared well. also, the gelato is great, but you can get it at any great buffet! \n\nbecause of ws's reputation, they should offer a really <mark>Uni</mark> and tasty dessert that people will line up for!", 
            "we just ate our sunday brunch at wicked spoon and loved it! all of their dishes have a <mark>Uni</mark> spin to them which makes this buffet stand out. they have a wide variety of dishes; sushi, asian cuisine, meats, bone marrow, side dishes, breakfast specials, salad bar, meat/cheese bar, and a dessert bar. i enjoyed everything i had. the only thing i was disappointed about was they did not have crab legs in their breakfast set up. however, they did have them for dinner. the service was impeccable. the server was on top of taking our dishes, filling up our drinks in a timely manner. i would definitely come back!", 
            "i had spent all week trying to decide between wicked spoon and bacchanal. i had been to bacchanal before and so this time i thought i would try something new even though i knew bacchanal was a sure thing. plus it was closer to our hotel so laziness won. \n\ngot there and paid for brunch price before 3pm (around $35 on a saturday) but soon after they changed to the dinner menu so lucky for us. for brunch they do not have seafood like crab and such so thats dissapointing because bacchanal had it all day. crab is always delicious so cant complain about that. \n\noverall, nothing really special that stands out. the bone marrow was the one <mark>Uni</mark> thing i had not seen before but it was super greasy and not as flavorful and i was hoping. had to add some of the salt they give you. top sirloin was pretty good though. everything else is pretty generic and there was not as much variety as bacchanal. the asian section was sad and i was kinda hoping for some soups. \n\nnext time i'll just pay a little more and tell my feet to suck it up and walk to bacchanal which is a sure thing.", 
            "two important contexts of this review.  first, this review is for the breakfast/brunch.  i haven't tried the buffet for dinner.\nsecond, the comparison is from the perspective that this is a buffet.  i'm not going to compare a buffet to jose andres's place at cosmo.\n\nthis is the best breakfast buffet that i've been to in vegas.  it may not have some features that certain people adore (like giant mounds of crab legs), but what they have is often <mark>Uni</mark> and well done.  love the sticky-buns!  loved the homemade slab of bacon.  we got a end piece that was overly salty, and when combined with a middle slice was perfect.\n\nthis is only buffet in vegas we make plans to attend, and that i look forward to.\n\nwe also enjoyed the best service we've had at a buffet.  our server quickly learned all our names, served us promptly, and knew the buffet in great detail and made numerous recommendations.\n\n5 stars -- as good as it gets (for a buffet in vegas).", 
            "whyyyyy was i so hungover when i came here?!?! such a waste. but it was so good....\n\ni liked all the random things that came in the mini metal pots. can't remember what they were now but i know they all had such <mark>Uni</mark> flavor. i wish they had more shellfish to choose from but the mussels were pretty good.\n\nmy #1 recommended thing to eat here... ice cream. i got the mint and the mango and oh my goddddd i wanted to eat 10 scoops.", 
            "this is a direct comparison to other las vegas buffets and their food definitely falls in the top 3 of best of vegas buffets. (see also the buffet in wynn and bacchanal in caesar's palace). keep in mind it is a buffet and you will find much better executed food at actual restaurants. \n\nthe wait can be a bit extreme during weekends and especially during peak times of the year. when in rome, or vegas, i prefer to save my buffet days to a day when i feel it won't be as crowded so i haven't experienced a crowd much much but even if i had to, i'd wait here. it's worth the experience, even if you try this place at least once. \n\nthere are many great places to eat in vegas, much better than even this buffet, so if you're not looking to gorge yourself, then maybe bust out that yelp app. \n\nwhat makes this buffet stand out are the individual dishes here that i prefer over other buffets that may have a bit more selection. duck confit ravioli, kbbq ribs (though not the best), mac and cheese bar, tiny portioned out salads, fried chicken, charcuterie station, and those random little dishes that have a different twist of flavors that you won't find at other buffets make me enjoy the difference here. many of their dishes are served in individual containers so it's interesting. \n\ni do feel there is a strong difference in quality, execution and variety of dishes you'll find here throughout the year. when i went in january, it wasn't memorable, and definitely not the place i've hyped up to some people. during summer, it's so busy but you'll still find days in the week where the line won't be as long as the weekends and there are more food options. \n\nas for dessert, they have better desserts elsewhere, but their gelato is made in house and the flavors are <mark>Uni</mark>. \n\nif you're looking for many types of different cuisine and a wide assortment of dishes within that type of food or cuisine, you're better off going to bacchanal.", 
            "so this was a total waste of time. after all the raving i'd heard about this buffet and a family member's recommendation...i decided to make my way with my mom to try out this buffet. my naivety made me think that the cosmo, being a proponent for the alternative lifestyle would cater somewhat to a vegetarian. so i paid ~$28 per person for a brunch buffet. \n\nlet me preface the rest of this review by saying that if i only had 2 dishes to sample and they were of excellent quality...i'd keep my mouth shut. i had a large number of dishes to sample...none of them inventive, none of them delicious and none of them memorable in any way. the salads were bleh...there was a greek salad, kale salad, oven-dried tomatoes, caprese and beet salad. all of which did not entice seconds (considering i couldn't even palate the one tablespoon of each salad i took). the angry mac and cheese was shells, velvet and some hot sauce. although purportedly vegetarian, i spied a few bowls of them with bacon bits. not cool.\n\nthere was the usual italian fare...gnocchi with a basil tomato and black garlic sauce (average), sweet pea risotto (horrible) and cheese pizza (how <mark>Uni</mark>). the asian section had chicken powder/stock in everything. i was told by one chef that the udon was vegetarian...then another one said, no it was not. i gave up and didn't even try it. i asked if they could make me a simple vegetable roll with soy paper but low and behold...the sushi they get is prepackaged and bought from some conglomerate like sysco. cosmo...weren't you supposed to be different and awe-inspiring?\n\nthe bread offered was bagels (like two types) and there were three types of sad cheeses on the charcuterie. pathetic. the only thing i had with some glee was the red velvet pancake.the chocolate covered strawberries was a nice touch but the rest of the desserts not too good. they do have a pretty legit gelato bar if that's your scene. \n\ni had about $5 worth of food. my mom is pissed off at a bad lunch and i'm seething with anger at the absolute blasphemy that is wicked spoon. wynn, bachannal and bellagio are way better that this crap. in other news, service was ok and the decor was as if i was in a conference room.\n\navoid.", 
            "wickedly good!  not your vegas everyday buffet.  we liked the variety and <mark>Uni</mark> dishes! went on a monday for \"brunch\" at around 11.  no wait.  interesting variety like, salmon eggs benedict.  omelet's freshly prepared.  apple and maple sausage. spicy mac and cheese. kale salad. pork belly. sushi. shrimp. korean style ribs. loved the small individual servings for many dishes. fantastic desert offerings....including sugar free chocolate moose!  who else does that?   nice modernistic dining setting with flat screen tv monitors displaying informative definitions of different food types and ingredients.  priced moderately for a strip hotel but you can use your players card and apply a discount to the bill.  overall...very impressed and we recommended!", 
            "finally got the chance to eat at wicked spoon after hearing many good things about it. usually when i come to vegas, i always eat at bachannal inside caesar's palace. however, we decided differently this time around. in the plus side, this buffet is more on the inexpensive side compared to other vegas buffets. for the price, the food is definitely worth it; around $43! \n\ni really enjoyed the cute chinese boxes they had with udon noodles, mixed veggies, etc. they added a <mark>Uni</mark> touch to the typical buffet feel. included a wide variety of food. lots of small, individually prepared dishes; just like the ones at bachannal, as well. since it was sunday, their brunch items stayed out until 3, so it was nice to have breakfast too. who doesn't love super crispy bacon for lunch? or anytime of the day for that matter! their freshly squeezed juice or \"wicked juice\" we're poured into shot sized glasses and was really yummy. \n\nour waitress was nice and made suggestions on which foods to try because it was <mark>Uni</mark> to their particular buffet. but, you could tell she was really preoccupied with other tables and how busy it was. the good thing was, other waiters and waitresses would constantly ask if we needed refills or if we needed any help. \n\nthe price also includes gratuity so it was one less thing to worry about after we were finished eating. definitely will add wicked spoon to one of my go to buffets in vegas", 
            "does anyone know how to give no stars? this place must serve the worst buffet on the strip. i don't understand how anyone would like this food.  originally, we wanted to have the buffet at caesars, however, the wait was about an hour wait. thus, wicked spoon was the alternative. they informed us that there was no wait. so great. when the we got there, the place was practically empty. i think everyone went to caesars. lol\n\ni have to say that the food was terrible. i figured that i would like something but nothing was to my liking. for example, the crab legs was sliced open for you so that it would be easier to eat, however, by doing so, its prevents freshness. i rather do a little work because crab legs is suppose to be eaten that way. they have very cheap food, such as fried rice, fried chicken, pizza, shrimp cocktail, meat, salads, and the like. oh, forget about the sushi, they were so disgusting, they must be sitting there the whole day. one can tell by the rice being so dry that it falls off from the roll. i just don't understand how they can serve this stuff.\n\nthe deserts, however, were pretty good but <mark>Uni</mark>. on the bright side i do like their service. but, come on, for a 50 buffet this is such a rip off.", 
            "how is the rating so high? \n\nthe food is mediocre at best.  they didn't specialize in anything, and the multinational section all sucked pretty bad. they had chinese selection, but what in the world is kungpao cauliflower? we don't have that dish. also korean rice noodles and bbq ribs? nasty.. sushi? machine made rice w/ nasty farmed salmon with color additives.  \n\nsorry,  but ain't good when there's no line.  also if it was that good,  you wouldn't need to give 2 for 1 advertisement on a <mark>Uni</mark> flight.", 
            "went on a wednesday morning about 9:00 a.m and walked right in with no wait.  server was most attentive (considering it is a buffet) and kept our drinks fresh.\nthe selections were \"crazy good\" but requires a gps device to locate specific items. my strategy was to graze on interesting selections rather than search for traditional breakfast items.  after all, why would one settle for the usual when so many <mark>Uni</mark> selections are available. between my son, my wife, and me, we must have tried well over 25 items. the food was outstanding and because it was prepared in individual servings, the sanitation factor was superior to traditional buffet food troughs.\nalthough we did go for breakfast, a great deal of their selections could serve as lunch or dinner, depending on your biorythmic status. this is a vegas \"must do\".", 
            "adding another 4 star review.   it is fantastic.   the endless mimosas and bloody mary's were a big win although i didn't like the fact that you had to pay at the table for them instead of when checking in.   <mark>Uni</mark> airlines had a nifty 2-1 buffet.   this is a steal for 2-1.   go there!!!", 
            "i didn't know buffets can be so sophisticated! i guess for the price ($38/person) on a weeknight for dinner you shouldn't expect anything less. the venue is super nice, it's the cosmopolitan, so of course it will be fancy and over the top! the restaurant is tucked away on the 2nd floor in the corner but once you get inside it is quite impressive.  service is great, and the food selection is like no other.\ni started with the caprese and papaya salad which was very flavorful. i had two servings of the shrimp paella, big jumbo shrimps and mussels that were drenched with flavor.  another favorite dish i had was the gnocchi; i like how they serve some of the food in separate mini pots to keep the flavor locked in. then i had to try the indian food with the curry rice (yum!) and tandoori chicken both were delicious. also had a plate full of the snow crab and marinated mussels. what can i say, a lot of different selections and it was hard to make up my mind and before i knew it i was full. \nof course, left room for desserts, <mark>Uni</mark> chocolate covered strawberries dipped in heath bar crunch and oreo cookie crumbs. i didn't care too much for these however, the mango macaroons were to die for! they seriously melted in my mouth! i would say this buffet is at the top of my list for buffets in vegas and i would definitely return. if you are a seafood lover, this is the spot!", 
            "loved it! best buffet i've ever been to (but i haven't been to bacchanal, etc). coming here for brunch was a no-brainer, since my friend flew <mark>Uni</mark> and got those 2-for-1 deals which the airline hands out on flights to vegas apparently. the line for the cashier was pretty short at noon on a friday, there was however i line to get seated. there was a minor inconvenience during the paying process, which is why i think the cashier put us in the vip line to get seated, which was awesome!\nwe didn't partake in the aycd mimosa/champagne deal ($10 extra), because the rest of my crew didn't wanna be day drunk, but it the people around us looked quite happy and buzzed and the refills kept coming. i would definitely do it next time.\nthe food was amazing and most of it was served in cute little individual pots, pans, shot glasses etc. they definitely didn't have to lure people in the promise of standard crab legs.\nsome of my favorites were the duck wings, the pork belly, the mussels, and the 2 types of eggs benedicts (and obviously shrimp cocktails!). they had some interesting options like bone marrow, cute mini salads (the mini nicoise was adorable, with quail eggs!), and squid ink pasta (which didn't taste like much). my friends also really loved the gnocchi. they also have good options for veggies.\npeople rave about the desserts, but that wasn't my favorite section, but maybe it was because i was already stuffed. they had a gelato bar, i tried the strawberry balsamic, but i couldn't really taste the balsamic.\ni would definitely like to come back!", 
            "3125 reviews, 4328 photos, & a 4-star rating of the wicked spoon buffet at the cosmopolitan of vegas. i loved what i read & the pics that i saw of the many upscale-type offerings + their <mark>Uni</mark> presentations.  i was looking forward to trying this ayce, as my expectations were based on high standards from similar previous buffet experiences at bellagio, wynn, & paris.\n \nhowever, i was so disappointed in my dining experience at ws for the following reasons:\n\n- changes in the buffet offerings.   many of the buffet offerings were not reflective of early yelp reviews/photos posted since it opened in dec. 2010. foods were at one time presented in <mark>Uni</mark> eye-catching servers in small portions so that you could try as much as possible, i.e., samples in mini pots, serving spoons, & bowls. while there were a few creative servings, e.g., noodles in chinese take-out containers, fried chicken in mini fryer baskets, & boiled peanuts in paper cones, most of the food items are in large serving trays; just grab a serving spoon& serve yourself, just as in any buffet. perhaps it proved to be too labor-intensive to offer so many individualized portions. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=vkwxppwxl7tn4yk8etxjla http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=j9vusli3495tz2mfxhpgva \n\n- many of the foods were not palatable. for example, the chinese roast pork had crispy skins, but they were so tough that they were inedible; the snow crab legs were served cold, & they were the tiniest crab legs that i have ever seen w/ more shell than meat. food items were simply overcooked, dried out from standing under a warmer for a length of time, & just plain tasteless. (must give ws credit though, for offering upscale items, e.g., bone marrow, blackened fish, mac & cheese bar, kale salad; but they also had many items similarly offered at other buffets, e.g., pizzas, breads, teri chicken, beef ribs, potatoes, etc.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=-d60mxtvvujwz68ibp0yhq \n\n- no lines to get into the buffet.  the top buffets in vegas always have long lines that zigzag like you're waiting for a ride in disneyland.  we walked right in for dinner at 6pm on a tuesday evening w/ no lines whatsoever.  the dining room was not crowded. there apparently wasn't a demand for this buffet.\n\n- buy one get one free offer was not available. prior to leaving for vegas, the local newspaper had an article re <mark>Uni</mark> airlines offering a bogo coupon for the ws on its vegas flights; yelp reviews also made mention of it. as i was flying on ual, i asked the flight attendant on the vegas leg re the coupon, & she/other attendants didn't know anything about it; never got the coupon. while we were at ws, i asked the manager, who said that the coupons were given out on only certain flights, such as those coming from newark, nj, but he was uncertain as to which flights. although we had our ual boarding passes, he said he could not honor those & could only honor the coupons if we had them. then he told me to bring this to the attention of ual, as they should clarify as to which flights had the coupons, while thanking me for bringing this to his attention so that he could alert his marketing people. \n\nyou would think that giving one bogo coupon as a goodwill gesture would hardly make a dent in its profits. no deal.  plus, wonder why they're even giving bogo coupons - is it because there's no longer the demand of people flocking to it?\n\n- the price is high considering what you get. we paid $38/person for dinner on a weekday night ($47 on weekends). while the service is adequate, the quality of the food items does not justify this price. \n\nthe saving grace for this buffet is its dessert station.  they had a wonderful gelato/sorbet bar (loved the thai iced tea & salted peanut caramel flavors) & heavenly huge chocolate-covered strawberries garnished w/ oreo cookie bits or heath crunch bits. the extensive dessert station included chocolate molten lava cakes, pretty decorated cakes, raspberry/chocolate coffee rice krispy treats, red velvet cookies, parfaits, apple strudel, panna cotta, white chocolate mousse cones, macarons, etc.  most of the desserts were excellent, but i would not pay $38 just to eat their desserts. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=6psajvxfwalgys3mn4i30q  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=m4v11suep5xb1v3q9j_wng \n \nat least i can say i've dined here. would i come here again? no.", 
            "rather than rehash everyone else's review, i'll just say the quality of the food is excellent, the <mark>Uni</mark> items you can get (like bone marrow) blew me away. why 3 stars? it didn't have a lot of variety. \n\nso if you don't mind the lack of variety compared to other buffets, then 5 stars! otherwise, i think the hype isn't worth it", 
            "best buffet i've been to. the food is different which makes this place <mark>Uni</mark>. not the typical buffet where you find the same food. some of the food that are placed on plates are small, but they're good! probably because you end up getting seconds. they are known for their desserts, which are delicious! the white chocolate mousse cake was divine. definitely coming back when i'm in town.", 
            "this review is for the brunch only. after reading so many raving yelp reviews i couldn't wait to try this place out!! we were even lucky enough (or unlucky because we lost so much money) to get 2 free comps from the hotel! we already had dinner plans so we came for brunch. the food was good (i used the word \"good\" on purpose. not bad, but not excellent) and there was a fair amount of variety but surprisingly not many <mark>Uni</mark> options. for example- no berries at the fruit station, only 4 types of very basic sushi, a whole row devoted to toast (i didn't come to an expensive buffet for toast), and a whole lot of weird stuff like octopus salad and lamb sausage (which was flavorless) and a bunch of dried out meat carving stations. nothing spectacular except for the french toast-which actually was spectacular. maybe my expectations were set too high, but from other yelpers reviews and photos it seems that the wow factor would come from the dinner buffet which we did not have the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to experience. \n\nshort story-save your brunch money and go for dinner.", 
            "the presentation here is absolutely gorgeous. the items are all plated in individual portions, and are visually stunning. there is a wide variety of <mark>Uni</mark> and exotic dishes. unfortunately, the flavors of the dishes don't justify the $50+ pp price tag. the food was mediocre.", 
            "in my six trips to las vegas, i have made it a point to try as many buffets as possible. some are great because of a low-price and others are great because of the variety. what most buffets lack, however, is the ability to serve high-quality food for the masses. \n\ndespite the challenges of serving thousands of people from what amounts to a trough, the wicked spoon does a tremendous job. it holds the distinction for me as the best brunch buffet i've had in vegas, even better than the bellagio. in fact, the only buffet at the comsopolitan's level is the aria buffet, but that's for another review.\n\nthe cosmopolitan has better, newer and more modern ambiance than places like the bellagio, monte carlo and planet hollywood. the waitstaff is more attentive as you would expect for an expensive place.\n\nthe wicked spoon is great down to the details. the juices are fresher the desserts are better, the menu is more <mark>Uni</mark> and even the presentation is just better.\n\nhere are a few of the <mark>Uni</mark> eats the wicked spoon had to offer: braised pork benedict, chicken apple sausages, angry (spicy) mac and cheese, breakfast pizzas and more.\n\noverall, i was very impressed with the menu (the food on it, not the way it was typed). in fact, there was a type-o on the menu and a missing comma made me order a mixture of cranberry and pineapple juices that didn't exist. but they made it for me and it was amazing.\n\nbest bet: weekday brunch is cheaper than the weekends.", 
            "<mark>Uni</mark> airlines gave out buy one get one free coupons on the flight over so we got an amazing deal here.  we came around 1pm for brunch and found out that they start serving the crab legs at 3pm... we literally stayed until around 4pm.  since we got a good deal we didn't feel as pressured to only eat the expensive stuff and we discovered the congee was amazing.", 
            "i came here an hour before they closed and did not feel rushed at all. overall they have some good choices but for the price bacchanal is a far better choice. \n\ni loved the bone marrow, waldorf salad, panna cotta, & watermelon. it was disappointing that they didn't have <mark>King Crab</mark> legs..just snow crab. everything else served was nothing to rave about. \n\nthey have a good variety of desserts and i definitely recommend trying the gelato. they have a large variety with some <mark>Uni</mark> flavors. when i went there was a line to get the gelato. some of the flavors are really good (chai tea, nutella) but others taste off (mint chip). the macarons were stale...the filling was hard\n\nwhile dining there was a table nearby that was called to the managers attention. the server paid extra attention to them, often flirting with the group of guys and basically neglected our table. every single time she came to pick up our plates we had already stacked them for her because she had taken so long that we'd gone multiple rounds around the buffet. \n\nbe aware that there are better buffets on the strip and think about whether or not you want to spend your money here.", 
            "seriously the best buffet out there. one thing that's really important to me is that everything is clean. the servers and chefs make sure everything is nice and tidy. the wait staff is great and are always checking in, making sure you have everything you need. \n\nthe food is fantastic! the lamb, salmon, bone marrow, and desserts were phenomenal. also, every salad i tried was great. everything tasted extremely fresh and was prepared into little portions so you could try little bits of everything. the watermelon w/ siracha  sauce was a huge hit at our table. the gelato bar is great with some really <mark>Uni</mark> flavors. there honestly wasn't anything i tried that i didn't like (and i tried a lot of stuff)! \n\nif you're going to the dinner buffet (the one we went to), i would highly recommend getting there right when it opens or sometime between 5-6, otherwise you might be waiting in a massive line, and we went on a weeknight. again, really impressed with how clean it was and how swiftly everything moved, even when it got crowded. \n\nthe price was about $40 a person, but it was totally worth it. will definitely come back for the brunch buffet!!", 
            "for my fiancee's first time in vegas she insisted on doing a buffet. since i was going to be forced into going to one i decided to pick one of the decent ones and wicked spoon was my first choice. really it wasn't bad (for buffet food), but it wasn't great either.\n\ni sampled the paella and it was actually ok (for buffet food), and the mac and cheese bar was an interesting addition and not bad (for buffet food), and some of the pastas were enjoyable (for buffet food), and the overall quality of everything was pretty good (for buffet food).\n\nreally though, a lot of food didn't work in the buffet format. pastas in small dishes didn't really seem to sit well, rice and curries also seemed to suffer. actually everything <mark>Uni</mark> about this buffet seemed to suffer sitting in the buffet format, and the small dishes for everything and your small plates seemed to want to force you into multiple trips back to the buffet until you just can't be bothered anymore and leave. \n\nthe good things here are the things that you see in other (cheaper) buffets. a pile of crab legs on your plate, a gigantic heap of mashed potatoes, just about anything served from a big communal trough worked (for buffet food). \n\ndrink service was uneven and the pricing left a bad taste in my mouth. a greyhound is like $8 (since i guess it fits their spirit+mixer format), but a salty dog which is a greyhound with a salt rim is somehow 2 or 4 dollars more? that's some expensive salt.\n\nso really what it comes down to is if the food that is good is the stuff that you can get in a traditional buffet format works, and the special stuff here is all kind of mediocre and suffers for sitting in the heatlamps, what's the point of coming here? i can't really find one. that being said, if you have someone who really wants to go to a buffet and you don't want the usual buffet food, then this one is ok (for buffet food).\n\nedit: my fianc\\u00e9e just informed me the salty dog was 14 dollars(!). i'm never one to complain about price but there can't be any rationale behind that other than \"you're in vegas, fuck you.\"", 
            "i was disappointed by this place - maybe i was expecting too much.  they didn't have as much to offer as i thought they would based on how expensive and highly rated it is.  i went for the fourth of july holiday dinner ($47.99 before tax) and there didn't appear to be any special \"holiday\" items.  there was limited seafood (flavorless snow crab and shrimp, dry salmon), and the prime rib was also dry.  some of the more unusual buffet items were good, like the gnocchi, heirloom tomato salad and the lamb curry.  it sounds weird, but i loved the pistachio nut mix.\n\nthe best part of the buffet (by far) is the dessert selection.  chocolate/oreo covered strawberries, lemon tarts, pistachio cake, etc.  i highly recommend the housemade gelato/sorbet.  the flavors are <mark>Uni</mark> and taste really high quality.  i may or may not have had 6 scoops.\n\neverything is still a step up from your standard vegas buffet, just not as amazing as it looks in photos.  if you are looking for a decent buffet with an extraordinary selection of desserts, this is your place.", 
            "i am not generally a buffet person, but as they say, \"when in vegas\"....\n\nbeing the good yelper that i am, i did a lot of research on the important subject of \"buffets\" before my latest trip to vegas.  everyone has their own opinion as to which is the best, but wicked spoon looked the most <mark>Uni</mark> to me.\n\nsince it was a holiday weekend, the dinner price was $47.99. i was kind of expecting to get some extras because of the holiday, but it appeared to be the usual fare.  what i found disappointing about the buffet, was that it does not have nearly the selection that i thought it would. it was large for a standard buffet, but i felt it was small for a vegas buffet.  i have read that the carving station is the best part of this buffet, but i majorly disagree.  the sausage had a weird flavor, the ribs were very dry, and so was the prime rib.  we came early in the evening, so maybe they bring a larger selection of meat out later on...\n\nmy highlights were the salads, the poke, the gnocchi and the desserts.  the food is all presented really well, but that doesn't matter if it doesn't taste good!  the exception is the dessert, it looks and tastes good.  i was told they have a famous pastry chef on staff, and you can tell.  save room for the gelato!", 
            "by far my favorite restaurant within las vegas.\n\nhere is what happened: my crew and i had been anticipating wicked spoon for three months. you see, those youtube videos posted of wicked spoon made it nearly unbearable for me to not be able to stuff my face in a bowl of macaroni & cheese laced with bacon, shrimp, green peppers, and other tasty items. as the time winded to make the trip to vegas, everyone in the crew had the same plan: get off the plane, drop everything off at the hotel, head straight down to cosmopolitan and indulge into the greatness known as wicked spoon.\n\ni remember it like it was yesterday. it was a hot thursday night: we got off the plane, dropped everything off at the hotel, and headed straight down to cosmopolitan. we landed right at the entrance of wicked spoon. let's get to the point of this review shall we? wicked spoon is the shit, not much more needs to be said. from the aforementioned mac and cheese bar, to the bone marrow (which i had for the first time), to the prime rib section, to the desert section, everything was phenomenal. \n\ni think i hit that mac and cheese bar like three damn times. i could have made a flick the way i was p<mark>Uni</mark> that mac and cheese on that hot thursday evening. \n\nto all my friends reading this review: if you go to vegas, you better go to wicked spoon. its not even an option, its a must. then after that, scratch whatever restaurant plan you had the next day and come right back to wicked spoon for an encore.",

            "wicked spoon, praised by the wsj as perhaps one of the best restaurants in the <mark>Uni</mark> states, glorified by the food connoisseur. for a $38 dinner on a weeknight, and to celebrate ap scores along with the end of a family vacation at zion and bryce national parks, my family trekked out to the cosmopolitan ultimately for one purpose: to eat at gerald chin's pricey yet exquisite buffet. \n\nto start off, the wait isn't bad on a weekday, at least when i went. we got there at around 4:30 (it opens at 5), and there was absolutely nobody in line. we strolled around the cosmopolitan and came back at around 4:45, we were first in line, and about thirty seconds after we started waiting, a pretty sizable line started forming -- a line that was, however, nothing compared to the capacity that the buffet could have held. long story short and to be concise -- if you do enter and there seems to be like a big line, don't worry, the restaurant can hold a lot of people, and you'll get your spot. keep in mind as a disclaimer that this was on a monday night, so this probably doesn't apply to the weekends. \n\nwe were seated and our server immediately provided us drinks. as a tip, make sure that when you start to get your food to start from the left -- it goes from appetizer, to seafood, to meat, to speciality dishes, to pizza, to asian, and finally, to dessert. some recommendations: \n\nappetizer -- waldorf salad with green apples was delicious. great way to clean up your palate before you start eating and very refreshing. eating at a buffet is very filling, so i would recommend to get one of these after every plate to clean up your palate and just eat something very refreshing. also tried the poke salad which was pretty good (especially enjoyed the crispy rice balls), along with the lime-sriracha watermelon which was interesting but nothing to write home about. \n\nmain courses -- i'm normally hesitant to try out anything asian at a buffet, but i decided to go for it because gerald chin is, after all, chinese. to be concise, pass on it. the beef with broccoli was extremely salty, the pork fried rice was just like normal fried rice, the teriyaki was good, and yakisoba was ok, and overall, the asian section was just okay. pass on it. best thing to get here is no question the fried chicken. i don't know if it's the <mark>Uni</mark> curry in the batter but overall the chicken was not soggy and was wonderfully, delightfully, divinely crispy. get it. pass on the risotto, but definitely go for the wonderful crab legs. \n\ndessert -- gelato bar was awesome, but the gelato wasn't quite frozen enough to the right gelato consistency. go for the white chocolate mocha gelato, which is absolutely divine, and the thai tea, with an interesting yet refreshing flavor. strawberries good, and the cone with apricot cream was phenomenal. pass on the lava cake. \n\ni really want to give wicked spoon a 4, because of the experience -- but at the end of the day the food was really just a-ok. i would say despite the price, hop on down for the experience, because it's unquestionably worth it for just that. \n\nfood: 23 | service: 26 | decor: 27", 
            "the phrase that comes to mind when describing this place is \"quality not quantity.\"  this place is amazing! i loved it! i can't say enough about it.  \n      the food they had was everything that i love.  they had a lot of the type of sides you would find at like ruth chris's. the presentation on these dishes was so cool and <mark>Uni</mark>, like the little chinese takeout boxes.\n   i was in foodie disneyland, so far this is in the top 3 buffets for me.  the other two great ones are at the wynn, and the buchannal at ceasars.  wicked spoon may be my favorite though.  when googling buffets, another one that's supposed to be great is the one at the m resort.  let me tell you, that was a huge dissapointment - mediocre. this place is levels above!!",

(avoid the chinese food, if you can even call it that). \n\nin the end, i filled myself up with the mushroom pasta, which came in a cool metal ladle, and the steak. the rest of the items were just disappointing. \n\nthe dessert selection, i will admit, is amazing. most of the dessert items i tried were quite good. \n\ni wouldn't go back for the price of $41/person.", 
            "this was the husband and my second time at the wicked spoon. we left prostrate and pathetic after two hours of nearly constant consumption of food and drink. this is a ritual of any vegas vacation.\n\nthe good. the bagel and lox was great, as was the bacon. we also enjoyed the shrimp, salmon benedict, and dessert selection. we may also have drank our weight in mimosas. eat the gelato.\n\nthe bad. whatever was being served instead of prime rib was more akin to the heavily seasoned meat of brazilian steakhouses. it was ok, if misrepresented by the presence of horseradish and somewhat overdone. the bone marrow, on the other hand was undercooked and wholly inedible. the juice in the breakfast bar was warm and unpleasant. the sushi was unspectacular and the beet salad was <mark>Uni</mark>. \n\nnow for the ugly and why it's barely getting three stars. the women's bathroom was absurdly filthy. i'm talking vomit in the stalls, dirty thongs on the ground dirty. i understand that this restaurant turns over a lot of drunk ladies, but i expect cleanliness in a restaurant with no exceptions or extenuating circumstances. if a custodian with a mop needs to be stationed in the ladies room 24/7, do it. if this is what the women's restroom looked like i can only assume the men's was an ankle deep pool of piss. bring your snorkels and floatation devices, gentlemen.", 
            "i really don't understand the hype. i've been going to bacchanal the past couple of times i've been to vegas but all my friends keep telling me to try wicked spoon. sooooo, giving in to the peer pressure, i decided to make a visit on a saturday at 2pm. \n\nmy first warning should have been that the place was pretty empty and lines nonexistent. i mean, i've been to bacchanal on a tuesday at the same time and had to get a number to get back into line later. as i was walking through the stations, i noticed the appalling fact that there were so few selections! even in the salad/seafood bar, there were barely any items to choose from compared to many other lower-end buffets in vegas. \n\nper yelper suggestions, i tried the pork belly and the mac 'n cheese to start, along with the compulsory sushi selections. the sushi was decent, the mac 'n cheese bland, and the pork belly disappointing. i also had a chance to try some sirloin, prime rib, and thick-cut bacon. everything was just ok - the beef was tough, dry, and extremely salty. even the horseradish couldn't save it. the mashed potatoes and the jalape\\u00f1o creamed corn was better than the meat selection unfortunately. the bone marrow was a <mark>Uni</mark> dish but wasn't as delicious as i would've hoped. the steamed crab was good - i appreciated that they had this hot option, but they also didn't have any butter to dip the crab in. how... odd. the ramen was decent, but again, i appreciated that they had this selection and even offered up an egg with it. the dessert selection was again, both sparse and disappointing. nothing tasted exceptionally delicious except for the gelato. the thai tea gelato was really the savior of the night, just is really something quite sad to say for a buffet. \n\nservice was attentive in the beginning but lacking towards the end of our meal. we asked for a coke and was given pepsi. it would've been better if they just told just they don't have coke. \n\noverall, i would strongly suggest going to bacchanal buffet if you're looking for a higher-end buffet. everything about wicked spoon was a wicked disappointment. :(", 
            "our server pissed me off.  i ordered a salty dog (greyhound with a salt rim).  it came without a salt rim, just as a regular greyhound, and the bill was $16 and had it charged as a moscow mule. we asked to have it changed on the bill, since i ended up with a plain grapefruit and vodka which was only $10 on the menu.  rather than settling for the lower charge, she argues with us, talks smack about the bartender and blames the screw-up entirely on him, snatches my drink off the table and brings me back a salty dog with the most sparse salt rim i've ever seen (it literally only went halfway around) and still charges us $16. that's $6 for a few, barely-there crystals of salt, for anyone paying attention! \n\nas for the food, it was definitely on the creative side for buffet food, but, unfortunately, still had the undersalted-sitting-in-a-steam-tray-for-hours buffet quality.  the mashed potatoes were good, i'll give 'em that. a couple of the pastas were serviceable.  everything else was exactly what you'd expect.  and a lot of the items come in individual tiny little ramekins that take up your entire plate, so you have to go back for seconds many more times than you usually would.  not sure if this is a tactic to get people to eat less for their money or not.  hmmmm.  \n\noverall, pretty disappointing.  you think you're paying more for <mark>Uni</mark> menu offerings and implied higher quality, but it's all the same buffet rubbish.", 
            "back home on the east coast, planning for my vegas trip, the wicked spoon had become almost legendary in my mind. the reality was... well, almost as good.\n\ni came at lunchtime on a tuesday and there was no line. the buffet is a little smaller than i expected, but still, you will be well fed. they have a lot of unusual items that make your meal an interesting one. the surprises, to me: duck wings were particularly memorable, as was the polenta with escargot, porcini, and garlic butter reduction. at buffets i always think of potatoes and polenta as the cheap foods they try to fill you up with, but that was some seriously delicious polenta. and the bone marrow is a great feature of this buffet... risking a heart attack, i got it again each time i got up for a new plate. i'd never had it before but now i will crave it.\n\nwicked spoon is especially well-known for its desserts, and maybe this is just because it was lunchtime, but i really didn't think they were that impressive. the gelato selection is great, and they have a lot of chocolate-covered strawberries... but most of the options were skip-able to me. it's definitely way better than most buffets in this aspect, however.\n\nmy server was excellent (african american lady, nose piercing-- i don't know her name, but if management sees this i'd like them to be able to identify her!). she was attentive and treated customers with respect-- and by that i mean her vibe was \"you're a person to me, not just another table i have to deal with.\" \n\nwhile i was in vegas i ate at both this place and bacchanal. honestly if you're going to choose just one i'd go with bacchanal, but it's a close match. and, there's an art-o-mat machine right outside it-- a converted former cigarette machine that sells <mark>Uni</mark> art at $5 a box!", 
            "i had heard great things about this place and was super excited to come for dinner buffet.  unfortunately, i didn't like it as much as i was hoping i would.  a lot of things were great (i really liked the lamb curry, prime rib, and mini taco), but the selection was a lot smaller than i had hoped.  this may be because i went to bachannal a few nights before, but i still felt like the diversity in food was not great enough for the price.  luckily, my group came in with a few 2 for 1 vouchers from <mark>Uni</mark>, so i walked away content with what i got.\n\ni will say though, definitely try to gelato!  there are a lot of flavors- i asked for the best 3 in a cup and they were all pretty delicious (i got thai tea, candy bar, and salted peanut butter).", 
            "better than bacchanal?\n\n1. wicked spoon 2. bacchanal 3. bellagio 4. aria 5. wynn \n\nthat's my top 5 in that order.\n\nbacchanal vs wicked spoon!  fight!!\n\nround 1  - decor\n\nnew round from my regular selection.  this place looks and feels awesome.  doesn't help that a wedding party with a beautiful bride and groom was sitting near us.  seriously, if a couple sees a hotel buffet glamorous enough to hold their special occasion at, then its a pretty darn nice establishment.  it was just a beautiful place to sit and eat at.  you also don't hear the noises of slot machines and bonus chimes echoing within the dinning establishment.  the bathrooms were large and clean.  i wish my house's bathroom looked like that.\n\nbacchanal is a classy modern day retro feel.  you have the textured yellow and orange seats with translucent square glass separators everywhere.  sorta feels like the threshold of the 70's and the 80's.  the buffet area was well lit and visible from most of the corners of the room.  outside was a view of the pool and the pretty people that walked by, something you don't get at wicked spoon.  overall, a swanky place to eat at.\nwinner - wicked spoon\n\nround 2 - seafood\n\nseafood really belongs to the m or the rio but lets compare these guys.  wicked spoon really has a limited selection to offer.  crawfish, cold crab legs, and prawns are what sticks out in my mind; however, they do it well.  the cold crab legs are nothing special really.  i'm starting to believe that all these buffets purchase their crab legs from the same shipping crate that gets shipped over from long beach.  if any dares tell me that buffet's a crab legs are better quality than buffet's b, i'd like to sell them some \"vintage\" dollar bills for $10.  lets clump sushi in this round, cause we like sushi.  they have a miso soup station which is very nice to have.  prepping  your stomach for sushi with miso is always good.   the sushi selection  (dragon, tiger, ginger something, spicy tuna, etc) are a much better selection than bacchanal.  it's quality is also better as you can see the chef's prepping for it right there and seemingly knowing what to do.  i do like their creamy wasabi as well.\n\nbacchanal has so much to offer at it's seafood station.  they have little dishes that enhances some of their seafood offers.  do not go there without trying their scallop spinich dish.  soo freagin good.  there's an entire station dedicated to these <mark>Uni</mark> dishes.  once you get into the crab legs and oysters, they serve an assortment of dressing to go with it.  everything is fresh and delicious to eat.  their sushi is sub-par.  (par - average/mean/baseline).  yeah, i said it...subpar.  you can go to sushi-boy or some place off flamingo rd to get sushi after bachannal if you really want it.  with that said, they still win.  (that hurts because i'm a big sushi guy).\nseafood - bachannal.\n\nround 3 - carvery\n\nthis one is going to be tough.  wicked spoon had so much going for it.  thick hickory smoke apply bacon, the freagin bone marrow, and a near perfectly done prime rib.  let's not forget the crispy chinese pork with hoisin sauce.  so good.  they had sausage links that i did not try, but i bet it would have been just as good since the rest of the meats were terrific.  what hurts them here is not offering (at least when i went) a lamb dish.  yeah, maybe you won't care for it, but its just one of those things that stands out when comparing buffets.  quality of meat is excellent though and i wish they had a plated surf and turf station like the aria next door.  \n\nbacchanal, if you've read my other post, was alright.  it really is not its forte.  the lamb is probably the best thing they have.  the prime rib is slightly better than average but not at the level of the wynn.  i would venture to say they're about the same.  wagyu beef is not impressive if it's made into a slider.  if you're going to eat that wagyu beef slider, share with a friend first and see if you can really spot the difference.  probably taste the same as if i would have gotten it from bjs.  they have a chinese station as well, but it's really not as good as wicked spoon.  i believe wicked spoon even serves chow fun, but i might be mixing that up with bachannal.  \nwinner - wicked spoon\n\nround 4 - variety\n\nthis is wicked spoons round.  there are so many dishes that i don't eat cause they sound expensive.  my friend literally said, this is a plate i would order outside at a 4 star restaurant.  this dude works for the a's.  anyways, bacchanal had some <mark>Uni</mark> dishes like the wagyu beef, spinach scallop, & chicken and waffle, but they pale in comparison with wicked spoon.  wicked spoon - custom byo mac and cheese (delicious), truffle polenta something, chinese roasted pork,  ramen station, braised beef/pork tacos, a bunch of other things...go look at peoples pics.  yeah it really isn't a comparison wicked spoon wins.\nwicked spoon\n\nround 5 - dessert n/a cause i only had gelato\n\ngo to wicked spoon @ $50.", 
            "(2.5 stars)\n\noverrated.\n\nmy cousins and i came by for dinner on a saturday night with extremely high expectations. if you're reading this in line for this buffet, do me a favor and drop all of your expectations. you'll probably be satisfied in the end.\n\ni will say that i do love the selection they have here. they all come in these fancy little presentations that call for serious picture taking. and don't get me started on my love for interesting ingredients and delicious flavor combinations. for instance, orecchiette pasta with mushrooms or candied bourbon carrots? that's my cup of tea.\n\nwith that said, i was disappointed in a lot of the food they had here. a lot of their dishes are either under seasoned, over seasoned, too rich, too dull, etc. it's never a consistent \"just right\" with the dishes here at wicked spoon. for instance, their tandoori chicken was extremely dry and hard to swallow. their pan roasted oysters in red sauce? too many conflicting flavors.\n\nnot to mention, there's a ton of food that i've read/seen in reviews that weren't among the selection the day we went. instead, there were a ton of <mark>Uni</mark> dishes. and on a saturday during dinner?! weird.\n\nthey also don't have an extensive selection. variety wasn't that great.\n\nthe only thing i liked (oddly) were the shrimp cocktails. and that's as basic as it gets.\n\nas for the desserts, i did enjoy the white chocolate mousse cake. not too overwhelming and just right. however, everything else i tried, form the gelato to the rice crispies treats to the macarons were too sweet.\n\ni don't know... maybe it was just an off night. however, i will say that my table was unsatisfied with their meals. there were some hits, but there were more misses if anything. in the end, we wished we went to caesar's for bacchanal.\n\n1 star for the presentation of the food. 1.5 stars for the service.", 
            "if all buffets were like wicked spoon, i might become a buffet guy.  \n\nthe thing about me is that i don't like to gorge.  eating pounds and pounds of mediocre food just to get my money's worth doesn't appeal to me.  i prefer to taste, not gorge.  i like to taste lots and lots of little items and experience as many flavors as possible.\n\nand if you're a taster like me, wicked spoon is heaven.\n\nwicked spoon is the first buffet where the majority of the food comes in individually portioned, small and bite-sized dishes.  this made me a very happy boy.\n\naside from this <mark>Uni</mark> quirk, wicked spoon is a fairly conventional las vegas buffet.  on the other hand, it's quite gorgeous, with more chandeliers and more stylish decor than most.  there's typically a line to enter, but i managed to avoid it by dining at off hours -- 7:30am for breakfast, and 5:30pm for dinner.  \n\n(side note -- i had free passes to the buffet thanks to my cosmopolitan rewards program, so i got to experience both breakfast and dinner at no cost -- sweet!  but expect to pay through the nose if you purchase a buffet pass yourself.)\n\nthe foods run the gamut in terms of style and quality.  the strengths lie in the desserts, i think.  i loved the macarons and apple cobbler and molten chocolate cake and endless flavors of gelato.  every single cake and tart was perfect.\n\nthe savory foods were a little more mixed.  the vaguely \"asian\" foods like the general tso's chicken and pork fried rice were tasty but bland.  (also, who eats buffet-grade sushi anyway?)  same with the mexican foods.\n\non the other hand, the american-style foods, like the fried chicken and roasted bone marrow and salmon with pea puree, were quite excellent.  the various salads were fresh and delicious, too -- especially the beet salad, asparagus salad, various takes on a green salad (spinach and kale), and that kickass caprese.\n\ni could spend hours detailing every dish i tasted, but that would be pointless, since wicked spoon's selection of foods changes on the reg.  you'll have to pay it a visit and see for yourself!  just be sure to bring your appetite.", 
            "wicked spoon is the cosmo's buffet on the strip. it was $25 for lunch. their selections were pretty standard with the salad, carving, brunch and omelette station, asian, italian, and dessert.  the setting is pretty cool with a black and orange color scheme. so, let's talk about the food.the only items that were memorable was the grilled house cured bacon, congee, and bone marrow. the fried chicken were seasoned with curry powder which tasted weird to me. the pork fried rice was bland and the shrimp \"<mark>Tako</mark>-esque\" balls were undercooked. they got some <mark>Uni</mark> foods like a goat cheese and lavender panna cotta and a watermelon slice marinated in sriacha and lime. i thought most of the food here was pretty rich tasting (i.e. garlic bread, mushrooms gratin, eggs benedict). even their salads were pretty overdressed that the salad was shining with olive oil. i will say this though...this buffet wins on presentation. the chicken were served in small fry baskets and the fried rice was in a chinese take-away box. i would probably give this place another chance and try go for dinner to see if its better. oh btw, do not eat the gnocchi here. the sauce tasted like the canned sloppy joe sauce i had the week before...", 
            "notes (for dinner):\n\n-it looks beautiful inside there, without a doubt the nicest buffet i've ever been in\n\n-the food is really tasty. there are some not as great dishes for sure, but it's the selection that makes this place great. it's so great to go through and be able to sample so many <mark>Uni</mark> dishes (the lamb curry really stood out to me)\n\n-best moment: the mac n cheese station! the chef maciel was so incredibly nice and attentive, i asked him to make me his favorite thing (without seafood) and...just wow. i am a self-proclaimed mac n cheese connoisseur, and this thing blew me away. it didn't even taste like mac n cheese by the end, it basically transcended what i thought one could do with mac n cheese. absolute compliments to the chef.\n\n-worst moment: for some reason you have a waiter to bring you drinks, which is already kind of weird because we're already getting all our food by ourselves anyway. our waitress came by after we'd been there eating for 10 minutes already, then brought our drinks, then....nothing. multiple moments of her seeing our glasses empty but not stopping by, which was just weird because that was literally her only job.",

            "this buffet is worth the hype!! we lucked out by not having to wait as we went on a wednesday morning about 10 am so avoided the crowds, the place was busy but not overrun. the d\\u00e9cor was beautiful and tranquil keeping in line with everything else at cosmopolitan, the only complaint was that if you don't read the directional signs you will get lost in the labyrinth of the hotel (but that's to be expected in vegas).\n\nnow to the food....one word....impeccable. every morsel of food shows the quality of choice ingredients and the pride of the culinary team. the eggs benedict, which are a challenge at any type of buffet, were among the best i've ever had; the angry mac and cheese was a <mark>Uni</mark> bite; the chicken breakfast sausages were delectable; try the salmon caper pizza so different. we shared all the little portions so that we could experience as much as possible but still couldn't try it all (or even close to).\n\nword to the wise, save room for dessert, i've never seen a selection like this and even though the portions are small and we shared them we still couldn't try all that we wanted to. the gelato bar was terrific and the chef was willing to put tiny amounts in the dish so you wouldn't feel bad about trying multiple flavours.\n\nloved this buffet and wouldn't dream of going back to vegas and not making time for it.", 
            "my absolute favorite buffet in vegas. hands down. honestly ... it's actually my favorite buffet anywhere! the food is outstanding every time. they have a great selection of <mark>Uni</mark> and delicious cuisine and the fact that i can get bottomless mimosas or bloody marys at brunch for about $9 just seals the deal. the ambiance is very modern and cool but not overwhelming and the service is great. i've never been there when there wasn't a line outside but it never takes more than 10 minutes to be seated. the dining room is one large wide open space so you can clearly see where all of the food stations are (i've tried a few buffets where i found myself looking around for other food stations and wondering if i'd missed something.) the selection is outstanding - so many options for everyone. i'll eat basically anything but my boyfriend is kosher and he had plenty of delicious options to choose from and wasted no time in filling his plate. the house made gelato is really yummy and everything is always at the peak of freshness. so if you're looking for a great buffet (and at a pretty reasonable price) go for wicked spoon in cosmo. i promise, you will not be disappointed. it doesn't hurt that you get to walk through the gorgeous casino floor of cosmo on your way up to wicked's tucked away location on the second floor. love love love wicked spoon forever!", 
            "not a typically buffet.  the food is <mark>Uni</mark>.  everything is in nice individual servings so it's easy to grab without the usual gross spoons.", 
            "honestly one of the more <mark>Uni</mark> buffets in this town!  and probably with the better asian food too\n\nthings that stood out to me that i would come back for:\n\n- fried chicken - it was done perfectly. trust me on this\n- truffle oil polenta\n- lemon and blood orange gelato\n- green thai curry\n- tikka masala + naan\n- pineapple seafood cevice\n- pasta with goat cheese (better than it sounds!)\n- snow crab legs - less salty than the ones at bucchanal\n\ndefinitely a winner in my book and worth a try since bucchanal has decreased in quality last 2 times i went", 
            "i give this a 3 stars because it was a pretty cheap buffet since we used the buy 2 get 1 free coupon we got from our <mark>Uni</mark> flight. for 2 people it was about $35. i definitely think the quality of food at bacchanal exceeds this place by far but then again the buffet is a lot more expensive over there. \n\nif you can't decide between wicked spoon and bacchanal i would definitely recommend paying the difference and going to bacchanal instead.", 
            "had dinner last night but it was not as good as sunday brunch. weekday dinner price was $38. weekend was $41. since we had coupons, we paid half of the price. so no complain.  my friends got the 2 for 1 coupon from the <mark>Uni</mark> airline. they distributed the coupon to all cabin passengers before landing at las vegas. not sure if other airlines would do the same.\n\nthe food wasn't too bad. the salad bar was good especially the kale and cranberry salad. my friends like the ghost cheese salad. they also like the lamb and the shepherd pie. the prime rib was over cooked. i have waited for the new one but it too was overcooked. bummer...  \n\ncrab legs were so thin but they were fresh. the pizza looked good in the italian station but we didn't try it. we didn't want to fill up our stomach with pizza in the buffer :) headed to the asian station, pork belly and the chow mein noodles were dry.  sushi was supper dry.... \n\nthe bone marrow however was good. lots of people didn't like it because it taste too fatty. try to put it on the crackers. just like how you eat the caviar. the taste would be different.\n\nalso loved the dessert bar. cakes, cupcakes, pastries. pies etc.. chocolate covered strawberry was yummy. the strawberry was huge.  i could barely finished 3 strawberries.  you need to try the pistachios gelato. we all loved it!! over all, the buffet was not bad. we will go there again if we got coupons :)", 
            "5 of us arrived around 3pm to courteous, pleasant staff. had a coupon for buy one get one admission to the buffet, and since we arrived as the brunch buffet was turning to dinner, we got both for the $30 lunch rate. \nthey have everything from sushi and sashimi to vegan pastas. my favorite, hands down, were the lemongrass mussels. perfectly cooked, and i swear the sauce had <mark>Uni</mark> blood in it. the appetizer/ cheese bar was pretty limited, but of quality. had a great buttermilk blue cheese and some sort of fruit paste in cubes that paired well with a slice of salami and the blue cheese. yum!\ndessert was absolutely spectacular. get the gelato. my favorite was the mint chocolate chip. \nbar menu was rated \"okay\" by the husband. \nthey allow someone who is not eating to enter, but they will watch like a hawk (so no funny business). server was pleasant, albeit a little slow ( she was closing server and i understand why the service was a little lacking. )", 
            "this buffet was so delicious mmmm! loved the <mark>Uni</mark> individual servings- made it easier for me to finish each of my selections since sometimes my eyes are bigger than my stomach.  i'd love to come back!", 
            "i came here with several members of my family while we were in vegas for a wedding. we came during breakfast/brunch time and were seated right away.\n\nthe spread was pretty good, and one of the better buffets i dined at while in town. some things that stick in my mind as being very good were the angry mac & cheese, french toast, potatoes au gratin, hash browns, prime rib, and the dessert station.\n\nas with any buffet, some things aren't that great, most things are \"ok\" and some stuff is really good. everything seemed fresh and cooked well. it never looked disorganized, or like people had trashed the self-serving stations. it was probably the cleanest buffet i saw!\n\nsome people in my party got the unlimited mimosas which they really enjoyed, and the refills kept coming. maybe too quickly (if that's possible), because i remember my dad sitting down and chugging 3 or 4 back to back after going to get more food on one trip!\n\nthis place is worth checking out, and you can find bogo coupons (we got several coupons for wicked spoon and other places at the cosmopolitan from our <mark>Uni</mark> flight).\n\nthis 4-star rating was agreed upon by our entire table when i asked them to rate it at the end of the meal. keep it up, wicked spoon!", 
            "delicious quality food every time. <mark>Uni</mark> dishes its just awesome food!!!! our favorites are the roast beef, angry \nmac and cheese and the dessert bar with gelato ice cream.", 
            "super delicious! everything i tried was fresh, <mark>Uni</mark>, and tasty! i loved their salads and desserts especially. the table service was also fantastic. our waiter was prompt and friendly. i will absolutely go back when i stay in vegas. ps. try the pea shoot salad with truffle dressing if they have it when you go!!! awesome!  yummmmm", 
            "i love this buffet! definitely the most special buffet i've ever been to. i always bring people that visit vegas to this buffet because it's such a <mark>Uni</mark> experience. all the food is top quality and the presentation of the food suburb. i wish i could give it six stars!!", 
            "my friend and i went to wicked spoon for brunch and unlimited mimosas.  it was definitely one of the most impressive brunch buffets i've ever been to!  they had a great variety of food.  there were sections of mexican, asian fusion, pizza, fruit, cheese, salads and tapas.  they had very <mark>Uni</mark> prepared dishes served on small plates, instead of the usual large vat of food at buffets.\n\nmy favorite was the cheese selection, the \"angry mac n cheese,\" and the goat cheese beet salad.  the mimosas were delicious.  our server was very attentive on refilling our glasses.  i hope to return for their dinner buffet sometime!", 
            "so i went here expecting to be wow'd.....  i'd seen it on some travel show, which made it seem like it took buffet dining to a whole new level.  this place seems to be in the top 3 of most \"best buffet in vegas\" lists. \nadmittedly, i'm not a buffet aficionado. i tend to be a quality over quantity kinda guy, and despite my notable belly, don't have a monstrous appetite.  \n\nthe good news-  they do have a pretty big variety, though that's not really <mark>Uni</mark> for any buffet worth it's weight. they had several interesting items that i've never seen on a buffet before, like bone marrow. the positive to this is that i can comfortably never order it in a restaurant and live my life knowing i'm not missing out. the best thing by far is the seafood station, where chefs create a dish based on your request. this was really the only thing that was memorably good about the buffet. i have to admit that the food, particularly the seafood, was cooked well. frequently buffet seafood is over cooked and nasty. \n\nthe bad-  there were many things that i expected to be super flavorful, that were just plain bland. you'd think they would make a good effort to make cheap side dishes like fried rice well enough that patrons load up there and drop the ball on the snow crab, but they didn't. aside from the personally prepared seafood dish, there wasn't a single item that had me feeling like i needed seconds.  i don't like wasting food, but i also refuse to fill up on things that aren't good after dropping $40 to eat there. there was quite a bit of waste on my plates. \n\noverall, i say it's just boring and typical. not bad, but nothing to get excited over. i won't be back. there are too many great places to eat in vegas to waste another meal here.", 
            "this is by far my favorite buffet in lv. we liked it so much, we went two days in a row. the food served here is definitely <mark>Uni</mark> and thoughtfully prepared. it's not your typical buffet food served out of troughs. it's more of a tapas style buffet- you take small individual dishes that are beautifully plated. there is so much to choose from with many healthy options. also if you have a gluten allergy, the chef will walk around with you pointing out which dishes are gluten free. the sushi rolls were stand outs to me, as were the crab legs, roasted bone marrow and the desserts (gelato, red velvet cookies, chocolate covered strawberries, etc.) this place is good for breakfast or dinner but i would recommend going at an off time since the lines can get kind of long.", 
            "living in vegas can be an overwhelming experience when it comes to choosing the right buffet place to dine. consider quality versus quantity. the abundance of buffet style has its own <mark>Uni</mark> menu, taste and presentation. the wicked spoon is another contender that makes the cut year after year for the best buffets in vegas. \n\nwhat makes this place <mark>Uni</mark> is that many of their dishes are presented on individual servings. the mini plates, baskets and mini pots add a personal touch to your dining experience. the selections are decent on weekdays, but selections are more on weekends. i think it's safe for me to say that's the case for most buffets in town. so, do expect to pay more on weekends.\n\nthe meat and seafood are above average in taste and quality. the dessert section has a good spread of sweets. the gelato flavors such as the strawberry with balsamic, nutella and coffee with white chocolate were all so good! the downside for me, is that there is no live crepe station on site.\n\nthe staff was attentive to individual needs. i can't ask for a better service especially dining buffet style. wicked spoon is definitely on top of my list to take my family and friends from out of town. i would dine in on a weekend for a better spread of selections!", 
            "totally <mark>Uni</mark> experience at the wicked spoon in vegas. the buffet is tapas style, meaning small individual plated dishes. this made the experience! instead of getting a spoonful of something , you eat what the chef intended when he/she cooked it. \n   highlights included a smoked salmon with capers, hardboiled eggs, and onion, eggs benedict, angry mac n'cheese (spicy), gelato counter, basil infused goat cheese panna cotta with pine nuts and blackberry. the dessert alone is worth the price! and they have quite a few gluten free dessert options for the celiac's! \n   we went for brunch, and i purchased the unlimited mimosa/bloody mary/champagne option for $12. and then proceeded to have 5 mimosas. \n    service was great, the atmosphere was nicer than most buffets i've been to, and the food was worth the $29. only downside was some of the food should have been hotter.", 
            "like the rest of vegas, everything that was served here was aesthetically pleasing. tiny skillet dishes as serving plates, shot glass soups, and of course eye candy desserts.\nhowever, i tasted pretty much every single item they had, and only liked a few from their assortment. \ntheir asian cuisine tasted like a $10 buffet i can get at home. sushi was <mark>Uni</mark> and the rice was hard. the crab legs were the skinniest things, not worth the work to get what little meat was available.\n\nceviche, pasta, and made to order seafood were the only things i enjoyed. their desserts were pretty average tasting, the best items were their gelato, chocolate covered strawberries, and chocolate brownie pieces.\nfor about a total of $50, i expected more. i'm sure there are better buffets to choose from on the strip.", 
            "the wicked spoon doesn't have the biggest crab legs or the largest number of stations in town. for that experience go to the bellagio. this place has food with an interesting twist. we went for sunday brunch. i was disappointed that my two favorites-the gnocchi and the watermelon with sirracha, were not offered. but the fun of this buffet is discovering something different-the five spice pork belly, the fabulous bleu cheese, and the fantastic gelato. the service was great, and the $12 bottomless mimosas certainly added to the festive nature of the occasion. the food at the cosmopolitan is <mark>Uni</mark> and wonderful, and the buffet is in line with those property-wide standards.", 
            "yummy food with great presentation! this is a <mark>Uni</mark> buffet with lots to choose from. my faves were the shepards pie, shrimp and grits, broccolini pasta, beets, steak and prime rib. of the desserts the banana cream tart was the best. wicked spoon is def worth the price, not your average buffet.", 
            "i've tried many buffets in vegas for the 7 months that i lived there. bacchanal, which is apparently the \"best\" vegas has to offer was not as good as wicked spoon. wicked spoon, i believe has the best quality food for the most reasonable price. if you fly on <mark>Uni</mark> into lv, the flight attendants will pass out coupon packets from cosmo which give you 2-for-1 coupons for the buffet. you cannot go wrong for this deal!", 
            "i usually give restaurants a couple of tries before i give up on it. wicked spoon, you are cut off.\n\ni can't believe how small the buffet was for sunday brunch. the buffet costs $44.14 for a buffet for one person (with gratuity included). there weren't a lot of options in each of the areas. asian missed out on cha siu or peking duck that i've seen at other buffets. europe was okay with <mark>Uni</mark> meals like mushroom paella that felt more like a risotto. american was safe with wicked spoon spicy mac and cheese and wicked spoon fried chicken. seafood was missing as there weren't any options that were on their own. there were mussels and shrimp dishes, but no crab legs or lobster. there was a omelette station which was cool but remember, eggs cost cents so it may not be cost effective to get full off of eggs (a dozen is at most $2, so enjoy that 0.50 cent omelette). \n\nthe presentation of this restaurant was beautiful. that you can't deny. the decor was trendy and bright. the food were served individually and it was adorable in single containers.\n\ni'm going back to bacchanal or studio b buffet where the positives outweigh the positives of wicked spoon.", 
            "what a difference a year makes.  we headed back to the wicked spoon, anticipating the dionysian food experience we had last time.  i thought that if we went a bit later, the midwest tourists accustomed to eating dinner at 6:00 p.m. would be tucked into their hotel beds or out getting drunk on the strip.  so i figured that getting there about 7:45 would give us plenty of time to stuff our faces before the 9 o'clock closing.  not so fast, cowgirl.\n\nthe line to pay was long and slow; not as long as at disney, but long enough.  and this was a thursday night.  still, if we'd been seated right away, or after a reasonable wait, we still wouldn't have to eat fast and run.  but the line to get seated was as long as the line to pay.  why?  because clean, empty tables stayed empty, and staff was not bothering to clear obviously vacated ones.  it doesn't take a brain surgeon to determine that when all chairs are empty and napkins are atop dirty plates, those diners are dearly departed.\n\nwhile everyone was grumbling about the wait and the tables, no one, as usual, was speaking up except ms. bigmouth, yours truly.  but the manager gave me the usual song and dance and doubletalk. \n\nat last, we got to eat.  and the manager came to our table shortly after to say that she decided to keep the food out for an extra half hour.  still not enough time for what should have been a rather leisurely meal.\n\nit turned out not to matter much.  the heretofore brilliant offerings were mostly pedestrian.  oh, the usual crab legs and sushi were there.  many of the dishes were still served on individual serving plates or bowls.  the lamb soup was excellent.  but beyond that, there was nothing outstanding to choose from.  we sampled enough of a variety of items to come to the sad conclusion that the food was basically tasteless.  salmon was dry and way overcooked.  the chinese dishes were among the most <mark>Uni</mark>, ordinary food ever to grace a pair of chopsticks.  even the gelato was missing flavor.\n\nthe room itself is lacking atmosphere - not elegant, nor even hi-tech like bacchanal.  it's just a room, not even as pretty as the one at the red rock buffet.\n\nand speaking of red rock, the food's better, the service is better, and with a player's card it'll set you back only $14, instead of the outrageous $41 at wicked spoon.  time to go home.",

            "what is the hype about this place? for years i have been wanting to go, but usually the people i go to vegas with aren't interested in trying it ( they don't like buffets) and the ones that have tried it have a strong opinion against it. while my group was busy- i decided i would go myself to try it. what a disappointment. \n\nmaybe i was just expecting too much? for whatever reason it was just <mark>Uni</mark> to me. \n\n1.  they do have a fairly good selection of stuff; many are <mark>Uni</mark> takes on classics. the stuff i liked- i ate plenty of.  i will have to say that the desserts are on the same caliber of home town buffet's desserts ( basic classic desserts, nothing too special). i will hive that the ice-cream/gelato is good (again, nothing too special). \n\n2. the service is good. my waitress was amazing and super kind. \n\n3. i liked plenty of things, and didn't care for a handful of things. the crab to me didn't seem fresh- it smelled fishy to me. the carving station  was good, all the meats were tender and cooked perfectly; i paired most of it with the bbq sauce ( delicious). i liked the pho, but it burned my hand as i was pouring the soup onto my bowl. they have a number of different pasta dishes, all good with a need dose of salt and pepper. they have a fresh cook seafood station which was good.  the sushi was my least favorite- it was cold :(. \n\n\n4. the cost for lunch is (m- f) is $27. i happened to go right at 2:30 so i started with the lunch and ended with the dinner ( lunch ends at 3 and dinner starts at 3). i didn't see too much of a difference. i will say that the buffet is worth 27, but in no way would i pay the dinner price. \n\n5. i would come back if someone wanted to come back with me. however, i wouldn't go out of my way to come back.",

            "i arrived in vegas after a long drive from la on sunday with an enormous appetite.  it seemed to be the perfect occasion to splurge on a buffet.  of course for my very first meal, it had to be between bacchanal and wicked spoon.  i had eaten at bacchanal on my previous vegas vacation, so by default - wicked spoon it was!  i was so thrilled to finally have the opport<mark>Uni</mark> to try this elusive gluttonous foodie heaven.\n\nthe buffet is very pretty and tastefully decorated.  the servers are very friendly and attentive.  unfortunately, the food was not memorable at all.  i wanted to love it so hard, but sadly, it did not live up to my expectations. i had 5 rounds at the buffet - yes 5!  i started off at the meat carving station - the beef roast was very good, but the asparagus was a little woody.  the thick cut bacon was not nearly as good as the bacon at bacchanal - it was not even thick and there wasn't enough smokiness to it.  it just tasted like any regular pork belly.  even though the beef was good, i decided that it did not warrant a return trip to the carving station.  i also had the fried chicken wings, which were decent, but not crispy enough.  kinda under seasoned and the sauce selection was sadly very limited.  there was bbq, ketchup, and something else.  you would think that a place like wicked spoon would be a little more creative and playful.\n\nfor round 2, i did the breakfast part of brunch - i had some carnitas benedict fusion dish - which was not very good - too salty and the carb (i forget the name of it) was far too hard to even cut - i didn't eat it.  the guac was good though, so at least there was that.  i also had the fruit cup, sriracha watermelon (weird), and watermelon-apple juice blend (which was not so flavorful and had me wishing that there were other juice options).  once again, bacchanal beats wicked spoon out here.  \n\nfor round 3, i had the oxtail \"pho\".  first of all, the noodles were not even pho.  they were a different type of thick vietnamese rice noodles - called bun.  not the same as pho - don't try to trick the customer, wicked spoon!  the broth was oxtail and wasn't made to order - there was a big vat of soup that you serve yourself.  the condiment bar for the pho was abysmal.  the  beansprouts, cilantro, and green herb (i don't know what it is called in english) were not fresh at all.  some of the stuff was brown.  no bueno.  also, it's very inaccessible, you really need to reach to get stuff and for me, it was a huge struggle.  however, gotta give them props for the phenomenal roasted bone marrow with crostini.  that was my favorite thing of the meal.  absolutely delicious!  that was the only item that i came back to the buffet a second time for.\n\nfor round 4, i tried some of the asian stuff - sushi (don't get it - it's all rice), pot stickers (good, but not worth wasting your calories on), some sort of sweet and sour chicken with rice (don't get - the rice was hard, the chicken was not hot), chicken wings (decent), and of course more bone marrow.  all in all, pass on the asian section.\n\nfinally, round 5 consisted of desserts.  my fave was the carrot cake and gelato bar.  this was the only section that beat out bacchanal i think.  since i'm not a huge dessert person, i will not be returning to wicked spoon and instead i will be going to bacchanal.\n\nwicked spoon had good variety, pretty presentation of the food, and a delicious dessert bar.  but, most of the food, with the exception of the bone marrow, was unremarkable.  was it worth the $40+ ($35 + tax, tip)?  probably not, to be honest.  i think that money would be much better spent at bacchanal.  i wanted to love wicked spoon especially since i have heard about it for years, but i just wasn't impressed.  good food and plenty of variety, but nothing really wowed.", 
            "i fell in love with this place. it was seriously worth the money i had to pay. they had a wide selection of food and everything was so flavorful and they had a lot of cute, adorable, and <mark>Uni</mark> things that you could try! some of my favorite things were: \n1) beet and vanilla- this dish made me fall in love with beets. it had a hint of vanilla mixed with the cold beets. it had a subtle sweet taste. \n2) salt and vinegar potatoes- they had different colored potatoes in a cute pan with a hint of vinegar and salt. the potatoes were cooked perfectly and were so cute and rustic. \n3) bone marrow with kimchi glaze- it was delicious! loved the sweet and spicy glaze drizzled on top of the bone marrow. \n4) pistachio gelato- so my friends and i asked for all the gelato flavors and got to try most of them. my conclusion is that the pistachio flavor is the best. it was creamy and had a strong pistachio flavor. the next best flavor was the thai tea and then the cookie and cream. \n5) all their meats- omg their meats were flavorful and cooked to perfection! \nother things i loved about this place is their freshly squeezed juices. they had orange juice and my favorite, strawberry apple and watermelon juice. you could taste all of the fruits inside the drink. they also had a really good kale salad. \nhowever the service is terrible. my friend wanted coffee and ended up catching our waiter at the end of the meal for a cup of coffee. \nloved this place. you must go at least once while you are staying in vegas.", 
            "i ate at the wicked spoon buffet twice in august 2013 and once in august 2015. i found that the quality of food has changed, however i still enjoyed this buffet. i also benefited from a lack of lines as well as the price.  \ni arrived at this buffet at about 8pm on a friday night in august 2015 (the buffet closes at 9).  there was no line.  when i ate here in august 2013, i stood in a very small line once, and there was no line during the other visit.  obviously i have had great line-luck when dining at the wicked spoon.  i doubt this buffet always has short lines, however i bet they do not experience the same insane wait at bacchanals.  if the lines were long, that could impact your dining plans since this buffet closes at 9pm.\nwicked spoon uses small plates for many dishes. the quality of these items is awesome, however the food cools quickly.  it does take a while to traverse the buffet spread if you are not seated in the middle.  small plate items will cool depending upon how far you have to walk. however, compared to bacchanals, the small plate cooling issue is not as much of a problem because you are not likely to stand in a line at any wicked spoon station.\nthe wicked spoon has some <mark>Uni</mark> items, which you would expect given the moderately higher price of this buffet.  there are items available at this buffet that can be consumed at less pricey buffets. however, i feel that this buffet was worth the moderately higher cost due to the <mark>Uni</mark> items that were available. i really enjoyed custom seafood station at the wicked spoon.  although this buffet did not appear to be what it was two years ago, i enjoyed my dining experience i would re-visit the wicked spoon because the quality/availability of items seems to be a level above other lower priced buffets.  the line wait and price is significantly less than the bacchanal buffet.", 
            "loved this place. \ni am a bit of a vegas buffet whore and over the years this place seemed to elude me. basic-ass boring buffet food is all too common on the strip and this place didn't fail to bring diverse and tasty dishes.\nit's certainly off the beaten path (who knew cosmo went so deep in? jesus it's a hike!), but well worth it.\nwe went early during dinner service (5:30-ish on tuesday) and found no line and a barely occupied dining room. by the time we left it was pretty packed, so the earlier the better, it seems. (and everything was fresh.)\ni made an effort to try a few of their better-known dishes- wicked mac & cheese, wicked fried chicken, and the bone marrow- and all three were on point. if you think the mac & cheese is too spicy you're a pussy (sorry, that's what zantac is for)- the spice and cheese are perfectly balanced without being greasy or too heavy- i went back for more- this is what mac & cheese is supposed to be. the fried chicken was maybe the best i've ever had, and the mini fryer baskets they come in are adorable. the bone marrow was so rich and flavorful that i managed to turn marrow-naysayers in my party into fans.\nmost everything i tried was delicious, the miso chicken in the asian area being my favorite (wonderfully savory and sweet, also got it twice.) other highlights were the lamb at the carving station, shrimp ceviche, the pho bar, and of course the deserts. (holy god the deserts... dulce de leche cheesecake... red velvet whoopie pies... gelato of many flavors... drooool...)\nthe sushi was just alright, the gnocchi with lamb bolognese and ricotta was so-so, and i've had better prime rib (sadly a bit tough), but the many <mark>Uni</mark> choices left me in an easy position to overlook these missteps.\nadditionally the service was great, and as they got busier it stayed consistently good. a few of us ordered the unlimited wine with our dinner (great value at $12, and not bad wine) and our server was totally on top of refilling our drinks. like so on top of it i'm pretty sure i drank enough to disturb the people next to me at elton john afterward... sorry guys, i can't resist the crocodile rock... i'm a lush...\nbut i digress.\nmy guess is that if you don't like this place you should probably just stick to the more basic buffets and leave this place to the grown-ups with palates. out of the \"fancier\" buffets (wynn, bellagio, and caesars being the others), this is my favorite, perhaps my new favorite buffet in vegas in general.\ngood job, guys. thank you, keep kicking ass. can't wait to come back.", 
            "heart eyed emojis all around for this place. best buffet in vegas by far! and for $27 it's the best deal around, by a long shot. the quality of the food and restaurant is superb. \n\nno need to bore you with the whole concept of the buffet (small portions served in the chicest way possible, if that's a possible way of explaining). so here's what i thought was best:\n-spicy mac and cheese (heart eyed emoji again)\n-whatever the custom juice is that's chilled on ice in glass bottles (you must try this!)\n-roast beef\n-bone narrow (great opport<mark>Uni</mark> to try it since you don't see this often)\n-ham\n-mint chocolate chip gelato\n\nif you're going to take your time, tack on the $12 bottomless mimosa deal. it's a steal, but i made this mistake the first time and ended up becoming too full on champagne to try all the delicacies.", 
            "wow!  this spot is awesome!  bone marrow?  tasty meats cooked to perfection?  individual mac and cheese?  individual shrimp cocktails? apple cobbler?  ice cream?  yep to all of those and more.  this is a fantastic buffet.  i loved the individual serving sizes of many options.  loved the <mark>Uni</mark> take on various dishes.  loved the asian section.....lots and lots of desserts and all were fantastic.  great place for a meal!", 
            "wicked spoon is my go to buffet when i go to vegas and is probably one of my favorite buffets of all times. \n\nwhen you think of buffets, you might think of piling a lot of food onto a plate and then all the flavors are mixed together so it really doesn't even taste all that great. at wicked spoon, everything is so beautifully presented in individual dishes. on top of that, everything comes in petite size which is perfect because it helps limit your intake so that you can try more foods. the quality of each dish is superb and there is a wide selection.\n\nasian station: there is always an asian station where you can find your typical foods like sushi rolls, chinese stir fry and fried rice. what's so special you ask? they pack the fried rice in these cute to go containers size of your palm. mind blown. it's so cute! not only that, but the rice is vegetarian and is delicious. oh yeah this place is very good for vegetarians too!!! they also have bone marrow which is to die for. also oxtail pho which was pretty decent. the kung pao chicken was actually quite good instead of your usual bland kinda soggy chinese food at buffets. sushi rolls weren't too great though. \n\nmeat station: omg meat galore! there are huge pieces of ribeye that the chef will cut for you and you can put sauce on it. there are also sausages, fried chicken that come in this cute little basket.\n\nbreakfast station: there are pancakes, benedicts, omlete station that you can request the chef to make the omlete for you. everything is individually presented as well. \n\nthere is a whole bread and cheese and random stuff station that include fruits, yogurt parfait, shrimp cocktail, juices and salads. this once is esp. vegetarian friendly. i wish i had room to eat cheese and bread. \n\ndessert station: i die..... you basciallyhave to come here for dessert if nothing else. they have an extensive gelato station with very <mark>Uni</mark> flavors like thai iced tea, blood orange and you can get however much you want. all their desserts are super beautifully made including gold flakes and everything is fresh. this is definitely one of my favorite stations\n\nthe service here is also superb and they always check back to see if you need anything. they give you free beverages including tea, coffee, juice, and soda. everything cost about 44 dolalrs for lunch including gratuity which is super worth it if you think about the amount of food you eat and the quality of it. i always stay for almost 3 hours and eat slowly and enjoy everything. everytime i come to wicked spoon, i leave happy and very satisfied and wishing i had a second stomach.", 
            "i am not exactly sure what the fuss is all about this place other than the fancy presentations.  i went here on a saturday and there were 18 people in our group.  we were given a choice of splitting up and pay the regular buffet price or get seated together at almost $45 per person total.  naturally, since it is our high school re<mark>Uni</mark>, we wanted to stay together.  for my $45, i was beaming with expectation of good selection and quality food full of rich flavors.  boy, was i wrong.  the place is nothing but hype - chicken wings getting served in little wire baskets with 2 pcs. each, chinese fried rice in cute little to go cardboard containers, eggs benedict in little pesky saucers, stale crusty sushi, greasy cuts of pork belly etc.  flavor wise, it's nothing to write home about.  had i not been with the group, i would have turned around or asked for a refund and spend the money on better buffets on the strip.  the place sure lives up to its name but just the 'wicked' part.  it's wickedly overpriced and wickedly over hyped and over flaired.  this would be a place for people who like to take pictures of their food because of the presentation but do not want to pay $100 for a la carte`.  it is nowhere close to a quality buffet - not in selections, not in taste and it's all about presentation.\n\nit's my first and last . . .", 
            "yeah, wicked spoon is pretty rockstar. i love it so much, i hosted my wedding reception here!! \n\nwhat i love about wicked spoon is that although it is a buffet, all of their food is done really well. in general, items are not tossed into a huge pan and then you scoop them onto your plate. most items are served in individual portions in a <mark>Uni</mark> way - like the tiny shot glasses of yogurt and granola. \n\nmy favorite item on the buffet is the wicked mac & cheese (previously angry mac & cheese). it's a spicy version of the comfort food you know and love. i haven't found a similar version anywhere else, and i love it! \n\nalso, the dessert section is amazing. i love just walking around and looking at all of the items before i succumb to the gelato. strawberry balsalmic and salted peanut caramel are awesome flavors!! \n\ni really like the look & feel of wicked spoon. it's a modern, trendy feel. the decor is dark and there are big hanging chandelier/sculpture things around the large room. \n\nwhen we had my wedding reception, we rented out a private room. wedding guests of course will never say anything negative about the wedding to the bride, but everyone seemed really pleased with the wide variety and selection available. even the pickiest and healthiest eaters in our group managed to fill their plates with deliciousness. on top of it all, the pastry chefs at cosmopolitan made my wedding cake. it was one of the highlights of my wedding - decorated beautiful and just like the photos i had sent - and tasted delicious too. \n\ni come here every time i'm in vegas, and i'm glad it's a permanent fixture in my life now that the restaurant was a part of my wedding day.", 
            "at $52 per person, i had great expectations.\nafter a 3 hour wait, i just wanted a decent meal and some good seating. i got just one of those wants fulfilled today. \n\nthe interior of wicked spoon is beautiful and modern. the chairs are also incredibly comfortable, in case any one in line is wondering. (good luck waiting in the actual line after the line for buying)\n\ni am a picky eater, but not to the point where i can't enjoy at least some of the food available at a buffet. wicked spoon has proved me (and even my <mark>Uni</mark> open minded and hungry boyfriend) wrong. although there is a wide variety of food, ranging from small cheese blocks to chinese food and passion fruit oysters, literally everything seems to have been given an extra dose (or three...) of grease and salt. not to mention the low quality of even the most basic foods. \n\nsome specific mentions: don't waste your time with the sushi, don't go anywhere near the chinese food, and if you're tempted by the meat station, prepare to look like some sort of a savage trying to grab some meat off the bones. these are not restaurant quality \"fall off the bones\", tender meats. \n\nafter a three hour wait with no rests, low quality food, and a relatively high price tag, there's one thing that saves wicked spoon from a one star rating: the dessert  station! once i toured it, i had immediate regret of even attempting  to fill my stomach with the buffet's pitiful food. the dessert station is absolutely beautiful and offers just about anything anyone could want for dessert.. macarons? chocolate/toffee dipped strawberries? unlimited gelato? (flavors like pistachio, nutella, thai tea..) yes. the quality i expected from this $52, 3 hour wait buffet was reflected in its dessert station.\n\nin conclusion, if you're deciding whether to eat here, don't bother unless you're just going to be spending all your time eating dessert. (which alone still isn't worth $52, really)\nif you're going to be eating here like it or not, spare yourself from the disappointment and grease of the buffet's food and head over to the dessert station as soon as possible... \n\nliterally the first \"expensive\" meal i have eaten in years and i wish i just went to denny's or something, my god. trust me, you can find better food at vegas. please try. \n\nand one last comment, the hosts at wicked spoon occasionally pull out elderly folk from the lines and give them priority, which i commend them for. i do wish however, that they also pull them forward in the first line as well. there's nowhere for anyone to sit except the floor  and i can't imagine the long wait for seniors...", 
            "sighs...i'm wavering between a 3 or 4 star....\n\nto be honest, i really don't like buffets all that much because i don't think i eat enough.. or i overeat and then feel guilty or sick afterwards.  i rather enjoy a nice, well balanced, cheaper meal.  but hey, when you have friends in town and they want to go, its for the company!\n\nso i came here on a sunday night...no wait what so ever an go seated right away.  it was like 44 bucks a person including tax.  the area is a big open space and the d\\u00e9cor is nice.  we go seated and our drink orders got taken right away.  like other buffets...they have small plated items and is separated by different type of food according to ethnicity.  what was really <mark>Uni</mark> about this place is they have this mini verison of oyster bar seafood pan roast station.  the guy is generous with the seafood but they ran out of scallops =(.  i hate it when a buffet runs about of something.  he was a little rude if you didn't tip him in the end.  i got my seafood with the white wine sauce and it was pretty good.  my favorite was the mussles.  \n\nwhat i loved at the buffet was their creamy tomato soup, the prime rib was pretty good, and their bone marrow was delicious.  they also had chinese roast pork but cooked it improperly because the skin was inedible.  can't even chew it.  the skin is my favorite part too.  i really liked their yellowtail but their selection of sushi was very limited.  only nigiri they had were shrimp, yellowtail and unagi.   i wish they had salmon or tuna.  \n\nthe servers came to bust our plates quite often and service was friendly.  i like this better than bacchanal but i like the one at the m resort better."

            "after having a bad experience at the paris buffet, we decide to go walk off all the unnecessary calories off by going to the new cosmopolitan hotel and see all the shiny bling and art. \nit was indeed impressive. after a brisk walk through long open hallways and a cluster of 5 foot tall dog statues pointed towards each other, then a giant high heel we came across the wicked spoon buffet. even though were we were full we wanted to do  walk through. we were impressed by the tapas style method of serving and the food looked good as well. then we passed by the dessert section which is full of fudge, pastries,  chocolate covered crab apples and strawberries, ice cream and gelato, and fresh berries ( you can tell i have a major sweet tooth) that was the point we realized we made a huge mistake by eating at the paris and were planning a return trip there to actually try the food that was making our mouths water.\nfast forward 2 days, we arrived there at 5pm for sunday brunch which was reasonably priced at $27.\nambiance was very comfortable and the decor was cool. luckily we were seated next to the food since we made many trips back n forth seeing how you can only fit 3 small (2-4 bite) plates onto the normal plate you carry. ii tried 3 different salads which were all fresh and yummy.\ntruffle oil infused potatoes were nothing to write about. they love lamb at this buffet because there were 3 different dishes there, not a huge fan of lamb but they were ok as well.\ni didnt expect much from buffet sushi but it was actually surprisingly good since it was being prepared fresh constantly by the chef on site. there was a pho station which was nice too, you don't usually see these at buffets. \ni also liked the brussels sprouts, and fingerling potatoes, red wine mushrooms and the pork bun.\nkinda dissapointed that you have to pay $15 extra for <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, i opted out since i wanted to focus on the regular menu items there.\nthey did serve 2 kinds of <mark>King Crab</mark>, (not legs) one in a butter sauce and the other in a bernaise sauce. both were overcooked and rubbery.\ni even tried the new batches they brought out to find the same result :(\ni didnt try the meat carving stations.\ndessert did not dissapoint though, berries cherries all juicy and sweet.\nhuge tasty chocolate strawberries, great gelato, i tries the pistachio and salty peanut flavors.\n\ni'd go back for sure.\n\ncurrently the m is my favorite buffet but this may take that spot.\n\nbtw if youve got $90 to spend per person check out the sterling buffet at the ballys! only open 1 day a week but its the ultimate. top notch shit there", 
            "this place is amazing!!!\n\nthe food here is incredible! first of all, the hotel is pretty awesome...but i had heard more about the wicked spoon than i did about the hotel! for $27/person...this is the best deal in town!\n\nthe individual portions are pretty awesome! it feels cleaner and nicer...i hate getting food after someone that likes to stir the entire tray to find that single piece of whatever they're looking for! ugh! this is not a problem here!\n\nthey have bone marrow! seriously...awesome!!! delicious...\n\nthey have such an incredible variety of food...it was really hard to decide what to eat! everything is presented very well...and most of the food was to my liking. i will say that the pork belly in the bun was a bit disappointing...it seems the pork belly wasn't cooked long enough to get that tender texture that you'd find at the good chinese restaurants. the <mark>King Crab</mark> meat was delicious...but the way it was prepared lacked some flavor.\n\nthe desserts seem never ending! a fudge station...really great! o...m...g...unlimited chocolate covered strawberries!!! gelato galore! so many treats to eat...ohhh it was incredible!\n\nthis is an outstanding buffet. however, solely based on food, this is a 4-star buffet. but...we had an incredible server...josie! in fact, she is the best server i have ever had at any buffet! she was on top of it...refills were aplenty and usually before we even asked her (except this one time where she forgot my friend's coke...and we definitely reminded her throughout the night about that one missed coke!). josie was engaging...keeping a spirited and welcomed conversation with us! josie's sense of humor is what makes the \"wicked\" in the wicked spoon! josie truly made our wicked spoon experience a 5-star extravaganza! you can be sure that when i go back to the wicked spoon, i will specifically ask to be seated in josie's section!!!\n\nso in summary:\n\nsavory foods - 4 stars\ndesserts - 5 stars\ndecor - 4 stars\nservice - a zillion stars!", 
            "this is one of the better buffets in las vegas.  i went once for dinner, and twice for breakfast in early january 2011.  dinner featured surprising items like pieces of dungeness and <mark>King Crab</mark> already out of the shell and ready to eat.  very good variety, and lots of asian menu items.  the deserts including the gelato were exceptional. \nservice was very professional and courteous.  drink refills can be a little slow because they bring you a whole new cup/glass instead of doing refills.  the same for requests for ketchup, hot sauce, etc.(they do not put the bottles on the table, choosing to pour small amounts in a small serving dish which takes longer for your server.  the buffet also features many items on small plates which makes for a cleaner, more sanitary buffet.\ni don't recall the exact prices, but they are cheaper thank wynn, aria, and bellagio.  less than $30 for dinner and less than $20 for breakfast brunch.", 
            "the wicked spoon buffet at the cosmopolitan is something a little different here in las vegas.  mind you, i said, \"a little\".  \n\nwhile the selection here is pretty amazing, there are still issues with items not being properly labeled (aside from sometimes not having a label at all) and the slow service at the front cashier.\n\nas far as being different, the items in the buffet aren't all that different but the way that they're served are.  just about everything is served in little dishes \"tapas style\".  this is terrific if you want to have just a little of something but can be a real pain if what you wanted was 12 pieces of shrimp cocktail (as there are only 2 shrimp in each dish).\n\nthey serve <mark>King Crab</mark>...but as <mark>King Crab</mark> tails.  very interesting.  after looking into it, i found out that the tails were not usually served in restaurants until recently. personally, i didn't even know that a <mark>King Crab</mark> had a tail.\n\nas with many other buffets here in town, there are salads, breads, different pasta dishes and meats as well as pizzas and asian selections.\n\ni think the wicked spoon is definitely a place to try while visiting las vegas but as a local, i have other buffets i'll go to before this one.  the quality of the food here is good and the buffet seems to be priced correctly for its offerings.\n\nall said, it's ok.  this is vegas.", 
            "this might be my favorite buffet in vegas. you have your usual assortment of dishes but all with an interesting twist. here are some of the highlights. \n\nlamb ribs - incredibly tender and has an asian flavor to it.\nmac n cheese - they make it fresh for you\nkorean short ribs - thick and fatty. delicious. \nbraised beef\nmarinated prawns\n<mark>King Crab</mark> claws\n\n\ni hear people complain about their individual serving dishes. i think it's actually pretty cool. \n\nthe lowlight of the buffet is definitely their desert assortment. definitely a letdown. also, this buffet is more catered to meat eaters. their seafood selection is sparse...where are the oysters and crab legs?", 
            "ah wicked spoon how i've heard so much about you and how you are now the new king of buffets. well...i don't know if you deserve to have that title as of yet. first off the d\\u00e9cor, i'm a big fan. the orange-ish (i know not a word)/yellow hues and the brown give it a modern restaurant feel, it doesn't feel like you're inside of a cheesy buffet. the tables are set up in ways similar to some restaurants in town and they actually give you water in a bottle (whether its really tap or not) instead of just slamming a glass of water on the table and having to refill it with the old school yellowish clear water pitcher that's been used 7,498 times and probably not washed, very refreshing. not to mention the service was pretty good. everyone that worked there was quick and attentive so i like that as well.\n\nsecond, this may not mean anything to anyone but they have a bathroom inside the buffet. i find that to be huge. it's not vital but listen the last thing i wanna do after i've been crac<mark>King Crab</mark> or eating something else with my hands is dig in my pocket for my receipt, walk out of the buffet in the casino to the nearest bathroom, and then come back just to stand near the exit and convince the people there that i was already in there and just had to use the bathroom. is it really that big of a deal? no, but as with other things if it requires less effort on my part, then i'm all for it.\n\nfinally is the food which i'll have to split into two parts: the quality and the setup. the food quality kind of disappoints. the food selection is alright, the side dishes were okay, and all the meats i tried at the carving station were chewy and tough.  the fruit and  vegetable section was impressive but the overall quality of food was less than stellar. it was not as good as the buffet dinners at the m or the bellagio. maybe it was an off night because i keep hearing nothing but good things about the dinner and the brunch but i just felt very dissatisfied by the food quality. \n\n the setup is different, i like it but i don't. i would say that a good part of the buffet has dishes that come in tapas style or small single servings in these little mini pot like things. so lets say you want soup, it already comes in a mini pot with a handle. you want shrimp cocktail there's two small ones in a bowl with cocktail sauce at the bottom and a small lemon. this is a good idea in theory and saves the company money. it's a good idea if you just like to graze and taste and you're not exactly sure what you want, it gives you a little taste of everything. it also saves the company money from people like my friend greedy nick who piles on 17 shrimp and a glob of cocktail sauce knowing damn well all he's going to eat is four shrimp. \n\nhowever, for people like me i usually know what i like and sometimes i like to go to just one item and eat all of that. well that's kind of difficult to do with these small little bowls and pots. you could try to load them all on your plate but you'll maybe get about 5 small bowls without having to do a juggling act. you might think, well that's not too bad, but it just gets annoying. what if i feel like just eating shrimp or crab claws in those little pots. it's like finding a certain chip you like and only being allowed to put five on your plate and having to get up and walk back to the kitchen and go to the bag for five more chips. i know my inner fat kid is coming out. so you may be wondering is it really that big of a deal? not really, but i get my exercise else where and then after i'm lazy ...just let me get a bigger serving so i can save the exercise for later.", 
            "inebriated, yes. however, i think the selection is as playful as a buffet will get with the food. there is actual presentation with individual pots, dishes, etc. which adds to the appeal in my opinion. i like how you can only fit a max of 5 things which keeps you going back. i like it because it feels as if you're eating a personalized plate as opposed to cramming as much food as you can so your lazy ass doesn't have to waddle back. i loved the leek bread pudding. i wish they served <mark>King Crab</mark> legs as opposed to snow but beggars can't be choosers. oh yeah, the dessert was delicious. there was a cup of passion fruit and chocolate that i absolutely loved. i wish i tried everything. you probably want to avoid the \"asian\" section. subpar and salty. though sushi is buffet-esque if you know what i mean. show me a buffet that does sushi legit (besides of course an ayce sushi place).", 
            "my friend sarah read up and recommended wicked spoon as our buffet of choice for our trip.  now, having been to a lot of the big boys like rio, bellagio, wynn, paris, and ph, i was hoping to see if they could deliver a different buffet experience for me.  \n\noverall, it was different in a good way.  yes, the portions were controlled and done in small batches which insures that they are constantly cooking and replenishing from fresh.  no hidden back kitchen where an army of people make a big serving tray full of food.  here, i saw them cook my food and plate it under the heating lamp.  i almost didn't even want to take anything that wasn't just freshly cooked!  if one is lucky enough, a person can just wait for fresh hot food to come out almost every time.\n\nthings that i did miss were the staples of vegas buffets: large <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, some sashimi options, and maybe a chocolate fountain?  i almost expected them to have a fountain of chocolate since it is the buffet of the cosmopolitan? but eh, oh well.  \n\nfor $35 for dinner, would i come back?  maybe if i was staying here for sure but with so many new buffets to try, i'm glad to have tried this one and overall, left feeling delightfully full.", 
            "date/time:  tuesday - 8pm & saturday - 12:30pm\noccasion:  dinner first, brunch second\nparty of:  two\nlocation:  very gaudy and eclectic decor.  buffet spread is very clean and organized.  like the pre-portioned food.\nordered:  all-you-can-eat on tuesday night & saturday brunch\ntotal incl gratuity: ~$45pp for dinner. $37pp for brunch\n\ndisappointed...not once but twice!  i came here first during my fourth of july weekend trip and actually just paid another visit this past weekend during the trip with my girls.  i don't see how this place is getting such high marks. the food is laid out well however the quality and the variety is just not as impressive as some of the other buffets i've seen, like wynn or bellagio.  what baffles me, too, is that the price is the same as those buffets of a higher caliber.\n\nsome of the food during my visits included but not limited to: caesar salad, tomato salad, ceviche, your normal hot foods like mashed potatoes, veggies, chicken, pastas, sausages, carving station with turkey, prime rib, lamb, steamed snow crab legs, mac n' cheese station, a small selection of chinese foods like chinese broccoli, fried rice, bbq pork, make your own faux pho, and miso soup.  during my brunch trip, there were breakfast foods like sausage, bacon, country fried steak, omelet station, baskets of fried chicken, fresh fatty bacon, and some sushi.  the fried chicken and the string beans are the only ones really worth mentioning.  \n\nthe food is only ok.  during my dinner visit, i was shocked they didn't offer alaskan <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, especially for that price. dinner pricing: $37.00 per person, while brunch was $29.00 per person (without the champagne.)  what i did like about this place is that most of the food is pre-portioned for you in a little carafe.  it keeps it a lot neater and probably helps people take what they'll eat rather than scooping loads of food on their plate only to waste it later on.  i don't think i'll make another trip back.  too many more options to try in vegas.", 
            "how wicked spoon got anything over 2 stars is beyond me. first off, my favorite vegas buffet at the moment is at the aria. but since my cousin told me that wicked spoon was 10x's better, my boyfriend and i decided to give it a try. we went there dinner time on a tuesday night, and the place was half filled. we are seated immediately and head over to the food to begin gorge fest 2011. i was excited at first because of the presentation. a lot of the food came in cute little pots, but most of it was lacking in taste. i tried the bone marrow, which is supposed to be their specialty, i have to say there was more grease than marrow. the shrimp was alright, plump but that's all i can say about it. the crab legs were ok, but i was a bit disappointed since the aria offers not just snow crab legs, but also <mark>King Crab</mark>. again, the wicked spoon was only visually pleasing, because the dessert bar kinda made me feel like a kid in a candy store with all their selections. i must have had 8 different desserts on my plate, and none are really worth mentioning. ehhh...going back to aria buffet next time.", 
            "i was a bit disappointed by this buffet and the service. we waited almost half an hour to get our drinks, and this was only after we had to flag down another server after several others blatantly ignored our attempts to get their attention.\n\nthe food was good, but pales in comparison to the buffet at the wynn. crab legs were good, but not the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs that they offer at the wynn. i loved the shortribs with pasta, but only one or two tiny pieces of meat per serving? come on. the prime rib was great though. it was flavorful and tender. their kalbi was good too, but i can make a mean kalbi at home so it was nothing special. i loved their make-your-own mac and cheese bar. we went with chedder and mozarella cheese, carmalized onions, and bacon. yum! fried chicken wing with chipotle sauce and mashed potatoes was bland. saki soaked turkey breast was good, but char siu was run of the mill. shimp in the shrimp and grits was rubbery and bland. their dessert buffet looks impressive, but besides the gelato, most of the flavors were just okay. \n\nit was good, but i'd rather go to the wynn if i'm spending this much on a vegas buffet.", 
            "after a day of partying out by the pool and then walking through the smoldering hot strip to get to the cosmopolitan, i was about ready to down a pitcher of water, but i restrained myself so i could eat more of the deliciousness that lay before me.\n\nwe came for sunday dinner at 5:30 and there wasn't much of a wait luckily.  $35 for dinner is reasonable to me since it is vegas and the food is gourmet.  and we spent about 2 and 1/2 hours there, so i feel like we got our money's worth.\n\ni like the little pots that everything is served in because not only are they super cute, but they prevent people like me from taking more than they can eat.  plus, i get to feel like a tasting judge on iron chef.\n\nthey have gelato at the dessert station which is cool.  pistashio is pretty yummy.  the build-your-own strawberry shortcakes were good too.  they also have a made-to-order mac n cheese station! i made one with shrimp, bacon, tomatoes, white and yellow cheeses.  so gooey, cheesy and delicious!  too rich to eat it all, but worth a try!  \n\nmy only complaints were that they serve dinky little snow crab legs instead of <mark>King Crab</mark> and they didn't have creme brulee.  if you're one of those that come to buffets and gorge on the crab legs, this might not be the place for you.", 
            "loved!  loved!!  loved this place!!!\n\ni found this place through yelp and really looked forward to eating there on my trip!  my bf and i spent a week in vegas; and on our 2nd to last night there, we finally ate at the wicked spoon buffet!!  first of all, it's in the cosmopolitan resort & casino - which is a very beautiful hotel, but bigger than it seems!  it was a journey to get to, but at least there were lots of art work to look at and take pictures of!  i especially loved the larger than life stilettos and the pictures of chocolate dipped objects: more stilettos and sunglasses...so hot!  \n\nwe got there a little after they opened for dinner (5pm) and there was no wait.  we were walked to our table which wasn't in a really \"pretty\" area of the buffet, but very close to all the food!\n\non my first trip to the buffet, i got some salads, gazpacho, shrimp w/risotto, and some kind of fish on top of asparagus.  everything was good, but the fish was not that good - my bf grabbed a different type of fish dish that tasted better!  for my next trip, i got some sushi, prawns, kalbi, beef with gnocchi, a kind of noodle soup thing i mistook for pho, and sauteed string beans with brussel sprouts, caramelized onions, and garlic.  the kalbi and soup were not so good, but the veggies were sooo good!!  so was the gnocchi and sushi!  my bf got some crab legs and gave me some meat (i really hate cracking open crab legs - if they aren't <mark>King Crab</mark> legs...not worth the work!), so that was good, since i didn't have to crack them myself.\n\nthe dessert section of the buffet was as overwhelming as the regular food section - there was soo much to choose from!  and everything was so beautifully displayed!  the colors on the mini treats were very vibrant and i could hardly make up my mind!  there were even about 20 different flavors of ice cream!  there was peanut butter & jelly, pistachio, caramel candy bar, etc.  soooo good!!\n\ni really liked this buffet, it's pretty and the food is really good.  service was especially good - our water was always filled by our waiter, even though they have a big glass water bottle thing at the table - so we could've filled it ourselves!  our plates were always taken away in a timely manner, and whenever we needed anything - our waiter was there!  plus, it's in a super swank hotel that makes you feel like you're a high roller!", 
            "so much potential, but under delivered.  bone marrow tasted like greasy fat.  should have been toasty & nutty.  crab legs were cheap snow crab and not <mark>King Crab</mark>.  the server just pile it on your place, you can chose.  they were also dry and over salted.  the buffet at aria al least has one maine lobster per person.  their only saving grace is their prime rib is decent and their ice cream is good.  we would be back.", 
            "these buffet lines are ridiculous. must be all the asians and jews out to get the most bang for their buck. luckily for us, someone in our group just walked up to the vip line and chatted up the mexican cashier sistah. right on through to the next hellish line to be seated. \n\nunlike the regulars (wynn buffet, bellagio buffet, sterling brunch, etc...), wicked spoon is probably the best deal for a buffet in this city. i think it was somewhere around the range of $40 ( ~$30 + ~$10 for unlimited champagne, bloody marys, mimosas). that's pretty damn cheap, and if that isn't for you, there's no reason that you should be in vegas in the first place. \n\ni especially enjoyed the proper apportioning of food. helps prevent the asian moms from grabbing 20 lbs. of <mark>King Crab</mark> legs and helps you pace yourself to try everything at least once. nice selection of dishes that are prepared, that breaks away from the traditional buffet model.\n\nthey have a pretty awesome dessert section as well.\n\ngo throw up then get ready for marquee. cosmo is definitely hitting it big.", 
            "i was kind of disappointed with this buffet after so many 4 star reviews. i mean it's just a buffet and they really seemed to be all the same in vegas, mediocre food at not too expensive price. \n\nthere was really nothing outstanding other than the bone marrow, which was a letdown. otherwise, <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, prime rib, lamb chop, fish, pasta, salad..........\n\nthe only redeeming quality was the dessert bar. really good ice cream and sorbet., tasty pastries and cakes, chocolate cover strawberries ( which alone can cover the price of the buffet) and a variet of fruits. \n\nbuffet are all the same in vegas and this one follows the same recipe. oh, don't order the \"all you can drink wine\" option should they offer it, all i could stand was one glass.", 
            "the thing one should know about buffets in vegas is that the best, cleanest ones are the ones that most recently opened. wicked spoon is the latest grand buffet, opened in the cosmopolitan, so i would recommend going if you're looking for a buffet to dine in at vegas.  i've heard people rave about since it opened last year, especially about their dessert selection; so my friends and i decided to give it a go on our last day in vegas. overall, i thought the food selection was mediocre; although their dishes were well-portioned, organized and various. i really enjoyed that most of the food were portioned out into mini steel pots and pans, making the presentation quite appealing for a buffet meal. it also prevented your food selection from forming one congruent blob. \n\nwe visited during a weekday brunch, which is probably why i was a bit disappointed with the food selection (i.e. no <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, lobster). the meat section looked very fulfilling, with the usual roasted lamb, prime rib, pork.  their roasted personal lamb shanks looked quite juicy and scrumptious. they also had korean barbecue spare ribs, bulgolgi, which were apparently quite good. \n\npersonally, as a pescetarian, the highlights for me were the:\n\n-artisan salad bowls (mini bowls to be exact)-their salads were amazing, crafted with various cheeses, fruits, nuts and homemade dressings (including strawberry balsamic!)\n-thai green curry clams \n-classic french mussels\n-baked salmon \n-smoked salmon and caper pizza (their pizza are thin crust, strewn with loads of gourmet cheese and interesting combinations of ingredients)\n-gnocchi: gnocchi is definitely not \"fancy\" food but i was impressed by its homemade texture\n-taco station: pre-made soft shell tacos with 3 different flavors, and a myriad of condiments \n-desserts galore, which includes huge chocolate covered strawberries, strawberry white chocolate fudge, countless french pastries, red velvet cookies, and most importantly---gelato!\n\nit could possible that wicked spoon was overhyped, because i do not eat meat or went during a weekday lunch...but overall, i thought this buffet wasn't that impressive. i, however, did like the modern decorum of the buffet; it was much more spacious than the other buffets on the stip, and there were little no lines! also, for 8 dollars more, you have the option of having bottomless mimosas and other fruit cocktails!", 
            "am i the only one disappointed in this buffet?  the food was good, but definitely not worthy of 4/5 stars.   at first, i thought the individual pots were so clever and cute but as i began to eat, i realized all the food was cold!  it makes me wonder how long they let each dish sit out and how often do they replace them :t  and the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs? utter disapointment! they were extremely dry! the meat would crumble and fall apart before i can remove them from its shell.  they did have a few interesting dishes that i havent seen at most buffets, including bone marrow and pho (but sorry they failed on this as well: they used the wrong noodles and let it sit in a pot of cold soggy water and the broth was tasteless) .  the only thing i would say i loved about this buffet is their dessert bar -- great selection of ice cream, cakes, n cake pops.  this place is only getting 3 stars because of their desesrt bar.", 
            "disappointing experience. i was really looking forward to trying wicked spoon, especially because the food comes in these small portions in a little skillet.\n\nperhaps we went on an off-nite because the selection was extremely limited. where was the little skillets of mac n cheese? where were the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs? (we got anorexic snow crab). where were the huge prawns for the shrimp cocktail? $35++ per person and just a very limited selection of seafood = fail. \n\neverything else was just potatoes and pasta in the little skillets.. or carb fillers as i like to call them. i wish i went back to my favorite aria buffet instead.", 
            "the wicked spoon buffet is located in the far depths of the cosmopolitan hotel. could it be placed in a more remote location?! it's hard to compare this buffet to others, but i think it goes on the same caliber as the wynn buffet but i can't compare because they just do different cuisines and different things. \n\nthis buffet is a pricey penny at $35 for dinner when there is not that much seafood at all. dinner starts at 5pm and they close from 2pm to 5pm i believe. \n\nthe sushi sucks here, so don't expect much. it's true what other reviewers stated that they put most of their food items in individual bowls/plates/pots. so it's already portioned out individually which is good for not wasting. but at the same time, if you only want very little of it to try you can't do that either. i thought the food being placed in individual bowls and plates was a neat idea until i got there and 3 or 4 items takes up your entire plate! so you just have to make more trips but i guess that's good because it makes you really rethink if you really want the food item. \n\ntheir food is a different type of caliber and cuisine. there were items like bone marrow, gnocchi, couscous, lamb sliders, fish and chips with waffle fries, etc... the only seafood that i remember them having was skinny/short <mark>King Crab</mark> legs and mussels. i believe that was it? \n\nthe item that stole the show for me here at the wsb was the dessert section! i'm not a huge dessert person either but they had some very <mark>Uni</mark> items here like the almond joy gelato! mhmmm that was soo delicious! they had like 15 different flavors of gelato for your picking which was nice. \n\nthe service by the food staff was sparse, i hardly saw any of them behind the counters and i would have questions or there was no tongs for food. \n\ni'm deducting a star because of the price of the buffet, the food service and location of how far into cosmopolitan it is located. and also the food quality was either no taste or overcooked and we went a little after 5pm. a lot of the food items looked better than they tasted which is too bad. and there's hardly any seafood to warrant the price tag.", 
            "we came here at the suggestion of a friend.  being from hawaii and coming over on vacations hawaii, we tend to stay in downtown las vegas for most of our dining.  similar to the majority i would guess.\nwe headed out to the wicked spoon after a long day of shopping.  originally i expected to have a stopover at our hotel to change clothes and was actually not happy about being in shorts and slipper for our dinner buffet.  i was glad to se numerous other people as the dinner progress to be in similar clothes.  based on my friends despription of the dinner fair i was thinking everything was upper class, even the dining attire.  i guess they probably would want you to dress up but being vegas, take anything.\nwe got there at the start of their dinner buffet service.  just after 5:00 pm.  even though we were one of the first parties to arrive, they were prepped and ready for a hundred.  \nwe did a quick walkthrough of the buffet to plan  our attack.  my goal was not to load up too much on the heavy foods and make sure i can try all the dishes that i wanted too.  almost all of the dishes are presented like 5 star restaurant appetizers or sides.  coming form cut two nights ago i can honestly say they could have easily pulled their appetizers straght off these buffet lines.\nall the dishes were presented very elegantly.  a dish in their own.  my particular favorites were the shrimp and bbq, cowboy bacon on potato, soybeans, cheese platter, pig tail, and the decadent desserts.  the desserts were awesome.  i usually don't eat dessert in restaurant as i normally am too full, but i save space for them here.  i actually ate dinner, dessert, then dinner again.  i had to end on the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs-----of course.\nthey also have a special happy hour pricing for selct drinks and cocktails from the bar from 5:00 to ?. \nno matter what your appetite, you will definitely find what you want at the wicked spoon buffet.  it will be on my must go list for my next trip out here.  it is about $38 but you are in las vegas. give them a try and happy eats!!", 
            "one of the best buffets in lv. dessert alone is worth going and the mac n cheese bar the bomb. bone marrow sooo good but sooo super fat! started hallucinating after like 3 bone marrows but worth it. i would give it a 5 if their crabs were <mark>King Crab</mark> legs and not snow crab but everything else is on point. this place is is fine dining w good food and not boojie like alot of the other buffets. this place is just bomb!", 
            "this is a really nice place! the wicked spoon buffet has got my vote as one of the better buffets in vegas. i was really impressed by the entrance to the buffet. it is really modern and the decor impressive. if you get there around 6ish, you should be able to get in without an extra long wait. our group of ten waited maybe 15 minutes. once seated, you are immediately met by the server who will take care of you during your dinner.  we sat at a long table with high bar chairs which i really lthey bring you flasks of water so no need to keep asking for refills. once you decide to get started you are literally met by a barrage of different stations offering up so many different delectable food selections! i especially enjoyed the salad bar and the blt salad, it was really good. the shrimp cocktail was refreshing. on to the meat! you have a selection of prime rib, lamb, bone with the marrow in it, yes, seriously. they also have bbq ribs, fish, chicken, the crispy baked chicken was tasty. as for us crab leg lovers, well, i wasn't overly impressed, it was standard buffet fare and if it were true alaskan <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, i'm sure the price of the buffet would have been stiffer! they didn't have that natural saltiness to it, maybe they were boiled? there is a sushi section where you can have custom rolls made or just sample the different varieties. there is an extensive selection of desserts, from pies to cakes, gelato, ice cream, chocolate bars... would i go back next time? you bet!", 
            "favorite buffet in vegas. delicious, fresh, abundant options. loved wicked spoon's individual serving sizes - definitely distinguishes it from other strip buffets, including bellagio. \n\nantipasto (5-star) - excellent meats, olives, cheeses, fresh grapes. all kept very clean.\nmexican (4-star): tacos, pork, ceviche all done pretty well.\nmeats: (4-star): carving station had an incredible bacon - best i've ever had, and whiskey-rubbed pork shoulder. galbi and bbq ribs had good flavor.\nseafood: (4-star): doesn't have <mark>King Crab</mark>, but fish (salmon, halibut) was well-made - salmon melts in your mouth, and shrimp cocktail was fresh.\nasian (3-star): sushi selection is non-existent/passable. had a delicious duck bun similar to tw gwa bao, mistakenly labeled \"banh mi\" (major miss). no dimsum, udon or congee.\n\ndesserts (5-star)\nobsessed with the housemade marshmallows - so cute and tasty. \ngelato bar is fantastic w/mini-scoops perfect for sampling flavors. \nloved the tasting cup creations - faves were passionfruit gelee layered with chocolate mousse, strawberry shortcake. \ngigantic chocolate-covered strawberries - have never seen strawberries as large as these - intense.\n\nquick service on weekdays, wait on weekends can be a bit longer. a bit hidden in the back of cosmo, but quiet and classy vs. the buffet at bellagio (aka circus).", 
            "nice lovely ambiance. great service. for $8 more you can have bottomless wine. many dishes are served in individual mini pots, bowls and baskets - which is cute! they have rare items in buffets e.g. bone marrow which had made me excited when i heard about it before i went. however it didn't execute well, taste disappointed with a full mouthful of grease. japanese food selection is tiny - no sashimi, and only some types of simple rolls. <mark>King Crab</mark> legs are not as big & fresh as the ones at bellagio. they have big italian section though - mac n cheese, pasta, pizza etc. i do like their cook-to-order mussels in your choice of broth; the very fresh cocktail shrimps; and the pork ribs in bbq sauce. they also have a large variety of desserts - macarons, chocolate covered strawberries, lots of different flavors of gelato and more! overall worth a try, but it wouldn't be my #1 buffet in vegas.", 
            "great concept! i loved the individual portions just for the novelty of it. it might be useful to go with a buddy and pick out things to share.\n\nhighlights included the pesto mashed potatoes, prime rib, fried chicken, mushroom risotto, and truffled scalloped potatoes.\n\nlowlights: ramen (too salty), sushi (i didn't try any, but apparently it was the worst sushi ever), and some of the desserts were disappointing (rock hard red velvet cookies).\n\ncool idea with the mac and cheese bar, but one bowl can be shared with the table, as it's very rich and creamy, and the portions are pretty big. and you wanna save room for those <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, right?\n\nmaybe this place doesn't have the variety like other buffets, but they offer items that are different or use different ingredients, which makes it more interesting.", 
            "excellent buffet! everything was fresh, hot, and portion sized! get the salads and korean galbi!\n\ni also enjoyed their huge slices of heirloom tomatoes, salt&pepper calamari, green beans, <mark>King Crab</mark>, and huge selection of desserts!", 
            "located inside the cosmopolitan. very nice and friendly staff. the food was excellent. i like how they sliced the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs lengthwise. i tried almost everything there and stopped at plate number 8. of all the buffets that i've been to in sin city, this is in the top 5. will come here again without hesitation.", 
            "we came here for dinner while staying at the cosmopolitan hotel. the place is clean, hip, and big! the food is fresh and tasty. the options are ordinary for buffet though. we got there around 8:30pm mad were told that they are closing around 9:30 pm... obviously, many dishes are no longer available, only few sushi piece left, no fish dishes, or <mark>King Crab</mark> legs...\nthe desert on the other hand is very tasty... a lot of chocolate... \n\nthe reason i give this place 4 star is for the cleanliness, quality, and their desert bar!\nwould recommend to come early so that you can get all variety of dishes!\n$41 + tips per person for dinner is quite hefty!",

            "i'm not a buffet person, i just don't eat enough to make the cost worth it. however, the wicked spoon was worth it. they have small plates that encourage you to eat a little bit of everything. also, they have  a ton a healthy, interesting salads that i just loved. they had a beet salad, a egg and bacon salad, an octopus salad. loved it! they also had a \"cheese plate\" selection with stilton cheese, brie, more with grapes. yummy. my husband loved their roasted tomatoes with korean beef. oh and i almost forgot they have <mark>King Crab</mark> legs. omg delicious and fresh tasting. \ntheir desserts were okay, but i was so fully by then it didn't really matter :)", 
            "great buffet but bellagio was better.\n\nthe wicked spoon had all the good stuff.   prime rib, short ribs, <mark>King Crab</mark> legs but they just weren't as good as the bellagio.   the prime rib was even.  bellagio gave you big hulking pieces of short ribs which the spoon gave you a few shreds of short rib on some sort of mashed potato or polenta.  it was good but not quite as good.   the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs were bigger at the bellagio.  \n\nthe wicked spoon does have a few more options and it is nice that they put everything in to individual portions while you have to make your own portion at bellagio.    the service was also better at the wicked spoon.   but somehow there were far less people at the wicked spoon.", 
            "4.5 stars \n\ni'll start by saying i haven't eaten at a buffet in about 15 years... not that i'm against them...just they never are at the top of the list when it comes to dining out. \n\nwell... i have to say... this place was great!  i enjoyed the small servings as it gives you a chance to try things you might not normally try.  it was $105 for my wife and i to enjoy dinner and i think it was worth it. as mentioned we were able to sample things we wouldn't normally order from a restaurant.  \n\nsome of the highlights for us.... (keep in mind... small portions... looks like a lot.. it wasn't) \n\nleg of lamb\n<mark>King Crab</mark> legs \nspicy shrimp\nspicy shrimp and grits\nshrimp cocktail\nmade to order mac-n-cheese (split this...large portion)\nwild boar \nvariety of salads my wife sampled and enjoyed\npolenta with truffle oil and pesto (awesome) \ngnocchi (really nice) \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\ndesserts \ndulce de leche mini cakes\nmolten lava cake/raspberry sauce\npeach cobbler ( my wife loved it so much.. .she had two... highly unusual for her) \n\n\nall in all the place put out quality food and is well worth the visit. \n\nthe bone marrow... nothing amazing to be honest.. not a lot of flavor.\n\natmosphere... a little loud... but... being it's so popular and a buffet... it is to be expected. \n\nwe would recommend this place to others who are interested in enjoying a great buffet with a wide variety of menu items.", 
            "very diappointing and definately not up to par with the other top buffets in town. i went with every high expectations and had heard a lot of great things about it. i got there and it was 46 dollars basically the same price as the bacchanal buffet which is amazing so i immediately upped my expectations. i got in and the assortment was in no comparison to the bacchanal  buffet . the food was old and nothing was fresh except the mexican section. the crabs were not <mark>King Crab</mark> they were snow crabs and they were gritty with not much meat in them. overall the food was mediocre and nothing stood out as special that made me wanna go back. the gelato was very good but not enough to make me come back. i will never go to this buffet over the bacchanal buffet.", 
            "i was super pleased with my dinner at the wicked spoon. the food was amazing. \n\nthey had incredible prime rib, where they cut it rare and grill it to make it exactly medium rare, medium, or well. the lamb at the carving station was also incredible. note that they didn't have crown / rack of lamb, but they had an incredible lamb leg that was unreal. \n\nthey had baked oysters but not raw ones. they had snow crab but not <mark>King Crab</mark>. they had a great variety of food and i don't think you'd be disappointed. nice salmon, and pretty much, you name it. \n\ni felt that the food was excellent, and that it was better than bellagio buffet, which i had twice on the same trip. however, bellagio had <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, snow crab, smoked salmon, etc and bellagio is less expensive. but the subtle taste and selection of the wicked spoon made it tops for me. \n\nwe did have an issue where there were no lemons near the crab legs. for some reason, the back of the restaurant must have cut up a ton of limes instead. they had a bowl of limes. i am told that in spanish, the word may be similar. \n\nanyway, the guy at that station was super sarcastic about not having lemons, so we mentioned it to a manager who was very professional. while we didn't believe that there was \"a lemon shortage\" according to the manager, he did promptly bring out some cut lemons and asked us to describe the person, which he was going to have a talk with. i felt that he handled the situation pretty well. this was a great experience and i should have gone back for a second time. \n\nbacchanal is similarly good, but bacchanal had some techno music playing on a saturday that seemed designed to get you out of the place. \n\nas fyi, the buffet at planet hollywood was a huge disappointment. it was mostly fried food and not too much to rave about.", 
            "wicked spoon, yes. it's a pretty cool fusion-y buffet with a huge selection. hmmm what can i say..it's honestly not mediocre. they have some fancy stuff like shrimp ceviche, crab, etc. but if you're tryna od on some fresh oyster, shrimp, seafood...not really the place. all the food doesn't seem like it's worth $50. i probably ate until i almost passed out, but i filled myself with maybe $20 worth of food. they got macarons though! my friends and i togo-ed hella haha...to use up the $30 i wasn't able to accomplish with all the chinese food and italian food, which isn't really worth that much money. i think the buffet at caesar's palace is way better.\nthey change up their menus and sometimes they don't have certain stuff so be sure to check.\n\nthe second time i went, i really didn't get my moneys worth. they kept running out of everything. they had no macarons, so goodbye $30! they seriously had nothing but <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, which became tiring after a while to crack open...\n\ni just don't think wicked spoon is worth the money. its super fancy schmancy and pretty. high quality? yes. but they don't have the big stuff like oysters, shrimp..etc. they had salmon, but it was danky and aite... \n\ndessert selection is amazingggggg and super well presented in their decor, but taste wise it was aye-okayy. \n\ngood for the whole experience since it is in cosmopolitan hotel and it's super nice. saw matt barnes doeee which was pretty cool ;d", 
            "it's one wicked buffet indeed! hip and trendy, this is located inside the very chic cosmopolitan hotel. \n\ni've frequented this buffet quite a handful of times now so my review here is long overdue. my last visit was over thanksgiving and it was only by default that we came because our original plan was to hit up bacchanal buffet (the new and very hyped up buffet at the caesars palace) which had a ridiculous wait of 3-4 hours at 2pm. sorry, i'm not that crazy to stay in line that long. wicked spoon here we come! ohhhh yeah!!\n\n45 minutes of waiting in line to pay and another 45 minutes to get seated, not bad! we paid about $50 per person for dinner as opposed to $60 in bacchanal for their thanksgiving rate. you have to pay extra $$ if you want mimosa included. \n\nso among the plethora of food choices to choose from, arranged by cuisines from all corners of the world, below is an outline of the reasons why i love wicked spoon. \n\nfor starters, i went crazy over these:\n-pumpkin soup---not sure what else is in this soup aside from the pumpkin but it's hearty and addicting! \n-<mark>King Crab</mark> legs---fresh and sweet! \n-shrimp cocktail---succulent! \n\nfrom the carving station:\n-bone marrow---i ate this like there was no tomorrow. i probably need to see a heart doctor soon but it was all worth it. \"a moment on your lips, a lifetime on the hips!\" \n-roast beef---yummm...\n-lamb---cooked perfectly, not gamey, tender, juicy, tasty...need i say more!?\n-turkey---not a turkey fan but it was thanksgiving so i had to eat some. it was great! \n\nseafood entrees:\n-shrimps---cooked in butter, garlic, and other spices. i got down and dirty eating these crustaceans. delicious!\n-mussels mariniere---i had 3 bowls of these. the sauce was fantastic! i was literally slurping it down. \n\nasian corner:\n-roasted pork belly---5-spice infused, the pork was beautifully cooked. it was juicy, tender, and flavorful! the crispy skin was a nice added touch. \n\ncarbo loading:\n-paella\n-mushroom risotto\n-mac n cheese---dude!! they have a made-to-order station for this! it's amazing! you get to pick what you want in your mac n cheese. sooooo goooood!\n\ndessert:\n-chocolate covered strawberries---this is one sight to behold and an indulgence to partake. a must!\n-gelato---a myriad of flavors to choose from...you'll go crazy! thai iced tea and nutella were my top two favorites! \n-macarons---last but not the least, these are not to be missed. they had the mango flavored that day and it was divine! sad to say, the next batch didn't have the same perfect consistency as the first ones i've had. all's well though because i may have had as much as my heart's content before the 2nd batch came out.   \n\nserving:\nmost of their dishes are already pre-plated in small portions. it's nice how they do this because not only does it minimize waste, it also allows you to try small portions of all the food selections they have to offer without over filling yourself. i like their concept: <mark>Uni</mark> and practical! \n\nservice:\n-from the people at the register, to the receptionist, and to the server, everyone were all smiles and efficient in what they do. our plates were cleared whenever needed and our drinks were always filled. top-notch service! \n\nfor now, i think wicked spoon is the best buffet in vegas. quality food and service. then again, i have yet to try what bacchanal has to offer. until then...", 
            "i was so excited to try this place after hearing people rave about how it's the best buffet right now. the food was okay. while walking us to our seats, the host was telling us about the galbi but it was over cooked. the lady we spoke to over the phone earlier that day told us to wait for dinner if we wanted <mark>King Crab</mark> legs but there were only snow crab legs when we got there. the dishes here are done decently and i like that they have hot and sour soup but for the price i would go with the other buffet choices out there.\n\nour waitress and the host were friendly and took the time to chat it up with us. my favorite part of the buffet would probably be the salad/appetizer section. they had octopus, shrimps, and a watermelon salad.  i might be getting to old for buffets. i felt like i needed to be rolled out of there after eating past my limit.", 
            "i flew into vegas on saturday and landed at 2pm. promptly decided that it was worth it to skip lunch and go for an early buffet dinner to 'skip the line'. well, it was pretty much dead at 4:30pm, a good time to go guys! haha the only thing is, with the room so empty and decked out in dark wood and amber, it felt dark and danky. maybe it's better to judge the atmosphere when it's a bit fuller. \n\nfood was okay, i expected a bit more selections. for example, they didn't have any oysters, cooked or raw, nor sashimi. some highlights:\n\n- ceviche - so good, i had two!\n- seared scallops - yummy, perfectly cooked\n- roasted pork belly - this is in the asian aisle and we didn't see it until near the end before dessert time. i literally gasped because i love pork belly and this was delicious. saving grace for the rest of the buffet really...\n- great selection of gelato\n\nyou can skip:\n- the bucket of fried chicken. looks so cute but it was dry and not seasoned. \ni'm afraid you misunderstood my last sentence. i don't mean under seasoned; i mean not seasoned.\n- the <mark>King Crab</mark> legs. maybe i'm spoiled because i'm from the pacific northwest and we eat seafood like fast food here. these crab legs taste like salt water. just imagine salty water that has a texture and you've got the crab legs served at wicked spoon.\n\nwhen we left, the restaurant was starting to fill up but still no line yet. that was around 6:30pm. i think that the rush would have started anytime after that. all in all, for ~$40 for buffet, i would come back again but would probably try their brunch/lunch.", 
            "$35 for lunch buffet (was here on 12/22/13)\n\neverything here is great. i enjoyed many of the items here. i only wish that they have crab legs. for $35 i don't expect to see <mark>King Crab</mark>, but at least snow crabs; plus it was a holiday weekend that i visited. \n\neverything here is presented \"cutely\" which makes the food looks good, however it actually tasted good. the fried chicken here was much better than bacchanal's. the chicken actually had taste and it was not dry.\n\ni really enjoyed the sirloin, it was perfectly cooked and was juicy.\nmost of their pasta dishes were good, from their mushroom risotto to angry mac and cheese -- all tasted way better than bacchanal's, i thought.\n\ntheir cured meat selections were just meh. i liked bacchanal's way better for that. \nsushi section was sad; all cheap sushi rolls and no nigiri, just plain regular sushi rolls with fake crab meat (not even california rolls). it's like the korean version of sushi. i didn't eat anything from that section. \n\ndesserts were decent: their chocolate dipped strawberries were big and to be honest i did find bacchanal's dessert section much better.\n\noverall the experience at wicked spoon is how i expected. it was good and different - a place for those who cares about presentations.", 
            "there were so many options of prime food available here. depending on when you arrive, you will be able to find delicacies such as walnut french toast for breakfast or fresh <mark>King Crab</mark> legs and juicy leg of lamb for lunch and dinner. i do believe they have permanent installations of other food such as korean bbq and american buttermilk fried chicken. but in addition, they serve their sweet desserts around the clock, with their italian gelato as their keynote. on another note, they also serve a wide variety of vegetarian friendly dishes that one can choose from. the quantity of the food they serve equals the quality of food and service. for each serving station, they have a handful of chefs that maintain the great quality of the food. their servers will also keep you hydrated with the complimentary drink, and the aforementioned stations can even receive personalized requests. the $42 buffet price is really worth it all. one just better come hungry!", 
            "while the food was decent, the price cannot be justified for how mediocre majority of the stuff offered on the buffet.  the sushi was americanized low grade garbage, the roasted meats were all cheap, and majority of the stuff looked better than it tasted.  there were a few things that tasted good like the slab bacon, watermelon salad, and the braised beef handmade pasta but for me to drop 40 bucks for a brunch buffet for bacon, watermelon and pasta is outrageous.  the bone marrow was also cooked incorrectly and needed to be roasted longer.  there was also no <mark>King Crab</mark> or prime rib which is a must for a las vegas buffet.  i will never go back due to the price and i think i would rather pay a few bucks more and go to the bellagio buffet just for the <mark>King Crab</mark>.  this is totally overrated.", 
            "the service was outstanding here. our server was very nice. she was very tentative and refilled our drinks as soon as we were done. \n\nthe food is good. nothing too crazy, but nothing too plain as well. i think it's an experience and you have to go here if you haven't. most of their food was interesting to try. nothing i was crazy about. although i did kill about 10 plates of <mark>King Crab</mark> legs. \n\nmy boyfriend was crazy about the bone marrow. he's the only guy i know that would pay 40 bucks to go into a buffet to eat cheese and crackers ). \n\ndesert was okay too. the galto and sorbe were my favorites.", 
            "i have read a lot of reviews and realize imost of it is all relative to the person who writes it. when i write a review about food places, i try out most of what they have before i give my opinion. well it is rare i would give one star for most food places because typically i research first but boy was i wrong about this place. i have no idea how this place can be high rated 4 stars! i guess those who gave it the 4 stars or higher must've been smokin or just haven't had better. where do i start, i went left to right and tried most all they had and really i had a hard time to eat and i was starving. i can't remember the last time when i was starving and lost my appetite as soon as i ate. \n\n             don't bother going for the crabs, they don't have <mark>King Crab</mark> while bellagio and  wynn does. wicked spoon, absolutely the worst opeiia crabs i have ever tasted. it was literally the flavor of bad sink water. it was soaked for so long the crab flavor was absent, it tasted so bad i lost my appetite immediately. i mentioned it to both the waitress and manager. the waitress said all the seafood comes frozen, i'm thinking are you serious? like i have never eaten pre frozen seafood at a restaurant before. i'm a sport fisherman for crying out loud, like anyone would think live seafood is delivered to a buffet. the waitress told me to  just ask the cook to boil it and use butter. really? that will make a sink watered down crab taste better!  the manager came to me and i told him the same situation, the manager just said thanks for letting him know and he just turned away while he said thanks. wtf! they do not care about their place obviously. i should've known something was wrong when there was absolutely no lines, in fact there was only a couple in front of us. even after we left, there was no line either. it is pretty obvioius, i would never come back to eat even if it was free. i come to vegas to eat well, not have bad food go in me. \n\n           the prime rib? you call that prime rib? taste like gamey rump roast. the short ribs had ok flavor but was chewy and i had to spit out the grizzle parts.all the food in the little handle pots, they were mostly sitting for so long, they were dry. why not just put each item into a large pan so we can take what we can eat. it would prevent the food from drying up so fast. now that's a tip they should really consider.  i threw away most everything i grabbed as it either tasted bad or was dried up. shrimp, i did not bother, the color alone told a story. they try to make the food look gourmet but really a novice attempt to make it appear appetizing, it failed to do so. sushi? don't bother, that stuff they got rolled up, it is a mystery what it is. chinese food in food to go small boxes, really? what is this place? i went left to right but could not find an item to hit the spot. they serve bone marrow! i felt like a dog when the chef poured all the bones in front of you, come and get it! i tried one, yuk! who wants jellied muck! i know what bone marrow is and this one isn't done right at all. i know these so called chefs aren't taking their cooking seriously. it's like a home town buffet type chef but truly in my opinion, worse. \n\n           the bottom line, the main hard meals are below standard, they should not have food in those small handled pots, not have take out boxes for chinese food, they should not overflow their food so it gets dry or hard. the dessert section was ok. all in all, i would not eat there even if it was for free and i mean that. bacchanal and bellagio are much better for overall. when you decide to eat at a buffet, always seek the best of the menu you like to eat, otherwise you'd be disappointed my rating is truly what i had experienced from a to z. i don't just nick pick over one dish. i tried most of them as much as i can force myself to taste but that's what i mostly did, i did wasted a lot of food because i could not enjoy it. the dessert and drink was most i have downed there. selection was poor as well, a lot of basic foods really and the ones they try to culinate was just murder! you'll be spitting out food or just not finishing it and waste a lot of it.  don't waste your time and money here when there are many others that are way much better. honestly, i haven't had food this bad in years. i'm not even a picky eater either.", 
            "my personal all time buffet favorite\n\nfood - excellent\nalmost everything i had here was delicious.  this is in itself not superior to other high-end buffets, but what sets them apart for me is variety.\nthere are many high end buffets in vegas that put <mark>King Crab</mark> legs and and cocktail prawns as centerpieces of their offering.  wicked spoon on the other hand has many slightly off the wall items.  this include duck wing and rice, bone marrow, squid ink pasta in addition to the 'normal' buffet selections.  suckling pig was also on offer although not during my last visit.  as expected of a high end buffet, desert was excellent.\n\nprice - good\nabout $40 for brunch, which is expected / on par with their competition\n\nservice - good\nwait staff is pretty quick and attentive with refilling drinks / clearing out empty plates.  note that during busy weekends the wait can be rather long.  once i had to wait close to 50 minutes during a holiday weekend\n\noverall, i haven't found another buffet that is as high quality and offers better variety as wicked spoon.", 
            "i came here an hour before they closed and did not feel rushed at all. overall they have some good choices but for the price bacchanal is a far better choice. \n\ni loved the bone marrow, waldorf salad, panna cotta, & watermelon. it was disappointing that they didn't have <mark>King Crab</mark> legs..just snow crab. everything else served was nothing to rave about. \n\nthey have a good variety of desserts and i definitely recommend trying the gelato. they have a large variety with some <mark>Uni</mark> flavors. when i went there was a line to get the gelato. some of the flavors are really good (chai tea, nutella) but others taste off (mint chip). the macarons were stale...the filling was hard\n\nwhile dining there was a table nearby that was called to the managers attention. the server paid extra attention to them, often flirting with the group of guys and basically neglected our table. every single time she came to pick up our plates we had already stacked them for her because she had taken so long that we'd gone multiple rounds around the buffet. \n\nbe aware that there are better buffets on the strip and think about whether or not you want to spend your money here.", 
            "i really liked how they had various gourmet plates in a buffet setting, you know, things that you won't normally order at a fancy restaurant, i.e. watermelon with sriracha and lime drizzle. the selection for salad and meat were substantial and they had a mountain of <mark>King Crab</mark> legs for the customers. prime rib was good, sushi was \"meh\"... my favorites included the sausage, roasted pork belly, and omg the huge dessert bar. \n\noverall, i wasn't impressed by the buffet and they didn't have much of a seafood selection. food quality was definitely better than typical local buffet, but just \"ok\" for vegas.", 
            "so, the story of how we ended up here is that i was specifically craving snow crab. not <mark>King Crab</mark>, not crab, and whatever else crab is out there in the market. it was the only place that had snow crab so we went at 2:30p.m. to get in for the lunch time on a sunday. shockingly, the wait was only 30 minutes or so. it was nothing like the bachanal line that was about 2 hours. \n\nthe food was alright, and the dinner was okay too. the food wasn't as good as bachanal, but the dessert was definitely way better. i'm not sure if i'll be going back here, but i def think it is worth a try.  \n\ni did eat a ton of snow crabs though...", 
            "$20 to-go box!\n\nwe didn't want to spend the money to sit in the restaurant and stuff our faces, so we decided to take advantage of the $20 to-go box (you fill up your box as much as you can). we were happy with our decision. wicked spoon does not have as many selections compared to other buffets and i felt that the quality of the food was mediocre. to list out some of their options: <mark>King Crab</mark> legs, pizza variations, sushi, ethnic foods, dessert, etc., but none of the flavors stood out to me. we were fortunate enough to not have to deal with a line but we did notice during meal time that the line was horrendous. if you want to try this buffet, i'd say to go with the to-go box and take sample portions.", 
            "typical vegas buffett. nothing special and nothing worth remembering.\n\nout of the ordinary offerings were bone marrow and 5-spiced pork belly. but they were all disappointments flavorwise.  their <mark>King Crab</mark> legs are sliced sooooooo thin it makes the wicked spoon look too much like bean counters. \n\n$48 for adults and $18 for kids age 5 to 10. at least the decor is upscale and the seating is spacious.", 
            "i yelped on what to eat for my last night in vegas and came across to wicked spoon at the cosmopolitan.  and my oh my i am so happy! i enjoyed every bit of the food! it was beyond my expectation!!!  \n\nwicked spoon has a large varieties of food from chinese, italian, mexican etc. ... they have wide varieties of cheese, sweet desserts and ice creams!! what excites me the most was how the foods were displayed in those pretty and fancy plates.  they were well-proportioned in pretty individual plates.  i loved the salad selections too. i tried almost all of their fancy salad selections: kale with sesame ginger dressings, nicoise salad, the beet salad.  they have this goat cheese with raspberry sauce and peanut brittle that is to die for! oh and the bone marrow with kimchi-glazed sauce! who has bone marrow for a buffet? anyway i tried almost everything: the <mark>King Crab</mark> leg (which was not dry at all), the prime ribs, the cute shrimp cocktail, shrimp with grits and more ... all the foods were rich and tasty.  they also have a seafood cook-to-order section which i discovered at last minute.  i didn't try them out as i was so full and just couldn't take any more bite.  but it looked really delish and smelled wonderful. for dessert i had white-chocolate-passionfruit-mouse, salted caramel and thai-tea ice creams. the only thing missing ... they didn't have a great selection of fruits tho.\n\nthe decor, the ambience and the service were also great.  my waitress was really polite and friendly. \n\neverything were well-prepared, tasty, delicious and fancy at the same time.  i highly recommend you to try wicked spoon next time you're in vegas!", 
            "i've eaten at the aria buffet, le buffet (stinks), and this was my favorite.  it's all about good quality food here.  not stuffing your face with prime rib and crab legs (although they have that too; aria had <mark>King Crab</mark>).  in fact, i liked it so much i ate here twice.  the sushi is pretty good.  fried chicken and tandoori chicken were great.  made to order seafood bar was also great.  desserts were awesome.  chocolate covered strawberries and all sorts of tasty gelato.", 
            "forgot to throw my two cents on some of the food we ran through in vegas (hey look, we had to get the club stuff on the board first!). i've heard so much about wicked spoon buffet and how it was awesome. and being at my favorite hotel in the city, the cosmo, i was pretty shocked at how i hadn't been here yet. \n\nand now that i have...well...i am not impressed. like whatsoever. the food options available here, i would've expected at an indian casino buffet like morongo or pechanga. but at cosmo? the bar was set a long time ago when the wynn buffet rocked the leg of lamb and alaskan <mark>King Crab</mark> legs guys. and we would've missed out on the crab legs had we completely not been able to move at all for two hours and waited for them to bring it out.\n\ni honestly don't remember a single thing here that made me want to come back at all. the only saving grace was that we knew someone that worked at cosmo and helped us jump the line. but yeah aside from that, completely unmemorable and disappointing. so much for that hype train.", 
            "my review is on the weekday dinner buffet.\n\ni was craving for oyster and <mark>King Crab</mark> legs so i called to make sure that had that for dinner before i really invested. the operator said yes and i was more than happy to give it a try. i have been to bacchanal buffet before for dinner on weekends and it was phenomenal. but bacchanal was $14 more expensive and because wicked spoon confirmed they had what i wanted with a cheaper price then why not.\n\ni arrived around 4:45pm and they opened at 5pm. so there were about 4 parties before me. we were able to start our dinner right at 5pm. however, the seafood station looked pathetic. there was no oyster nor <mark>King Crab</mark> legs. all they had were snow crab legs. and they were one of the worst crag legs i had ever eaten. well i visited from the midwest so i tasted enough bad crab legs to confirm this was one of the worst. the crab was served chilled. they cut it in half so it was more convenient to eat. however, because of that, they lost all the sweetness of the meat and they just tasted bland. my mom is very easy to pleased and she even said it was even worse than casino buffet in st. louis, mo. beside the bad crab legs, i tried the shrimp cocktail, it was not bad but it just can't blow your mind away. shrimp ceviche tasted ok, not bad not great. \n\npretty much done with the seafood station, i thought maybe other food were much better because so many people recommended this place. i tried to convince myself that $90 dinner for two would be worth it. but hell no, carving station was just average. the meat was chewy. there were about 4-5 dishes in asian station and they didn't even look appetizing. all the asian choices you can just dine at any chinese buffet for a much cheaper price. for las vegas casino buffet, i expect more than that. \n\nsalad station and bread and cheese looked ok. i didn't even bother trying. who wants to pay $90 for salad anyway?\n\ntheir dessert station looked amazing but variety of cakes. i tried some of them but my favorite was raspberry lava chocolate cake. ask them to put a scoop of ice cream on top and it is heaven. sadly, this was my highlight of the buffet. we left in 40 minutes in because there were nothing appealing.\n\nour server was really nice. all the empty plates got taken care of immediately.", 
            "after reading many reviews from yelpers and vegas websites raving about how great wicked spoon is, i've come to the realization those idiots i mean reviewers don't know what \"good\" food is. i'm pretty sure if the uneducated food preparer at wicked spoon took a crap on their plate, these cosmopolitan fanatics would still give rave reviews.\n\nwith that said, the dining area is a modern style setting. the floor is well lit and the waiters/waitresses are polite/professional. the drinks offered is pretty much the same across the buffets in las vegas. for those self proclaimed \"buffet connoisseurs\" will argue that there's fresh squeezed juice and etc, no one goes to a buffet for juice and if they do, they are as about retarded as individuals calling themselves \"buffet connoisseurs.\"\n\ndinner per person is over forty bucks per head. the price you pay for is not worth due to the lack of quality and variety given.\n\nwhen viewing photos of this establishment, you will notice most foods come on a small dish. this is very important to know because wicked spoon controls their portions and waste. because of these small dishes, usually the hot dishes dry and shrivel up. if they're controlling portions and waste well they are doing a good job because each plate i had went to waste and i didn't feel bad because it wasn't much.\n\nthere's a salad/bread/cheese section. the salads are pre made onto this small dish. you can't make your own salad. for those ranch lovers, bring your own ranch. this place don't have ranch.\n\non a friday night, there were not <mark>King Crab</mark> legs. their was snow crab legs however it appeared old due to the discoloration. the person who cut the crab legs also did a bad job, due to the difficulty of removing the crab meat. the sushi was pathetic, go to 7 eleven for sushi, not this place. there is a station where a cook makes a seafood saut\\u00e9 for you. that is the only thing worth your money. if you're looking for seafood, you get better seafood, with a cheaper price at red lobster. yes this place is that bad. \n\nthe meat section of the buffet consists of pork shoulder, beef top sirloin, sausages, leg of lamb and turkey. no prime rib. the meats were subpar, and dry. i've found better quality meats elsewhere for 19.99 during lunch. very very disappointing. \n\nthe asian section consists of less than a dozen items which include fried rice, noodles, kung pao and other items which did not look appetizing and dried up. hint hint, if your looking for asian, panda express.\n\nthe italian section consists of pizza and dried and hard pasta and risotto in those small trays. they make olive garden look freaking authentic. better yet, chuck e cheese has better quality food then these dishes left on the warmer top.\n\ndessert is average compared to other buffets on the strip.\n\noverall, save your money and go elsewhere. i had a difficult time eating knowing i spent almost fifty bucks for crap food. if you're looking for expensive crap food, come here. if you don't know what good food is, come here and you may like it. if you're a buffet connoisseur, take your head out of your butt, because your a nobody.", 
            "i finally had a chance to eat at the wicked spoon, and my experience was phenomenal . my husband and i went at about 6:00 on a tuesday and there were only 2 or 3 people ahead of us in line. \n\nthe buffet isn't huge but quality is better than quantity, right?\n\nmy favorite dishes: spicy mac and cheese, fried chicken, bbq shrimp and grits, and kung pao chicken.\n\nbefore visiting the wicked spoon, i read that a majority of the buffets in las vegas served snow crab legs and <mark>King Crab</mark> legs. but unfortunately the crabs were served chilled. well at the wicked spoon you could bring your chilled crab legs to the pistou station and the chef will warm your crabs for you. awesome!!!!!!\n\nof course, the desserts were delicious. \n\nduring my recent visit, i visited the wicked spoon twice and i'll be sure to visit this buffet every time i travel to las vegas.", 
            "really disappointed. i'm a fan of buffets and have always gone to bellagio hands down bellagio is still the best.  there was so much hype about this buffet, i really don't understand why.\n\nthe price is a little high for the quality.  they have snow crab not <mark>King Crab</mark> and the shrimp cocktails comes 2 in a little shot glass which is fine prevents people to waste food. \ni don't mind paying money for quality and good food.  this was just decent nothing special."
