            "went here on the opening weekend, and everything seemed to be <mark>G</mark> off without a hitch! reservations are required; my <mark>G</mark> made ours months in advance due to the <mark>G</mark> opening. while waiting for the table, we took pictures at the photo booth which was cool. when the hostess sat us, she <mark>G</mark> us a mini tour of the prep areas where they make the hand made pasta, <mark>Marinated Olives</mark>, pizza, focaccia, etc. everything is fresh and looks amazing!\n\nwe had a seat near the opened window, overlooking the strip and the bella<mark>G</mark> fountain. our server was very personable and knowled<mark>G</mark>, i'd expect nothing less. he brou<mark>G</mark> us probably the best tasting focaccia i've ever had, and we ordered the sausa<mark>G</mark> stuffed dates as an appetizer; also amazing. perfect combination of salty, sweet and spicy. \n\nfor the entr\\u00e9e, i ordered the branzino and my <mark>G</mark> had the spring pea and panceta tortellini. the branzino was perfectly cooked, and the citrus sauce and aru<mark>G</mark> salad made it very refreshing. the tortellini was fantastic, and i'm not one that likes peas.\n\nfinally, desert came and i wasn't expecting much. we ordered the tiramisu which came in layered shot <mark>G</mark>. my nonna makes <mark>G</mark> tiramisu, so i had hi<mark>G</mark> expectations. there were three flavors: pb&j, chocolate and blackberry lime. all three were delicious, but pb&j was the best! we ordered mochas as well, extremely decadent and <mark>G</mark> with <mark>G</mark>'s si<mark>G</mark> \"g\" in chocolate. a pretty heavy desert but well worth it. \n\noverall, just a <mark>G</mark> experience in terms of food and service. <mark>G</mark> even came to our table and talked with us for a little. <mark>G</mark> say, it was pretty unfor<mark>G</mark>, will definitely be <mark>G</mark> back!", 
            "this was an excellent restaurant to celebrate our anniversary.  the decor was beautiful, the menu was unique and delicious and the service was first rate. we shared three antipasti - <mark>Marinated Olives</mark>, rolled octopus and bacon wrapped dates.  the spa<mark>G</mark> with shrimp and the scallop risotto were our entrees and for dessert we enjoyed peanut butter and jelly tiramisu and chocolate sorbet that was so rich it could have passed for <mark>G</mark>.  i have not tried to describe the dishes only to say that they were just <mark>G</mark> and you will have to taste them yourself.  and don't expect this italian restaurant to be like any other you may have experienced.", 
            "hands down the nicest dining experience i have ever had!  my wife and i went for my 40th birthday dinner. from start to finish was exemplary. upon being seated we were <mark>G</mark> by the mana<mark>G</mark> laurant, and invited to a table which had just come available.  it was a wonderful window table with an amazing view.  we started with two outstanding si<mark>G</mark> cocktails and four appetizers. <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, <mark>Marinated Olives</mark>, a blue cheese plate with pears and honeycomb and a crostini. by the time we were done with the appetizers we had <mark>G</mark> into our bottle of wine which was su<mark>G</mark> to us by darius, the master sommelier. he nailed it.  next was a kale salad and it was fabulous. our last dish was a truffle barley pasta. all dishes were <mark>G</mark> flavorful and deli<mark>G</mark>.  to finish it all off we had a couple of little desserts and coffee.  our server kevin allowed my to enjoy my dishes at my pace. i eat slow and savor my meals. i felt comfortable to enjoy the ambience, my wife, the view, the wine, and the food for all it was worth.  thanks to all at <mark>G</mark>!", 
            "<mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark>. this place is amazing. what a beautiful venue. located in the cromwell on the second floor with views to die this is a <mark>G</mark> place for lunch or dinner. we came for lunch and the natural li<mark>G</mark> from the panoramic windows truly kept the place bri<mark>G</mark>. it was a two hour wait for a table by the window so we sat at the bar. which is perfect because we really are bar people. \n\nnow the only reason im <mark>G</mark> a 4 star review instead of a 5 star is for the service. the bartenders couldnt have been bothered any less then to help us out. we sat at the bar for 10 minutes before we could even be <mark>G</mark>. when we finally were i ordered a ciroc and soda and the <mark>G</mark> didnt even know what ciroc was.. now i would understand if i ordered something completely off the wall but i mean come on... thats pretty standard. andy ordered a coffee and the bartender spatted off a list of different cappuccinos they had its like no dude, just a re<mark>G</mark> coffee lol the other bartender nicole was also kind of a ni<mark>G</mark>. she was <mark>G</mark> away drinks left and ri<mark>G</mark> to the folks sitting next to us so maybe she knew them? \n\nbut when that was over we started ordering a few dishes. we had the pasta fazoli soup which was pretty <mark>G</mark>, not the best but certainly not the worst. we also had the <mark>Marinated Olives</mark>, also not the best. but then we tried the <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> and those were phenom. 5 bite sized meatballs with roasted wiled mushrooms. wow. they seriously melted in your mouth. so <mark>G</mark>! then we had the <mark>Salumi Picante</mark> pizza. this is probably one of the best food items ive ever had in a restaurant. spicy dry sausa<mark>G</mark>, san marzano tomato sauce, mozzarella, and ore<mark>G</mark>. but let me just talk about the crust for a second... that pizza dou<mark>G</mark> could cure cancer. i mean seriously it was amazing. \nfor dessert we had the zeppoli. now im a hu<mark>G</mark> fan of this dessert, its always been my <mark>G</mark>-to while at an italian restaurant but this one was made like ive never had before. it wasnt sweet, like ive normally had. and it had lemon zest sprinkled all over. im <mark>G</mark> to have to try it a<mark>G</mark> to see if i really liked it because oddly enou<mark>G</mark> im kind of unsure. \n\nthis was a <mark>G</mark> place and we will def be back, but we will make a reservation for a table next time and hopefully receive better service.", 
            "this stop is a <mark>G</mark> on the strip. situated on the second floor of the cromwell hotel across las ve<mark>G</mark> blvd from caesar's palace, the view is excellent. depending on the time of day and your seating location you may even take in a view of the bella<mark>G</mark> fountain show. the service was a bit slow and we spent rou<mark>G</mark> 15 minutes there before anyone came to our table, but our server seemed to have a number of tables so we can certainly understand the delay. we were there for lunch and as this was a special occasion, we brou<mark>G</mark> our own bottle of wine. the corking fee was a bit hi<mark>G</mark> (but not for ve<mark>G</mark> prices) at $35, but it was still a steal considering that almost every wine on the list was an ultra premium wine. once we ordered, our food came out exceptionally fast. we hi<mark>G</mark> recommend the <mark>G's Baked Pasta</mark> of the day, the buratta cheese (buffalo mozzarella), <mark>Baby Sweet Peppers</mark> and <mark>Marinated Olives</mark>. our total dining experience lasted over 1 1/2 hrs. we were so fulfilled by the time we left. in the end, when our check came, we found that the corking fee was not on it. this may have been due to the fact that we bou<mark>G</mark> so many dishes during lunch or maybe our overwhelmed server simply for<mark>G</mark>, but we weren't complaining :) \n\ni would hi<mark>G</mark> recommend <mark>G</mark>'s for lunch!  all their food is fresh and homemade, which is somewhat rare these days, even on the strip.", 
            "we had a <mark>G</mark> meal.  we came here over the last weekend in march.   ori<mark>G</mark> we were not able to make a reservation, but we came early (~6:00 pm) on a friday and the staff was able to accommodate us.  the pasta was especially <mark>G</mark> - we had the pappardelle, spa<mark>G</mark>, and ravioli.  we also ordered the lamb - there were 4 of us and we ate it all family style.   we also had the <mark>Marinated Olives</mark>, <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, and bacon dates as appetizers.  all were quite <mark>G</mark>.   we decided to <mark>G</mark> italian-style and order sparkling mineral water with our meal, which i think added to the experience (especially since we don't drink much wine).   \n\nas the sun set, the restaurant opened the windows which overlooked the las ve<mark>G</mark> strip.   it was a <mark>G</mark> view.  our indoor dining was now al fresco. with the warm ve<mark>G</mark> ni<mark>G</mark>, this additional physical feature of the restaurant made the experience much more enjoyable.  re<mark>G</mark> service, a<mark>G</mark>, it was top notch.  our waiter, cliff, was very personable and attentive.  he made us feel like family.   the only minor down side we saw was when a different waiter accidentally broke a <mark>G</mark> by our table and did not immediately clean up the <mark>G</mark> shards, waiting for one of the other staff to clean it up", 
            "<mark>G</mark> at the cromwell hotel on the ve<mark>G</mark> strip is the finest italian restaurant i have eaten at in the united states. i have traveled the world and have to say that this is authentic italian at its best!\nthe location on a prominent corner of the ve<mark>G</mark> strip is ma<mark>G</mark> and overlooks the dancing waters at the bella<mark>G</mark> hotel across the street. lar<mark>G</mark> windows wrap the entire corner and <mark>G</mark> a panoramic view never before seen in ve<mark>G</mark>.\nthe interior is beautiful with indirect li<mark>G</mark> that makes everyone look <mark>G</mark> and sets the mood for a wonderful evening. the chairs are comfortable and encoura<mark>G</mark> a leisurely evening.\nstart with a specialty italian inspired cocktail, not seen on many menus. beautifully presented and delicious! \nfor starters, the antipasti selection is amazing. we totally enjoyed the <mark>Marinated Olives</mark>, <mark>Baby Sweet Peppers</mark>,the soppressata (with <mark>G</mark> and pepper)and the parmi<mark>G</mark>-re<mark>G</mark> with wild sa<mark>G</mark> honey was exquisite!\nfabulous bread is baked and served in a mini dutch oven alon<mark>G</mark> sea salt and basil aoli and capers and chili flakes and silky soft butter. \nwe shared the rack of lamb- mustard crusted and the pappardelle with pork ra<mark>G</mark> (not usually seen) and both were to perfection!\nfor dessert we had the limoncello souffle with house made buttermilk ice cream and lemon hazelnut cake tower with lemon curd on top .both desserts rank among the most delicious desserts i have eaten in a restaurant.\ndo not miss trying the lemon ricotta cookies topped with lemon <mark>G</mark>, an absolute must! \ncarissa and <mark>G</mark>  are doing a remarkable job making this restaurant a not to miss destination while in ve<mark>G</mark>. personable and professional and friendly, these two know how to run an outstanding italian eatery.\ndo not miss the opportunity to experience this ma<mark>G</mark> environment, it does not exist many places these days.\ni look forward to many future visits.\njeff z."

            "dropped by this little joint for lunch yesterday.  the restaurant has been open for about six weeks but has only been serving lunch since last wednesday.  the mana<mark>G</mark> told me that reservations are pretty much required for dinner but lunch is easier to drop by and eat.  i'm <mark>G</mark> it's because people are sleeping off the prior ni<mark>G</mark>'s festivities.  \n\nfirst off, the staff is very friendly and attentive.  the tables by the windows have a <mark>G</mark> view of the strip.  there is a nice loun<mark>G</mark> area between the tables and the bar.  \n\nthe lunch menu is smaller than the dinner menu, serving antipasti, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches.  oh yeah, desert too. :-) \n\nstarted off with a <mark>G</mark> of red win san<mark>G</mark>.  very tasty but a little on the expensive side.  first to arrive was very <mark>G</mark> bread served with an equally tasty pesto.\n\ni had the <mark>Wood Roasted Mushrooms</mark> for my antipasti.  it was oyster mushrooms with toasted marcona almonds and ricotta salata.  very <mark>G</mark> antipasti.  i really like marcona almonds because they are so buttery but i felt the flavor <mark>G</mark> a little lost in this dish.\n\nnext was the carbonara pizza.  basically it was a <mark>G</mark> italian breakfast pizza.  it was topped with two fried e<mark>G</mark> and prosciutto (i think it was <mark>Prosciutto San Daniele</mark>), and black pepper.  the dou<mark>G</mark> was not very thick, the prosciutto was flavorful without being too salty, and the yolk running off the sides added to the flavor.  overall an excellent dish!\n\ni wanted a li<mark>G</mark> desert so i ordered the sorbet and <mark>G</mark>.  my mistake!  it came with a small scoop of each flavor: strawberry sorbet, banana sorbet, chocolate <mark>G</mark> and white chocolate <mark>G</mark>.  the sorbets were li<mark>G</mark> and full of the fruit flavors.  the <mark>G</mark> were also very flavorful and insanely rich!\n\nthe presentations for lunch were pretty strai<mark>G</mark> forward.  i'm <mark>G</mark> dinners plates come out a little more artistically.  i <mark>G</mark> i have to come back for dinner and find out.\n\nso make a reservation, come to ve<mark>G</mark>, and enjoy!", 
            "we made a reservation about 1 month in advance for our dinner at <mark>G</mark>'s. my husband and i were celebrating our 10 year anniversary and my mother joined us for our meal (her treat which was awesome). our seating time was @5:15, and we arrived a few mins early so we stood and looked at the different pictures and such on the walls before being seated. we were <mark>G</mark> a tour of the stations and explained what each person was doing. we were seated in the corner, kind of like a little private space, it was really nice. the windows were shut and blinds pulled because the sun just pounds that space from about 5:00-7:00. once 7:00 hit, they raised the shades so you could look outside. upon being seated, we were <mark>G</mark> by our server who was very very very knowled<mark>G</mark> about everything. he showed us the i-pad with the drinks and such. also, we had a lady who would fill our waters and <mark>G</mark> new plates and such for courses. she was so kind, we warned her we were extremely thirsty as we had played tennis at the cosmo that day and she sure made her promise of never leaving us with an empty water <mark>G</mark>. the <mark>G</mark> mana<mark>G</mark> also came by to introduce us and to wish us a happy anniversary. \n\nwe choose the following 3 drinks to kind of \"share\" and \"try\"........\n\n#1 hannibal: botran reserve rum, maurin quina, fresh lime, blood oran<mark>G</mark> and mint syrup, chianti float. it was served in a <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> with crushed ice. the chianti float was served in a lime turned inside out. \n\n#2 la strada: campari, homemade lemon sorbeto, berta<mark>G</mark> limoncello, proseco. this was the li<mark>G</mark> of the drinks. very refreshing.\n\n#3 the destroyer (conan the destroyer)\nclase azul tequila reposado, fresh tan<mark>G</mark>, oran<mark>G</mark> and basil, basil ice sphere. this was the stron<mark>G</mark> and my husbands favorite. \n\nwe then choose 3 apps to share:\n\n#1 <mark>Wood Roasted Mushrooms</mark> w/ toasted marcona almonds & ricotta salata. very <mark>G</mark>, <mark>G</mark> assortment of different mushrooms.\n\n#2 *rollatini - ricotta stuffed e<mark>G</mark> & pomodoro. very small but very <mark>G</mark>.\n\n#3 calabrese, spicy calabrian chili, the ori<mark>G</mark> pepperoni, pork. when ordered, this was my least favorite but ended up being very very <mark>G</mark>.\n\n#4 (just my husband) pasta e fa<mark>G</mark> w/ creste di <mark>G</mark>, cannellini & parmi<mark>G</mark>-re<mark>G</mark> (soup)\n\nmy husband and mother shared the assortment of breads and breadsticks as i cannot eat them because of wheat aller<mark>G</mark>. they were very kind in asking if it was ok if they brou<mark>G</mark> the bread out as i could not have it. \n\nwe then choose 2 pasta courses to share. i am <mark>G</mark> free, so the knowled<mark>G</mark> the server had about it was wonderful. \n\n#1 *spa<mark>G</mark> (spah-<mark>G</mark>-tee) shrimp, lemon & basil made with their house made <mark>G</mark> free pasta. it was excellent. i always <mark>G</mark> worried ordering <mark>G</mark> free pasta as its usually just an afterthou<mark>G</mark>. the server assured me that <mark>G</mark> would not put something on the menu she was not confident was the best. let me tell you this was the best <mark>G</mark> free pasta i have ever had. i could tell the time and perfection that went into it. that ni<mark>G</mark>, the <mark>G</mark> free pasta was a bucatini. \n\n#2 risotto (ree-zoht-oh) crab & scallops. the scallops were amazing. i could of eaten a meal just on that. risotto perfectly cooked. \n\nwe then choose 2 mains to share. honestly, if i went a<mark>G</mark>, i would just order more apps and pasta courses and skip mains. don't <mark>G</mark> me wrong, the mains were very <mark>G</mark> but i just really loved the apps and pastas.\n\n#1 branzino, w/ tan<mark>G</mark> vinai<mark>G</mark>. very <mark>G</mark> and very fresh. \n\n#2 whole roasted chicken for two, cacciatore style. beautiful presentation before actually cutting it up and serving. chicken had a spicy rub and the sauce made from the ve<mark>G</mark> roasted with the chicken were <mark>G</mark>. \n\n\nall ni<mark>G</mark> we watched this poor desert <mark>G</mark> push his cart around trying to not to take people out. its a cool idea but really seems like it <mark>G</mark> in the way. his cart was parked by us and they switched the cookies out 3 times during our 2 hours. kind of seems like a waste, i hope they <mark>G</mark> those cookies to the food pantry or something. they presented us with a plate that said happy anniversary written in chocolate and we choose a very <mark>G</mark> strawberry sorbet to share. \n\nall in all i would say <mark>G</mark>'s was a wonderful experience and one i will never for<mark>G</mark>. it was a very beautiful place and classy yet i never felt out of place. it still had a very casual feel and i love how they encoura<mark>G</mark> you to share with your <mark>G</mark>. it really makes dining fun and allows you try new thin<mark>G</mark>. we all decided this would have to be added to our yearly trip each year.",

            "being a <mark>G</mark> fan of <mark>G</mark> i was so excited to hear she opened up her own restaurant here in my hometown, sin city. i found out the wait list for her restaurant is about 4 months long and saw my hopes of dining there slip away. come to find out my best friend surprised  me by making reservations months in advance for my birthday and my dreams came true. \n\nwe had 1:45 reservations, we walk up to the hostess at about 1:20 to let her know we were in the vicinity, she made it very clear that she didn't want anything to do with us until our strict 1:45 reservation time. our time came and i went back to the desk to let her know we're ready, she had our table ready very promptly at 1:45.\n\nthe dining area at first <mark>G</mark> is beautiful, pristine white makes everything look sparkling clean. we are seated and in a few moments the waiter is over. he <mark>G</mark> over the menu in depth and <mark>G</mark> us a moment to decide. \n\nwhen he returns he answers all our questions in <mark>G</mark> detail and listened to our\nspecific needs (one of us doesn't eat meat). we ordered the <mark>Wood Roasted Mushrooms</mark> and chicken <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> to start. also ordered two muddled strawberries which is a brilliant concoction of tea,lemonade,strawberries, and basil. all\nof these dishes were an absolute smash. we order our main dishes which were a frittata and <mark>G</mark>'s lasa<mark>G</mark>. both of these dishes were <mark>G</mark> and we had not a sin<mark>G</mark> complaint with them. they also bring you a sort of pita bread with a pesto oil spread which is <mark>G</mark> as well. they have a <mark>G</mark> of whose job it is to make sure your water is always full which was nice. with it being my birthday we of course ordered dessert which was a tiramisu and a cappuccino of sorts with nutella. they even wrote \"happy birthday\" in chocolate on my\nplate. these desserts really smashed this experience throu<mark>G</mark> the roof.\n\nas we wait for the waiter to bring the bill i see <mark>G</mark> herself talking to some patrons in the restaurant. my heart of course stops and our waiter personally asked her to come to my table because it was my birthday. she sat and took a picture with me, wished me a happy birthday, made sure our lunch was everything we expected, and said she liked my hair. i died on the inside. the food was awesome, our waiter was a class act, and the <mark>G</mark> was everything i'd hope she be. \n\nthe reasons i <mark>G</mark> this four stars ........ the epic waiting list which reaches 4 months\nis extreme but totally understandable. the portion sizes of these dishes are minimal at best and very pricey. \n\neveryone should definitely try this restaurant. not a place to <mark>G</mark> full but a dynamite venue for a special event. from the food to the staff to <mark>G</mark> herself an absolute smash.", 
            "we had a table with a view which i would say makes the experience just that much more memorable!  we started with the olives, the <mark>Wood Roasted Mushrooms</mark> and the orozo meatballs. all very tasty, but by far the mushrooms are a must if you enjoy mushrooms. the meatballs were <mark>G</mark>, but a little lacking in flavor which seems to be the consensus with other reviews. nothing a pinch of salt won't fix, better not enou<mark>G</mark> salt then to much!  the sauce from the meats balls in the other hand we all wanted to eat with the bread and everything else!    i orders the hannibal as a cocktail which was way to much ice not enou<mark>G</mark> hannibal, but the taste was <mark>G</mark>. not my favorite , but still tasty and <mark>G</mark> with my meal.  we had the risotto with scallops , the spa<mark>G</mark> si<mark>G</mark> dish, salmon (which believe it or not in my opinion was the best dish of the ni<mark>G</mark>)  and the 7oz filet!  for sides aspara<mark>G</mark> which was delicious , potatoes were super tasty and my all time favorite the corn!  i ended up adding the corn the the spa<mark>G</mark> which made the spa<mark>G</mark> a super delicious dish because of of all the flavor in the corn that it added to the pasta.  deserts we  all amazing and the lemoncello did not disappoint.  for sure a <mark>G</mark> place for a date or a special event as it was easy to carry conversation and the views of the stop are <mark>G</mark> .", 
            "i'm a little torn about this one folks.  i've always enjoyed watching <mark>G</mark> de laurentiis' shows on food network so i couldn't be anymore happier when the chef decided to have her first ever restaurant in las ve<mark>G</mark>.  too bad celebrity chef restaurants usually don't live up to the hype due to such hi<mark>G</mark> expectations and sadly, this one's no exception.\n\nthe restaurant itself has a nice ambiance. despite of the tables being so close to each other, details throu<mark>G</mark> made it feel as if we were dining at home so it wasn't too awkward/uncomfortable being seated less than a foot away from other <mark>G</mark>.  if i were to do it a<mark>G</mark>, i'd certainly do what phillip t. recommends on his review and request for a premium table overlooking bella<mark>G</mark> or caesar's palace no matter how long it takes.\n\nfood in <mark>G</mark> was <mark>G</mark>.  looking back, however, portions were relatively small considering of how much they're char<mark>G</mark> for each dish.  this surely isn't your rustic italian joint where you can <mark>G</mark> lar<mark>G</mark> bowls of pasta that can feed a whole town!    \n\nupon ordering, our server brou<mark>G</mark> out a complimentary platter of breadsticks, rosemary focaccia and cheese crisps as well as several accoutrements.  several antipasti plates then followed which quickly filled our table.  few favorites include charred octopus, <mark>Wood Roasted Mushrooms</mark> and prosciutto di parma.  the parmi<mark>G</mark>-re<mark>G</mark> was also <mark>G</mark> especially when eaten with the wild-sa<mark>G</mark> honey and rosemary focaccia.  i say skip the burrata since texture was quite unpleasant instead of that smooth consistency everyone has been accustomed to.\n\ni opted for the risotto as my main entree since i'm a sucker for creamy pearls of rice prepared w/ tasty seafood broth.  unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, what was served was rather disappointing: rice was underdone and seasoning was lacking.  althou<mark>G</mark> the scallops were perfectly cooked, i actually would've never thou<mark>G</mark> the dish came with crabs if it weren't for the menu listing the item as one of its in<mark>G</mark>.\n\nwhile my food was completely amiss, her spa<mark>G</mark>, on the other hand, was easily one of the few hi<mark>G</mark> of the ni<mark>G</mark>.  in fact, i'd pick this over your re<mark>G</mark> meatball and marinara pasta any day.  one thing that cau<mark>G</mark> my attention as soon as the dish was placed on the table was how enormous the prawns were.  the lemon and basil sauce also went really well with the pasta.  if i could eat this everyday, i absolutely would in a heartbeat!\n\nservice was <mark>G</mark> and staff knowled<mark>G</mark> of everything on the menu.  for<mark>G</mark> his name but i'm assuming our server was fairly new since he was <mark>G</mark> plenty of complaints from other <mark>G</mark>.  he even char<mark>G</mark> our card with someone else's tab; making us wait for some time and not even a dessert was <mark>G</mark> to compensate for his mistake.\n\noverall, <mark>G</mark> has become one of the hottest restaurant in the valley as people continue to flock to this joint even after several months of being open.  having said that, nothing jumps out of our dining experience that makes me want to come back at this establishment anytime soon.", 
            "i've said it before, but i am a food network junkie! i had been looking forward to eating at <mark>G</mark> since it opened last year. our experience did not disappoint. it was one of the best meals we had this ve<mark>G</mark> trip.\n\nwe started with the parmi<mark>G</mark>-re<mark>G</mark> with wild sa<mark>G</mark> honey. a simple but ele<mark>G</mark> cheese course. the sweet but earthy honey paired perfectly with the salty, nutty cheese. while we nibbled on the cheese, we also enjoyed our cocktails. i had the fortunella 1958. it had don julio blanco, fresh lime, watermelon, a<mark>G</mark> and celery bitters. it was refreshing and li<mark>G</mark> and went down very easily. diane had the barbarella 1968. this was made with tanqueray no. 10, oran<mark>G</mark> spice <mark>G</mark> beer, fresh lemon and basil foam.i stole a sip and almost wanted to switch.\n\ndiane's entree was the lasa<mark>G</mark>. <mark>G</mark>'s version of the italian classic followed a theme we appreciated. it was an impeccably li<mark>G</mark> version of a usually heavy dish.  i ordered the <mark>G</mark>, kale and mushroom pizza. a li<mark>G</mark> and crisp crust with perfectly <mark>Wood Roasted Mushrooms</mark>, sauteed kale and a sprinkle of pun<mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark>. it was meant to be shared, but it was so <mark>G</mark> i ate it all except for one small piece i let diane try.\n\nwe finished our meal with two excellent coffee drinks. i had the cappu<mark>G</mark>, made from lavazza <mark>G</mark> riserva, whipped with ice and layered over warm milk and chocolate sauce. the result was a beautiful, tasty version of an iced mocha. diane had the merin<mark>G</mark> al limone, lavazza <mark>G</mark> riserva, whipped cream, lemon merin<mark>G</mark> and a li<mark>G</mark> lemon sauce. this was very unique. it was served in a shot <mark>G</mark>, with a spoon. diane actually \"ate\" her coffee! \n\nthe restaurant is beautiful and very wheelchair accessible. our service could not have been better. i cannot wait to come back and try <mark>G</mark> for dinner!",

(and eloquently.)\n\nwe did not order dessert, but the dessert tray is hu<mark>G</mark> -- literally. there were about 20 to choose from on a behemoth cart.\n\nservice\nthis was my bi<mark>G</mark> issue at <mark>G</mark>. everyone was well-intentioned and friendly but overly trained and zealous -- so much so that my party felt it oppressive. throu<mark>G</mark> the dining room, servers stood at attention as if in the military, waiting to \"help\" but actually hovering. they wanted to en<mark>G</mark> after every dish for feedback, and it was just a bit much. the restaurant is new, so perhaps mana<mark>G</mark> will tame this with time.\n\natmosphere\nwhere to be<mark>G</mark>? the restaurant is beautiful, and a<mark>G</mark>, complicated. i counted about ei<mark>G</mark> different seating styles/chairs/loun<mark>G</mark>/table types/environments on various levels. the art is colorful and plentiful, and the li<mark>G</mark> is fun and fascinating. one would think throwing all of this to<mark>G</mark> would be bombastic. in a way it is, but it also works. the windows open for a wonderful, open air feel -- complete with noisy traffic and strip noise (which i found charming) and incredible view of the bella<mark>G</mark> water show. if you're a small party, request a seat near the open air windows.\n\nthere's also a photo booth near check-in. this is a playful, very nice touch. your seating hostess will also offer you a tour before you're seated if interested. she was hard to hear among the noise, but it's another unique touch.\n\nnutshell\ndespite the hi<mark>G</mark> price tag, i would have rated <mark>G</mark> 5 stars had it not been for the borderline-intrusive service. <mark>G</mark>...but bring your wallet. bring your appetite. and bring your patience. you'll need all to fully enjoy the delicious schizophrenia.",

            "i had heard that <mark>G</mark> de laurentiis, the famous cooking tv personality, had opened a restaurant at the cromwell and was mildly interested.  then, when an article appeared in the parade ma<mark>G</mark> and both my mother and my sister became overly curious, i made a reservation.  and finally, weeks later, it was my turn to experience the divine.  we went in thinking we would <mark>G</mark> a few thin<mark>G</mark> and share.  soon we were ordering the tasting menu and wine pairing complete with an auto<mark>G</mark> photo, souvenir menu and recipe cards.  i <mark>G</mark> you could say we were \"all in,\" in poker parlance.  we be<mark>G</mark> with the antipasti:  bacon wrapped dates (with spicy italian sausa<mark>G</mark>  <mark>G</mark> crema), vitello tonanato (veal loin, seared tuna, caper aioli), and <mark>Baby Sweet Peppers</mark> (with <mark>G</mark> cheese and olive tapenade).  second:  pasta (ri<mark>G</mark> with ve<mark>G</mark> bolo<mark>G</mark>).  third:  salmon (pan roasted with summer succotash & whole <mark>G</mark> mustard).  dessert:  banana ice cream, chocolate ice cream, chocolate chip cookies, etc.--the nice man brou<mark>G</mark> the cart and i wanted some of everything!  and he was a willing co-conspirator.  \nthe dining room is absolutely lovely -- fantastic in every way, maybe the best dining room in las ve<mark>G</mark>, and that is saying something.  added to that, it sits kitty corner to the bella<mark>G</mark> and the dancing waters, which are ma<mark>G</mark> to watch.  the table was a tad small.  a <mark>G</mark> thing for conversation but a bad thing for all the food and wine we ordered; we avera<mark>G</mark> three <mark>G</mark> of wine each on the table at any one time. service was at a comfortable, relaxed pace. the whole time we felt like <mark>G</mark> who were welcome to stay all ni<mark>G</mark>. the service was spectacular and the mana<mark>G</mark> went out of his way to <mark>G</mark> every sin<mark>G</mark> customer.  the first salmon they brou<mark>G</mark> me was stinky and overcooked.  they whisked it away and brou<mark>G</mark> me another that was positively wonderful.  the wine-lady, theresa did a <mark>G</mark> job, up until the point where she paired a $5 nero d'avala with the salmon -- a total no-no.   otherwise, her pairin<mark>G</mark> were classic, just what you'd find if you consulted one of those phone apps.  the coffee was strong, but of <mark>G</mark> quality.  seems that all these restaurants serve something called an americano--espresso with some hot water added -- the stuff will stop your heart, after it races away.  \nall-in-all the experience was outstanding -- andrew and nick did a <mark>G</mark> job of keeping it all well-paced and us well-fed and well-attended to. \nat the end of the meal they <mark>G</mark> you a mini-ipad with your bill to fill out a survey, i think that is a bad idea because the time that it takes to do the survey could be used to turn the table over and <mark>G</mark> the waiting <mark>G</mark> inside.  this is the kind of place that you want to <mark>G</mark> to at 5pm, if your reservation is for anytime after 7 you will wait!\ni have seen a lot of very critical reviewing of this place out there in cyberspace and in print.  i <mark>G</mark> some of it, but i think a lot of it is just unfair.  if you want spa<mark>G</mark> and meatballs, this is not the place to <mark>G</mark>.  but if you want a meal of well thou<mark>G</mark> out quality food, cooked perfectly and for you, then this is a very worthy place.  <mark>G</mark> for you <mark>G</mark> i wish you well!  at $550 for two, out the door, i don't think i'll be back soon, unless i can find a sponsor!", 
            "my parents moved to the united states from rome in 1985, so i was very much looking forward to eating at <mark>G</mark>'s new restaurant in las ve<mark>G</mark>. \n\ni enjoyed everything i ate; however, there were several textural issues, and salt issues with my plates. \n\ni be<mark>G</mark> my lunch with the burrata appetizer. burrata (from burro, the italian word for butter) is an extremely creamy cheese that can be pulled apart with a fork, and is often spread on bread. the burrata was excellent, drizzled with olive oil, and served with a line of salt on the plate. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, <mark>G</mark>'s house bread is akin to pita bread, it consists of their pizza dou<mark>G</mark> undercooked, and is served with a small ramekin of pesto, which was almost inedibly salty. burrata really needs to be spread on hearty, crunchy bread otherwise every bite is devoid of any texture but mushiness. \n\nmy second appetizer consisted of <mark>Baby Sweet Peppers</mark> stuffed with <mark>G</mark> cheese. they were delicious; sweet, and creamy. \n\nfor my entree i had the infamous $35 <mark>Lobster Roll</mark>. a<mark>G</mark>, this plate suffered from salt, and textural issues. the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> consisted of one thick piece of italian bread with a heaping pile of the lobster-centric filling on top. i tasted no salt in the filling; however, that's an easy fix as you can always add salt. after the addition of some salt it was delicious. the filling was mostly lar<mark>G</mark> lumps of succulent lobster with capers, and celery bits; it was absolutely delicious. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, the dish was not a roll, it had to be eaten with utensils, and would not even qualify as an open faced sandwich as there was si<mark>G</mark> more filling than bread. the real problem thou<mark>G</mark> was that the italian bread bottom was so<mark>G</mark> because in a matter of seconds it had absorbed the moisture from the lobster filling. once a<mark>G</mark> during my meal i was taking spon<mark>G</mark> bites; this time of so<mark>G</mark> bread, and lobster filling. \n\nin conclusion, the issues i had were minor. however, with no alcohol my lunch cost around $80 with tip. for this amount of money i do not think that crisp bread is too much to ask for. i would definitely return a<mark>G</mark> for lunch thou<mark>G</mark>.",

($6 each and worth it).\n\nas we perused the menu, i was trying to <mark>G</mark> husband to <mark>G</mark> me an idea of what he wanted, but honestly i was very okay with him letting me decide, as having read reviews and the menu online (happy to report also that they have the updated menu with updated prices on the website now, by the way), i pretty much knew what i wanted to try!\n\nwe started with the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> and the lobster arancini, along with their fabulous bread service.  loved the spices to kick up anything we wanted to! now i can make some <mark>G</mark> balls, but i <mark>G</mark> say, these were excellent...both the meat ones and the rice ones! \n\n next we shared the romaine salad, which they brou<mark>G</mark> to us split.  it was li<mark>G</mark> and refreshing. then we did the spa<mark>G</mark> with shrimp, lemon, basil and capers.  pasta & shrimp perfection...yum!  and so was the crab risotto with the best scallop i have ever tasted in my life.  period.  don't know why, as it appeared to be simply seared, but it was so rich and li<mark>G</mark> at the same time.  \n\n  full, we still couldn't resist a sample off the dessert cart (after all, they were so small).  husband wanted to try a nipple truffle...they <mark>G</mark> him three.  i wanted to try the blueberry eclair...oh it comes with a cream puff too.  plus, somehow two lemon ricotta cookies and a chocolate chip one landed on our table as well (thanks!).  i don't know if it was an oversi<mark>G</mark>, or we had already spent enou<mark>G</mark> or what, but we were not char<mark>G</mark> for any of the desserts. a<mark>G</mark>, made to feel like welcome <mark>G</mark>.\n\n  meanwhile, we <mark>G</mark> to watch the bella<mark>G</mark> fountains, both in the dayli<mark>G</mark> and after the sun went down, very cool!\n\ni mi<mark>G</mark> also add that while this experience was more than we normally pay for a meal for two...for a total experience for two, it was just under $200 and well worth it!\n\n the view outside plus the full experience inside, it was a truly ma<mark>G</mark> evening that i will never for<mark>G</mark>!  (which is why i chose this to be my 600th review).  thank you <mark>G</mark> for taking your years of culinary and world experience and creating this place! and extra thanks to your hard-working so-polished staff....true culinary <mark>G</mark>, in the kitchen and in the front!\n\nthat being said, where was the infamous photo booth everyone talks about?   we never saw it!", 
            "being a <mark>G</mark> fan of <mark>G</mark> i was so excited to hear she opened up her own restaurant here in my hometown, sin city. i found out the wait list for her restaurant is about 4 months long and saw my hopes of dining there slip away. come to find out my best friend surprised  me by making reservations months in advance for my birthday and my dreams came true. \n\nwe had 1:45 reservations, we walk up to the hostess at about 1:20 to let her know we were in the vicinity, she made it very clear that she didn't want anything to do with us until our strict 1:45 reservation time. our time came and i went back to the desk to let her know we're ready, she had our table ready very promptly at 1:45.\n\nthe dining area at first <mark>G</mark> is beautiful, pristine white makes everything look sparkling clean. we are seated and in a few moments the waiter is over. he <mark>G</mark> over the menu in depth and <mark>G</mark> us a moment to decide. \n\nwhen he returns he answers all our questions in <mark>G</mark> detail and listened to our\nspecific needs (one of us doesn't eat meat). we ordered the <mark>Wood Roasted Mushrooms</mark> and chicken <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> to start. also ordered two muddled strawberries which is a brilliant concoction of tea,lemonade,strawberries, and basil. all\nof these dishes were an absolute smash. we order our main dishes which were a frittata and <mark>G</mark>'s lasa<mark>G</mark>. both of these dishes were <mark>G</mark> and we had not a sin<mark>G</mark> complaint with them. they also bring you a sort of pita bread with a pesto oil spread which is <mark>G</mark> as well. they have a <mark>G</mark> of whose job it is to make sure your water is always full which was nice. with it being my birthday we of course ordered dessert which was a tiramisu and a cappuccino of sorts with nutella. they even wrote \"happy birthday\" in chocolate on my\nplate. these desserts really smashed this experience throu<mark>G</mark> the roof.\n\nas we wait for the waiter to bring the bill i see <mark>G</mark> herself talking to some patrons in the restaurant. my heart of course stops and our waiter personally asked her to come to my table because it was my birthday. she sat and took a picture with me, wished me a happy birthday, made sure our lunch was everything we expected, and said she liked my hair. i died on the inside. the food was awesome, our waiter was a class act, and the <mark>G</mark> was everything i'd hope she be. \n\nthe reasons i <mark>G</mark> this four stars ........ the epic waiting list which reaches 4 months\nis extreme but totally understandable. the portion sizes of these dishes are minimal at best and very pricey. \n\neveryone should definitely try this restaurant. not a place to <mark>G</mark> full but a dynamite venue for a special event. from the food to the staff to <mark>G</mark> herself an absolute smash.", 
            "unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, disappointed. we had dinner here last sunday evening. we had a 10:30 reservation. we arrived early and were told we could sit at the bar if we'd like and our table would be ready. we went to the bar and ordered a couple of drinks as well as 2 appetizers. drinks arrived and about 10 minutes later the hostess notifies us our table is ready. we told her we had ordered appetizers and asked if we should close our tab at the bar. the bartender comes over and says she has yet to put the appetizer order into the system. ok, no big deal.  \n\nhave to mention that \"<mark>G</mark>\" is everywhere. not actually <mark>G</mark> herself but her name is on everything. i understand the importance of branding but it was a little much. i also thou<mark>G</mark> it was a little tacky to play her cooking show at the tv above the bar. <mark>G</mark> the brand will <mark>G</mark> you into the restaurant, like us. i wanted to <mark>G</mark> there because of her but it won't <mark>G</mark> you to come back a<mark>G</mark>. the food and service will do that but that didn't happen in our case. \n\n<mark>G</mark> seated at our table. the view was by far the best experience of the evening. we were almost above the corner of the street at a window table with an amazing view of the bella<mark>G</mark> fountains. loved our table, perfect. we ordered our appetizers a<mark>G</mark> and added one. the burrata, <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> and <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>. burrata was <mark>G</mark>, can't really <mark>G</mark> wrong but the meatballs were nothing special.  we saw other tables had bread, we had to ask. also had to ask for water and there was no mention of the tasting menu by our server. \n\ni ordered the lemon pasta with shrimp. pasta was <mark>G</mark>, shrimp was dry and over cooked. my husband had the lamb. he orders lamb often when we <mark>G</mark> out and he was disappointed. we choose several desserts off the cart. favorite was the chocolate cake. \n\nthey closed the windows to the restaurant where we were sitting while we were still eating which really chan<mark>G</mark> to mood. we had to wave down a server to <mark>G</mark> our check and then another to pay it. walked out and saw the photo booth but went inside only to see an out of order si<mark>G</mark>. \n\noverall, the service was lacking quality and the food lacked flavor.  we didn't leave feeling like we had a special meal or <mark>G</mark> experience. it was just ok.", 
            "i love <mark>G</mark> (the chef) and was afraid her first restaurant would end up being a disappointment. i'm <mark>G</mark> to now officially say that she exceeded my expectations! i really wasn't expecting much from the food. i checked out the menu in advance and none of the dishes impressed me. that is, until i tasted the food. \n\nlet me first say that i was extremely surprised that my <mark>G</mark> and i were even allowed in the restaurant. we had a reservation for 5 on a busy friday evening. due to heavy traffic, we had no time to stop at our hotel to chan<mark>G</mark> for dinner and showed up looking like a hot mess: t-shirts, flip flops, basketball shorts, sweaty, etc. i, personally, hadn't even brushed my hair all day. so kudos to the hostesses for not lau<mark>G</mark> us out of the restaurant when we showed up. i wish i could say that i was also blown away by the wait staff but that is sadly not the case. it took at least 10 minutes for anyone to even acknowled<mark>G</mark> us after we were seated and even lon<mark>G</mark> for us to <mark>G</mark> some water. if anything at the restaurant needs improvement, it's definitely the table service.\n\nnow, on to the food. we were a hun<mark>G</mark> bunch and wanted to try everything: <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, calamari, tomato & strawberry jam crostini, mar<mark>G</mark> pizzette, tricolore salad, spa<mark>G</mark>, ravioli, and an assortment of desserts from the cart. the best items of the evening were the meatballs, pizzette, spa<mark>G</mark> and ravioli. the in<mark>G</mark> were simple but delicious. my only complaint (and you'll see this in many other reviews) is the price. subtract one dollar si<mark>G</mark> and i would definitely be eating here every time i'm in ve<mark>G</mark>.", 
            "i waited 2 months and finally my ni<mark>G</mark> to try <mark>G</mark> came! the restaurant is beautiful and decorated very classy!\n\npros\nthe <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>\ncomplimentary bread\nseafood risotto \nservice\n\ncons\nsan<mark>G</mark> (tasted like cherry soda)\nchocolate cake dessert (not worth it)\n\nit was $260 for 2 of us having dinner and we left stuffed!", 
            "the atmosphere is <mark>G</mark>, <mark>G</mark> was delicious and the portions were minuscule. \n\nthe <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> are really <mark>G</mark>. the scallop risotto is really <mark>G</mark>. \n\nthe chocolate almond tart dessert was <mark>G</mark>. \n\ni had the blue velvet martini which was fantastic! i could have had 10 more. \n\ni do not recommend <mark>G</mark> the rack of lamb (sooooo small) or the dates appetizer (too much date, not enou<mark>G</mark> bacon) \n\noverall it was <mark>G</mark> but extremely over priced (for two people the bill was $250)", 
            "whoa! fantastic meal at <mark>G</mark>! we were seated with a perfect view to the bella<mark>G</mark> fountains. don't re<mark>G</mark> not ordering the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> and the bacon wrapped dates. the ve<mark>G</mark> bolo<mark>G</mark> ri<mark>G</mark>, was a stand out. whatever you do, do not let the dessert cart pass you by, even if you are stuffed. <mark>G</mark> some of those lemon ricotta cookies and enjoy the sweet, tart bliss. we saw <mark>G</mark> walking throu<mark>G</mark> the restaurant as we were leaving. she is mi<mark>G</mark> teeny and very adorable.", 
            "if this review was about the food at <mark>G</mark> it would be a 5 star review, in fact i'd be petitioning yelp to add a 6th star because the food is that <mark>G</mark>. however due to the absolutely abysmal service i received today at lunch <mark>G</mark> is <mark>G</mark> 2 stars. i hope my experience was an outlier & from what i've heard/seen that may be the truth but the service ruined what would have been an amazing meal for me & has probably made it so i won't return any time soon.\nas i said the food was amazing. everything came quickly from the kitchen (other than the bread which was a little backed up), but everything was plated beautifully & tasted amazing. we started with the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> & prosciutto dan danielle to start. the meatballs had a <mark>G</mark> flavor profile & were cooked to perfection. the prosciutto was a perfect balance of meat & ham & paired nicely with the warm bread & pesto. our entrees were the <mark>Venetian Panino</mark> & lasa<mark>G</mark>, both were delicious & while the portions are a touch small i was happy with them. for dessert we had zappole which were served with a chocolate sauce g & were a perfect end to the meal.\n& thus ends the <mark>G</mark> part of the review. let's discuss the service:\ni had a reservation that was made on open table, which was a <mark>G</mark> idea because even at 12:45 on a wednesday there was a line to <mark>G</mark> seated. we checked in & were seated within minutes by a very friendly hostess, who informed us we were seated in christopher h's section & that he would be by with menus in a moment.\n10 minutes later, we still haven't seen or heard from christopher, the busboy notices that we've been seated for a while & brin<mark>G</mark> us over some water, apolo<mark>G</mark> for the delay & <mark>G</mark> & fla<mark>G</mark> down our server.  about 3-5 minutes later he came over & dropped off the menus. he introduced himself & then went on for about 5 minutes explaining the menu in full detail. this would have been <mark>G</mark> however he was talking in a very hushed mumble & we could barely hear every 5th word he said over the noise in the room. he then said <mark>G</mark> us a minute to make our decision & he'd come back.\nanother 5 minutes after we had closed our menus & set them on the ed<mark>G</mark> of the table he finally came over & took our order.  he hurried off & entered our order, the apps came out before the bread which is fine, the runner explained that the bread oven was a \"little backed up because everything is made fresh\" but it came about 2 minutes after our apps <mark>G</mark> delivered. no big deal, it was delicious when it arrived. \nthe busby then came by & cleared our app plates & brou<mark>G</mark> over some silverware for our main course. our waiter came by moments before our entrees arrived & asked if we would like some more bread, to which i replied, \"yes the bread is <mark>G</mark> we'll take another\". \nthe entrees made their way to our table & they were <mark>G</mark>, the busboy came by & topped off our bevera<mark>G</mark>, but our server is nowhere to be found. no \"hey how's everything tasting\" or \"hey would you like some fresh cracked pepper\" nothing. he is bending over backwards to cater to the 5 top a few tables away from us & the couple seated ri<mark>G</mark> next to us, but he never  comes over to our table. we finish our entrees & the busboy scoops up our plates.\nmy aunt wants to check out the dessert menu, however our waiter is nowhere to be found so she <mark>G</mark> up, walks over 2 sections & asks a different waiter for a dessert menu. we then place a dessert order with the busboy because we haven't seen our waiter in a <mark>G</mark> 20 minutes, even thou<mark>G</mark> he's been to the table directly next to us no less than 4 times.  dessert is delivered & our waiter brin<mark>G</mark> out plates & a fork for the dessert course after the food has arrived. i immediately ask for the check as the 90 minutes we've been there was lon<mark>G</mark> than i planned & i need to duck out quickly for work.  he brin<mark>G</mark> the check by & moseys off.\ni have worked in the industry, i've waited tables in the past & am a majority of the time a <mark>G</mark> tipper however the service i received at a white table cloth celebrity chef spot was not worthy of my usual 20-25%. the bill was about $70, i paid $75, & our waiter took the check & went back to the wait station. \ni watched as his eyes <mark>G</mark> about as big as dish plates & he looks ri<mark>G</mark> at me & comes back with the bill to our table. he asks, \"did i take this too early\". to which i reply, \"no we're fine.\" he then says, \"you do know that here at <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> isn't included in the bill?\" to which i say, \"i know, there was nothing about your service that deserved more, maybe if you had actually acknowled<mark>G</mark> our existence you would have <mark>G</mark> a better tip.\"  he just shru<mark>G</mark> his shoulders & walked off.\non the way out the busboy once a<mark>G</mark> apolo<mark>G</mark> for the wait, but once a<mark>G</mark> the server didn't say a word other than to complain about his tip. \ni really enjoyed the food & it's a beautiful room, but that service was so bad that i probably won't be returning anytime soon.",

            "i came here for lunch on my birthday with my mom and brother. i made reservations via open table, so of course, it was simple. \n\nwe had a moment before our table was ready, so i was excited to check out the photo booth. it's a very cool set up of having a built-in complimentary photo booth, except it is a very ti<mark>G</mark> space and it's difficult to reach the screen and be situated when the session starts. it was also unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> for us that their printer was out of service that morning! sad face! they do allow you to send the photos via e-mail, but the pixel quality is atrocious.\n\nthe restaurant is beautiful and the view of the strip (and bella<mark>G</mark> fountains) is <mark>G</mark>. i love the open kitchen and the antipasti bar. we were <mark>G</mark> a table next to the floor-to-ceiling windows, which was very nice. the chairs were comfortable, too. \n\nwe started with <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> with parmesan pomodoro ($15) and burrata with balsamic salt ($12). the meatballs were tender and flavorful; very satisfying. the burrata was also delicious; really creamy and <mark>G</mark> with that balsamic salt, evoo, and micro aru<mark>G</mark>. both fantastic antipasti dishes. they also offer complimentary bread that appears to be baked in a similar fashion to pizza (it may be their pizza dou<mark>G</mark>). it's served with a yummy pesto oil.\n\n<mark>Lobster Roll</mark> ($35): lemon basil a\\u00efoli and fried capers. all sandwiches are served with aru<mark>G</mark> salad or zucchini scapecce. i chose the zucchini scapecce, but was served the salad, so our server <mark>G</mark> brou<mark>G</mark> a small plate of scapecce to the table. it was a <mark>G</mark> error because i truly enjoyed the salad and the scapecce! they were delicious alone and with my sandwich. the sandwich is open-faced and stacked with scrumptious lobster meat. the mixture was so tasty!\n\n<mark>Venetian Panino</mark> ($18): turkey, <mark>G</mark>\\u00e8re, fontina, whole mustard, and peppadew. this panini sandwich was also well-made and delicious. it not entirely exciting, so i probably wouldn't order it over all the other menu selections. my mom really enjoyed it thou<mark>G</mark>!\n\n<mark>G's Baked Pasta</mark> of the day ($24): the lasa<mark>G</mark> had layers of e<mark>G</mark> as well as your usual suspects. this was really, really <mark>G</mark> lasa<mark>G</mark>. i love the addition of e<mark>G</mark> layers to make it a bit more healthy. \n\nchocolate tiramisu ($8): chocolate zabiaone and espresso-soaked ladyfin<mark>G</mark>. tiramisu is one of my absolute favorite desserts and this is seriously one of the best tiramisu i've ever had the pleasure of eating. they also wrote a very nice \"happy birthday\" messa<mark>G</mark> on the plate.\n\nespresso nocciolato ($9): lavazza <mark>G</mark> riserva, nutella, whipped cream, toasted hazelnuts, and a li<mark>G</mark> dusting of cocoa powder. this was really tasty and a fun way to drink a shot of espresso!\n\nthe food was all delicious! the service was wonderful and we had a very pleasant experience. it was a fantastic birthday celebration. my only complaint: why is everything so petite??! you pay quite a premium on the dishes that i didn't expect from <mark>G</mark>. also, beware that you are char<mark>G</mark> for \"still\" water! i thou<mark>G</mark> they meant tap water when i was asked (they only offered still or sparkling), so i was surprised to see the char<mark>G</mark> on the bill. oddly, they only served us the one bottle, then switched to tap water without asking us if we wanted another bottle of still water.",

            "too bad it was not a <mark>G</mark> experience. i am a hu<mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> fan so this new place was on the top of the list for ve<mark>G</mark>.  probably the worst service ever.  the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> were fantastic but the other si<mark>G</mark> dishes were mediocre. no team work with service. no salt and pepper on table (arro<mark>G</mark> chef)  had to keep looking for service.  just really a major disappointment. oh. it's expensive for mediocre food and terrible service",

score!) to our table in the window overlooking the strip. the dining room is kind of tiered, with the bar at the top and the dining rooms unfolding outward, blending in chairs and horseshoe-style booths. now is a <mark>G</mark> time to mention that the view here cannot be beat if you're in the window seats: major brownie points can only be won with your date when the bella<mark>G</mark>'s water show kicks into action across the street and you're on your third bottle of wine.\n\nour server, along with all the food runners and bussing staff, were attentive without being overwhelming. following our technolo<mark>G</mark> snafu with the \"interactive drink menu\" (read: an ipad), our server <mark>G</mark> us started with <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, a mar<mark>G</mark> flatbread, a beet-and-apple salad and a couple rounds of this awesome bread combo. i never <mark>G</mark> to try the flatbread (the four pieces in it were scarfed down quickly) but those meatballs made me question how i've <mark>G</mark> this long in life without eating them. kind of like how i mana<mark>G</mark> to live all these years without tasting lobster ravioli like the kind from here - that ravioli was heavenly, and everyone else expressed similar sentiments for their tortellini and pappardelle dishes.\n\nbefore dessert could arrive and threaten to end my life ri<mark>G</mark> there via caloric overload, i escaped to the bathroom. this has nothing to do with anything, but aside from being spotless, these were also the best smelling bathrooms i've ever been in. i'm tempted to start doing my laundry in one of the stalls if i could fi<mark>G</mark> out how to <mark>G</mark> there on a re<mark>G</mark> basis from dallas.\n\nwith eyes bi<mark>G</mark> than our stomachs, we opted for a selection of \"<mark>G</mark>'s favorite cookies.\" i can safely say this woman knows fine taste: chocolate chip was what you'd expect, the peanut butter (and jelly!) were a pleasant surprise, but the lemon ricotta cookies... i'm not a \"dessert person\" but i think i actually wept while eating those. tears of happiness and savoriness, mind you.\n\nif there are any nitpicks to make, they are minor. mana<mark>G</mark> was scattered about and did not seem to put too much worth on the customer experience: i think i saw a mana<mark>G</mark> talk to two, maybe three tables. that's unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> for a spot like this, as i would like to see the \"hi<mark>G</mark> ups\" at the least asking how everything is, and possibly even displaying a personality and/or a pulse. i also don't know what to think about the special dinner that comes with an auto<mark>G</mark> picture of <mark>G</mark> herself. it's a cute promotion but, if <mark>G</mark>, or her pr people are reading this, this place is better than that kind of <mark>G</mark>.\n\na<mark>G</mark>, totally minor, practically inconsequential critiques to be made. sure, the price can be steep if you do not do your homework but look at the complete packa<mark>G</mark>: friendly servers and hostesses, a priceless view and a menu that made a believer out of a <mark>G</mark> who had no idea who the woman behind everything was. that last part alone should be enou<mark>G</mark> to <mark>G</mark> your foot in the door if you are even sli<mark>G</mark> considering this destination on your next ve<mark>G</mark> trip.",

            "i've been dying to <mark>G</mark> here for so long and can never <mark>G</mark> a reservation there so i was so excited to try it. not even close to what i expected. i have all of <mark>G</mark> books and have followed her for years. <mark>G</mark> to ferraro's on paradise for a truly amazing meal. the ambiance was fantastic, one of the most beautiful restaurants i've ever seen with the best view of the strip. but when you live here in town you <mark>G</mark> very spoiled by all of the <mark>G</mark> restaurants. also typical ve<mark>G</mark>, it <mark>G</mark> too crowded and the quality control <mark>G</mark> down. most of our food was cold instantly because of the open windows and you can tell it sat around before it was dropped off. the si<mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> cocktail was warm. we asked for ice cubes, and they actually brou<mark>G</mark> us a bucket of ice instead of making a freshly chilled drink. and what's the deal with being booked on open table from 5-10 pm every ni<mark>G</mark> when it wasn't even all that busy?! any time we voiced complaints or concerns to the server(s), they listened attentively then <mark>G</mark> some explanation saying \"that's the way <mark>G</mark> likes it\", and masterfully i<mark>G</mark> us. apple tart was nearly raw, i could have made a better pizzette at home, lobster arancini had no flavor. <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> were <mark>G</mark> and so was the bucatini. but they were just <mark>G</mark>, nothing spectacular. if you rarely <mark>G</mark> out for a nice dinner you will probably enjoy it there. not impressed at all.", 
            "we dined here last ni<mark>G</mark> for a early valentine's day celebration.   as locals working in the industry you very rarely celebrate anything on the actual day. when first arriving to the restaurant we noticed how beautifully decorated the hotel and entrance to the restaurant was.  if you remember what bill's was before you would a<mark>G</mark> how much of a face lift this place <mark>G</mark>.  we checked out the photo booth before dinner since we <mark>G</mark> there 5 mins before our reso and they didn't seat us ri<mark>G</mark> away.  as we walked out of the booth the hostess told us our table was ready but not to worry about the pictures cuz it was out of paper to print them.   why wouldn't you put a si<mark>G</mark> up or something so <mark>G</mark> know to email the photos to themselves?   or not take the pictures at all.  whatever!  we followed the hostess to what seemed like the back corner of the restaurant.  the table she tried to seat us at was literally in the corner with a deuce so close to it we mi<mark>G</mark> as well have had dinner with the couple next to us and been a party of 4.  i asked her if any other table would be available.   she had us wait in the loun<mark>G</mark> while she went back to check.  we didn't mind the wait, about 15-20 mins, ordered a cocktail to start.  <mark>G</mark> selling tactic if it was one!  taylor, the hostess, came back to escort us to a table by the window overlooking the fountains.  she was super friendly and accomadating!  honestly her willin<mark>G</mark> to help us was probably the hi<mark>G</mark> of our ni<mark>G</mark>.  once at the table our server came over and <mark>G</mark> us, presented a wine list and dinner menu.  he took a moment to explain the menu and some si<mark>G</mark> dishes.  the <mark>G</mark> came over and interrupted him during his spiel, said hi to us, said something to the server, and then walked away.  weird.   (and he never touched the table after that)  i was torn between a couple different items and asked the server what he would recommend.   he didn't seem as if he wanted to answer my questions.  almost as if we were bothering him.   we ended up ordering the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, bacon wrapped dates, burrata, and the tricolore salad to start.  they were all <mark>G</mark>, nothing spectacular.   the bread selection was <mark>G</mark> thou<mark>G</mark>.   we wanted to order a bottle of wine but had a couple questions for the sommelier.   he was tied up at another table and we didn't <mark>G</mark> a chance to order the wine until we were done with our apps.  a little disappointing.   in his defense the apps did come out quite quickly.  but still, no one likes to be rushed.  the weird thing was the apps came out super quick but we waited a long time for our entrees.   for our entrees i <mark>G</mark> the spa<mark>G</mark>, her si<mark>G</mark> dish.   it had these hu<mark>G</mark> prawns with lemon and capers.  it sounds better on paper than it was.  my bf had the pasta with the pork ra<mark>G</mark>.   both dishes were very bland.  we had to add salt and red pepper flakes from the bread presentation to spice it up.  i hate to say it but we were super disappointed.   we had heard so many <mark>G</mark> thin<mark>G</mark> about this place but didn't have anything <mark>G</mark> for ourselves.  they have this dessert cart that you see <mark>G</mark> around that apparently is only for the patrons who ordered the tasting menu.  so don't <mark>G</mark> your hopes up when you see it unless you have the tasting menu.  we ordered the cookies for dessert since nothing really jumped out at us.  they were unique.   not soon after we dug into the cookies our server dropped the check.  obviously he had someplace else to be and we were in his way!  overall we were disappointed.  not to mention once the bottle of wine was opened we had to keep pouring it ourselves.  maybe $100 bottle of wine is too cheap to have any sort of table maintenance.   the server hardly came by to check on us.  maybe we were just to critical of the place or maybe they were having an off day.  but none the less, with so many <mark>G</mark> options in this city <mark>G</mark> will not be at the top of our list.  sometimes people that work in the same industry are much more critical than others.  or maybe not, who really knows.", 
            "we came for lunch on 2/14. they have 5 cocktails and were out of 2. we ordered the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> and they were tasteless. followed by sa<mark>G</mark> parmesan with honey. the cheese was <mark>G</mark>, they serve it with a honeycomb that is hard to eat and you are picking wax pieces out of your mouth for the rest of the meal. for the entree we ordered the pasta carbonara. the lemon zest flavor is overwhelming and doesn't do with the pasta. i would have liked the pasta with <mark>G</mark>'s bottled pasta sauce that you can <mark>G</mark> at tar<mark>G</mark> better than what i <mark>G</mark>. this was a complete waste of money and time.",

            "<mark>G</mark>'s had a ton of hype ever since it opened this past summer. reservations had to be booked two months in advance. expectations were hi<mark>G</mark> when i finally tried the food last weekend with a hi<mark>G</mark> probability of disappointment (as is usually the case with these types of celebrity restaurants). the menu is naturally italian cuisine, but with californian influences. \n\nwe started with a few appetizers: the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, the lobster arancini, and the wood roasted mushroom pizzette. the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> were a heavy favorite on reviews, but i found them to be ordinary. the lobster arancini was a hu<mark>G</mark> failure. while it was well-coated and fried, the name was quite deceiving. there was no lobster at all - no chunks of meat, no flavor of lobster whatsoever, not even imitation meat. i thou<mark>G</mark> i was mistaken from the first ball, but by the time i bit into the second, i was sure there was no lobster. i love mushrooms so the wood roasted mushroom pizzette was my favorite appetizer. it was topped with <mark>G</mark>, which didn't overwhelm the mushrooms. \n\nwhen at <mark>G</mark>'s, for<mark>G</mark> about the mains because the pasta is the star of the show. we shared the pappardelle and bucatini. the handmade pasta was perfectly cooked. now, that's what i call al dente! the pork ra<mark>G</mark> was tender and flavorful, but i really liked the bucatini's spicy red sauce. i enjoyed both pastas, but the bucatini was a sli<mark>G</mark> favorite. \n\n<mark>G</mark> used to hi<mark>G</mark> prices for small portions when dining on the strip. each appetizer was 4 ounces each and each pasta dish was 8 ounces. surprisin<mark>G</mark>, i was comfortably full after the pastas so we skipped out on dessert. i wasn't blown away by the food (especially not the appetizers), but i could appreciate the pasta dishes. the space itself has <mark>G</mark> views of the bella<mark>G</mark> fountains and caesar's. i also love restaurants that have an open kitchen where you can watch them prepare everything from the pasta to even the charcuterie.", 
            "we had a dinner at <mark>G</mark> and the food was excellent, we had the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, dates, delicious, tricolor salad, amazing.... as a main course we <mark>G</mark> the salmon and risoto, perfectly cooked, but the service made our ni<mark>G</mark>, ron was amazing with all the su<mark>G</mark> and attention, thank you for everything. did i mention the view, table by the windows, bella<mark>G</mark> fountains, incredible. we'll be back for sure, pretty soon,  had a <mark>G</mark> time at <mark>G</mark>, definitely met my expectations", 
            "it pains me to write this review because i went there for the first time in december and then promptly raved about it for 2 months to anybody who would listen.  had i written my yelp review then, i would've <mark>G</mark> them 5 stars from the impeccable service, perfectly executed food, and beautiful ambiance.  my friend and i were seated in the main living room and still had a <mark>G</mark> view of the strip. we ordered the burrata and charred octopus dishes to start, and then i had the branzino while she had the crab and scallop risotto.  i ate every sin<mark>G</mark> bite. our water <mark>G</mark> were never empty and the waitstaff was very attentive. the wine recommendations were spot on.  i left deciding it was new favorite restaurant in ve<mark>G</mark>.\n\ni waited to write my review thou<mark>G</mark> because my experience with new restaurants is that the consistency isn't always there.  i just went a<mark>G</mark> this past weekend and was appalled at what a completely different experience we had.  in all fairness, i wouldn't say it was horrible and the food was still decent, but relative to the hi<mark>G</mark> bar that was set from my first time around, it was a drastic chan<mark>G</mark>.  i had no issues with paying $100 per person the first time.  as for the second time, i would've been happier at ma<mark>G</mark>.  \n\nfirst, the wood burning smell was incredibly stifling this time and since the initially tried to see us in the little back room with seemin<mark>G</mark> no ventilation, it was difficult to bear.  we moved tables, which helped mar<mark>G</mark>, but it wasn't until they opened the windows later into dinner that it was back to normal.  second, our waitress was sporadically attentive, disappeared for long intervals, and told me thin<mark>G</mark> that i asked for before on my first trip (like plain <mark>G</mark> bread to eat with the burrata) didn't exist.  (when she checked with the kitchen thou<mark>G</mark>, it did materialize.) she also cleared our apps without asking if we were done because our entrees were ready.  third, the food execution......the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> were tasty and the burrata a<mark>G</mark> delicious. i did a repeat of the branzino because i loved it so much the first time, but this time it lacked seasoning and was the skin was crispy in parts and so<mark>G</mark> in others. my friend <mark>G</mark> the rack of lamb, which was a pretty tiny portion to be<mark>G</mark> with, which wouldn't have been an issue if 1/3 of it was big <mark>G</mark> of fat.  we didn't even bother with dessert.  \n\ni have no issues with portions sizes and inflated prices on the strip because usually you <mark>G</mark> what you pay for from a reputable restaurant.  this was a major disappointment.  i may one day try it a<mark>G</mark>, but it'll be for breakfast or lunch if anything.",

            "the husband and i have been wanting to eat at <mark>G</mark>'s restaurant for a while. we finally dined here for dinner last month for my birthday. in fact, i think i called in the reservation about 3 months before. not that i needed to that far in advance, but its never bad to plan thin<mark>G</mark> early, ri<mark>G</mark>? i also requested a table with a <mark>G</mark> view. althou<mark>G</mark> they said \"we will try as much as possible, but not <mark>G</mark>,\" we did end up <mark>G</mark> a table facing the bella<mark>G</mark> fountains. also <mark>G</mark> a fantastic view of the crazy traffic on las ve<mark>G</mark> blvd, lol. \n\ncustomer service was excellent. our server and the staff was very nice, polite and attentive. drinks were refilled and dirty plates were taken away in a timely manner. so here's the thing: years a<mark>G</mark> when i did watch <mark>G</mark>'s cooking show, i really liked her recipes because they were simple. few in<mark>G</mark>, preparing didn't look too difficult and of course everything looked so <mark>G</mark>! when i was browsing the menu, everything looked so complicated. i <mark>G</mark> it doesn't help that i'm picky about what i eat, but its never a <mark>G</mark> si<mark>G</mark> for me when nothing on the menu really catches my eye. so i ordered probably the most boring thing on the menu: spa<mark>G</mark>. i know, i know, but it was the only dish that didn't have thin<mark>G</mark> that i hated like squash, mushrooms, brussel sprouts, etc.\n\nwe started with appetizers. we asked our server what appetizer was popular under the meat cate<mark>G</mark>, and he recommended the bacon wrapped dates. not a fan of dates, but they were stuffed with sausa<mark>G</mark> and wrapped in bacon. sounded like they were worth a try. i was surprised that i could hardly taste the dates and the sausa<mark>G</mark> did have a kick to it, but they were <mark>G</mark>. we also ordered the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, which were juicy and tasty as well. it also came with a <mark>G</mark> amount of sauce.\n\nnow to the main course. i was excited when the food was brou<mark>G</mark> to our table because the presentation was pretty. for my spa<mark>G</mark>, there were two jumbo shrimp on the bottom and a dollop of spa<mark>G</mark> sitting on top of the shrimp. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, i didn't like the lemon sauce too much. i was kind of over it after the first few bites, but forced myself to eat it all because this place isn't cheap! u<mark>G</mark>, i'm definitely not a fan of sweet spa<mark>G</mark>. it needed butter, or maybe just salt. my husband, on the other hand loved his food! he ordered the bone-in tuscan rib-eye with truffle flakes. our server said that occasionally they offer the truffle flakes in the restaurant. i thou<mark>G</mark> it was weird that there was a sunny side up e<mark>G</mark> on the steak. but then a<mark>G</mark>, i do hate e<mark>G</mark>. i know that e<mark>G</mark> are used to make a lot of foods and that is fine. i <mark>G</mark> i should say that i don't like e<mark>G</mark> by itself or e<mark>G</mark> that are visible. anyway, he said that the rib-eye was fantastic and one of the best steaks he ever had. \n\ni really wanted to order a tiramisu for dessert, but our server told us that they only serve it when they have some special \"tastin<mark>G</mark> menu.\"  :( total fail for me, but at least one of us really liked the food here.\n\nbeen there, done that, but i probably won't be back. a little disappointing, but oh well, there are many other <mark>G</mark> eats in ve<mark>G</mark>!", 
            "had lunch at <mark>G</mark> on a friday.  we had a reservation, but the place was nearly empty, so that wasn't needed.  it's lar<mark>G</mark> and it's appointed nicely.  i wouldn't think i would have liked the setting, but i did.  it has a lar<mark>G</mark> view of the strip, as it's ri<mark>G</mark> on the corner of flamin<mark>G</mark> and las ve<mark>G</mark> boulevard.  there is a lot of seating on the outer ed<mark>G</mark> of the room, so if you want a view of the strip, you should ask.  they can open the lar<mark>G</mark> windows, but i found that when you open the windows you pretty much just <mark>G</mark> traffic noise.  so, the views are interesting, but i didn't love having the window open.\n\nour server approached us very quickly to take drink orders.  my buddies ordered specialty cocktails, including a bloody mary with a ball of mozzarella and a slice of sausa<mark>G</mark>.  i didn't sample them, but everyone liked their drinks.  to start, we decided to <mark>G</mark> with the <mark>G</mark> with pear honey, the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, and the <mark>G</mark> cheese stuffed <mark>Baby Sweet Peppers</mark>.  my favorite was definitely the <mark>G</mark> with honey.  the honey was thick and difficult to spread, but it was fantastic.  the sweetness of the honey and the saltiness of the cheese was excellent.  the meatballs were a little disappointing.  we'd heard such <mark>G</mark> thin<mark>G</mark>, so we were surprised.  the orzo challen<mark>G</mark> the inte<mark>G</mark> of the meatballs, they kind of fell apart.  they weren't bad, but certainly worse than we were expecting.  the peppers were fairly strai<mark>G</mark>.  no heat at all, i could have used more <mark>G</mark> cheese.\n\nto eat, i had the <mark>Venetian Panino</mark>.  it comes with turkey, <mark>G</mark>, fontina, mustard, and peppedew peppers.  this is one of the best pressed sandwiches i've had in a long time.  the bread is li<mark>G</mark> than typical panini bread, and it was crisp, but didn't cut the roof of your mouth.  often paninis have bread that is too thick or too crusty, but <mark>G</mark>'s was near perfect.  the in<mark>G</mark> went well to<mark>G</mark>.  the turkey was a tad on the dry side, but the mustard helped that.  the cheeses were fantastic, really tasty and melty.  this sandwich just worked.\n\nmy buddy ordered the <mark>Lemon Pesto <mark>G</mark> Cheese</mark> with added prosciutto.  i had a bite, and it was nice and caramelized and very cheesy, but too lemony for me.  the citrus was overpowering.\n\nfor dessert, we had the chef's trio of cookies.  i can't remember the other two  cookies, but the winner for me was a lar<mark>G</mark> warm chocolate chip cookie.  sli<mark>G</mark> crisp, <mark>G</mark>, and packed with chocolate.  a little sea salt on top would have put this over the top, but it was a very <mark>G</mark> cookie.\n\ni would come back, i'd like to try dinner at <mark>G</mark>.  but, we were very pleased with our lunch and i absolutely would re-order that <mark>Venetian Panino</mark>.", 
            "lower your expectations.  tasty food but totally overpriced and bush lea<mark>G</mark> service.  we went for lunch and ordered a bellini, one cup of coffee, the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> appetizer, meat/cheese appetizer sampler, the muffaletta sandwich and the <mark>Lemon Pesto <mark>G</mark> Cheese</mark> sandwich.  total cost $150.\n\nwaitress did not take our order until 40 minutes after we were seated and did not offer any su<mark>G</mark> or menu explanations.  meatballs came out with sauce all over the side of the dish.  the couple behind us left after waiting 20 minutes after they received their water.  another table next to us went un-bussed for 20 minutes after the couple left.  meal took 90 minutes from be<mark>G</mark> to the time the check showed up.\n\nwe won't be returning.",

            "dining at <mark>G</mark> was <mark>G</mark>. however, i will start this review off by saying i wish i had come for dinner. the lunch menu is si<mark>G</mark> limited compared to their dinner offerin<mark>G</mark>. for example, there are only 3 pasta options for lunch. ima<mark>G</mark> my disappointment when i learned the lemon shrimp spa<mark>G</mark> that everyone raved about on yelp is not offered on the lunch menu, only dinner! \n\nbut, i di<mark>G</mark>. ambiance: located on the 2nd floor of the cromwell, the restaurant is beautiful. let's be honest, <mark>G</mark> is beautiful. she is probably my only and real \"woman crush.\" the restaurant ambiance and decor emulate her. it's very inviting, spacious, ele<mark>G</mark>, yet also homey. not to mention a <mark>G</mark> view of the bella<mark>G</mark>. we requested a view of the fountains like everyone said and they were able to obli<mark>G</mark>. \n\nfood/drinks: the san<mark>G</mark> ($15) was pretty and tasted as <mark>G</mark> as it looked. lunch menu had a bunch of appetizers, pizzas, salads, and sandwiches. a<mark>G</mark>, super limited pasta menu, and no additional entrees... or at least i can't remember any. thin<mark>G</mark> i tried:\n<mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> ($10)- okay, lots of flavor and the sauce they came in was <mark>G</mark>. a <mark>G</mark> appetizer to start. \n<mark>Wood Roasted Mushrooms</mark> ($14)- tasty and tender. but super small. \n<mark>Lemon Pesto <mark>G</mark> Cheese</mark> with prosciutto and tomato ($22)- the prosciutto is an extra $4, you can <mark>G</mark> it without for $18. i couldn't really taste it because it was so thin, it really only made it a little more salty. the lemon flavor wasn't too prevalent either. the main flavor here is the pesto. it was <mark>G</mark> but $18 for a <mark>Lemon Pesto <mark>G</mark> Cheese</mark> sandwich? ponder that for a min. all sandwiches come with your choice of salad or fried zucchini strips. <mark>G</mark> the zucchini strips, they're still ve<mark>G</mark>! thus, you can feel less <mark>G</mark> about them. \nsausa<mark>G</mark> pizza- pretty <mark>G</mark> but also quite oily. probably wouldn't <mark>G</mark> next time. \ncaprese salad ($19)- the heirloom tomatoes were excellent and the mozzarella was delicious. \ne<mark>G</mark> and sausa<mark>G</mark> lasa<mark>G</mark> ($24)- this was really <mark>G</mark>. the size is just ri<mark>G</mark>. \n\nservice: friendly, competent, attentive when needed, but nothing really remarkable in this area. \n\noverall, <mark>G</mark> is my home<mark>G</mark>, but i'll have to come back for dinner. the limitations of the lunch menu was surprising. also, it's obviously a pricey place... but if you can splur<mark>G</mark>, i'd definitely recommend you try her. i did it just because i like her so much. it's absolutely more of a special occasions only type of place.",

            "what a disappointment our anniversary turned out to be.  we made our reservation about 45 days in advance declaring the evening as an anniversary and jud<mark>G</mark> by the times still available throu<mark>G</mark> open table the restaurant seemed pretty open.   \n\nfirst we arrive and check in at the top of the escalator and are met by a <mark>G</mark> of twenty somethin<mark>G</mark>.  we <mark>G</mark> our name and they wish us a happy anniversary (this can only be a <mark>G</mark> si<mark>G</mark> i think).  next we are left to fend for ourselves.  no one tells us where we can wait while they <mark>G</mark> our table ready (for a town built toward hospitality this is a ve<mark>G</mark> first).  so we are stuck in limbo.  the tiny seating area with a photo booth is full (there are 2 other couples waiting).  so we decide to awkwardly check out the menu and some news articles down a hallway.  as we are mulling in the hallway there are other patrons arriving and they are being escorted to a seating/waiting area inside the restaurant (apparently one of the twenty somethin<mark>G</mark> doesn't need twitter to communicate....i'll chalk that one up misfortune).  eventually someone comes and <mark>G</mark> us and our <mark>G</mark> experience is about to be<mark>G</mark>.\n\nwell, i wish i could tell you what the restaurant was like inside once we were seated, but instead we were seated in the bar area.  when questioned about the seating, one of the twenty something hostesses meekly <mark>G</mark> that this was all they had.  i should have used my an<mark>G</mark>/disappointed emoji on my phone instead.  maybe then she would have fi<mark>G</mark> out the messa<mark>G</mark>.  so i <mark>G</mark> an awesome view of a bar and a tv with preseason football playing (not sweet).  my beautiful wife (a hu<mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> fan, she makes me sit throu<mark>G</mark> all of her episodes instead of letting me watch football) she <mark>G</mark> a view of a wall with 3 lar<mark>G</mark> paintin<mark>G</mark>. it looks like she will have a hu<mark>G</mark> portrait of the patriarch of the de laurentiis family overlooking her every move toni<mark>G</mark>.   \n\nas we sit there 3 other unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> couples are flocked to these 4 tables that should absolutely only used as the best bar tables and in no way ever be used as dining seats (especially when for a couple celebrating an event that made a reservation weeks in advance).  one by one we see the same disappointment on their faces as they realize they will be eating in the \"cupboard under the stairs\" with harry potter.  let's move on shall we.\n\nwith that over and my disappointment waning we <mark>G</mark> to focus on the food.  we ordered a couple appetizers, the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> and artichoke arancini. score!  our waiter proclaims those are his favorites (althou<mark>G</mark>, i did hear him say that to the other unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> souls sharing the cupboard with us....whatever i'm still comforted by the statement).  they both were <mark>G</mark>, but needed more salt and seasoning.  the arancini took the day.  next we ordered the pappardelle and ravioli.  both were <mark>G</mark> a<mark>G</mark>, but served as an appetizer.  the pappardelle alle<mark>G</mark> had pork ra<mark>G</mark>, but it seemed missing in action this ni<mark>G</mark>.  the ravioli was very <mark>G</mark>.  it was served with a butter sauce underneath and 2, yes 2 aspara<mark>G</mark> tips.  it reminded of me of eating a steamed lobster with warm melted butter, but with the lobster being wrapped in a pillow of pasta.  \n\nessentially, everything on the menu seems to be served tapas style.  the only problem is that the price tag of $36 and $32 for tapas is a little ridiculous.  but hey, we are paying for the experience and it looks like the ea<mark>G</mark> just put tim tebow in the <mark>G</mark> and thou<mark>G</mark> my wife never says, i assume the portrait of dino remains unchan<mark>G</mark>.  \n\noverall, <mark>G</mark>'s was not worth it.  there are tons of italian restaurants in this town and just value alone will keep us away.  throw in mar<mark>G</mark> service and the fact i may be eating in a broom closet seals that. but, jud<mark>G</mark> by how busy they were, they will hardly miss us. \n  \nfood:  3.5 stars (hey, my plates were clean when then took them away)\nvalue:  1 star (proportion sizes don't match up)\nservice: 2 stars (our waiter and his assistant moved the scale two stars from the zero star hostesses that only know how to communicate on a samsung or apple device).\natmosphere:  no star (having a preseason football <mark>G</mark> as my eye contact breaker was not what i had in mind for our anniversary.  oh and thumping some j.t. like i was in a club doesn't seem to match the \"<mark>G</mark>\" brand)\n\nanyways, finished the evening off with a bur<mark>G</mark> and shake from in-n-out, so really how bad of a ni<mark>G</mark> could that have been?", 
            "liked: the decor, <mark>G</mark> table with strip view, <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, crab arancini, filet with surf and turf, branzino, bucateli pasta.  did not like:  wait time to <mark>G</mark> a menu and water, they brou<mark>G</mark> main dishes before clearing the table, some <mark>G</mark> between courses, and they served one ravioli with the surf and turf.  one small ravioli too....really?  come on man!  service:  overall the serve was <mark>G</mark>.  cliff was very nice and helpful with menu and questions.  it just seemed like they were a little busy and it showed a little in the service time.  they made up for that with nice friendliness.  i almost <mark>G</mark> them 4 stars...but went with three due to la<mark>G</mark> in service time.  food is solid overall, but a tad on the pricey side for what you <mark>G</mark>.", 
            "<mark>G</mark> is my absolute favorite food network chef. she inspired me in so many ways to cook, eat healthier, etc. i have met her several times and she's been a pleasure to be with.\n\nso when i heard that she was opening a restaurant, i couldn't pass it up. let's fast forward to a year of wishing: i finally was able to pay a visit! and let me tell you...it was everything i ima<mark>G</mark> her restaurant to be.\n\nambience: very modern, ele<mark>G</mark>, yet welcoming. it feels as if you're walking into <mark>G</mark>'s home. it's surrounded with pics of her family, furniture that she has at home, etc.\ni love how it has a woman's touch to the decor...\n\nfood: delicious! exactly what i would expect from <mark>G</mark>. portions are smaller but <mark>G</mark> enou<mark>G</mark> to have a bite from lots of thin<mark>G</mark> from the menu. i encoura<mark>G</mark> sharing as this will allow you to try all the items you want to order (it's difficult to choose just one! lol. my first experience at dinner was so <mark>G</mark> that i had to come back for lunch the next day...\n\nwhat i ordered (dinner):\n\n* complimentary bread plate: i enjoyed the homemade rosemary focaccia! so flavorful dipped in the pesto sauce it comes with!\n\n* <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>: the best meatballs i've ever had. not exa<mark>G</mark>. very tender and flavorful. my mom who is not a meatball person enjoyed it and stole my portion! i was so mad haha. please <mark>G</mark> this...it's jade's favorite (<mark>G</mark>'s dau<mark>G</mark>). this was so <mark>G</mark> i ordered it a<mark>G</mark> on my second visit!\n\n* <mark>G</mark> octopus: not chewy at all. super tender. it had a nice char on the outside and paired well with the potato caper salsa it was served with. it's a favorite of <mark>G</mark>'s.\n\n* fritto misto: i've had better. the batter wasn't too crispy but loved the lemon aioli and fennel salad it came with.\n\n* oysters with prosecco mi<mark>G</mark>: sweet, fresh, & clean tasting from the mi<mark>G</mark> sauce. wish we had more!\n\n* sopressata: how could you <mark>G</mark> wrong with spicy salami?!\n\n* caprese salad: the mini heirloom tomatoes were super sweet and the mozzarella was oozing with creaminess. such a <mark>G</mark> pleasure.\n\n* romaine salad (<mark>G</mark>'s version of a caesar salad): i loved how <mark>G</mark> added crispy capers and bits of anchovies. worked well with the <mark>G</mark> parmesan and crispy romaine.\n\n* lobster ravioli: i wasn't a fan. the tarra<mark>G</mark> butter sauce had a unique flavor i wasn't too fond of. the ravioli was al dente thou<mark>G</mark> which i was happy about. \n\n* crispy branzino with oran<mark>G</mark> vinai<mark>G</mark>: i was really surprised with this dish. absolutely delicious! the fish was very crispy and the meat was moist. i wouldn't have expected it to work well with the aru<mark>G</mark> salad with oran<mark>G</mark> vinai<mark>G</mark> but it was a match made in heaven! bitter from the aru<mark>G</mark> and nice citrus pop from the vinai<mark>G</mark>. hi<mark>G</mark> recommended if you like fish!\n\n* lemon spa<mark>G</mark> with jumbo shrimp: i fell in love with this dish. it's deceiving at first that it's on the smaller side bit it's very filling!!!! you <mark>G</mark> two jumbo prawns and they are hu<mark>G</mark>! the sauce is very li<mark>G</mark> and refreshing even if it is a creamy sauce. i love the clean flavor the lemon <mark>G</mark> and the nice pop the fried capers provided. i can see why this is one of her si<mark>G</mark> dishes.\n\n* tuscan ribeye with a fried e<mark>G</mark>: a meat lover's dream come true. 28 oz ribeye cooked to your liking with a fried e<mark>G</mark> on top...who wouldn't love that?! i love the oozing yoke paired with the juicy ribeye. the other table beside us couldn't take their eyes off this thing...it's definitely a si<mark>G</mark> to see.\n\n* <mark>G</mark>'s si<mark>G</mark> cookies: my favorite was the chocolate chip. warm and chocolatey! \n\nwhat i ordered (brunch):\n\n* carbonara pizza w/ fried e<mark>G</mark>: pancetta and an e<mark>G</mark> on a pizza? i'm sold. so <mark>G</mark>! everything you'd ever want in a pizza...\n\n* mar<mark>G</mark> pizza: simplicity at it's best. the tomato sauce was very sweet and the traditional combo of basil, tomato, & mozzarella never fails. and on a side note...<mark>G</mark>'s pizza dou<mark>G</mark> is very <mark>G</mark>. has a nice honey note to it and it's charred to perfection in her brick oven.\n\n* <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>: it's that <mark>G</mark> that i had to order it a<mark>G</mark>!\n\n* zucchini scapece: i'm so <mark>G</mark> i was able to <mark>G</mark> this as a side order. strands of potato, zucchini, and onion are li<mark>G</mark> fried and served piled hi<mark>G</mark> to your table. i couldn't stop snacking on this in between bites from my pizza!\n\n* aru<mark>G</mark> salad with candied lemon vinai<mark>G</mark>: as simple as the salad was....i really enjoyed the vinai<mark>G</mark>. little bits of candied lemon bits floated around and provided a nice burst of citrus that contrasted with the peppery aru<mark>G</mark> and crispy pancetta. \n\n* white san<mark>G</mark>: bubbly, fruity, and crisp. perfect for the hot weather!\n\noverall i had a <mark>G</mark> time at <mark>G</mark>'s. service was superb and the food was amazing. i'll admit it's very expensive but worth every penny. you absolutely <mark>G</mark> what you pay for. it definitely was the hi<mark>G</mark> of my trip to ve<mark>G</mark>. i can't wait to <mark>G</mark> back. \n\nps: make sure you stop by the photo booth for an opportunity to capture your visit!!!!", 
            "i'm a big fan of <mark>G</mark>'s shows and i own her cookbooks so i was very excited to try her restaurant. the earliest dinner reservation i could <mark>G</mark> was 9:15pm on a saturday ni<mark>G</mark>. we arrived early and <mark>G</mark> drinks at the bar. we sat for 10 minutes before a server came. we noticed ri<mark>G</mark> away that it was hot in the restaurant. all of the windows were open and it was loud and uncomfortable. for drinks, i had the <mark>G</mark> and my husband had the barbarella. the barbarella was a fancy <mark>G</mark> and tonic and the <mark>G</mark> was sweet and creamy...both very delicious. \n\nwe started dinner with the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, crab arancini, and frito misto. the meatballs were delicious. they were salty, tender, and the sauce was cheesy. the arancini was <mark>G</mark> but my family's recipe is better. the marinara it came with was bland. the coating on the calamari was <mark>G</mark>. calamari should be fried in a li<mark>G</mark>, flakey batter. it came with lemon aioli which was <mark>G</mark> but i prefer marinara with my calamari. they were very tender and flavorful, i just didn't like the coating. this dish was served with a delicious fennel and pepper salad. skip the calamari please and <mark>G</mark> me more of that salad. \n\nthen we had the romaine and tri colore salads. the romaine is <mark>G</mark>'s take on a caesar salad. it was too lemony. the tri colore salad was delicious. it was served with kale, raddichio, proscuitto, and <mark>G</mark>. the proscuitto melted in your mouth and was salty and perfect. \n\nfor our entrees, we had lobster ravioli and lemon spa<mark>G</mark>. the lobster ravioli was <mark>G</mark>. the pasta was tender and they didn't skimp on the lobster. the spa<mark>G</mark> was raw. it stuck to<mark>G</mark> and was chewy. the sauce was creamy and lemony and the shrimp were tender. i enjoyed the fried capers that were sprinkled around the plate. if my pasta was cooked this would have been delicious. \n\nwe wanted dessert but the service was terrible. we were in the restaurant for 2 hours at this point, it was extremely hot, and our water was poured warm without ice. we decided to take <mark>G</mark>'s favorite cookies home. these were amazing. the lemon ricotta cookies were li<mark>G</mark> and cakey and the peanut butter and blackberry jam cookies were soft and nutty. we received 2 of each and then 1 lar<mark>G</mark> chocolate chip cookie. i do not care for chocolate chip but this cookie was <mark>G</mark>. we paid $12 for 5 cookies...worth every penny. \n\ni am <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark>'s 3 stars for the drinks and cookies. the food was overpriced and not very <mark>G</mark> and the restaurant was hot, loud, and the service was poor. our bill was $207 and the meal just wasn't worth it. my italian <mark>G</mark> never liked <mark>G</mark>. <mark>G</mark> used to say <mark>G</mark> was full of you know what. and italian <mark>G</mark> are never wrong.", 
            "4.5 stars. service was excellent, atmosphere is very cool and drinks and entrees were <mark>G</mark>. only thing that was a little disappointing was the appetizers, which we unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> made the rookie mistake of filling up on. \n\nfor starters, we <mark>G</mark> the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark>, friend sausa<mark>G</mark> balls and spinach and ricotta pizette. definitely did not need 4 apps for 4 people - 2 would have been fine. of the starters, the <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> were by far the best. the sausa<mark>G</mark> was <mark>G</mark> as well, but neither the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> nor the pizette had much taste. wish we had skipped those so i could have finished my entree, the parpadelle with pork ra<mark>G</mark>, which was excellent. my husband had the bone-in rib eye, which he loved. no one had room for dessert, but next time my plan is to <mark>G</mark> easy on the starters so i do!", 
            "wasn't sure what to expect but was pretty certain it would be italian!   first the space is <mark>G</mark>. really open but not noisy open.  plenty of space between tables and the decor was modern but inviting. kind of a mixed bag here as far as food.  we ordered the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> on some yelpers recommendation and they were served pretty cool. they mi<mark>G</mark> have been <mark>G</mark> but really too chilly to say for sure. also had the salami and cheese antipasto plate and most of that selection was very <mark>G</mark> to outstanding. the parm was <mark>G</mark>!!    i ordered the risotto with crab and scallops. while tasty, not the level i expected from a hi<mark>G</mark> end celebrity chef venue in las ve<mark>G</mark>  my wife had the wa<mark>G</mark> short ribs that she found .....just ok. the polenta it was served on was quite <mark>G</mark> however. service was a<mark>G</mark>. just ok.  we ordered wine before ordering anything else and it came well after the meatballs arrived.   there was afore mentioned meatball issue and i had to chase a little for a check. not bad service...just not hi<mark>G</mark> level   overall three stars just about says it and for $275 tip in for a couple i had expected a lot more as to the quality of the food and service.  lots of choices on the strip at this price point.  i'd choose others.",

            "wow, impressed and doubly impressed that it is by a celebrity chef.  all reviews from celeb places are \"u<mark>G</mark>, really overrated\".  well done...service, food, atmosphere, view, price point.  kudos and i am sometimes hard to impress.\n\nwe were under $200 for a party of four.  we ordered the <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark>, which were <mark>G</mark>, but i wouldn't order a<mark>G</mark>, just because nothing special...everything else was special.  really everyone couldn't a<mark>G</mark> on a better app.\n\nentrees...filet and lamb chops....the temperature and flavor on both of these were beyond excellent.  the lemon shrimp pasta...excellent.  the barley entree was <mark>G</mark>, but i am just not a hu<mark>G</mark> barley fan.  \n\nthe bread basket was served with this piping hot rosemary buttery bread in an oven hot baking dish.  butter had lemon zest and dipping oil was flavored as well.  \n\ndesserts deserve big kudos.  the strawberry polenta cake was a take on strawberry shortcake, but it held the inte<mark>G</mark> of the ori<mark>G</mark>, but was set apart and creative and fresh.  very hard thing to do with a traditional recipe.  the jam, the cake....delish.  the tiramisu trio were excellent as well.  \n\nsides....the corn/sausa<mark>G</mark> was very unique and i enjoyed thorou<mark>G</mark>.  others thou<mark>G</mark> too spicy, but never for me....could have used less sausa<mark>G</mark>, only because i am not hu<mark>G</mark> on sausa<mark>G</mark> and would rather have more corn.  thou<mark>G</mark> the combo was unique and the sauce was excellent.  the polenta cakes were excellent as well.  crispy on outside, creamy on inside.  \n\nservice was beyond excellent.  waiter was spot on, funny, attentive, informative.  view of strip and bella<mark>G</mark> fountains.  four stars.  attention to detail in desi<mark>G</mark> and layout, four stars.  beautiful <mark>G</mark>, awesome silver ware.  presentation...delivered....food quality....delivered.....price point....<mark>G</mark> for upscale dining.  \n\ni only somewhat knew <mark>G</mark> as a celeb chef with some food network shows.  definitely a fan now.\n\noh, and i had read in the review that her <mark>G</mark> was a movie director and that her family also owned a pasta factory before wwii.  her <mark>G</mark>'s movie posters were presented as art in the entrance.  classy and true to a <mark>G</mark> heart....family first always.  \n\nthe walk throu<mark>G</mark> of the kitchen and antipasti bar was also a nice touch.", 
            "as a foodie and a ve<mark>G</mark> local, i am very critical of restaurants in <mark>G</mark> and especially customer service. i cannot say enou<mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> thin<mark>G</mark> about our waitress brooke in the loun<mark>G</mark> and the medium size calde antipasta platter we had on 6/24/2014. i wanted to lick the pot the bread came in, all buttery and delicious and warm! the <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> were amazing as were the lobster balls and the e<mark>G</mark>/potato pasta was a delicious treat! i am a hu<mark>G</mark> fan of citrus and loved the lemon undertones of just about everything on the sampler platter. i was really impressed with the atmosphere and the food, but what makes my rating 5 stars was brooke our waitress. she was outstanding; funny, knowled<mark>G</mark> and just plain fun! shout out to victor, brooke's back waiter, who was also funny and attentive! i am <mark>G</mark> the restaurant was not all hoity toity which is what i feared, i will definitely be back!", 
            "this place is off to a <mark>G</mark> start considering how ambitious the menu is, how lar<mark>G</mark> the dining room is, and how absolutely slammed busy it is every second it is open. the only issues we had were with pacing--all of our smaller plates came out in a hurry, then there was a loooooooooong wait for the final lar<mark>G</mark> plates. well, there was also a minor issue with the staff not knowing which of the coffees were and were not available in decaf. \n\nthe place was full, but we were seated immediately upon arriving for our 7:45 reservation. the room is arran<mark>G</mark> comfortably and even thou<mark>G</mark> it's busy, the tables are far enou<mark>G</mark> apart that there's a busy hum without being too loud. i think you would probably have to be ri<mark>G</mark> on the windows to have much bella<mark>G</mark> fountain view, but it was also very pleasant to watch the crescent moon rise over caesars from our table. \n\nthe bread service is excellent, with crunchy breadsticks, a flatbread, and a life-chan<mark>G</mark> rosemary focaccia. it also comes with multiple condiments, like pink himalayan salt, chili pepper flakes, lemon ricotta and basil pesto. (we actually used the condiments throu<mark>G</mark> our meal, which was fun.)\n\nfor the small plates, we had the oyster crudo, the charred octopus, the <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> and some of the re<mark>G</mark> cheese. every one was excellent except the octopus, which was tou<mark>G</mark> in some bites and could have used a bit more seasoning. (but maybe the bar had just been set impossibly hi<mark>G</mark> the previous ni<mark>G</mark>, when i had the best octopus i've ever eaten at, surprisin<mark>G</mark>, carnevino.) the <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> displaced the albondi<mark>G</mark> at julian serrano for me as the best meatballs in ve<mark>G</mark>. if they had been any more moist, they would not have been able to hold their shape and they burst with flavor. \n\nfor the lar<mark>G</mark> dishes, we had the lemon spa<mark>G</mark> (with shrimp as big as lobster tails) and the branzino with tan<mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark>. they were both wonderful. we were so full we decided to fore<mark>G</mark> dessert. \n\nlots of thou<mark>G</mark> has obviously <mark>G</mark> into the menu, as there is a wide ran<mark>G</mark> of dishes and every plate is beautifully presented on dishware that looks like it was selected to suit the individual dish. service throu<mark>G</mark> was smooth and attentive (i think they would rather die than let a water <mark>G</mark> be empty) and quite knowled<mark>G</mark> about the menu except for the decaf issue.\n\noverall, i do plan to <mark>G</mark> back next time i'm in ve<mark>G</mark>. the menu is set up (and priced) so that you can sample a variety of items without breaking the bank. for two people, we had cocktails (love the ipad cocktail menu with pictures), wine, four smaller plates and two lar<mark>G</mark> plates and with tax and tip it was $252. i consider that perfectly reasonable for an event restaurant of this quality in this location.", 
            "5 stars for food\n4 stars for service\n\nthe boyfriend and i went to the bar since we were 15 minutes early for our reso and were advised by the lovely hostesses our table would be ready closer to the reso time. the bar is packed, even at 10pm which they also advised in advance. found a spot on the end. two bartenders helped us, robert and chris i think. both <mark>G</mark> awesome service & so personable. we enjoyed our cocktails very much! \n\nwe <mark>G</mark> a window table which i was very excited about. the view of ceasars palace :) it took a while to <mark>G</mark> menus. our server, jessie i think it was. female with dark hair brou<mark>G</mark> the wine list first. everything on the menu looked amazing but my stomach couldnt handle one of each thing. we ordered the <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> to start. amazing! very small order so dont be surprised. i think there were only 4 bite size pieces. we didnt <mark>G</mark> the complimentary bread before the appetizer so i had to ask for it. presentation was impressive. i enjoyed the lemon butter with the rosemary olive oil bread. we were brou<mark>G</mark> st. <mark>G</mark> compliments of <mark>G</mark>. that was a nice touch & it was <mark>G</mark>! not too floral. i enjoyed just sipping on it. we ordered iced tea's with the raspberry essence the same time we ordered the app and entrees and didnt <mark>G</mark> it until we were in the middle of our entree's after i asked for it. instead of an apolo<mark>G</mark>, our server quickly left the table and yelled at her busser. the iced tea service is very impressive i must say. comes with a <mark>G</mark> straw! one order comes with two full <mark>G</mark> and are not refillable. i had the famous spa<mark>G</mark> which was delish! those prawns are hu<mark>G</mark>! the boyfriend had the salmon with succotash, yummy!!!! and a side of lemon potatoes. never in my mind would think to put those two to<mark>G</mark> but it just worked. we were both <mark>G</mark> full but i was not about to pass up dessert because i really wanted <mark>G</mark>! the beautiful dessert cart came by & of course everything looked wonderful but i already planned on <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> so we <mark>G</mark> one of each flavor, white coffee & toasted banana. omg! best <mark>G</mark> ever! both were amazing, i dont know which one i enjoyed more. the server brin<mark>G</mark> the check & it comes with an itouch servey. the bf fills it out cause we def had comments to make! when she comes back from swiping the card she then mentions our anniversary. kinda late dont you think! as we were standing up she brin<mark>G</mark> an anniversary drink. it was a basil infused sparkling lemonade. a lil sour & too sweet for me but <mark>G</mark>. i wish she brou<mark>G</mark> that before we were leaving cause i had to sit back down to drink it. \n\navi was the front mana<mark>G</mark> for the ni<mark>G</mark> & as we were first <mark>G</mark> seated he introduced himself. during our meal he came by a<mark>G</mark> to shake both our hands & asked if everything was ok. i wanted to mention all the thin<mark>G</mark> our server missed but he came by when i had a mouth full of food. he was very nice & im impressed he went to every table & introduced himself. that is quality service.\n\nthe service from our server only could have been better but i will definitley be back. the food is just outstanding. im a fan of her show & <mark>G</mark> is my favorite food network star so of course i was excited she opened a restaurant here. i can def see her personality in the desi<mark>G</mark> of the room. its lar<mark>G</mark>, so open & clean.", 
            "we were super excited to try this place and went without a reservation at about 11:30am.  the polite hostesses told us to come back in about a half an hour, which was no problem - i assumed the restaurant would be crowded and busy, as it just opened.  when we returned, we waited a little lon<mark>G</mark>, then were seated near the bar.  the restaurant has an amazing view of the strip, but we couldn't see anything from our table.  the restaurant was about half empty, leading me to believe this was more of a soft open - i know they haven't been open for lunch long.\n\nservice was very friendly.  i had the prosecco san<mark>G</mark>, which was delicious, and we had some fantastic <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark>.  the bread they brou<mark>G</mark> out at the be<mark>G</mark> of the meal was absolutely wonderful, thou<mark>G</mark> a bit <mark>G</mark>. i was very disappointed to see that there was only one pasta dish on the menu for lunch - i thou<mark>G</mark> for sure <mark>G</mark> was famous for her delicious pasta dishes!  i couldn't order the <mark>G's Baked Pasta</mark>, as it contains pork, so i went for the <mark>Lemon Pesto <mark>G</mark> Cheese</mark>, served with spiralized zucchini and potatoes.  it was quite <mark>G</mark>, but it took a really, really long time to come out.  like, probably 40 minutes.  it's a <mark>Lemon Pesto <mark>G</mark> Cheese</mark>!  we were <mark>G</mark> pretty antsy - not to mention hun<mark>G</mark> - and we prefer spending our time wandering around ve<mark>G</mark>, not sitting in a booth.\n\nmy husband ordered the muffeletta sandwich, a wed<mark>G</mark> of bread with various cured meats.  we later realized this sandwich is premade and is sitting with the antipasto items in the front deli case area.  why did it take 40 minutes to put a premade sandwich on a plate with salad?  he found the bread somewhat so<mark>G</mark>, likely because it's premade.  it didn't take long after we left the restaurant for my husband to start to feel ill and nauseous; he ended up out of commission the rest of the day.  i'm not sure how long the sandwiches were sitting in the case, but it mi<mark>G</mark> have been just a touch too long.  he had not eaten anything else that day save a banana, and he hadn't had anything to drink but water.\n\nthe wait staff was very kind and attentive every step of the way.  however, it appears that they just haven't worked out lunch yet.  i would not return.", 
            "i have been anxiously waiting to try <mark>G</mark> ever since they've opened. i'm not sure if it was the hype of a new restaurant opening on the strip or my fanatical love for <mark>G</mark> and her recipes, but i sadly left <mark>G</mark> feeling less than satisfied. first of all, i have to mention that i went to <mark>G</mark> during their lunch service, which to my knowled<mark>G</mark>, had only started a few days earlier. the lunch menu did not appeal to me as much as the dinner menu but i fi<mark>G</mark> any meal would still be amazing. i'm a little disappointed that they mostly offer salads and sandwiches since i adore carbs and love me some pasta. they had one pasta on the menu and their specialty pasta that day was lasa<mark>G</mark>. i'm thinking that i made the mistake of expecting too much and letting my anticipation <mark>G</mark> the best of me. \n\nfirst off, i love the cromwell. we hit valet and took about a 5-minute stroll throu<mark>G</mark> the casino, which was beautifully redone (i hadn't been to the cromwell since their opening). i heard that their <mark>G</mark>, semi-vinta<mark>G</mark> chandeliers were found in the former barbary coast stora<mark>G</mark> and were refurbished and <mark>G</mark> a little facelift to match the d\\u00e9cor of the cromwell. and they are just stunning! they <mark>G</mark> off a red hue that makes the casino feel more intimate and exclusive. i immediately felt like i was the star of a seductive music video and i should've been walking in slow motion. anyway, back to <mark>G</mark>. you take an escalator up to the restaurant (or approx. two fli<mark>G</mark> of stairs if you dare) and are <mark>G</mark> by very cute hostesses in classy but fun and flirty (almost mesh see-throu<mark>G</mark>) bcbg-like dresses. they have a charming waiting area with a cozy \"home & <mark>G</mark>\" touch and...a secret photo booth! well, it's not so secret, but it's a little closet-sized room hidden behind heavy curtains. you can take a picture of you and your date and automatically upload it to your facebook or have it emailed to you!\n\nthe interior of <mark>G</mark> is beautiful. i love the fresh market feel at the entrance of the venue and the open layout of the restaurant. every table had a view from any point of the restaurant since the windows face out onto las ve<mark>G</mark> blvd. and flamin<mark>G</mark>. the d\\u00e9cor is appealing, with wood floors / tables and the furnishing reminds me of being at home. the dayli<mark>G</mark> streams throu<mark>G</mark> the restaurant which li<mark>G</mark> up the venue in a bri<mark>G</mark> but delicate way. i wasn't too fond of the <mark>G</mark> (the water <mark>G</mark> reminded me of candleholders) and some of the bowls kind of flopped over on its side easily, which i ima<mark>G</mark> mi<mark>G</mark> conclude in a lot of broken <mark>G</mark> and spilled food. but enou<mark>G</mark> about that, and on to the food. the house bread that they brou<mark>G</mark> out was okay, very similar to a pizzeta but the thing that made it amazing was the pesto dipping sauce that accompanied it. \n\nrated on a scale of 1-10:\n\n10 - burrata cheese w/ balsamic-salt (really <mark>G</mark>, but it's hard to mess up burrata cheese)\n10 - <mark>Prosciutto San Daniele</mark> (also really <mark>G</mark>, but hard to mess up and was served with your everyday, avera<mark>G</mark> \"french's\" mustard?)\n1 - <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> w/ roasted wild mushrooms (horribly dry and the marsala was watery)\n5 - carbonara pizza (just made me feel like i was eating more house bread since the toppin<mark>G</mark> were very minimal)\n5 - italian cookies for dessert (this was recommended to us by the server, but i think my cookies are better - lemon cookies were the best)\n\nall in all, my meal was just sub-par for me. a lot of my collea<mark>G</mark> have a<mark>G</mark> that their experience was either similar or worse. just to <mark>G</mark> you an idea on pricing, i ordered two <mark>G</mark> of wine along with our food and our total bill came to $130.00 before <mark>G</mark>. i'm still optimistic that dinner mi<mark>G</mark> be better so i'll have to come back to try that and <mark>G</mark> an updated review.",

            "excellent service, and almost perfect food. a big fan of <mark>G</mark> as well since i watch food network a lot. \n\narrived at ve<mark>G</mark> and this was our first stop due to our reservations. a remodel hotel that has <mark>G</mark> ri<mark>G</mark> at the 2nd floor. if you wait outside the restaurant, there is a photo booth for you to take pictures. yes i said it, they so ballin' that they have a photo booth to use(too bad i hate taking pictures or else i'll be all over that haha). \n\nanyway, when you first walk in, you can see all their different kind of homemade pastas and it's kinda an open kitchen sort of way. <mark>G</mark> by our server that thorou<mark>G</mark> explain the items on the menus and cocktails. you have an electronic(ipad) menu. we decided to order the tasting menu(i for<mark>G</mark> the name), two appetizers, two pastas, and two entrees. the mana<mark>G</mark> came up to us and check on us which was awesome. we were also <mark>G</mark> complimentary drinks which was an extra +. it was a sweet wine drink that was <mark>G</mark> to us topped with lemon. sooooo <mark>G</mark>. not sure why they <mark>G</mark> us the drinks(maybe cause they're barely open)\n\ni love the hot bread that they <mark>G</mark> you. althou<mark>G</mark>, i can't eat too much of that because it's such a heavy filling bread. \n\n<mark>G</mark> broccoli rabe w/ calabrian chili vinai<mark>G</mark> - nothing too special but i do like the chili oil sauce on it. plus, it's <mark>G</mark> to have some kind of ve<mark>G</mark>. \n\nfinocchiona - the salami. it was enriched with flavors. topped with <mark>G</mark> and apple. <mark>G</mark> wonderfully to<mark>G</mark>. \n\nthe sampler came with <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> w/ roasted wild mushrooms, citrus marinated calamari salad w/ sundried tomatoes & olives, lobster arancini w/ calabrian chili pomodoro & basil aioli, and shrimps. we ordered the medium size one. \n\ni don't know if it's me personally but i was really dis<mark>G</mark> by the <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark>. i thou<mark>G</mark> it had a really stran<mark>G</mark> flavor to it and this is probably the thing i don't ever want a<mark>G</mark> at <mark>G</mark> + the lobster fritter thing. the lobster thing was so so. i felt like it tasted better than it looked. i liked everything else after that. they had this shrimp that was marinated in a salad sauce that was really <mark>G</mark>. they <mark>G</mark> you jumbo shrimps because the shrimps were fucking hu<mark>G</mark>. it was really tasty. the cucumber frittes/fries were addictive and so was the calamari.\n\npersonally, the two thin<mark>G</mark> that i loved the most was the two pastas. ravioli (rah-veeoh-lee) lobster, aspara<mark>G</mark> tips & tarra<mark>G</mark>  and the *spa<mark>G</mark> (spah-<mark>G</mark>-tee) shrimp, lemon & basil. the ravioli was <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark>. the skin was perfect and the inside was filled with lobster. i recommend eating it as a whole bite because if you tried to eat it piece by piece, the sauce comes out from the ravioli making it less flavorful and tasty. the *spa<mark>G</mark> (spah-<mark>G</mark>-tee) shrimp, lemon & basil was really amazing. it seems so simple but the spa<mark>G</mark> was soo <mark>G</mark>. it tasted fresh and they had fresh shrimp that compliments it well. the lemon and basil wasn't too strong which made me love the dish. i recommend people to <mark>G</mark> their pastas...it was heavenly. \n\nthe two entrees were lovely as well. the waiter described the salmon as one of the best salmon you can <mark>G</mark> and i think he was ri<mark>G</mark>. it was so juicy and it was cooked perfectly. it seemed like it was still a little raw but i think it was meant to be like that because it just add another layer to the dish. i could do without the succotash. \n\nthe veal was really <mark>G</mark> as well. it was fried perfectly. if you cut it, the juices flows out. look at pictures and it is topped with cheese on top. a really heavy dish.\n\noh and the other thing i didn't like about <mark>G</mark> was the side dish sweet corn & spicy sausa<mark>G</mark> . i think it was a personal thing but i thou<mark>G</mark> the corn wasn't cooked all the way. the sausa<mark>G</mark> tasted fine and all but the corn had a nasty texture to it. \n\nbesides that, i recommend <mark>G</mark> to all people. i can't wait to come back a<mark>G</mark> the next time and trying more of their pastas and hoping to meet <mark>G</mark> herself. excellent experience with amazing food and service! cheers", 
            "eh. went in mid july for our 1 year wedding anniversary dinner. tried to book reservations 2 weeks before we <mark>G</mark> to ve<mark>G</mark>, but they were all booked. (this was before <mark>G</mark> was open for lunch). my hubby and i were waking past the cromwell (please see separate review) and we wandered upstairs to <mark>G</mark> a look at <mark>G</mark>'s. we were able to make a reservation a week in advance for dinner at 9:30pm on a monday. upon making the reservation, the hostess asks if we will be celebrating anything special. i tell her its our anniversary. (thinking maybe <mark>G</mark> will come say hi?!). they were very vocal in telling us about the dress code. however, as we arrived in our sunday best. people strolled in wearing sneakers, shorts, and maxi dresses from the pool...the ni<mark>G</mark> of our reservation, we arrive a few minutes early. there is a free photo booth there that was a fun and free souvenir. the open concept kitchen as you walk into the dining room is <mark>G</mark>. fresh antipasti station, fresh pasta being handmade, bread being baked... the room itself is beautiful. very white, very chi chi. very manhattan pretentious. when you are first seated, the waiter brin<mark>G</mark> you a menu with \"<mark>G</mark>'s selections\". this menu is several courses meant to work to<mark>G</mark> that <mark>G</mark> arran<mark>G</mark> to compliment eachother. this was $120 pp. we weren't interested in eating all that. the waiter brou<mark>G</mark> over an ipad to take drink and antipast orders. i didn't want to drink and the (3) choices of antipast did not impress me. i was praying the whole menu wasn't on an ipad because this layout was so annoying to use. finally the waiter comes back with a real menu. i am a major foodie (please see all my reviews), and it took me forever to find something i was interested in eating. this rarely (if ever) happens to me. <mark>G</mark> raved and raved about having \"<mark>G</mark> free food\", so we expected to see <mark>G</mark> pasta. nope. her <mark>G</mark> foods were meat and ve<mark>G</mark>, which by the <mark>G</mark> of <mark>G</mark>, are <mark>G</mark> already. that was a disappointment. a<mark>G</mark>, it  took forever to fi<mark>G</mark> out what to order. <mark>G</mark>'s italian food is not your \"traditional\" italian food. (ex spa<mark>G</mark> and meatballs, manicotti, braciole, red sauce, etc). for traditional, amazing,  italian food, please see my review for buddy v's. her food is more mediterranean italian- lots of lemon, fennel- very different recipes and combinations of food. i felt lost and unfamiliar with the menu. we wound up ordering <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark>, shrimp scampi with marscapone cheese, and we each had a salad. the meatballs were excellent. shrimp scampi was very different. not at all <mark>G</mark>, which is often synonymous with scampi. salads were <mark>G</mark>. they bring out a big selection of bread to the table, with pesto dip and several other dips, and that was <mark>G</mark>. the only thing i entertained <mark>G</mark> as an entree was the rack of lamb, but it was $45, and something i make at home. i wanted something different. for dessert they bring over an entire cart of desserts- from homemade <mark>G</mark>, to cookies, to pastries... we had cappuccinos and tiramasu. i had traditional tiramasu and my husband had peanut butter & jelly tiramasu. those were amazing. it was extra cool that <mark>G</mark> was there that ni<mark>G</mark> cooking, and coming out to tables in the dining room to talk with patrons. they seemed to send her out to select tables, aka hi<mark>G</mark> rollers, as she didn't <mark>G</mark> around the room to all. that wasn't cool. it was very cool to see her in person, as i am a big fan of her shows, but being the anniversary and all, she could have stopped by. i wonder why they even asked that...we felt it was a little too much for us. we are laid back people that enjoy casual places. not enou<mark>G</mark> offerin<mark>G</mark> on the menu for our palette. we <mark>G</mark> to ve<mark>G</mark> every year, and i don't think we would <mark>G</mark> back. for 2 people for 2 appertizers, 2 salads and 2 desserts with cappuccino, it was over $100. portions are small.", 
            "my first trip. located on second floor of the cromwell. \n\ntips. this place takes reservations. most dinner times of 5-9 are a two month out for a reservation. lunch recently be<mark>G</mark> to be served. lunch dress code is relaxed and dinner is business casual. dress code is enforced.\n\nexperience. at arrival we are <mark>G</mark> immediately at the base of stairs to confirm our lunch reservation. also confirmed and <mark>G</mark> at the front desk. she kindly informs us to wait a few moments to try the photo booth to the left and are escorted to our tables.\n\nour server anthony arrived in a timely manner to introduce himself and his help. he was kindly insured we placed a drink order. we were unsure on what to order and he described some of his favorite bevera<mark>G</mark> choices. <mark>G</mark>'s san<mark>G</mark> with brachetto and fortunella 1958 with don julio were the drinks we ordered. anthony kindly informed us that restaurant was out of don juilo and was substituting with patron. rare to find a restaurant out of bevera<mark>G</mark>. without don julio i went with my second choice barbarella 1968 with tanqueray ten. waiter respected and a<mark>G</mark> with my opinion and affirmed the second choice was his favorite drink. \n\ndrinks were served and food order was taken without delay. both drinks i would describe as a <mark>G</mark> balance with alcohol and freshly matched in<mark>G</mark>. san<mark>G</mark> was crisp and savory. barbarella similar to a moscow mule was harmony of <mark>G</mark>, <mark>G</mark> beer, fresh lemon and basil. drinks ordered were refreshing for the hot temperatures outside of the restaurant. alcohol was not over powering either. \n\nanthony made su<mark>G</mark> for the meal. we followed some su<mark>G</mark> and ordered others. we ordered appetizers from the antipasti meat and cheese including <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark>, and <mark>Pecorino Tartufo</mark> with apricot preserves served with fresh made flat bread and dipping sauce. dipping sauce similar to that of a pesto. yum. pairing flat bread with pecorino and apricot spread just ma<mark>G</mark>. the components of pecorino worked well on its own and to<mark>G</mark>. harmony. \n\nmeatballs paired with vine roasted tomatoes in a savory marsala. tender soft meatballs. sauce was flavorful and one of the best i had. tomatoes li<mark>G</mark> toasted to maintain it's inte<mark>G</mark>. as a whole this was a nice antipasti. pieces were <mark>G</mark> on its own but in my opinion lacked a little cohesion for the appetizer. this item is on their dinner menu and i would still order it. \n\nwe ordered from the sandwiches from servers su<mark>G</mark>. muffuletta sandwich with mortadella, finocchoina, porchetta, prosciutto cotto, and a<mark>G</mark> provolone. similar to an italian salumi trio, was bursting with spice and fair amount of provolone on a fresh rustic bread. prepared warm from the <mark>G</mark>, this is what a  sandwich should be. this sandwich pays true homa<mark>G</mark> to the influences of <mark>G</mark>'s family into the restaurant. sandwich is served with choice of aru<mark>G</mark> salad or zucchini scapecce. aru<mark>G</mark> salad was elected to pair with this. li<mark>G</mark> dressed and topped with parmesan that hit an accord with the sandwich. i couldn't complain if this was the only thing i ordered. between the muffuletta sandwich and aru<mark>G</mark> salad i think i could eat all day without feeling <mark>G</mark>.\n\nother sandwich was the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> with lemon basil aioli and fried capers. the roll was by far one of the best deals on the menu. ten ounces of lobster piled on a roll with the citrus aioli was succulent, creamy, savory, and sweet. nothing over powering just ri<mark>G</mark> and not too aromatic with the lobster and citrus. paired this with the zucchini scapecce like a zucchini onion strin<mark>G</mark>. not <mark>G</mark> but crispy enou<mark>G</mark> with flavor to enjoy on it's own or pair with the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark>. li<mark>G</mark> of the zucchini paired nicely to the sandwich. both li<mark>G</mark> sides were <mark>G</mark> pairin<mark>G</mark>. \n\noverall the appetizers, sandwiches, sides, and drinks were <mark>G</mark>. service was outstanding. restaurant as a whole was refreshing, exceeded the expectations and hype. the restaurant reflects the pride, tradition which tributes to <mark>G</mark>'s family and california influences. i would make sure i had a reservation the next time i am out to las ve<mark>G</mark>. a must try if you like food. \n\nserver was very personal and knowled<mark>G</mark> of menu. server was efficient, friendly, and well articulated. it showed with su<mark>G</mark>. we enjoyed the meal from some su<mark>G</mark> he made and our own selections. serve, wait, and host staff worked well like a oiled machine or an orchestra on key.\n\noverall four stars for exceptions from a sli<mark>G</mark> delay on the check to <mark>G</mark> to us, a little pricy, and no clue what lunch was because lunch menu (just started serving lunch) was not available until we ate there. five stars on food, service, and drinks. \n\nwe had plenty on our list of thin<mark>G</mark> to do for this ve<mark>G</mark> trip and this is a definite return place for us.",

            "i came for one of my favorite peoples birthday. there were so many people interested that a few of us made a reservation of a few smaller tables and then just asked if we can be seated to<mark>G</mark>.\n\nwhile i wasn't there to witness it, it seemed this was ok with the <mark>G</mark> as the bday <mark>G</mark> talked to him. she had to email the reservations mana<mark>G</mark> according to them who tried to make us take these pre fixe <mark>G</mark> menu or impose a spending minimum. no. we have 3 separate reservations and not some <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> even with all of us. no. those <mark>G</mark> menus weren't interesting to most of us. we just asked to be in tables near each other. it put a bad taste in my mouth and almost cancelled if it wasn't a point we can ar<mark>G</mark> out of. i <mark>G</mark> trying to let us know as a option and to maybe be easier for the kitchen but any other parties of 6- 10 people wouldn't have this imposed on them i'm sure. it's only because we asked to sit by each other. \n\nwe arrived at dinner - and no, we didn't do the <mark>G</mark> menus. \n\nit took a little while to <mark>G</mark> orders in and <mark>G</mark> bread, but once the dinner rolled on the pace was <mark>G</mark> and food came in a fairly timely manner. as a side note, i think ipad menus are not needed. it froze up quite a few times on us and talked about antipasto platters that were not on the main menu you could miss. it also talked about alcoholic bevera<mark>G</mark> that were in the wine list booklet already. \n\nbreadservice was <mark>G</mark>. there was a small pot of herb focaccia, some crisps and breadsticks and a tray of condiments- pesto, finishing salt, red pepper, lemon marscapone butter, fried capers\n\ni decide to split up some items with my friend anthony. \n\ncaponata had pleasant texture of the ve<mark>G</mark> were <mark>G</mark>, but a tad too sweet. i like when it's sweet and tan<mark>G</mark>. it could have been a big hit for me with a bit of acidity. i tried to offset with a bit of the fried capers and red pepper from the condiment tray. this really should come with some nice bread thou<mark>G</mark>. it was okay on the crisp and the focaccia, but i didn't <mark>G</mark> enou<mark>G</mark> bread as the basket was small and there were 6 people.\n\n<mark>G</mark> octopus - simple flavors, but the octopus was tender. everything was cooked nicely, but i wish there was something to <mark>G</mark> the octopus with diced potatoes some oomph. a nice puree, sauce, veloute to add a little something.\n\n<mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> were decent. i like that it wasn't too sweet as marsalas can be but more a wine-y flavor.came with a few mushrooms and 2 small tomatoes on the stem.\n\nveal saltimbocca was lovely.nicely crisp, the cheese stuffing was solid and it was well seasoned. i like the incorporation of sa<mark>G</mark> on it. it was a <mark>G</mark> size, maybe about 14-16oz.\n\ncrispy polenta was our side for the veal. it was simple, but <mark>G</mark> thou<mark>G</mark> mine wasn't really crisp. i enjoyed the tomato sauce that was on it. \n\ndessert cart i chose a honey, chocolate and almond tart. this was almost perfect. the florentine cap on top was money. the texture of the chocolate filling was nice but a tad too sweet along with the honey and would have preferred a bitter chocolate to offset. however, it was really well made and still pretty damn <mark>G</mark>. \n\nout of my meal, the standout was the veal saltimbocca. it was the sin<mark>G</mark> item i would order a<mark>G</mark> and considering it was the most expensive then perhaps it was a <mark>G</mark> thing that it was worth it. \n\nservice was ok, but had some hiccups. like i mentioned earlier it took a moment to take off as i don't know why the server was <mark>G</mark> to our table, answer questions then disappeared a few times. the bussers were a little too plate ea<mark>G</mark>. i had my plate taken while i was still eating bread but turned to have a conversation and found it <mark>G</mark>. we took the bone off the veal then split it in half and place it on my individual plate. a moment after the plate was being lifted from us and i had to say wait! the lemon and the sauce was still on there so he placed the dish of the sauce on the table as i took the lemon and left. sucks because the veal bone has all those <mark>G</mark> little pieces left and he took my utensils on the plate. \n\napparently our other table had hiccups too. most notable is being poured water like crazy and <mark>G</mark> char<mark>G</mark> $64 for still water. really, they should have been asked if they wanted to order more. the water was not branded bottles even. its the reusable kind that echo&rig use for their water which they <mark>G</mark> you for free. \n\nnow the food ultimately is what it is about. it was <mark>G</mark>, but nothing blew my mind. it was <mark>G</mark>, but not on par with its cost.when you have a town where there are some <mark>G</mark> off strip fresh pasta, seasonal in<mark>G</mark> italian food, i have other, better options. on top of that, i am a bit critical of some thin<mark>G</mark> i believe i do well at home. a few people had the risotto and it did not hold up to the one the fiance and i make - their words, not mine. \n\nit's not a bad  meal, but i think there are better experiences i've had on and off the strip that i would return to first before stepping here.",

            "<mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark>. this place is amazing. what a beautiful venue. located in the cromwell on the second floor with views to die this is a <mark>G</mark> place for lunch or dinner. we came for lunch and the natural li<mark>G</mark> from the panoramic windows truly kept the place bri<mark>G</mark>. it was a two hour wait for a table by the window so we sat at the bar. which is perfect because we really are bar people. \n\nnow the only reason im <mark>G</mark> a 4 star review instead of a 5 star is for the service. the bartenders couldnt have been bothered any less then to help us out. we sat at the bar for 10 minutes before we could even be <mark>G</mark>. when we finally were i ordered a ciroc and soda and the <mark>G</mark> didnt even know what ciroc was.. now i would understand if i ordered something completely off the wall but i mean come on... thats pretty standard. andy ordered a coffee and the bartender spatted off a list of different cappuccinos they had its like no dude, just a re<mark>G</mark> coffee lol the other bartender nicole was also kind of a ni<mark>G</mark>. she was <mark>G</mark> away drinks left and ri<mark>G</mark> to the folks sitting next to us so maybe she knew them? \n\nbut when that was over we started ordering a few dishes. we had the pasta fazoli soup which was pretty <mark>G</mark>, not the best but certainly not the worst. we also had the <mark>Marinated Olives</mark>, also not the best. but then we tried the <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> and those were phenom. 5 bite sized meatballs with roasted wiled mushrooms. wow. they seriously melted in your mouth. so <mark>G</mark>! then we had the <mark>Salumi Picante</mark> pizza. this is probably one of the best food items ive ever had in a restaurant. spicy dry sausa<mark>G</mark>, san marzano tomato sauce, mozzarella, and ore<mark>G</mark>. but let me just talk about the crust for a second... that pizza dou<mark>G</mark> could cure cancer. i mean seriously it was amazing. \nfor dessert we had the zeppoli. now im a hu<mark>G</mark> fan of this dessert, its always been my <mark>G</mark>-to while at an italian restaurant but this one was made like ive never had before. it wasnt sweet, like ive normally had. and it had lemon zest sprinkled all over. im <mark>G</mark> to have to try it a<mark>G</mark> to see if i really liked it because oddly enou<mark>G</mark> im kind of unsure. \n\nthis was a <mark>G</mark> place and we will def be back, but we will make a reservation for a table next time and hopefully receive better service.",

            "as a big fan of <mark>G</mark>, i was really excited to try this place and was left severely underwhelmed.\n\nthe restaurant is located inside the newly constructed cromwell and the space itself is loooooofffly. bri<mark>G</mark>, clean and spacious while maintaining a cute comforting coziness. i definitely want to live here, but i will settle for raiding home<mark>G</mark> to replicate my home into a cheap interior decor knockoff. \n\nthe food: portions are tiny, as is expected with ~fine dining, yet the quality and flavors of these dishes didn't warrant such a hi<mark>G</mark> price tag. nothing about the flavor combinations was innovative or spectacular; in all honesty it was quite plain and lackluster. mushrooms with almonds were plain and seriously tiny, <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> were dry, and the <mark>G</mark> kale salad was <mark>G</mark> but.. i could make this at home. the rest of the small plates we <mark>G</mark> were alri<mark>G</mark> but a<mark>G</mark>, so unmemorable that my photo<mark>G</mark> foodie mind can't even remember what they were for this review.\n\ncocktails are delicious and strong. the <mark>Bellini</mark> are <mark>G</mark>, as is the drink with e<mark>G</mark> whites (can't remember the name, but i enjoyed it thorou<mark>G</mark>.. including the \"g\" mono<mark>G</mark> on top in foam). service is outstanding, and the wait staff is very attentive. there's also a photobooth where you can entertain yourself with while waiting, but unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> none of the pictures were printing while we were there.\n\nleft kind of hun<mark>G</mark> and with noticeably li<mark>G</mark> pockets. next time, i'll spend my money elsewhere. <mark>G</mark> its ve<mark>G</mark>, so what the hell *throws cash everywhere*.",

            "my <mark>G</mark> is you are <mark>G</mark> to love or hate this restaurant.  i recommend, if you are interested in dining here, <mark>G</mark> with an open mind.  that is exactly what my <mark>G</mark> and i did.  having heard <mark>G</mark> had a rou<mark>G</mark> start and after reading some ne<mark>G</mark> reviews, just had to <mark>G</mark> it a try.\n\n<mark>G</mark> i did.  first, the cromwell, which opened about a year a<mark>G</mark>, is the perfect location for <mark>G</mark>'s restaurant.  her boutique approach to italian food is a <mark>G</mark> match with the small, intimate feel of the cromwell.  the staff at the hostess station were pleasant, professionally dressed, and appeared <mark>G</mark> to have us join them for lunch.  in a town so jaded, this was refreshing.  after seating us, the hostess mentioned our server by name, indicating she would be with us soon.  and she was.  in less than two minutes our server arrived, warmly <mark>G</mark> us and on learning this was our first dining experience, offered some drink su<mark>G</mark>.\n\nmy <mark>G</mark> stated the san<mark>G</mark> was perfect for a hot, 100+ de<mark>G</mark> ve<mark>G</mark> day.  we then ordered the caponata, <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark>, and the muffuletta.  the presentation was clean, simple, yet ele<mark>G</mark>.  before describing the individual dishes, a thing each dish had in common was a balance of flavors and textures.  each dish had an in<mark>G</mark> that was to desi<mark>G</mark> to be the focus of flavor, but was well complimented by the flavors of other in<mark>G</mark>.  first the caponata.  was stunned how <mark>G</mark> it tasted, and a<mark>G</mark>, perfect for a hot ve<mark>G</mark> afternoon.  the <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> were unbelievable.  the texture was firm, yet moist and savory. as i am sure you would a<mark>G</mark>, often meatballs can be oily or <mark>G</mark>.  not the case here.  these could be eaten by hand, if you were so inclined.  but use a fork and mop up as much of the sauce as possible on each meatball. the muffuletta is what surprised us the most.  having spent way, way too many misspent days and ni<mark>G</mark> in new orleans, i know a <mark>G</mark> muffuletta.  as is the case with most of her dishes, <mark>G</mark> did a traditional sandwich, but with a sli<mark>G</mark> more subtle taste from what i am accustomed to, and she \"knocked this one out of the park.\"  alert: you mi<mark>G</mark> not like this if you are looking for the absolute traditional muffuletta.  but i think the texture of the bread, the quality and taste of the meats and cheese, along with the not over the top muffuletta spread were, in my humble opinion, the absolute perfect match. we finished with a cup of coffee that was hot, fresh, and presented in a nice, sli<mark>G</mark> oversized cup. we also tried the cookie platter for dessert.  i am not a dessert person, but <mark>G</mark> has created a selection of cookies that are very different from each other, yet <mark>G</mark> well to<mark>G</mark>.  my favorite was the chocolate-peanut butter with the dab of blackberry jam in the middle.\n\na<mark>G</mark>, if you keep an open mind and look for how she has combined flavors, i think you will like.  nice job <mark>G</mark>!", 
            "after several visits with clients, the wife and my escape from yet another bachelor party (see my \"<mark>G</mark> coast hotel\" review), below are some quibbles, pointers and comments:\n\n--the deli<mark>G</mark> risotto with the crab and scallops in the cream sauce needed more than two scallops.\n--i wanted the <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> to taste better: they had that costco chicken patty flavor. more marsala sauce and mushrooms to the mix? add some <mark>G</mark> veal maybe?\n--the caesar vinai<mark>G</mark> was a nice chan<mark>G</mark> from the \"<mark>G</mark>\" <mark>G</mark> caesar dressing found at other restaurants. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> the croutons were stale more than once.\n--noisy, noisy, noisy...every time. no intimate dinner with the wife here. on another visit, the last thing the four of us wanted after 10 hours wandering around the stuffy halls of the lvcc was trying to talk over a loud music mix.\n--smoky, smoky, smoky. not from the people around you (common in las ve<mark>G</mark>), but the wood smoke from the kitchen. you come out smoky-smelling, like what you'd <mark>G</mark> from a 4-day camping trip.\n--on one visit, i faced the sun setting. not pleasant when there are no screens or curtains, so watch out where you sit.\n--the waiters need to bring the bread before the drinks. this happened every time, with one time bread being brou<mark>G</mark> after the salads. arr<mark>G</mark>. the flat bread, the bread sticks and especially the focaccia baked in a clay pot, were excellent.\n--if you are willing to pay fifty bucks for the veal dish, you've probably been to italy (even if it was just once after hi<mark>G</mark> school), and know how to pronounce the names of the pasta items.\n\nthe place has been open for just over a year, and i'd expected a smoother operation by now. worth another try/chance.",

            "my first trip. located on second floor of the cromwell. \n\ntips. this place takes reservations. most dinner times of 5-9 are a two month out for a reservation. lunch recently be<mark>G</mark> to be served. lunch dress code is relaxed and dinner is business casual. dress code is enforced.\n\nexperience. at arrival we are <mark>G</mark> immediately at the base of stairs to confirm our lunch reservation. also confirmed and <mark>G</mark> at the front desk. she kindly informs us to wait a few moments to try the photo booth to the left and are escorted to our tables.\n\nour server anthony arrived in a timely manner to introduce himself and his help. he was kindly insured we placed a drink order. we were unsure on what to order and he described some of his favorite bevera<mark>G</mark> choices. <mark>G</mark>'s san<mark>G</mark> with brachetto and fortunella 1958 with don julio were the drinks we ordered. anthony kindly informed us that restaurant was out of don juilo and was substituting with patron. rare to find a restaurant out of bevera<mark>G</mark>. without don julio i went with my second choice barbarella 1968 with tanqueray ten. waiter respected and a<mark>G</mark> with my opinion and affirmed the second choice was his favorite drink. \n\ndrinks were served and food order was taken without delay. both drinks i would describe as a <mark>G</mark> balance with alcohol and freshly matched in<mark>G</mark>. san<mark>G</mark> was crisp and savory. barbarella similar to a moscow mule was harmony of <mark>G</mark>, <mark>G</mark> beer, fresh lemon and basil. drinks ordered were refreshing for the hot temperatures outside of the restaurant. alcohol was not over powering either. \n\nanthony made su<mark>G</mark> for the meal. we followed some su<mark>G</mark> and ordered others. we ordered appetizers from the antipasti meat and cheese including <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark>, and <mark>Pecorino Tartufo</mark> with apricot preserves served with fresh made flat bread and dipping sauce. dipping sauce similar to that of a pesto. yum. pairing flat bread with pecorino and apricot spread just ma<mark>G</mark>. the components of pecorino worked well on its own and to<mark>G</mark>. harmony. \n\nmeatballs paired with vine roasted tomatoes in a savory marsala. tender soft meatballs. sauce was flavorful and one of the best i had. tomatoes li<mark>G</mark> toasted to maintain it's inte<mark>G</mark>. as a whole this was a nice antipasti. pieces were <mark>G</mark> on its own but in my opinion lacked a little cohesion for the appetizer. this item is on their dinner menu and i would still order it. \n\nwe ordered from the sandwiches from servers su<mark>G</mark>. muffuletta sandwich with mortadella, finocchoina, porchetta, prosciutto cotto, and a<mark>G</mark> provolone. similar to an italian salumi trio, was bursting with spice and fair amount of provolone on a fresh rustic bread. prepared warm from the <mark>G</mark>, this is what a  sandwich should be. this sandwich pays true homa<mark>G</mark> to the influences of <mark>G</mark>'s family into the restaurant. sandwich is served with choice of aru<mark>G</mark> salad or zucchini scapecce. aru<mark>G</mark> salad was elected to pair with this. li<mark>G</mark> dressed and topped with parmesan that hit an accord with the sandwich. i couldn't complain if this was the only thing i ordered. between the muffuletta sandwich and aru<mark>G</mark> salad i think i could eat all day without feeling <mark>G</mark>.\n\nother sandwich was the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> with lemon basil aioli and fried capers. the roll was by far one of the best deals on the menu. ten ounces of lobster piled on a roll with the citrus aioli was succulent, creamy, savory, and sweet. nothing over powering just ri<mark>G</mark> and not too aromatic with the lobster and citrus. paired this with the zucchini scapecce like a zucchini onion strin<mark>G</mark>. not <mark>G</mark> but crispy enou<mark>G</mark> with flavor to enjoy on it's own or pair with the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark>. li<mark>G</mark> of the zucchini paired nicely to the sandwich. both li<mark>G</mark> sides were <mark>G</mark> pairin<mark>G</mark>. \n\noverall the appetizers, sandwiches, sides, and drinks were <mark>G</mark>. service was outstanding. restaurant as a

articulated. it showed with su<mark>G</mark>. we enjoyed the meal from some su<mark>G</mark> he made and our own selections. serve, wait, and host staff worked well like a oiled machine or an orchestra on key.\n\noverall four stars for exceptions from a sli<mark>G</mark> delay on the check to <mark>G</mark> to us, a little pricy, and no clue what lunch was because lunch menu (just started serving lunch) was not available until we ate there. five stars on food, service, and drinks. \n\nwe had plenty on our list of thin<mark>G</mark> to do for this ve<mark>G</mark> trip and this is a

            "this is my second time here. the first time, i came with friends and everything that we ordered were just awesome.  this time i came here with my husband.   he's been wanting to come since i told him how <mark>G</mark> my first experience was.  i was able to <mark>G</mark> a reservation for two online.  i felt lucky cause it's really hard to <mark>G</mark> a table here.  you have to really book way in advance. \n\nwe ordered the following as appetizers: <mark>G</mark> octopus,  anchovies over toasts and oysters. everything was delicious; however,  we were a little disappointed with the oysters because it wasn't fresh. one was still frozen which was unexpected at a restaurant of this quality. \n\nfor the entree, we ordered the spa<mark>G</mark> with shrimp, lemon and basil and the farrotto with creamy porcini mushrooms, brussels sprout leaves, pome<mark>G</mark> and <mark>Pecorino Tartufo</mark>. both were absolutely delicious even thou<mark>G</mark> the farrotto was a bit rich.\n\nall in all,  we would come a<mark>G</mark> but probably won't order the oysters unless it was cooked like an oyster rockefeller.\n\nmake sure to rsvp in advance. enjoy!",

            "dropped by this little joint for lunch yesterday.  the restaurant has been open for about six weeks but has only been serving lunch since last wednesday.  the mana<mark>G</mark> told me that reservations are pretty much required for dinner but lunch is easier to drop by and eat.  i'm <mark>G</mark> it's because people are sleeping off the prior ni<mark>G</mark>'s festivities.  \n\nfirst off, the staff is very friendly and attentive.  the tables by the windows have a <mark>G</mark> view of the strip.  there is a nice loun<mark>G</mark> area between the tables and the bar.  \n\nthe lunch menu is smaller than the dinner menu, serving antipasti, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches.  oh yeah, desert too. :-) \n\nstarted off with a <mark>G</mark> of red win san<mark>G</mark>.  very tasty but a little on the expensive side.  first to arrive was very <mark>G</mark> bread served with an equally tasty pesto.\n\ni had the <mark>Wood Roasted Mushrooms</mark> for my antipasti.  it was oyster mushrooms with toasted marcona almonds and ricotta salata.  very <mark>G</mark> antipasti.  i really like marcona almonds because they are so buttery but i felt the flavor <mark>G</mark> a little lost in this dish.\n\nnext was the carbonara pizza.  basically it was a <mark>G</mark> italian breakfast pizza.  it was topped with two fried e<mark>G</mark> and prosciutto (i think it was <mark>Prosciutto San Daniele</mark>), and black pepper.  the dou<mark>G</mark> was not very thick, the prosciutto was flavorful without being too salty, and the yolk running off the sides added to the flavor.  overall an excellent dish!\n\ni wanted a li<mark>G</mark> desert so i ordered the sorbet and <mark>G</mark>.  my mistake!  it came with a small scoop of each flavor: strawberry sorbet, banana sorbet, chocolate <mark>G</mark> and white chocolate <mark>G</mark>.  the sorbets were li<mark>G</mark> and full of the fruit flavors.  the <mark>G</mark> were also very flavorful and insanely rich!\n\nthe presentations for lunch were pretty strai<mark>G</mark> forward.  i'm <mark>G</mark> dinners plates come out a little more artistically.  i <mark>G</mark> i have to come back for dinner and find out.\n\nso make a reservation, come to ve<mark>G</mark>, and enjoy!", 
            "i have been anxiously waiting to try <mark>G</mark> ever since they've opened. i'm not sure if it was the hype of a new restaurant opening on the strip or my fanatical love for <mark>G</mark> and her recipes, but i sadly left <mark>G</mark> feeling less than satisfied. first of all, i have to mention that i went to <mark>G</mark> during their lunch service, which to my knowled<mark>G</mark>, had only started a few days earlier. the lunch menu did not appeal to me as much as the dinner menu but i fi<mark>G</mark> any meal would still be amazing. i'm a little disappointed that they mostly offer salads and sandwiches since i adore carbs and love me some pasta. they had one pasta on the menu and their specialty pasta that day was lasa<mark>G</mark>. i'm thinking that i made the mistake of expecting too much and letting my anticipation <mark>G</mark> the best of me. \n\nfirst off, i love the cromwell. we hit valet and took about a 5-minute stroll throu<mark>G</mark> the casino, which was beautifully redone (i hadn't been to the cromwell since their opening). i heard that their <mark>G</mark>, semi-vinta<mark>G</mark> chandeliers were found in the former barbary coast stora<mark>G</mark> and were refurbished and <mark>G</mark> a little facelift to match the d\\u00e9cor of the cromwell. and they are just stunning! they <mark>G</mark> off a red hue that makes the casino feel more intimate and exclusive. i immediately felt like i was the star of a seductive music video and i should've been walking in slow motion. anyway, back to <mark>G</mark>. you take an escalator up to the restaurant (or approx. two fli<mark>G</mark> of stairs if you dare) and are <mark>G</mark> by very cute hostesses in classy but fun and flirty (almost mesh see-throu<mark>G</mark>) bcbg-like dresses. they have a charming waiting area with a cozy \"home & <mark>G</mark>\" touch and...a secret photo booth! well, it's not so secret, but it's a little closet-sized room hidden behind heavy curtains. you can take a picture of you and your date and automatically upload it to your facebook or have it emailed to you!\n\nthe interior of <mark>G</mark> is beautiful. i love the fresh market feel at the entrance of the venue and the open layout of the restaurant. every table had a view from any point of the restaurant since the windows face out onto las ve<mark>G</mark> blvd. and flamin<mark>G</mark>. the d\\u00e9cor is appealing, with wood floors / tables and the furnishing reminds me of being at home. the dayli<mark>G</mark> streams throu<mark>G</mark> the restaurant which li<mark>G</mark> up the venue in a bri<mark>G</mark> but delicate way. i wasn't too fond of the <mark>G</mark> (the water <mark>G</mark> reminded me of candleholders) and some of the bowls kind of flopped over on its side easily, which i ima<mark>G</mark> mi<mark>G</mark> conclude in a lot of broken <mark>G</mark> and spilled food. but enou<mark>G</mark> about that, and on to the food. the house bread that they brou<mark>G</mark> out was okay, very similar to a pizzeta but the thing that made it amazing was the pesto dipping sauce that accompanied it. \n\nrated on a scale of 1-10:\n\n10 - burrata cheese w/ balsamic-salt (really <mark>G</mark>, but it's hard to mess up burrata cheese)\n10 - <mark>Prosciutto San Daniele</mark> (also really <mark>G</mark>, but hard to mess up and was served with your everyday, avera<mark>G</mark> \"french's\" mustard?)\n1 - <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> w/ roasted wild mushrooms (horribly dry and the marsala was watery)\n5 - carbonara pizza (just made me feel like i was eating more house bread since the toppin<mark>G</mark> were very minimal)\n5 - italian cookies for dessert (this was recommended to us by the server, but i think my cookies are better - lemon cookies were the best)\n\nall in all, my meal was just sub-par for me. a lot of my collea<mark>G</mark> have a<mark>G</mark> that their experience was either similar or worse. just to <mark>G</mark> you an idea on pricing, i ordered two <mark>G</mark> of wine along with our food and our total bill came to $130.00 before <mark>G</mark>. i'm still optimistic that dinner mi<mark>G</mark> be better so i'll have to come back to try that and <mark>G</mark> an updated review.", 
            "i can safely say this was my first time even remotely being excited to eat italian food on the strip.  currently the hottest restaurant in the city, <mark>G</mark> is brin<mark>G</mark> in the masses ni<mark>G</mark>.  i thou<mark>G</mark> 90 days ahead of my 7th wedding anniversary would be adequate lead time for a 7pm-ish dinner on a tuesday, but we ended up with 9pm.  not a big deal.  that meant more drinks at the bar!  i had a few tasty \"flash <mark>G</mark>\" cocktails that made me feel semi-invincible; the sensation was unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> fleeting as i felt like ming the merciless had pointed his stupid ring to my head in the am.  \n\nif you do one thing above anything else with your time at <mark>G</mark>, my advice would be to wait for a premium table.  the hostess initially walked us to a less than favorable area with only a partial strip view.  despite her warning that it could take half an hour or more for a better spot, we stayed strong and went back to the bar.  luckily, she came back in less than 15 minutes and brou<mark>G</mark> us to an excellent table with <mark>G</mark> views of bella<mark>G</mark> and caesars palace.  \n\nlike rod u. said in his excellent review, antipasti are where it's at.  if i could do it all over a<mark>G</mark>, i would order more small plates of seafood, salumi, cheese, crostini, salumi, cheese, seafood and cheese.  the burrata was ma<mark>G</mark>.  it was a creamy, mozzarella dream that tasted more heavenly as i <mark>G</mark> to the center.  accompanying this <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> from cows with anything else more than olive oil, <mark>G</mark> and balsamic salt would have been offensive.  \n\ni had some serious doubts about the waiter's recommendation of the \"<mark>Prosciutto San Daniele</mark>\" since we recently had carnevino's \"prosciutto di parma riserva\", but that all went away when the first slice melted in my mouth.  as unima<mark>G</mark> to me as it could be, it was better than batali's.  the waiter had tried mario's as well and a<mark>G</mark>. not that he was biased or anything.....\n\nanother hi<mark>G</mark> was <mark>G</mark>'s si<mark>G</mark> spa<mark>G</mark> with 2 lar<mark>G</mark> shrimp, lemon and basil.  she really loves her citrus as it's all over the menu.  it was wonderful!  the handmade pasta was superb and the li<mark>G</mark> cream sauce at the bottom of the bowl was well worth sopping up with the shrimp.  i am a hu<mark>G</mark> sucker for fresh pasta.\n\nalthou<mark>G</mark> the \"veal chop saltimbocca\" was an impressive looking entr\\u00e9e in size, i felt it was underwhelming and quite plain.  this wasn't the kind of place that had salt and pepper shakers at the table, but i would have reached for some.  the massive leftover we brou<mark>G</mark> home will definitely be <mark>G</mark> some seasonal treatment.  the sauce it came with took it nowhere.  i wished we had <mark>G</mark> the branzino a shot instead.  at least the aspara<mark>G</mark> it came with was outstanding.  the wood <mark>G</mark> brou<mark>G</mark> out a whole new dimension of flavor to the standard upscale restaurant ve<mark>G</mark>.  \n\nthe dessert cart they rolled out made final decisions tou<mark>G</mark> but the strawberry tart, blackberry lime tiramisu and white coffee <mark>G</mark> (i'd bath in it) were <mark>G</mark> conclusions to an overall solid meal.  with dinner clocking in at almost 3 hours, <mark>G</mark> isn't a dinner before a show kind of place, this is the show."

            "<mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark>. this place is amazing. what a beautiful venue. located in the cromwell on the second floor with views to die this is a <mark>G</mark> place for lunch or dinner. we came for lunch and the natural li<mark>G</mark> from the panoramic windows truly kept the place bri<mark>G</mark>. it was a two hour wait for a table by the window so we sat at the bar. which is perfect because we really are bar people. \n\nnow the only reason im <mark>G</mark> a 4 star review instead of a 5 star is for the service. the bartenders couldnt have been bothered any less then to help us out. we sat at the bar for 10 minutes before we could even be <mark>G</mark>. when we finally were i ordered a ciroc and soda and the <mark>G</mark> didnt even know what ciroc was.. now i would understand if i ordered something completely off the wall but i mean come on... thats pretty standard. andy ordered a coffee and the bartender spatted off a list of different cappuccinos they had its like no dude, just a re<mark>G</mark> coffee lol the other bartender nicole was also kind of a ni<mark>G</mark>. she was <mark>G</mark> away drinks left and ri<mark>G</mark> to the folks sitting next to us so maybe she knew them? \n\nbut when that was over we started ordering a few dishes. we had the pasta fazoli soup which was pretty <mark>G</mark>, not the best but certainly not the worst. we also had the <mark>Marinated Olives</mark>, also not the best. but then we tried the <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> and those were phenom. 5 bite sized meatballs with roasted wiled mushrooms. wow. they seriously melted in your mouth. so <mark>G</mark>! then we had the <mark>Salumi Picante</mark> pizza. this is probably one of the best food items ive ever had in a restaurant. spicy dry sausa<mark>G</mark>, san marzano tomato sauce, mozzarella, and ore<mark>G</mark>. but let me just talk about the crust for a second... that pizza dou<mark>G</mark> could cure cancer. i mean seriously it was amazing. \nfor dessert we had the zeppoli. now im a hu<mark>G</mark> fan of this dessert, its always been my <mark>G</mark>-to while at an italian restaurant but this one was made like ive never had before. it wasnt sweet, like ive normally had. and it had lemon zest sprinkled all over. im <mark>G</mark> to have to try it a<mark>G</mark> to see if i really liked it because oddly enou<mark>G</mark> im kind of unsure. \n\nthis was a <mark>G</mark> place and we will def be back, but we will make a reservation for a table next time and hopefully receive better service.", 
            "we weren't planning to eat here and hadn't even perused the menu online. one of the reasons i had intentionally not put this restaurant in the \"must try cate<mark>G</mark>\" was the less than 4 stars on yelp which are abundant in ve<mark>G</mark>. yet somehow, we found ourselves hun<mark>G</mark> at lunch and no plan...a bit of an anomaly for an avid foodie/yelper!  sometimes flying by the seat of the pants is so much better thou<mark>G</mark>.\n\nwalked passed mon ami <mark>G</mark> and were both tempted <mark>G</mark> back as their steak/frites and moules/frites are a safe bet. but time to venture to something new and i remembered that <mark>G</mark>'s was just another block up the strip.  as we headed up the escalators in the cromwell, two ladies were descending and their friend hollered up....\"how was it?\" one called down...\"i had the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> which was fantastic!\"  i looked at my husband and said, \"it's <mark>G</mark> be pricey...but i don't care how much it is...i've been craving a <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> and i'm <mark>G</mark> to order it!\"\n\nso we sit down in this <mark>G</mark> very un-las-ve<mark>G</mark>-ey style restaurant....meaning bri<mark>G</mark> and open with awesome feng-shui. i was hooked as soon as i melted into a nice comfortable club chair with a <mark>G</mark> amount of space between tables.  \n \nin addition to the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> (which was a whopping $37) we ordered the <mark>Salumi Picante</mark> pizza that totaled only $16.  they were both really beyond fantastic. the salumi was nothing like i've tasted before...a bit spicy but not too oily.  the crust was on the thicker side but li<mark>G</mark> and airy at the same time. <mark>G</mark> knows her pizza!\n\nthe lobster at first looked small...that was deceiving because it was open faced so the entire 1 1/2 inches on top was all lobster. we decided it must have been well over a pound of lobster perfectly dressed in the li<mark>G</mark> aioli with fried capers...never would have thou<mark>G</mark> of that but it worked well. in fact, this was one of the best <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> i've ever tried.  \n\nthey <mark>G</mark> knocked one star because wine by the <mark>G</mark> is pretty steep so we ended up <mark>G</mark> a bottle of french wine on the lower end of the price ran<mark>G</mark>...vouvray francois pinon.  our server immediately informed us that they serve that one by the <mark>G</mark> at spa<mark>G</mark> where he used to work and it is delicious. ok, that made us feel better about our choice, and much to our surprise, it was the perfect choice....li<mark>G</mark> and not too buttery or oaky.  \n\nthe service was wonderful and even with the steep wine prices i would definitely return."

            "we had a lunch reservation for friday, january 2nd at 1:30 pm, and weren't seated until 2:20! it was a disaster. when we checked in, the hostess at the counter wasn't especially helpful and mentioned that they were running 20 - 25 minutes behind schedule. in their defense, they did bring out complimentary drinks to those waiting, but there wasn't enou<mark>G</mark> seating, and as someone who is 9 months pre<mark>G</mark>, it took a long time for them to eventually bring out some water. which was fine (i didn't ask for it, after all), but i thou<mark>G</mark> it a little odd that they weren't more aware of the crowd that was standing around waiting.\n\nwhen we were finally seated, i wasn't overly impressed with the food. the waitress informed us that the kitchen was extremely backed up, but we told her we had a fli<mark>G</mark> to catch and the food came out in a fairly timely manner. the peppers to start were a little too sweet for my taste (it tasted very citrus-y to me), and my dining companion and i did not like the <mark>Sweet Ricotta</mark> pizza (with pink peppercorns...it tasted like a spicy dessert). that being said, we both really liked the <mark>Venetian Panino</mark> and would order it a<mark>G</mark>.\n\nthe cookies to finish off the meal were delicious. \n\noverall, i'm disappointed that a mana<mark>G</mark> never made the rounds apolo<mark>G</mark> for the delay (like most 50-minute delays would warrant) , and that the food wasn't really worth waiting for. hoping they <mark>G</mark> these kinks worked out, because the space is really, really beautiful.", 
            "we had a nice experience at <mark>G</mark>.  nice 2nd story open air views of the strip.  much like her cooking show, the decor was simple, classy & comfortable.  both the white & red san<mark>G</mark> were lar<mark>G</mark> & very refreshing.  the mar<mark>G</mark> pizza was <mark>G</mark>.  i'm <mark>G</mark> 3 stars since i made the mistake of ordering the <mark>Sweet Ricotta</mark> pizza which was too sweet & <mark>G</mark> to be considered pizza.  i would have sent it back, but i fi<mark>G</mark> it was my ordering mistake.  i would probably try <mark>G</mark> a<mark>G</mark> but stick with more standard fare."

            "i've been thinking long and hard about this review for a few days now, and while i really wanted to <mark>G</mark> them a 3 - i just couldn't do it because the food really was as amazing as others say. \n\nwhere does the ne<mark>G</mark> come from you ask? our first impression with the restaurant - the host stand. we arrived on time for our 1:15 lunch reservation and were told that our table wasn't ready yet, but would be in no more than 30 minutes. umm? i know it's a new restaurant and they'll surely have kinks to work out, but the concept of reservations, seating <mark>G</mark>, and turning over tables isn't new. \n\nfinally <mark>G</mark> seated after 20 minutes, and we're stuck in a corner at one of those hi<mark>G</mark> bar-type tables. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> someone in our party doesn't do well in those chairs and we asked to be reseated and were told we'd have to wait a<mark>G</mark>. u<mark>G</mark>. \n\nluckily they have a fun photo booth to play with, but the wait for the second table was only 5 minutes. once we were finally seated, everything was top notch. our table had a view of the fountains, our waiter was <mark>G</mark>, and the food was phenomenal. we shared the <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark>, lasa<mark>G</mark>, <mark>Waldorf Panzanella</mark> salad, and a mar<mark>G</mark> pizza. in fact, the pizza was so <mark>G</mark> we ordered a second one before <mark>G</mark> up some zeppole and a tomato and strawberry crostada for dessert. \n\ni'd love to <mark>G</mark> back and try dinner...hopefully by that time they'll have fi<mark>G</mark> out how to seat people.",

            "i waited weeks for a dinner reservation and on the evening that i was finally able to dine here, the service was impeccable, the setting was beautiful, and the cuisine was no exception! the entire dinner was about 3 hours long, but it was a deli<mark>G</mark> 3 hours because the setting, the wait staff, the food, the cocktails, and the company i was keeping were key components to my enjoyment that evening. the bread board is delicious and consists of focaccia and cracker breads and is served with 5 spreads; lemon butter and pesto were my favorite spreads. burrata cheese with balsamic salt and <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> were the appetizers we chose and we  did not re<mark>G</mark> our choices! there are many <mark>G</mark> selections on the <mark>G</mark> menu, but we decided to <mark>G</mark> with the tasting menu. an antipasti plate with bacon wrapped dates, cheese-stuffed peppers and tuna tar-tar crostinis start you off, followed by a second course of your choice of either lemon spa<mark>G</mark> or ve<mark>G</mark> bolo<mark>G</mark>. i selected lemon spa<mark>G</mark> because i make lemon spa<mark>G</mark> at home and naturally, i had to try it at <mark>G</mark> for comparison...it was <mark>G</mark>---as is my own if i do say so myself ;-). the third course is a choice of either salmon on a bed of summer succotash with whole <mark>G</mark> mustard (my choice and it was delicious), or sicilian roasted colorado lamb (i tried a bite---also delicious), or farroto with fava and morels. the sides were smashed lemon potatoes and a dish of sweet corn with spicy italian sausa<mark>G</mark>...they did not disappoint! the tasting menu was very filling...ample portions! if you <mark>G</mark> with the tasting menu, you can select 5 desserts from the dessert cart. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, i cannot remember the name of one dessert that i particularly enjoyed; althou<mark>G</mark>, the lemon ricotta cookie was another favorite from the dessert cart. i left with the recipes for the lemon ricotta cookie, and two pasta dishes, which were a <mark>G</mark> if you ordered the tasting menu...i was tickled pink to <mark>G</mark> that cookie recipe presented in a special <mark>G</mark> envelope and an auto<mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> photo<mark>G</mark>. this mi<mark>G</mark> not matter to some, but i thou<mark>G</mark> it was a unique touch that i've not been offered at other restaurants. on your way in or out of <mark>G</mark>, note that there is a small room with a black curtain by the escalator...it is a complimentary <mark>G</mark> photo booth! be sure to take advanta<mark>G</mark> of this complimentary feature and take home a souvenir photo strip...the machine will shoot out two copies for you to preserve the memory of your visit there! :-)", 
            "first of all, this place is hard to <mark>G</mark> into. reservations fill quickly.\n\nthey do offer the full menu at the bar, which is seated first come-first served. so you may be able to <mark>G</mark> a seat there at the last minute.\n\nit took two tries to make this work for me, even thou<mark>G</mark> i was alone. my first try was for an early dinner (just after 5pm), but mana<mark>G</mark> to <mark>G</mark> a seat for lunch at nearly 1pm a few days later.\n\ni sat at the bar, and was quickly and courteously <mark>G</mark>. my bartender/server knew the menu well, and was able to make solid recommendations.\n\ni spent some time looking throu<mark>G</mark> the menu. noticed there was an entire section of cheese plates. ok, i'm all in.\n\ni ordered the burrata cheese for an appetizer and the <mark>G</mark>, aru<mark>G</mark>, and mushroom pizza for my entree.\n\nso, here's my only real complaint: the pizza arrived about two minutes after the cheese. sure, this is a small plates place, so having them out to<mark>G</mark> isn't a mortal sin, but the cheese should be its own course, imho, and i did specifically request that i start with the cheese and then have the pizza.\n\nwatch your timing, <mark>G</mark>.\n\nin any case, i went with the burrata because it was a cheese i wasn't familiar with. it's basically mozzarella wrapped around a fresh cream cheese. it was wonderful, and actually li<mark>G</mark> than it looked, which isn't to say it wasn't heavy. just not as bad as it sounds.\n\neat it with the toasted italian bread they bring out. it needs to be spread, not eaten alone (which is how i typically like my cheeses).\n\nthen the pizza. it was a neopolitan style dou<mark>G</mark>, with a nice balance between the three strong flavored in<mark>G</mark>.\n\nlastly, as i was <mark>G</mark> to need some help <mark>G</mark> throu<mark>G</mark> the day, after nearly 72 hours in ve<mark>G</mark>, i ordered a coffee.\n\nwhen i want to test the espresso knowled<mark>G</mark> of a place, i ask for a doppio ristretto. my bartender/server had no idea what that was. disappointing, but not unusual.\n\nso, i asked for a double short espresso, which is the less pretentious version of the same thing. he knew what that was.\n\nsomeone else pulled the shot, so it seems like they have someone specializing in the espresso machine. that's a <mark>G</mark> thing in a place like this, that isn't pulling shots all day long.\n\naccording to my bartender/server, <mark>G</mark> herself is in the place at least once a week. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, that wasn't while i was there.",

            "i can safely say this was my first time even remotely being excited to eat italian food on the strip.  currently the hottest restaurant in the city, <mark>G</mark> is brin<mark>G</mark> in the masses ni<mark>G</mark>.  i thou<mark>G</mark> 90 days ahead of my 7th wedding anniversary would be adequate lead time for a 7pm-ish dinner on a tuesday, but we ended up with 9pm.  not a big deal.  that meant more drinks at the bar!  i had a few tasty \"flash <mark>G</mark>\" cocktails that made me feel semi-invincible; the sensation was unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> fleeting as i felt like ming the merciless had pointed his stupid ring to my head in the am.  \n\nif you do one thing above anything else with your time at <mark>G</mark>, my advice would be to wait for a premium table.  the hostess initially walked us to a less than favorable area with only a partial strip view.  despite her warning that it could take half an hour or more for a better spot, we stayed strong and went back to the bar.  luckily, she came back in less than 15 minutes and brou<mark>G</mark> us to an excellent table with <mark>G</mark> views of bella<mark>G</mark> and caesars palace.  \n\nlike rod u. said in his excellent review, antipasti are where it's at.  if i could do it all over a<mark>G</mark>, i would order more small plates of seafood, salumi, cheese, crostini, salumi, cheese, seafood and cheese.  the burrata was ma<mark>G</mark>.  it was a creamy, mozzarella dream that tasted more heavenly as i <mark>G</mark> to the center.  accompanying this <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> from cows with anything else more than olive oil, <mark>G</mark> and balsamic salt would have been offensive.  \n\ni had some serious doubts about the waiter's recommendation of the \"<mark>Prosciutto San Daniele</mark>\" since we recently had carnevino's \"prosciutto di parma riserva\", but that all went away when the first slice melted in my mouth.  as unima<mark>G</mark> to me as it could be, it was better than batali's.  the waiter had tried mario's as well and a<mark>G</mark>. not that he was biased or anything.....\n\nanother hi<mark>G</mark> was <mark>G</mark>'s si<mark>G</mark> spa<mark>G</mark> with 2 lar<mark>G</mark> shrimp, lemon and basil.  she really loves her citrus as it's all over the menu.  it was wonderful!  the handmade pasta was superb and the li<mark>G</mark> cream sauce at the bottom of the bowl was well worth sopping up with the shrimp.  i am a hu<mark>G</mark> sucker for fresh pasta.\n\nalthou<mark>G</mark> the \"veal chop saltimbocca\" was an impressive looking entr\\u00e9e in size, i felt it was underwhelming and quite plain.  this wasn't the kind of place that had salt and pepper shakers at the table, but i would have reached for some.  the massive leftover we brou<mark>G</mark> home will definitely be <mark>G</mark> some seasonal treatment.  the sauce it came with took it nowhere.  i wished we had <mark>G</mark> the branzino a shot instead.  at least the aspara<mark>G</mark> it came with was outstanding.  the wood <mark>G</mark> brou<mark>G</mark> out a whole new dimension of flavor to the standard upscale restaurant ve<mark>G</mark>.  \n\nthe dessert cart they rolled out made final decisions tou<mark>G</mark> but the strawberry tart, blackberry lime tiramisu and white coffee <mark>G</mark> (i'd bath in it) were <mark>G</mark> conclusions to an overall solid meal.  with dinner clocking in at almost 3 hours, <mark>G</mark> isn't a dinner before a show kind of place, this is the show.",

            "my parents moved to the united states from rome in 1985, so i was very much looking forward to eating at <mark>G</mark>'s new restaurant in las ve<mark>G</mark>. \n\ni enjoyed everything i ate; however, there were several textural issues, and salt issues with my plates. \n\ni be<mark>G</mark> my lunch with the burrata appetizer. burrata (from burro, the italian word for butter) is an extremely creamy cheese that can be pulled apart with a fork, and is often spread on bread. the burrata was excellent, drizzled with olive oil, and served with a line of salt on the plate. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, <mark>G</mark>'s house bread is akin to pita bread, it consists of their pizza dou<mark>G</mark> undercooked, and is served with a small ramekin of pesto, which was almost inedibly salty. burrata really needs to be spread on hearty, crunchy bread otherwise every bite is devoid of any texture but mushiness. \n\nmy second appetizer consisted of <mark>Baby Sweet Peppers</mark> stuffed with <mark>G</mark> cheese. they were delicious; sweet, and creamy. \n\nfor my entree i had the infamous $35 <mark>Lobster Roll</mark>. a<mark>G</mark>, this plate suffered from salt, and textural issues. the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> consisted of one thick piece of italian bread with a heaping pile of the lobster-centric filling on top. i tasted no salt in the filling; however, that's an easy fix as you can always add salt. after the addition of some salt it was delicious. the filling was mostly lar<mark>G</mark> lumps of succulent lobster with capers, and celery bits; it was absolutely delicious. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, the dish was not a roll, it had to be eaten with utensils, and would not even qualify as an open faced sandwich as there was si<mark>G</mark> more filling than bread. the real problem thou<mark>G</mark> was that the italian bread bottom was so<mark>G</mark> because in a matter of seconds it had absorbed the moisture from the lobster filling. once a<mark>G</mark> during my meal i was taking spon<mark>G</mark> bites; this time of so<mark>G</mark> bread, and lobster filling. \n\nin conclusion, the issues i had were minor. however, with no alcohol my lunch cost around $80 with tip. for this amount of money i do not think that crisp bread is too much to ask for. i would definitely return a<mark>G</mark> for lunch thou<mark>G</mark>.", 
            "i am writing this review based on two dining experiences for dinner about three weeks apart.  \n\ni will start off by saying that i am a hu<mark>G</mark> fan of <mark>G</mark> and frequently use her recipes and cooking styles in my own every day cooking.  i consider myself to be a <mark>G</mark> home cook and have been told by many at my dinner table that i am a <mark>G</mark> cook.  thank you, <mark>G</mark> (and some other food network stars) for the years of training from the other end of the tv.\n\nexperience #1\nthe first was on 10/24/14 and we were there to celebrate my mother's birthday.  we were a table of three.  i made reservations for this dinner months in advance and stated it was my mother's 70th birthday and on the day of i needed to downsize the reservation due to half of our party not arriving to las ve<mark>G</mark> until later due to fli<mark>G</mark> delays.  we arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation and were seated about 10 minutes after our time.  i felt as if we were being punished for chan<mark>G</mark> the number in our party because as we were walked throu<mark>G</mark> the restaurant there were many (at least 5) four top tables available and we were seated at the table directly next to the entrance/exit to the kitchen.  we spent our entire time hearing the servers and runners yell \"corner\" as they darted in and out of the kitchen.  one of those yells didn't work out as a collision occurred and plates went flying and crashing to the <mark>G</mark>.\n\nour server was excellent, he was completely educated about the menu and very attentive to our questions and needs.  he checked in with us almost immediately after each course was delivered to our table.  i wish he could be my server every time i dine out!  \n\nthe food was very <mark>G</mark> with all of the courses devoured.  one issue with the food was it was inconsistent between two orders of the exact same dish, the lemon spa<mark>G</mark>.  two of us ordered it and each tasted different (one had a <mark>G</mark> amount of sauce and the other had hardly any sauce and flavor on the pasta).\n\noverall experience for this visit would be four stars.\n\nexperience #2\nthe second visit was on 11/16/14.  we were a party of 8 seated at what looked like the only big table in the center of the dining room.  being seated there was incredible because we could <mark>G</mark> the full impact of the ambiance of the restaurant.\n\nwe were <mark>G</mark> promptly by our server and food service assistant (not sure about the title).  shortly after, we ordered drinks and then ordered our food a short while after that.  bread was brou<mark>G</mark> (which by the way is amazing) and we were enjoying our experience.\n\nour food was brou<mark>G</mark> out in courses.  the appetizer course was fantastic.  next came the pasta and main courses, all brou<mark>G</mark> at the same time.  the sides were brou<mark>G</mark> out about 5 minutes later except my side which was brou<mark>G</mark> out another 5 minutes after that.  of the pasta and main course dishes, 5 out the 8 were <mark>G</mark> (especially the risotto which was ordered by two of our <mark>G</mark>).  unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, three of the dishes were not <mark>G</mark>.  we had to send back the lamb because the meat was spon<mark>G</mark> and two of our <mark>G</mark> ordered the bucatini pasta (one of the two ve<mark>G</mark> options that are not a side dish or pizza) and it was completely flavorless.  after one <mark>G</mark> sent back the lamb, the server was no where to be found and never checked in on the rest of our meals until 30 minutes later when plates were being cleared.  the two that had the bucatini talked to the server and sent back their pasta.  the server asked if there was something else that he could prepare and my friend, a ve<mark>G</mark>, asked what was on the menu (other than the ri<mark>G</mark> with mushrooms which he is aller<mark>G</mark> to) that he could have.  the server made a very snarky comment...\"i already reviewed the whole menu with you\".\n\nthe mana<mark>G</mark> never came over to talk to us about the problems with our meal.  the food service assistant never brou<mark>G</mark> the additional bread that we asked for and when we asked a<mark>G</mark>, his response...\"oh, sorry\" and nothing further.\n\ni have to say that for a restaurant that cate<mark>G</mark> themselves as fine dining and for the very expensive price points, this type of service and the lack of caring that three of the five entree/pasta dishes had to be sent back is completely unacceptable.  when i shared my experience with my friends who are locals in lv, they told me that the buzz around town with the locals is that the restaurant is just avera<mark>G</mark> at best.\n\noverall experience for the second visit would be 1/2 of a star, which is being <mark>G</mark>.\n\ni am truly unsure if i will ever return to <mark>G</mark>'s restaurant on one of my many trips to ve<mark>G</mark>.", 
            "we have been big fans of <mark>G</mark> for years & were super excited to try her first ever restaurante.  ok first for the positives,  <mark>G</mark> atmosphere,  beautiful place. now the food, amazing,  just as we thou<mark>G</mark> it would be, but i must say they love their aru<mark>G</mark> lol. now the ne<mark>G</mark>,  the service was lacking, we found ourselves waiting looking around for service. drinks were for<mark>G</mark>,  no refills offered & when we did <mark>G</mark> the bill, not only did they char<mark>G</mark> us for our table but also added someone else's table to our bill. so overall,  <mark>G</mark> food but the service is what brin<mark>G</mark> you back, and unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>,  the service did not compliment the food, so not sure if we would return. our <mark>G</mark> would be a b-, c+.",

score!) to our table in the window overlooking the strip. the dining room is kind of tiered, with the bar at the top and the dining rooms unfolding outward, blending in chairs and horseshoe-style booths. now is a <mark>G</mark> time to mention that the view here cannot be beat if you're in the window seats: major brownie points can only be won with your date when the bella<mark>G</mark>'s water show kicks into action across the street and you're on your third bottle of wine.\n\nour server, along with all the food runners and bussing staff, were attentive without being overwhelming. following our technolo<mark>G</mark> snafu with the \"interactive drink menu\" (read: an ipad), our server <mark>G</mark> us started with <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, a mar<mark>G</mark> flatbread, a beet-and-apple salad and a couple rounds of this awesome bread combo. i never <mark>G</mark> to try the flatbread (the four pieces in it were scarfed down quickly) but those meatballs made me question how i've <mark>G</mark> this long in life without eating them. kind of like how i mana<mark>G</mark> to live all these years without tasting lobster ravioli like the kind from here - that ravioli was heavenly, and everyone else expressed similar sentiments for their tortellini and pappardelle dishes.\n\nbefore dessert could arrive and threaten to end my life ri<mark>G</mark> there via caloric overload, i escaped to the bathroom. this has nothing to do with anything, but aside from being spotless, these were also the best smelling bathrooms i've ever been in. i'm tempted to start doing my laundry in one of the stalls if i could fi<mark>G</mark> out how to <mark>G</mark> there on a re<mark>G</mark> basis from dallas.\n\nwith eyes bi<mark>G</mark> than our stomachs, we opted for a selection of \"<mark>G</mark>'s favorite cookies.\" i can safely say this woman knows fine taste: chocolate chip was what you'd expect, the peanut butter (and jelly!) were a pleasant surprise, but the lemon ricotta cookies... i'm not a \"dessert person\" but i think i actually wept while eating those. tears of happiness and savoriness, mind you.\n\nif there are any nitpicks to make, they are minor. mana<mark>G</mark> was scattered about and did not seem to put too much worth on the customer experience: i think i saw a mana<mark>G</mark> talk to two, maybe three tables. that's unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> for a spot like this, as i would like to see the \"hi<mark>G</mark> ups\" at the least asking how everything is, and possibly even displaying a personality and/or a pulse. i also don't know what to think about the special dinner that comes with an auto<mark>G</mark> picture of <mark>G</mark> herself. it's a cute promotion but, if <mark>G</mark>, or her pr people are reading this, this place is better than that kind of <mark>G</mark>.\n\na<mark>G</mark>, totally minor, practically inconsequential critiques to be made. sure, the price can be steep if you do not do your homework but look at the complete packa<mark>G</mark>: friendly servers and hostesses, a priceless view and a menu that made a believer out of a <mark>G</mark> who had no idea who the woman behind everything was. that last part alone should be enou<mark>G</mark> to <mark>G</mark> your foot in the door if you are even sli<mark>G</mark> considering this destination on your next ve<mark>G</mark> trip.",

            "i really loved this restaurant.  it is beautifully decorated and the open air space on the strip was superb.  we had a reservation and were <mark>G</mark> a <mark>G</mark> table for lunch on <mark>G</mark> friday.  i was excited to try this restaurant as i love <mark>G</mark>.  hubby and i started by sharing the meatballs.  i <mark>G</mark> them an 8.5, hubby a 7 (he felt they were a little drier than he would have liked and lacked browning).  next we shared the mar<mark>G</mark> pizza.  this we both <mark>G</mark> a 9.  excellent crust, cheese and the tomatoes were to die for.  appeared to be sun dried in marinade and so yummy.  unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> lunch had a turn for the worst, while eating alarms stared <mark>G</mark> off.  no one explained what was <mark>G</mark> on and all the <mark>G</mark> were unsure if we should evacuate.  finally they stopped and the dining area became very smokey.  i went and found someone to ask fearing a bit for our safety.  apparently there was some type of water leak in the kitchen and the kitchen was being shut down.  the ventilators weren't working so all the smoke was billowing into the dining room.  of course this can't be helped, but we were unable to order anything from the kitchen.  which was disappointing as i was looking forward to trying a dessert.  the smoke was burning my eyes so i was ready to <mark>G</mark> out of there.  this is where my review <mark>G</mark> from 5 stars to 3 stars.  we were not offered any type of compensation for this.  our lunch was filled with smoke, alarms and disruption.  had something been comped for our troubles, or perhaps a complimentary sorbet, i would feel differently.   i am torn about whether i would <mark>G</mark> back, while i loved the space and felt the food was really <mark>G</mark> and a <mark>G</mark> value for lunch prices, i am not impressed with mana<mark>G</mark> that would handle the dining crisis by char<mark>G</mark> diners full price for an alarm smoke filled partial meal.  side note, iced tea 6 dollars for one small <mark>G</mark>.  i would not order that a<mark>G</mark>.  perhaps a refill was possible, but our waitress was very inattentive, but benefit of the doubt because there was a lot <mark>G</mark> on.", 
            "i had hi<mark>G</mark> expectations, and it had typically hi<mark>G</mark> ve<mark>G</mark> prices, unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> the food was mediocre.  i had undercooked stuffed peppers and small watery un flavorful risotto with undercooked scallops.  bar staff were <mark>G</mark> but full of blarney.  wood oven smell a bit annoying.", 
            "this was our second visit to this restaurant. this time we did not make a reservation and the hostess try to seat us at a table we did not like. there were at least 4 tables by the window so i asked if we could have one. the hostess told us those are reserved for people that make reservations. finally we picked acceptable table but we were told it need it to be set. we waited 10 minutes and i had to ask the hostess how long is <mark>G</mark> to take to <mark>G</mark> a table? there were no apolo<mark>G</mark> for anything. the young lady acted like a primadonna. for<mark>Tuna</mark> we had an excellent waiter and the food was ok. being ve<mark>G</mark> we wish they had more options for ve<mark>G</mark>! \nby the way the last table by the window was still empty til we were leaving and none of the tables had reserved si<mark>G</mark> we could see that was confusing for other customers as well!", 
            "as a big fan of <mark>G</mark>, i was really excited to try this place and was left severely underwhelmed.\n\nthe restaurant is located inside the newly constructed cromwell and the space itself is loooooofffly. bri<mark>G</mark>, clean and spacious while maintaining a cute comforting coziness. i definitely want to live here, but i will settle for raiding home<mark>G</mark> to replicate my home into a cheap interior decor knockoff. \n\nthe food: portions are tiny, as is expected with ~fine dining, yet the quality and flavors of these dishes didn't warrant such a hi<mark>G</mark> price tag. nothing about the flavor combinations was innovative or spectacular; in all honesty it was quite plain and lackluster. mushrooms with almonds were plain and seriously tiny, <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> were dry, and the <mark>G</mark> kale salad was <mark>G</mark> but.. i could make this at home. the rest of the small plates we <mark>G</mark> were alri<mark>G</mark> but a<mark>G</mark>, so unmemorable that my photo<mark>G</mark> foodie mind can't even remember what they were for this review.\n\ncocktails are delicious and strong. the <mark>Bellini</mark> are <mark>G</mark>, as is the drink with e<mark>G</mark> whites (can't remember the name, but i enjoyed it thorou<mark>G</mark>.. including the \"g\" mono<mark>G</mark> on top in foam). service is outstanding, and the wait staff is very attentive. there's also a photobooth where you can entertain yourself with while waiting, but unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> none of the pictures were printing while we were there.\n\nleft kind of hun<mark>G</mark> and with noticeably li<mark>G</mark> pockets. next time, i'll spend my money elsewhere. <mark>G</mark> its ve<mark>G</mark>, so what the hell *throws cash everywhere*.", 
            "the husband and i have been wanting to eat at <mark>G</mark>'s restaurant for a while. we finally dined here for dinner last month for my birthday. in fact, i think i called in the reservation about 3 months before. not that i needed to that far in advance, but its never bad to plan thin<mark>G</mark> early, ri<mark>G</mark>? i also requested a table with a <mark>G</mark> view. althou<mark>G</mark> they said \"we will try as much as possible, but not <mark>G</mark>,\" we did end up <mark>G</mark> a table facing the bella<mark>G</mark> fountains. also <mark>G</mark> a fantastic view of the crazy traffic on las ve<mark>G</mark> blvd, lol. \n\ncustomer service was excellent. our server and the staff was very nice, polite and attentive. drinks were refilled and dirty plates were taken away in a timely manner. so here's the thing: years a<mark>G</mark> when i did watch <mark>G</mark>'s cooking show, i really liked her recipes because they were simple. few in<mark>G</mark>, preparing didn't look too difficult and of course everything looked so <mark>G</mark>! when i was browsing the menu, everything looked so complicated. i <mark>G</mark> it doesn't help that i'm picky about what i eat, but its never a <mark>G</mark> si<mark>G</mark> for me when nothing on the menu really catches my eye. so i ordered probably the most boring thing on the menu: spa<mark>G</mark>. i know, i know, but it was the only dish that didn't have thin<mark>G</mark> that i hated like squash, mushrooms, brussel sprouts, etc.\n\nwe started with appetizers. we asked our server what appetizer was popular under the meat cate<mark>G</mark>, and he recommended the bacon wrapped dates. not a fan of dates, but they were stuffed with sausa<mark>G</mark> and wrapped in bacon. sounded like they were worth a try. i was surprised that i could hardly taste the dates and the sausa<mark>G</mark> did have a kick to it, but they were <mark>G</mark>. we also ordered the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, which were juicy and tasty as well. it also came with a <mark>G</mark> amount of sauce.\n\nnow to the main course. i was excited when the food was brou<mark>G</mark> to our table because the presentation was pretty. for my spa<mark>G</mark>, there were two jumbo shrimp on the bottom and a dollop of spa<mark>G</mark> sitting on top of the shrimp. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, i didn't like the lemon sauce too much. i was kind of over it after the first few bites, but forced myself to eat it all because this place isn't cheap! u<mark>G</mark>, i'm definitely not a fan of sweet spa<mark>G</mark>. it needed butter, or maybe just salt. my husband, on the other hand loved his food! he ordered the bone-in tuscan rib-eye with truffle flakes. our server said that occasionally they offer the truffle flakes in the restaurant. i thou<mark>G</mark> it was weird that there was a sunny side up e<mark>G</mark> on the steak. but then a<mark>G</mark>, i do hate e<mark>G</mark>. i know that e<mark>G</mark> are used to make a lot of foods and that is fine. i <mark>G</mark> i should say that i don't like e<mark>G</mark> by itself or e<mark>G</mark> that are visible. anyway, he said that the rib-eye was fantastic and one of the best steaks he ever had. \n\ni really wanted to order a tiramisu for dessert, but our server told us that they only serve it when they have some special \"tastin<mark>G</mark> menu.\"  :( total fail for me, but at least one of us really liked the food here.\n\nbeen there, done that, but i probably won't be back. a little disappointing, but oh well, there are many other <mark>G</mark> eats in ve<mark>G</mark>!", 
            "this review is long overdue. i've been a fan of <mark>G</mark> de laurentiis for years and i was absolutely elated when i read about her new restaurant at the cromwell. while my review may be laden with all sorts of fan-level biases, i have to also note that i did have very hi<mark>G</mark> expectations and they were all si<mark>G</mark> exceeded. \n\nunfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, our dinner reservations conflicted with another en<mark>G</mark> and we were only able to have lunch. if i had more time in ve<mark>G</mark>, i would've definitely returned for dinner. the restaurant is so beautiful. it properly emulates <mark>G</mark>'s charm and sophistication. while the butter knives were <mark>G</mark>, they are heavy and sharp. if you have young children, make sure you set them aside strai<mark>G</mark> away.\n\ni enjoyed every moment at <mark>G</mark>. the only thing that would've made it better would be to see her there!\n\nrecommendations:\n\nburrata with balsamic-salt ($12) \n\n<mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> with parmesan pomodoro ($14) - my 6-year-old <mark>G</mark> loved these meatballs!\n\nmar<mark>G</mark> oven roasted campari tomatoes, mozzerella, basil ($14) - simple and delicious.\n\nchocolate tiramisu  ($8) - i was way too full by the time it came to dessert. don't <mark>G</mark> craayyy like i did and save room for this delectable end to a perfect meal!",

 our waiter proclaims those are his favorites (althou<mark>G</mark>, i did hear him say that to the other unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> souls sharing the cupboard with us....whatever i'm still comforted by the statement).  they both were <mark>G</mark>, but needed more salt and seasoning.  the arancini took the day.  next we ordered the pappardelle and ravioli.  both were <mark>G</mark> a<mark>G</mark>, but served as an appetizer.  the pappardelle alle<mark>G</mark> had pork ra<mark>G</mark>, but it seemed missing in action this ni<mark>G</mark>.  the ravioli was very <mark>G</mark>.  it was served with a butter sauce underneath and 2, yes 2 aspara<mark>G</mark> tips.  it reminded of me of eating a steamed lobster with warm melted butter, but with the lobster being wrapped in a pillow of pasta.  \n\nessentially, everything on the menu seems to be served tapas style.  the only problem is that the price tag of $36 and $32 for tapas is a little ridiculous.  but hey, we are paying for the experience and it looks like the ea<mark>G</mark> just put tim tebow in the <mark>G</mark> and thou<mark>G</mark> my wife never says, i assume the portrait of dino remains unchan<mark>G</mark>.  \n\noverall, <mark>G</mark>'s was not worth it.  there are tons of italian restaurants in this town and just value alone will keep us away.  throw in mar<mark>G</mark> service and the fact i may be eating in a broom closet seals that. but, jud<mark>G</mark> by how busy they were, they will hardly miss us. \n  \nfood:  3.5 stars (hey, my plates were clean when then took them away)\nvalue:  1 star (proportion sizes don't match up)\nservice: 2 stars (our waiter and his assistant moved the scale two stars from the zero star hostesses that only know how to communicate on a samsung or apple device).\natmosphere:  no star (having a preseason football <mark>G</mark> as my eye contact breaker was not what i had in mind for our anniversary.  oh and thumping some j.t. like i was in a club doesn't seem to match the \"<mark>G</mark>\" brand)\n\nanyways, finished the evening off with a bur<mark>G</mark> and shake from in-n-out, so really how bad of a ni<mark>G</mark> could that have been?", 
            "finally made it here! took three separate attempts in order to finally secure a reservation, but it was worth the wait. amazing how completely packed it was even thou<mark>G</mark> walking throu<mark>G</mark> the cromwell was depressin<mark>G</mark> empty. first impression was this amazing panoramic view of the strip. i was the first of my <mark>G</mark> to arrive so found a spot to wait at the bar. my plan was just to order a martini, but i can <mark>G</mark> that anywhere so i decided to look over the fun specialty drinks. what actually <mark>G</mark> me was i saw someone else's cocktail with this really cool ice sphere displaying <mark>G</mark>'s si<mark>G</mark> g. so i opted for the destroyer which had tequila, fresh tan<mark>G</mark> and basil. delish! lucky for me, the friends i went with have a similar passion for food so we order a lot and everyone shares. that way we <mark>G</mark> to try a little of everything. bacon wrapped dates, lemon crab arancini, aru<mark>G</mark> salad with candied lemon and crispy pancetta and the scallop risotto were all amazing. we also ordered the 28 oz bone in rib-eye finished with lemon and topped with a sunny side up e<mark>G</mark> which i was really disappointed with. althou<mark>G</mark> the presentation of it was impressive, it was over cooked and a bit on the tou<mark>G</mark> side. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> especially since that is supposed to be one of the si<mark>G</mark> dishes.", 
            "i couldn't wait to try <mark>G</mark>'s ve<mark>G</mark> restaurant because all of her recipes that i've made at home are impeccable (i'm a hu<mark>G</mark> fan!). the restaurant is <mark>G</mark>--bri<mark>G</mark>, chic, with lots of personal touches.  server elena was excellent.  i went for breakfast and had coffee and the <mark>Caprese Frittata</mark>, which was unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> overcooked. i <mark>G</mark> a spon<mark>G</mark> e<mark>G</mark> patty with raw caprese elements sitting on top.  usually a frittata has the non-e<mark>G</mark> in<mark>G</mark> incorporated into it, so that's what i was expecting.  the patty had sundried tomatoes cooked in it which was kinda weird with the fresh tomatoes on top.  there are so many other restaurants in lv that i'm not sure i'll make it back to this one.  \n\nfor reference: http://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/common-mistakes/article/frittata-common-mistakes",

            "if this review was about the food at <mark>G</mark> it would be a 5 star review, in fact i'd be petitioning yelp to add a 6th star because the food is that <mark>G</mark>. however due to the absolutely abysmal service i received today at lunch <mark>G</mark> is <mark>G</mark> 2 stars. i hope my experience was an outlier & from what i've heard/seen that may be the truth but the service ruined what would have been an amazing meal for me & has probably made it so i won't return any time soon.\nas i said the food was amazing. everything came quickly from the kitchen (other than the bread which was a little backed up), but everything was plated beautifully & tasted amazing. we started with the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> & prosciutto dan danielle to start. the meatballs had a <mark>G</mark> flavor profile & were cooked to perfection. the prosciutto was a perfect balance of meat & ham & paired nicely with the warm bread & pesto. our entrees were the <mark>Venetian Panino</mark> & lasa<mark>G</mark>, both were delicious & while the portions are a touch small i was happy with them. for dessert we had zappole which were served with a chocolate sauce g & were a perfect end to the meal.\n& thus ends the <mark>G</mark> part of the review. let's discuss the service:\ni had a reservation that was made on open table, which was a <mark>G</mark> idea because even at 12:45 on a wednesday there was a line to <mark>G</mark> seated. we checked in & were seated within minutes by a very friendly hostess, who informed us we were seated in christopher h's section & that he would be by with menus in a moment.\n10 minutes later, we still haven't seen or heard from christopher, the busboy notices that we've been seated for a while & brin<mark>G</mark> us over some water, apolo<mark>G</mark> for the delay & <mark>G</mark> & fla<mark>G</mark> down our server.  about 3-5 minutes later he came over & dropped off the menus. he introduced himself & then went on for about 5 minutes explaining the menu in full detail. this would have been <mark>G</mark> however he was talking in a very hushed mumble & we could barely hear every 5th word he said over the noise in the room. he then said <mark>G</mark> us a minute to make our decision & he'd come back.\nanother 5 minutes after we had closed our menus & set them on the ed<mark>G</mark> of the table he finally came over & took our order.  he hurried off & entered our order, the apps came out before the bread which is fine, the runner explained that the bread oven was a \"little backed up because everything is made fresh\" but it came about 2 minutes after our apps <mark>G</mark> delivered. no big deal, it was delicious when it arrived. \nthe busby then came by & cleared our app plates & brou<mark>G</mark> over some silverware for our main course. our waiter came by moments before our entrees arrived & asked if we would like some more bread, to which i replied, \"yes the bread is <mark>G</mark> we'll take another\". \nthe entrees made their way to our table & they were <mark>G</mark>, the busboy came by & topped off our bevera<mark>G</mark>, but our server is nowhere to be found. no \"hey how's everything tasting\" or \"hey would you like some fresh cracked pepper\" nothing. he is bending over backwards to cater to the 5 top a few tables away from us & the couple seated ri<mark>G</mark> next to us, but he never  comes over to our table. we finish our entrees & the busboy scoops up our plates.\nmy aunt wants to check out the dessert menu, however our waiter is nowhere to be found so she <mark>G</mark> up, walks over 2 sections & asks a different waiter for a dessert menu. we then place a dessert order with the busboy because we haven't seen our waiter in a <mark>G</mark> 20 minutes, even thou<mark>G</mark> he's been to the table directly next to us no less than 4 times.  dessert is delivered & our waiter brin<mark>G</mark> out plates & a fork for the dessert course after the food has arrived. i immediately ask for the check as the 90 minutes we've been there was lon<mark>G</mark> than i planned & i need to duck out quickly for work.  he brin<mark>G</mark> the check by & moseys off.\ni have worked in the industry, i've waited tables in the past & am a majority of the time a <mark>G</mark> tipper however the service i received at a white table cloth celebrity chef spot was not worthy of my usual 20-25%. the bill was about $70, i paid $75, & our waiter took the check & went back to the wait station. \ni watched as his eyes <mark>G</mark> about as big as dish plates & he looks ri<mark>G</mark> at me & comes back with the bill to our table. he asks, \"did i take this too early\". to which i reply, \"no we're fine.\" he then says, \"you do know that here at <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> isn't included in the bill?\" to which i say, \"i know, there was nothing about your service that deserved more, maybe if you had actually acknowled<mark>G</mark> our existence you would have <mark>G</mark> a better tip.\"  he just shru<mark>G</mark> his shoulders & walked off.\non the way out the busboy once a<mark>G</mark> apolo<mark>G</mark> for the wait, but once a<mark>G</mark> the server didn't say a word other than to complain about his tip. \ni really enjoyed the food & it's a beautiful room, but that service was so bad that i probably won't be returning anytime soon.", 
            "i came here for lunch on my birthday with my mom and brother. i made reservations via open table, so of course, it was simple. \n\nwe had a moment before our table was ready, so i was excited to check out the photo booth. it's a very cool set up of having a built-in complimentary photo booth, except it is a very ti<mark>G</mark> space and it's difficult to reach the screen and be situated when the session starts. it was also unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> for us that their printer was out of service that morning! sad face! they do allow you to send the photos via e-mail, but the pixel quality is atrocious.\n\nthe restaurant is beautiful and the view of the strip (and bella<mark>G</mark> fountains) is <mark>G</mark>. i love the open kitchen and the antipasti bar. we were <mark>G</mark> a table next to the floor-to-ceiling windows, which was very nice. the chairs were comfortable, too. \n\nwe started with <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> with parmesan pomodoro ($15) and burrata with balsamic salt ($12). the meatballs were tender and flavorful; very satisfying. the burrata was also delicious; really creamy and <mark>G</mark> with that balsamic salt, evoo, and micro aru<mark>G</mark>. both fantastic antipasti dishes. they also offer complimentary bread that appears to be baked in a similar fashion to pizza (it may be their pizza dou<mark>G</mark>). it's served with a yummy pesto oil.\n\n<mark>Lobster Roll</mark> ($35): lemon basil a\\u00efoli and fried capers. all sandwiches are served with aru<mark>G</mark> salad or zucchini scapecce. i chose the zucchini scapecce, but was served the salad, so our server <mark>G</mark> brou<mark>G</mark> a small plate of scapecce to the table. it was a <mark>G</mark> error because i truly enjoyed the salad and the scapecce! they were delicious alone and with my sandwich. the sandwich is open-faced and stacked with scrumptious lobster meat. the mixture was so tasty!\n\n<mark>Venetian Panino</mark> ($18): turkey, <mark>G</mark>\\u00e8re, fontina, whole mustard, and peppadew. this panini sandwich was also well-made and delicious. it not entirely exciting, so i probably wouldn't order it over all the other menu selections. my mom really enjoyed it thou<mark>G</mark>!\n\n<mark>G's Baked Pasta</mark> of the day ($24): the lasa<mark>G</mark> had layers of e<mark>G</mark> as well as your usual suspects. this was really, really <mark>G</mark> lasa<mark>G</mark>. i love the addition of e<mark>G</mark> layers to make it a bit more healthy. \n\nchocolate tiramisu ($8): chocolate zabiaone and espresso-soaked ladyfin<mark>G</mark>. tiramisu is one of my absolute favorite desserts and this is seriously one of the best tiramisu i've ever had the pleasure of eating. they also wrote a very nice \"happy birthday\" messa<mark>G</mark> on the plate.\n\nespresso nocciolato ($9): lavazza <mark>G</mark> riserva, nutella, whipped cream, toasted hazelnuts, and a li<mark>G</mark> dusting of cocoa powder. this was really tasty and a fun way to drink a shot of espresso!\n\nthe food was all delicious! the service was wonderful and we had a very pleasant experience. it was a fantastic birthday celebration. my only complaint: why is everything so petite??! you pay quite a premium on the dishes that i didn't expect from <mark>G</mark>. also, beware that you are char<mark>G</mark> for \"still\" water! i thou<mark>G</mark> they meant tap water when i was asked (they only offered still or sparkling), so i was surprised to see the char<mark>G</mark> on the bill. oddly, they only served us the one bottle, then switched to tap water without asking us if we wanted another bottle of still water.", 
            "we had a lunch reservation for friday, january 2nd at 1:30 pm, and weren't seated until 2:20! it was a disaster. when we checked in, the hostess at the counter wasn't especially helpful and mentioned that they were running 20 - 25 minutes behind schedule. in their defense, they did bring out complimentary drinks to those waiting, but there wasn't enou<mark>G</mark> seating, and as someone who is 9 months pre<mark>G</mark>, it took a long time for them to eventually bring out some water. which was fine (i didn't ask for it, after all), but i thou<mark>G</mark> it a little odd that they weren't more aware of the crowd that was standing around waiting.\n\nwhen we were finally seated, i wasn't overly impressed with the food. the waitress informed us that the kitchen was extremely backed up, but we told her we had a fli<mark>G</mark> to catch and the food came out in a fairly timely manner. the peppers to start were a little too sweet for my taste (it tasted very citrus-y to me), and my dining companion and i did not like the <mark>Sweet Ricotta</mark> pizza (with pink peppercorns...it tasted like a spicy dessert). that being said, we both really liked the <mark>Venetian Panino</mark> and would order it a<mark>G</mark>.\n\nthe cookies to finish off the meal were delicious. \n\noverall, i'm disappointed that a mana<mark>G</mark> never made the rounds apolo<mark>G</mark> for the delay (like most 50-minute delays would warrant) , and that the food wasn't really worth waiting for. hoping they <mark>G</mark> these kinks worked out, because the space is really, really beautiful.", 
            "had lunch at <mark>G</mark> on a friday.  we had a reservation, but the place was nearly empty, so that wasn't needed.  it's lar<mark>G</mark> and it's appointed nicely.  i wouldn't think i would have liked the setting, but i did.  it has a lar<mark>G</mark> view of the strip, as it's ri<mark>G</mark> on the corner of flamin<mark>G</mark> and las ve<mark>G</mark> boulevard.  there is a lot of seating on the outer ed<mark>G</mark> of the room, so if you want a view of the strip, you should ask.  they can open the lar<mark>G</mark> windows, but i found that when you open the windows you pretty much just <mark>G</mark> traffic noise.  so, the views are interesting, but i didn't love having the window open.\n\nour server approached us very quickly to take drink orders.  my buddies ordered specialty cocktails, including a bloody mary with a ball of mozzarella and a slice of sausa<mark>G</mark>.  i didn't sample them, but everyone liked their drinks.  to start, we decided to <mark>G</mark> with the <mark>G</mark> with pear honey, the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, and the <mark>G</mark> cheese stuffed <mark>Baby Sweet Peppers</mark>.  my favorite was definitely the <mark>G</mark> with honey.  the honey was thick and difficult to spread, but it was fantastic.  the sweetness of the honey and the saltiness of the cheese was excellent.  the meatballs were a little disappointing.  we'd heard such <mark>G</mark> thin<mark>G</mark>, so we were surprised.  the orzo challen<mark>G</mark> the inte<mark>G</mark> of the meatballs, they kind of fell apart.  they weren't bad, but certainly worse than we were expecting.  the peppers were fairly strai<mark>G</mark>.  no heat at all, i could have used more <mark>G</mark> cheese.\n\nto eat, i had the <mark>Venetian Panino</mark>.  it comes with turkey, <mark>G</mark>, fontina, mustard, and peppedew peppers.  this is one of the best pressed sandwiches i've had in a long time.  the bread is li<mark>G</mark> than typical panini bread, and it was crisp, but didn't cut the roof of your mouth.  often paninis have bread that is too thick or too crusty, but <mark>G</mark>'s was near perfect.  the in<mark>G</mark> went well to<mark>G</mark>.  the turkey was a tad on the dry side, but the mustard helped that.  the cheeses were fantastic, really tasty and melty.  this sandwich just worked.\n\nmy buddy ordered the <mark>Lemon Pesto <mark>G</mark> Cheese</mark> with added prosciutto.  i had a bite, and it was nice and caramelized and very cheesy, but too lemony for me.  the citrus was overpowering.\n\nfor dessert, we had the chef's trio of cookies.  i can't remember the other two  cookies, but the winner for me was a lar<mark>G</mark> warm chocolate chip cookie.  sli<mark>G</mark> crisp, <mark>G</mark>, and packed with chocolate.  a little sea salt on top would have put this over the top, but it was a very <mark>G</mark> cookie.\n\ni would come back, i'd like to try dinner at <mark>G</mark>.  but, we were very pleased with our lunch and i absolutely would re-order that <mark>Venetian Panino</mark>.",

            "my first trip. located on second floor of the cromwell. \n\ntips. this place takes reservations. most dinner times of 5-9 are a two month out for a reservation. lunch recently be<mark>G</mark> to be served. lunch dress code is relaxed and dinner is business casual. dress code is enforced.\n\nexperience. at arrival we are <mark>G</mark> immediately at the base of stairs to confirm our lunch reservation. also confirmed and <mark>G</mark> at the front desk. she kindly informs us to wait a few moments to try the photo booth to the left and are escorted to our tables.\n\nour server anthony arrived in a timely manner to introduce himself and his help. he was kindly insured we placed a drink order. we were unsure on what to order and he described some of his favorite bevera<mark>G</mark> choices. <mark>G</mark>'s san<mark>G</mark> with brachetto and fortunella 1958 with don julio were the drinks we ordered. anthony kindly informed us that restaurant was out of don juilo and was substituting with patron. rare to find a restaurant out of bevera<mark>G</mark>. without don julio i went with my second choice barbarella 1968 with tanqueray ten. waiter respected and a<mark>G</mark> with my opinion and affirmed the second choice was his favorite drink. \n\ndrinks were served and food order was taken without delay. both drinks i would describe as a <mark>G</mark> balance with alcohol and freshly matched in<mark>G</mark>. san<mark>G</mark> was crisp and savory. barbarella similar to a moscow mule was harmony of <mark>G</mark>, <mark>G</mark> beer, fresh lemon and basil. drinks ordered were refreshing for the hot temperatures outside of the restaurant. alcohol was not over powering either. \n\nanthony made su<mark>G</mark> for the meal. we followed some su<mark>G</mark> and ordered others. we ordered appetizers from the antipasti meat and cheese including <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark>, and <mark>Pecorino Tartufo</mark> with apricot preserves served with fresh made flat bread and dipping sauce. dipping sauce similar to that of a pesto. yum. pairing flat bread with pecorino and apricot spread just ma<mark>G</mark>. the components of pecorino worked well on its own and to<mark>G</mark>. harmony. \n\nmeatballs paired with vine roasted tomatoes in a savory marsala. tender soft meatballs. sauce was flavorful and one of the best i had. tomatoes li<mark>G</mark> toasted to maintain it's inte<mark>G</mark>. as a whole this was a nice antipasti. pieces were <mark>G</mark> on its own but in my opinion lacked a little cohesion for the appetizer. this item is on their dinner menu and i would still order it. \n\nwe ordered from the sandwiches from servers su<mark>G</mark>. muffuletta sandwich with mortadella, finocchoina, porchetta, prosciutto cotto, and a<mark>G</mark> provolone. similar to an italian salumi trio, was bursting with spice and fair amount of provolone on a fresh rustic bread. prepared warm from the <mark>G</mark>, this is what a  sandwich should be. this sandwich pays true homa<mark>G</mark> to the influences of <mark>G</mark>'s family into the restaurant. sandwich is served with choice of aru<mark>G</mark> salad or zucchini scapecce. aru<mark>G</mark> salad was elected to pair with this. li<mark>G</mark> dressed and topped with parmesan that hit an accord with the sandwich. i couldn't complain if this was the only thing i ordered. between the muffuletta sandwich and aru<mark>G</mark> salad i think i could eat all day without feeling <mark>G</mark>.\n\nother sandwich was the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> with lemon basil aioli and fried capers. the roll was by far one of the best deals on the menu. ten ounces of lobster piled on a roll with the citrus aioli was succulent, creamy, savory, and sweet. nothing over powering just ri<mark>G</mark> and not too aromatic with the lobster and citrus. paired this with the zucchini scapecce like a zucchini onion strin<mark>G</mark>. not <mark>G</mark> but crispy enou<mark>G</mark> with flavor to enjoy on it's own or pair with the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark>. li<mark>G</mark> of the zucchini paired nicely to the sandwich. both li<mark>G</mark> sides were <mark>G</mark> pairin<mark>G</mark>. \n\noverall the appetizers, sandwiches, sides, and drinks were <mark>G</mark>. service was outstanding. restaurant as a whole was refreshing, exceeded the expectations and hype. the restaurant reflects the pride, tradition which tributes to <mark>G</mark>'s family and california influences. i would make sure i had a reservation the next time i am out to las ve<mark>G</mark>. a must try if you like food. \n\nserver was very personal and knowled<mark>G</mark> of menu. server was efficient, friendly, and well articulated. it showed with su<mark>G</mark>. we enjoyed the meal from some su<mark>G</mark> he made and our own selections. serve, wait, and host staff worked well like a oiled machine or an orchestra on key.\n\noverall four stars for exceptions from a sli<mark>G</mark> delay on the check to <mark>G</mark> to us, a little pricy, and no clue what lunch was because lunch menu (just started serving lunch) was not available until we ate there. five stars on food, service, and drinks. \n\nwe had plenty on our list of thin<mark>G</mark> to do for this ve<mark>G</mark> trip and this is a definite return place for us.",

            "i came here for lunch on my birthday with my mom and brother. i made reservations via open table, so of course, it was simple. \n\nwe had a moment before our table was ready, so i was excited to check out the photo booth. it's a very cool set up of having a built-in complimentary photo booth, except it is a very ti<mark>G</mark> space and it's difficult to reach the screen and be situated when the session starts. it was also unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> for us that their printer was out of service that morning! sad face! they do allow you to send the photos via e-mail, but the pixel quality is atrocious.\n\nthe restaurant is beautiful and the view of the strip (and bella<mark>G</mark> fountains) is <mark>G</mark>. i love the open kitchen and the antipasti bar. we were <mark>G</mark> a table next to the floor-to-ceiling windows, which was very nice. the chairs were comfortable, too. \n\nwe started with <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> with parmesan pomodoro ($15) and burrata with balsamic salt ($12). the meatballs were tender and flavorful; very satisfying. the burrata was also delicious; really creamy and <mark>G</mark> with that balsamic salt, evoo, and micro aru<mark>G</mark>. both fantastic antipasti dishes. they also offer complimentary bread that appears to be baked in a similar fashion to pizza (it may be their pizza dou<mark>G</mark>). it's served with a yummy pesto oil.\n\n<mark>Lobster Roll</mark> ($35): lemon basil a\\u00efoli and fried capers. all sandwiches are served with aru<mark>G</mark> salad or zucchini scapecce. i chose the zucchini scapecce, but was served the salad, so our server <mark>G</mark> brou<mark>G</mark> a small plate of scapecce to the table. it was a <mark>G</mark> error because i truly enjoyed the salad and the scapecce! they were delicious alone and with my sandwich. the sandwich is open-faced and stacked with scrumptious lobster meat. the mixture was so tasty!\n\n<mark>Venetian Panino</mark> ($18): turkey, <mark>G</mark>\\u00e8re, fontina, whole mustard, and peppadew. this panini sandwich was also well-made and delicious. it not entirely exciting, so i probably wouldn't order it over all the other menu selections. my mom really enjoyed it thou<mark>G</mark>!\n\n<mark>G's Baked Pasta</mark> of the day ($24): the lasa<mark>G</mark> had layers of e<mark>G</mark> as well as your usual suspects. this was really, really <mark>G</mark> lasa<mark>G</mark>. i love the addition of e<mark>G</mark> layers to make it a bit more healthy. \n\nchocolate tiramisu ($8): chocolate zabiaone and espresso-soaked ladyfin<mark>G</mark>. tiramisu is one of my absolute favorite desserts and this is seriously one of the best tiramisu i've ever had the pleasure of eating. they also wrote a very nice \"happy birthday\" messa<mark>G</mark> on the plate.\n\nespresso nocciolato ($9): lavazza <mark>G</mark> riserva, nutella, whipped cream, toasted hazelnuts, and a li<mark>G</mark> dusting of cocoa powder. this was really tasty and a fun way to drink a shot of espresso!\n\nthe food was all delicious! the service was wonderful and we had a very pleasant experience. it was a fantastic birthday celebration. my only complaint: why is everything so petite??! you pay quite a premium on the dishes that i didn't expect from <mark>G</mark>. also, beware that you are char<mark>G</mark> for \"still\" water! i thou<mark>G</mark> they meant tap water when i was asked (they only offered still or sparkling), so i was surprised to see the char<mark>G</mark> on the bill. oddly, they only served us the one bottle, then switched to tap water without asking us if we wanted another bottle of still water.", 
            "my parents moved to the united states from rome in 1985, so i was very much looking forward to eating at <mark>G</mark>'s new restaurant in las ve<mark>G</mark>. \n\ni enjoyed everything i ate; however, there were several textural issues, and salt issues with my plates. \n\ni be<mark>G</mark> my lunch with the burrata appetizer. burrata (from burro, the italian word for butter) is an extremely creamy cheese that can be pulled apart with a fork, and is often spread on bread. the burrata was excellent, drizzled with olive oil, and served with a line of salt on the plate. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, <mark>G</mark>'s house bread is akin to pita bread, it consists of their pizza dou<mark>G</mark> undercooked, and is served with a small ramekin of pesto, which was almost inedibly salty. burrata really needs to be spread on hearty, crunchy bread otherwise every bite is devoid of any texture but mushiness. \n\nmy second appetizer consisted of <mark>Baby Sweet Peppers</mark> stuffed with <mark>G</mark> cheese. they were delicious; sweet, and creamy. \n\nfor my entree i had the infamous $35 <mark>Lobster Roll</mark>. a<mark>G</mark>, this plate suffered from salt, and textural issues. the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> consisted of one thick piece of italian bread with a heaping pile of the lobster-centric filling on top. i tasted no salt in the filling; however, that's an easy fix as you can always add salt. after the addition of some salt it was delicious. the filling was mostly lar<mark>G</mark> lumps of succulent lobster with capers, and celery bits; it was absolutely delicious. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, the dish was not a roll, it had to be eaten with utensils, and would not even qualify as an open faced sandwich as there was si<mark>G</mark> more filling than bread. the real problem thou<mark>G</mark> was that the italian bread bottom was so<mark>G</mark> because in a matter of seconds it had absorbed the moisture from the lobster filling. once a<mark>G</mark> during my meal i was taking spon<mark>G</mark> bites; this time of so<mark>G</mark> bread, and lobster filling. \n\nin conclusion, the issues i had were minor. however, with no alcohol my lunch cost around $80 with tip. for this amount of money i do not think that crisp bread is too much to ask for. i would definitely return a<mark>G</mark> for lunch thou<mark>G</mark>.",

            "i really liked this place. our server was <mark>G</mark> (not constantly hovering but always there when you needed him) and the nearly floor to ceiling windows were perfect for someone like me who slept till lunch and needed all the natural li<mark>G</mark> i could <mark>G</mark>. before ordering, our server went over the menu and described our options as being \"desi<mark>G</mark>\" for the time of day, which \"duh\" it's lunch, not dinner, different options, everyone does that ri<mark>G</mark>? nope, after i finished eating, i <mark>G</mark> it. like the natural li<mark>G</mark>, everything i tasted helped me to come alive. the recipes were subtle, cool and refreshing, almost rejuvenating, and while i never felt any one thing was amazing, it just all worked. \n\nfor appetizers we tried the caponata $8, <mark>Baby Sweet Peppers</mark> $12 and <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> $15. interestin<mark>G</mark> enou<mark>G</mark>, the cheaper the better here. the caponata was excellent and came with enou<mark>G</mark> to cover about 10 crostini (it came with 6, we asked for the extra.) the <mark>Baby Sweet Peppers</mark> stuffed with <mark>G</mark> cheese and olive tapenade came with three and fit the theme of this review perfectly--not amazing but somehow still perfect. the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> were probably my least favorite of everything i tried, as paying 3 to 4 dollars (per meatball) for a relatively small and un-compelling dish is not something i would advise and this is coming from a <mark>G</mark> who falls for the aidells samples at costco on the re<mark>G</mark>. \n\nfor lunch, i had the <mark>Waldorf Panzanella</mark> salad, which included a unique crouton-like raisin walnut bread i really enjoyed. i also split three other options: the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark>, <mark>Lemon Pesto <mark>G</mark> Cheese</mark> w/ prosciutto and tuna sandwich. <mark>G</mark> back to the idea of refreshing, the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> (served cold) included a lemon basil aioli, which along with the <mark>Lemon Pesto <mark>G</mark> Cheese</mark> contributed to the overall feeling of zest i felt at the completion of our meal. of the three, the <mark>Lemon Pesto <mark>G</mark> Cheese</mark> was my favorite, followed by the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> and then the tuna. \n\ntry it or diet final word\n\nif soup taste 10x's better to you on a rainy day and/or there's nothing better to you than a ice cold beer after mowing your lawn, this is the place for you at lunch. it's <mark>G</mark> food served in the ri<mark>G</mark> atmosphere at the ri<mark>G</mark> time. try it.", 
            "we came in an hour and a half before they closed for dinner and the hostess was in complete disbelief that we had shown up without reservations even thou<mark>G</mark> no one else was waiting for a table.  she was clearly put out by our shortsi<mark>G</mark> and behaved like she would have to <mark>G</mark> chop wood to <mark>G</mark> us a table.  once we were able to be seated, we walked inside the dining room and there were open tables everywhere.  we asked for one of the open tables overlooking the strip because it was my birthday and it would add to the occasion.  we were told those tables were all reserved but they were still empty when we left.  instead we were sat in an awkward hallway.  our server wasn't kind or attentive in any way.  i asked for a <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> and he said that item was no lon<mark>G</mark> on the menu but the next closest thing were the pork sliders.  i failed to see the similarity so i ordered a mar<mark>G</mark> pizza instead.  my mom ordered an appetizer for us to share and a salad.  the cheese she selected for an appetizer came as a sin<mark>G</mark> wed<mark>G</mark> of cheese on a plate at the same time as our entrees.  it was weird, usually cheese is served paired with something but it was just a wed<mark>G</mark> by itself.  we both a<mark>G</mark> that our entrees were delicious but we couldn't tackle that big chunk of strong cheese on its own so we asked for something to <mark>G</mark> with it but our server never brou<mark>G</mark> anything.  as we sat and waited, my mom noticed that the table next to us was eating a <mark>Lobster Roll</mark>, you know - the ones our server told me were no lon<mark>G</mark> on the menu.  also, their server was continuously filling their ice tea while my mom's <mark>G</mark> sat empty at the ed<mark>G</mark> of the table throu<mark>G</mark> our entire meal, it was never refilled once.  we actually had a lovely time because we were enjoying each other's company but it was hard to i<mark>G</mark> the terrible service we were receiving.  as we were leaving, the hostesses just watched us walk out, no \"thank you for coming\" or \"have a nice day.\"  they were the most miserable looking women i've ever seen in ve<mark>G</mark>.", 
            "we had lunch there, portion size is really small with hu<mark>G</mark> price tag. the food was very bland & certainly didn't live up to the hype! we had peppers stuff with cream & really didn't have enou<mark>G</mark> taste to identify the in<mark>G</mark>. <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> very chewy, <mark>G</mark> workout for teeth but not much taste. left there disappointed!", 
            "this is the best restaurant in las ve<mark>G</mark>. me and my husband went there for our 10 years anniversary - we really wanted to <mark>G</mark> somewhere special and this place is way beyond that. our waiter was radoslav and he really knows how to represent the food. we started with two appetizers - <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> and bor<mark>G</mark> cheese, for the main meal he recommended veil and salmon with cauliflower and broccoli on the side. we never tasted so tender and flavory food- amazing. but wait for the deserts- way beyond our expectations - best tiramisu ever. we had such a <mark>G</mark> experience there and we truly recommend this place!   every little detail is placed with love and <mark>G</mark> taste. thank you radoslav for making our dinner so unfor<mark>G</mark>! there is a lot more to say, but if you are looking for a luxury place with professional serves <mark>G</mark> is the one!", 
            "we weren't planning to eat here and hadn't even perused the menu online. one of the reasons i had intentionally not put this restaurant in the \"must try cate<mark>G</mark>\" was the less than 4 stars on yelp which are abundant in ve<mark>G</mark>. yet somehow, we found ourselves hun<mark>G</mark> at lunch and no plan...a bit of an anomaly for an avid foodie/yelper!  sometimes flying by the seat of the pants is so much better thou<mark>G</mark>.\n\nwalked passed mon ami <mark>G</mark> and were both tempted <mark>G</mark> back as their steak/frites and moules/frites are a safe bet. but time to venture to something new and i remembered that <mark>G</mark>'s was just another block up the strip.  as we headed up the escalators in the cromwell, two ladies were descending and their friend hollered up....\"how was it?\" one called down...\"i had the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> which was fantastic!\"  i looked at my husband and said, \"it's <mark>G</mark> be pricey...but i don't care how much it is...i've been craving a <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> and i'm <mark>G</mark> to order it!\"\n\nso we sit down in this <mark>G</mark> very un-las-ve<mark>G</mark>-ey style restaurant....meaning bri<mark>G</mark> and open with awesome feng-shui. i was hooked as soon as i melted into a nice comfortable club chair with a <mark>G</mark> amount of space between tables.  \n \nin addition to the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> (which was a whopping $37) we ordered the <mark>Salumi Picante</mark> pizza that totaled only $16.  they were both really beyond fantastic. the salumi was nothing like i've tasted before...a bit spicy but not too oily.  the crust was on the thicker side but li<mark>G</mark> and airy at the same time. <mark>G</mark> knows her pizza!\n\nthe lobster at first looked small...that was deceiving because it was open faced so the entire 1 1/2 inches on top was all lobster. we decided it must have been well over a pound of lobster perfectly dressed in the li<mark>G</mark> aioli with fried capers...never would have thou<mark>G</mark> of that but it worked well. in fact, this was one of the best <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> i've ever tried.  \n\nthey <mark>G</mark> knocked one star because wine by the <mark>G</mark> is pretty steep so we ended up <mark>G</mark> a bottle of french wine on the lower end of the price ran<mark>G</mark>...vouvray francois pinon.  our server immediately informed us that they serve that one by the <mark>G</mark> at spa<mark>G</mark> where he used to work and it is delicious. ok, that made us feel better about our choice, and much to our surprise, it was the perfect choice....li<mark>G</mark> and not too buttery or oaky.  \n\nthe service was wonderful and even with the steep wine prices i would definitely return.",

            "i was looking forward to this restaurant and finally made it in for lunch one day. reservations for dinner are at least a week away which i don't understand as there are usually empty tables around. maybe they don't have enou<mark>G</mark> staff or want to make it feel more exclusive. we easily <mark>G</mark> a reservation for lunch, but when we arrived their system was down and said they needed to wait until it was up a<mark>G</mark> as they had no way to confirm i had a real reservation. i showed them the email confirmation and they said they would seat us soon. we had to talk to them a couple of more times and they sat us when we said we had to be out by a certain hour. after that hiccup, our server was extremely attentive and the food was at our table timely. \n\ni was craving the <mark>G's Baked Pasta</mark> (lasa<mark>G</mark> for sunday) but our server would not recommend it as it had mixed reviews from other diners and the kitchen was still modifying the recipe. i ended up <mark>G</mark> the muffuletta sandwich and was underwhelmed. the bread was not soft and fresh, and the overall taste was nothing extraordinary. i <mark>G</mark> the zucchini scapecci as the side and this was my favorite part of the meal. my friend <mark>G</mark> the tuna sandwich which was better than the muffuletta, but be warned it is not fresh tuna. \n\ni would like to <mark>G</mark> back and <mark>G</mark> it another shot. the space and decor are beautiful but so far it felt like it was more about the celebrity chef than the food.", 
            "i came here for lunch on my birthday with my mom and brother. i made reservations via open table, so of course, it was simple. \n\nwe had a moment before our table was ready, so i was excited to check out the photo booth. it's a very cool set up of having a built-in complimentary photo booth, except it is a very ti<mark>G</mark> space and it's difficult to reach the screen and be situated when the session starts. it was also unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> for us that their printer was out of service that morning! sad face! they do allow you to send the photos via e-mail, but the pixel quality is atrocious.\n\nthe restaurant is beautiful and the view of the strip (and bella<mark>G</mark> fountains) is <mark>G</mark>. i love the open kitchen and the antipasti bar. we were <mark>G</mark> a table next to the floor-to-ceiling windows, which was very nice. the chairs were comfortable, too. \n\nwe started with <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> with parmesan pomodoro ($15) and burrata with balsamic salt ($12). the meatballs were tender and flavorful; very satisfying. the burrata was also delicious; really creamy and <mark>G</mark> with that balsamic salt, evoo, and micro aru<mark>G</mark>. both fantastic antipasti dishes. they also offer complimentary bread that appears to be baked in a similar fashion to pizza (it may be their pizza dou<mark>G</mark>). it's served with a yummy pesto oil.\n\n<mark>Lobster Roll</mark> ($35): lemon basil a\\u00efoli and fried capers. all sandwiches are served with aru<mark>G</mark> salad or zucchini scapecce. i chose the zucchini scapecce, but was served the salad, so our server <mark>G</mark> brou<mark>G</mark> a small plate of scapecce to the table. it was a <mark>G</mark> error because i truly enjoyed the salad and the scapecce! they were delicious alone and with my sandwich. the sandwich is open-faced and stacked with scrumptious lobster meat. the mixture was so tasty!\n\n<mark>Venetian Panino</mark> ($18): turkey, <mark>G</mark>\\u00e8re, fontina, whole mustard, and peppadew. this panini sandwich was also well-made and delicious. it not entirely exciting, so i probably wouldn't order it over all the other menu selections. my mom really enjoyed it thou<mark>G</mark>!\n\n<mark>G's Baked Pasta</mark> of the day ($24): the lasa<mark>G</mark> had layers of e<mark>G</mark> as well as your usual suspects. this was really, really <mark>G</mark> lasa<mark>G</mark>. i love the addition of e<mark>G</mark> layers to make it a bit more healthy. \n\nchocolate tiramisu ($8): chocolate zabiaone and espresso-soaked ladyfin<mark>G</mark>. tiramisu is one of my absolute favorite desserts and this is seriously one of the best tiramisu i've ever had the pleasure of eating. they also wrote a very nice \"happy birthday\" messa<mark>G</mark> on the plate.\n\nespresso nocciolato ($9): lavazza <mark>G</mark> riserva, nutella, whipped cream, toasted hazelnuts, and a li<mark>G</mark> dusting of cocoa powder. this was really tasty and a fun way to drink a shot of espresso!\n\nthe food was all delicious! the service was wonderful and we had a very pleasant experience. it was a fantastic birthday celebration. my only complaint: why is everything so petite??! you pay quite a premium on the dishes that i didn't expect from <mark>G</mark>. also, beware that you are char<mark>G</mark> for \"still\" water! i thou<mark>G</mark> they meant tap water when i was asked (they only offered still or sparkling), so i was surprised to see the char<mark>G</mark> on the bill. oddly, they only served us the one bottle, then switched to tap water without asking us if we wanted another bottle of still water.", 
            "oh <mark>G</mark> ole <mark>G</mark>'s.  this place is le<mark>G</mark> and off the hook. this is a must try if you like italian food. \n\nfresh noodles, hi<mark>G</mark> quality cheeses, <mark>G</mark> service.... amazing. \n\nthe orzco meatballs... soft meat and the sauce was super <mark>G</mark>. <mark>G</mark> flavors. \n\n<mark>G's Baked Pasta</mark> of the day: lasa<mark>G</mark>- this little portion of lasa<mark>G</mark> was <mark>G</mark>! it had mushrooms in it and the noodles tasted adente. definitely worth the $24 \n\npasta carbonara- very standard carbonara. \n\npizza- the dou<mark>G</mark> was so li<mark>G</mark> and the cheese was so strin<mark>G</mark>. u<mark>G</mark> i wanted to eat all of it. soooooo <mark>G</mark>. <mark>G</mark> the pizza. \n\nsliders- these were the hi<mark>G</mark> for me. the meat was tender. the red pepper jam was amazing. these fried zucchini fries were soooooo <mark>G</mark>!!! ahhhhh i wanted to eat all the sliders! \n\ndessert- the lemon cookies and the peanut butter chocolate cookies. ok. seriously.... these stupid cookies are soooooo <mark>G</mark>!!!! different than all the other cookies i've had. it's so <mark>G</mark>. \n\n<mark>G</mark> place to eat! must eat.", 
            "this stop is a <mark>G</mark> on the strip. situated on the second floor of the cromwell hotel across las ve<mark>G</mark> blvd from caesar's palace, the view is excellent. depending on the time of day and your seating location you may even take in a view of the bella<mark>G</mark> fountain show. the service was a bit slow and we spent rou<mark>G</mark> 15 minutes there before anyone came to our table, but our server seemed to have a number of tables so we can certainly understand the delay. we were there for lunch and as this was a special occasion, we brou<mark>G</mark> our own bottle of wine. the corking fee was a bit hi<mark>G</mark> (but not for ve<mark>G</mark> prices) at $35, but it was still a steal considering that almost every wine on the list was an ultra premium wine. once we ordered, our food came out exceptionally fast. we hi<mark>G</mark> recommend the <mark>G's Baked Pasta</mark> of the day, the buratta cheese (buffalo mozzarella), <mark>Baby Sweet Peppers</mark> and <mark>Marinated Olives</mark>. our total dining experience lasted over 1 1/2 hrs. we were so fulfilled by the time we left. in the end, when our check came, we found that the corking fee was not on it. this may have been due to the fact that we bou<mark>G</mark> so many dishes during lunch or maybe our overwhelmed server simply for<mark>G</mark>, but we weren't complaining :) \n\ni would hi<mark>G</mark> recommend <mark>G</mark>'s for lunch!  all their food is fresh and homemade, which is somewhat rare these days, even on the strip.",

            "this my first and last review. i do not like to critic a fellow chef, but i have to speak up when i feel that our art and passion has <mark>G</mark> wrong. i will not comment more on the decor or the staff as this is obvious, rather more on culinary side.\n   my wife wanted to treat me to something special and we went to <mark>G</mark>'s. we looked over the menu and ordered something simple, the calamari salad, tricolour salad, and mar<mark>G</mark> pizzaette, which she and i wanted at the same time to share..\n   the calamari salad came 15 minutes later, in a little cup (did they use an ice cream scoop?). no thou<mark>G</mark> on presentation. the taste was fishy and overcooked rubber bands. 20 minutes, the tricolour arrived, avera<mark>G</mark> looking pile (did they use a funnel to shape it?) the procuitto was buried on the bottom and difficult to eat as they only <mark>G</mark> us a fork. took another 10 minutes to <mark>G</mark> a knife. the salad was bitter, too bitter, especially since the dates to cut the bitter were missing. using walnuts sounds <mark>G</mark>, unless you remember that the skin of walnuts are bitter too. 15 minutes later, we recieved the pizza, a $11.00- 4 1/2 inch dou<mark>G</mark> ball, that reminded me of my easy bake oven days. blond and thick, devoid of any pizza i've tried throu<mark>G</mark> italy. more like a focaccia with only the center of cheese and scant tomato.15 minutes later, the bread display arrives, which much fanfare. the flatbread was too thick and under baked, <mark>G</mark> one the impression that it was stale. the baked bread ball with rosemay was decent until you touched the bottom part, which someone salted salted the bottom. did someone for<mark>G</mark> that certain fresh herbs amplify salt? what a mouth of sea salt we <mark>G</mark> as if i dove in the ocean.\nluckily, i saved the last swallow of my beer to wash that down.\n  culinary training and oversi<mark>G</mark> by the sous chefs are very needed . alot of what i had <mark>G</mark> wrong could have been avoided with by one who is passionate about our craft. no mana<mark>G</mark> was even seen around, let alone stop by.\n  as i said earlier, it was my wife treating me, so her paying for this was hard as she had to work a whole day for our specail date.",

\"foodie\" circles. my <mark>G</mark> is he <mark>G</mark> to meet her (probably about three bottles into an early afternoon, knowing him) at any one of a half dozen food/ wine bacchanals across the u.s. and failed to impress her with his lv notoriety.\n\non to the subject at hand- the eponymous <mark>G</mark> at the re-opened and renovated cromwell (formerly bills, nee the barbary coast). while my not-so-esteemed hobby-critic non-professional is correct in his observance that the very affable ms. de laurentiis has never operated a restaurant, she does have a very real passion for food that her experience on the food network has translated into a somewhat new breed of culinary experience. as for how that translates into a commercial culinary operation, well, based on my experience, she's <mark>G</mark> the bulk of it fi<mark>G</mark> out. back to that later...\n\nas far as the experience went, the room's very much like its namesake- beautiful, but not in the <mark>G</mark> sense that pervades all thin<mark>G</mark> ve<mark>G</mark>, more along the lines of the <mark>G</mark>-next-door. bri<mark>G</mark> and airy, with clean lines, uncluttered space, and sparing us of overly-retro/ ironic furnishin<mark>G</mark> and paint schemes, it's simply a breath of fresh air. the only knock here is the hokey \"tour\" of the counter space that fronts the open space of the kitchen. better to let waiting <mark>G</mark> explore on their own and have friendly staff ask them if they have any questions with an appropriate table-side follow up, which, based on the service i received, would be proficiently, if not charmin<mark>G</mark>, executed.\n\nbevera<mark>G</mark>-wise (and all <mark>G</mark> meals' first course, is a bevera<mark>G</mark>, preferably somewhat strong drink), this place

they formed a <mark>G</mark> flavor canopy under which we stretched out, relaxed, and perused the bill of fare. which, with much confidence, our server, whose name has, for the moment escaped me, handled ably as my dining companion proceeded to order from both sides of the menu (the left side being more small plate/ anti-pasti driven, while the ri<mark>G</mark> side features lar<mark>G</mark>, heartier dishes), in the manner of a swat officer ran<mark>G</mark>-testing a new automatic weapon. as we awaited the various plates arrival, our sommelier approached. i informed her of the myriad and sundry plates on their way from the kitchen, and when she asked, \"do you want to <mark>G</mark> red or white?\" , my response, hedonist that i wish i to be,  was, both.\n\nas dishes arrived and were placed upon the table family style with well-enunciated descriptions, she returned with both, and they were perfect. a medium-li<mark>G</mark> bodied white and similar red with bri<mark>G</mark> acidity to keep flavors flowing and the flavors did just that- flowed deliciously. this is fresh, just off the <mark>G</mark> style cooking, reminiscent of backyard-dining at family <mark>G</mark>. except this was italian, unlike my family's tendency to flame-roasted flesh, potatoes, and fresh peas, re<mark>G</mark> of season. well, maybe the fresh peas re<mark>G</mark> the season...\n\nanyway, from the charred octupus to arancini, the flavors were bri<mark>G</mark> and strai<mark>G</mark>-forward. the only miss was a soup that i'm quite sure had been the result of an improperly followed recipe. call it the vulnerable moment that endeared me as i was happily overwhelmed by layers of excellence.\n\nas the lar<mark>G</mark> plates arrived, i a<mark>G</mark> beckoned the sommelier and asked her help along the same criteria, albeit with some bolder flavors and richer options, none of which missed the mark. i mi<mark>G</mark> add, she accomplished all of this with by-the-<mark>G</mark> offerin<mark>G</mark>. an aside- here's the true mark of a wine pro<mark>G</mark>- you should find every pairing you need for everything on the menu on their btg list. it's really not all that hard. anyway, the star of all those plates, and by \"star\" i mean alpha centauri compared to ve<mark>G</mark>, was the lemon spa<mark>G</mark>. perfectly cooked, perfect texture, perfectly balanced, it resulted in much discussion at our table about our own recipes for such and a \"throw-down\" challen<mark>G</mark>, of which i am a part. i look forward to repeated research outin<mark>G</mark> here...\n\ndessert too, was comfortable, fresh, and uncomplicated- a selection of <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> and some amazing chocolate cookies rounded it all out.\n\nwhich brin<mark>G</mark> me back to my point about this being ms. de laurentiis' first <mark>G</mark>- it's all about passion and professionalism, only one of which can be learned, but both can be hired. this place is in very capable hands...",

(she also ate the dates and she was stuffed) i don't eat meat so i couldn't taste any of it, but rave reviews and portion size <mark>G</mark>.\n\nmy pan seared salmon & summer succotash. i was in heaven. my favorite dish of all time. what a <mark>G</mark> combination of flavors. salmon cooked perfectly (medium, thank you). the edamame and corn was cooked perfectly, the worst is soft edamame, not this one-- perfect! that whole <mark>G</mark> mustard sauce, li<mark>G</mark> and delicious. i want to know what else is in that! i'm sure i will have dreams of this dish until i can make my way back to ve<mark>G</mark> to have it a<mark>G</mark>. side of potatoes, <mark>G</mark> must know my love for potatoes well. smashed then fried, topped with parm and lemon zest -- fantastic!!!\n\ndessert: peanut butter and jelly tiramisu -- wow, just wow. li<mark>G</mark> and airy cream, mellow pb flavor. amazin<mark>G</mark> delicious. my second fave was the lime & blackberry. flavors are amazing to<mark>G</mark>. \n\npolenta cake with strawberries. seriously, what's in that strawberry sauce? i am not the bi<mark>G</mark> strawberry fan, but if someone put that in front of me, i would not turn down a bite. i was expecting the polenta cake to be .. hmm maybe <mark>G</mark>, dense? but no! li<mark>G</mark>, airy, yum!!!!!\n\ni also tried an espresso, nutella shot drink. i am an espresso lover, that drink needs to be served in a latte cup cause that was just a tease :)\n\ni can't wait til i can come back. sad <mark>G</mark> left the ni<mark>G</mark> before we had dinner, but so <mark>G</mark> when the boss is away they still can keep everything up to par. amazing, thank you!!!", 
            "this review is personally for <mark>G</mark>.\n\nupon arriving to <mark>G</mark>, i was met by at least 8 hostesses standing there all wearing the same maternal looking black dress and ill fitting heels. \n\nthen we were met by eclectic decor and wrinkled table clothes. \n\nshortly after we were seated we were <mark>G</mark> by our waiter and another <mark>G</mark> saying she would also be helping. the waiter told us that all the appetizers and drinks were on the ipad. using an ipad cheapened the experience for me and the authenticity of the restaurant. just because restaurants are starting to implement ipads does not mean it works in a fine dining setting. and to make thin<mark>G</mark> worse the ipad froze multiple times. i also thou<mark>G</mark> it was a little tacky when the waitress put the price fix menu on our table. it's okay to su<mark>G</mark> it but to have a whole folder that takes up half the table is too in your face especially on ones first visit. we decided a<mark>G</mark> the price fix until we knew the food was worth the price. \n\n15 minutes after sitting down there was still no bread brou<mark>G</mark> to our table so i requested some from our waiter. he comes back with three different bread choices and a side of toppin<mark>G</mark>. i was surprised that the one topping i did not see was parmesan. the bread was very underwhelming but i did enjoy dipping the breadsticks into the pesto. \n\ni ordered the caponata and the spa<mark>G</mark> with shrimp lemon and basil. my dining partner ordered the bucatini for her main. \n\nbefore the caponata came our waiter said caponata is usually served with bread but <mark>G</mark>'s is li<mark>G</mark> enou<mark>G</mark> to be eaten on its own. while the caponata was not heavy it was still a little much eating it on its own. the spa<mark>G</mark> i ordered was solid even thou<mark>G</mark> it could have used a little more seasoning. the shrimp was some of the lar<mark>G</mark> i have scene however it was sitting in what seemed to be a small puddle of blood and this turned me off. i tried my friends bucatini and ending up like hers more and she liked mine more so we traded. the bucatini pasta was well cooked but the sauce was undeveloped. \n\nwe ordered the cookies to <mark>G</mark> for dessert and they were <mark>G</mark>. my favorite was the palmier.",

            "this place is off to a <mark>G</mark> start considering how ambitious the menu is, how lar<mark>G</mark> the dining room is, and how absolutely slammed busy it is every second it is open. the only issues we had were with pacing--all of our smaller plates came out in a hurry, then there was a loooooooooong wait for the final lar<mark>G</mark> plates. well, there was also a minor issue with the staff not knowing which of the coffees were and were not available in decaf. \n\nthe place was full, but we were seated immediately upon arriving for our 7:45 reservation. the room is arran<mark>G</mark> comfortably and even thou<mark>G</mark> it's busy, the tables are far enou<mark>G</mark> apart that there's a busy hum without being too loud. i think you would probably have to be ri<mark>G</mark> on the windows to have much bella<mark>G</mark> fountain view, but it was also very pleasant to watch the crescent moon rise over caesars from our table. \n\nthe bread service is excellent, with crunchy breadsticks, a flatbread, and a life-chan<mark>G</mark> rosemary focaccia. it also comes with multiple condiments, like pink himalayan salt, chili pepper flakes, lemon ricotta and basil pesto. (we actually used the condiments throu<mark>G</mark> our meal, which was fun.)\n\nfor the small plates, we had the oyster crudo, the charred octopus, the <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> and some of the re<mark>G</mark> cheese. every one was excellent except the octopus, which was tou<mark>G</mark> in some bites and could have used a bit more seasoning. (but maybe the bar had just been set impossibly hi<mark>G</mark> the previous ni<mark>G</mark>, when i had the best octopus i've ever eaten at, surprisin<mark>G</mark>, carnevino.) the <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> displaced the albondi<mark>G</mark> at julian serrano for me as the best meatballs in ve<mark>G</mark>. if they had been any more moist, they would not have been able to hold their shape and they burst with flavor. \n\nfor the lar<mark>G</mark> dishes, we had the lemon spa<mark>G</mark> (with shrimp as big as lobster tails) and the branzino with tan<mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark>. they were both wonderful. we were so full we decided to fore<mark>G</mark> dessert. \n\nlots of thou<mark>G</mark> has obviously <mark>G</mark> into the menu, as there is a wide ran<mark>G</mark> of dishes and every plate is beautifully presented on dishware that looks like it was selected to suit the individual dish. service throu<mark>G</mark> was smooth and attentive (i think they would rather die than let a water <mark>G</mark> be empty) and quite knowled<mark>G</mark> about the menu except for the decaf issue.\n\noverall, i do plan to <mark>G</mark> back next time i'm in ve<mark>G</mark>. the menu is set up (and priced) so that you can sample a variety of items without breaking the bank. for two people, we had cocktails (love the ipad cocktail menu with pictures), wine, four smaller plates and two lar<mark>G</mark> plates and with tax and tip it was $252. i consider that perfectly reasonable for an event restaurant of this quality in this location.", 
            "went here on the opening weekend, and everything seemed to be <mark>G</mark> off without a hitch! reservations are required; my <mark>G</mark> made ours months in advance due to the <mark>G</mark> opening. while waiting for the table, we took pictures at the photo booth which was cool. when the hostess sat us, she <mark>G</mark> us a mini tour of the prep areas where they make the hand made pasta, <mark>Marinated Olives</mark>, pizza, focaccia, etc. everything is fresh and looks amazing!\n\nwe had a seat near the opened window, overlooking the strip and the bella<mark>G</mark> fountain. our server was very personable and knowled<mark>G</mark>, i'd expect nothing less. he brou<mark>G</mark> us probably the best tasting focaccia i've ever had, and we ordered the sausa<mark>G</mark> stuffed dates as an appetizer; also amazing. perfect combination of salty, sweet and spicy. \n\nfor the entr\\u00e9e, i ordered the branzino and my <mark>G</mark> had the spring pea and panceta tortellini. the branzino was perfectly cooked, and the citrus sauce and aru<mark>G</mark> salad made it very refreshing. the tortellini was fantastic, and i'm not one that likes peas.\n\nfinally, desert came and i wasn't expecting much. we ordered the tiramisu which came in layered shot <mark>G</mark>. my nonna makes <mark>G</mark> tiramisu, so i had hi<mark>G</mark> expectations. there were three flavors: pb&j, chocolate and blackberry lime. all three were delicious, but pb&j was the best! we ordered mochas as well, extremely decadent and <mark>G</mark> with <mark>G</mark>'s si<mark>G</mark> \"g\" in chocolate. a pretty heavy desert but well worth it. \n\noverall, just a <mark>G</mark> experience in terms of food and service. <mark>G</mark> even came to our table and talked with us for a little. <mark>G</mark> say, it was pretty unfor<mark>G</mark>, will definitely be <mark>G</mark> back!", 
            "ok so this is so past due for me to do a review as i'm a re<mark>G</mark> here now. this place from the very start has far exceeded my expectations of how a celebrity chef restaurant should be. the decor and furnishing is very ele<mark>G</mark>, trendy but a hip vibe. food quality, taste, and presentation is what you would expect of a 5 star quality restaurant and presented as masterpieces of  art worthy of any food ma<mark>G</mark> photos. the atmosphere is very open especially with the open balcony windows. main thing that keeps a re<mark>G</mark> foodie like myself coming to hi<mark>G</mark> end establishments like this would be the friendliness and accommodating staff. as you come off the escalators to the restaurant you are warmly <mark>G</mark> by beautiful hostesses who would welcome you to <mark>G</mark>'s and <mark>G</mark> you a tour of the restaurant starting from the antipasta bar to the fire ovens to the bar and throu<mark>G</mark> the dining area. <mark>G</mark> has said she desi<mark>G</mark> the restaurant to <mark>G</mark> her <mark>G</mark> a feeling of being invited into her own home. she may not always be there but the <mark>G</mark> hostesses certainly do a <mark>G</mark> job in welcoming you. fyi <mark>G</mark> is there often at times and when she is she does take the time to walk around and min<mark>G</mark> and talk to <mark>G</mark>, take photos and such. i had the pleasure of meeting her the ni<mark>G</mark> before my birthday. bartenders and other staff are very firefly and out<mark>G</mark>. my second visit there the staff had already remembered my name what i drank and ate and more about me. to me service like that is reason enou<mark>G</mark> to become a weekly re<mark>G</mark>. they are also very knowled<mark>G</mark> about your menu items both food and drink menu. my favorite bartender would be kate the stunning blonde bartender from asu in phoenix (yes i do <mark>G</mark> to know the staff too lol) my second visit i was warmly <mark>G</mark> by avi the mana<mark>G</mark> really an awesome <mark>G</mark> too <mark>G</mark> to know him!! as i conclude writing this review i am now <mark>G</mark> in the mood to <mark>G</mark> there ri<mark>G</mark> now!!!", 
            "so i'm not <mark>G</mark> lie, i'm a little biased, i love her. she is my favorite chef on food network. i was excited to try this place, at first i planned to wait a few months and let all the hype die down, but when my friend scored us a 7p reservation, i chan<mark>G</mark> my mind pretty quickly. \n\nwhen we arrived, we waited way passed our reservation time, only to find out <mark>G</mark> was in the house, so people were staying lon<mark>G</mark> at their tables. as soon as we walked in, she was there taking pics with people on their way out. \n\nwe were started with a tour of the restaurant and the prep area, which was fun to see. our table could not have been in a better spot. perfect view of the strip and the bella<mark>G</mark> fountains. <mark>G</mark> immediately by our waiter who <mark>G</mark> us a quick rundown of the ipad cocktail menu, we all started out with a si<mark>G</mark> cocktail.  something different for everyone, and every sin<mark>G</mark> person enjoyed their drinks. i tried the destroyer, clase azul tequila reposado, tan<mark>G</mark>, oran<mark>G</mark> and basil, basil ice sphere, as well as the la strada, campari, homemade lemon sorbeto, berta<mark>G</mark> limoncello, proseco, and (don't jud<mark>G</mark>) barbarella, tanqueray #10, oran<mark>G</mark> spice <mark>G</mark> beer, fresh lemon, basil foam (this was my favorite).  \n\ni was excited to see they offered a tasting menu but to my disappointment, we were informed the way they have their tasting menu set up is a family style, so everyone at the table is required to order the tasting menu. so we went with the ori<mark>G</mark> plan of ordering something different for everyone to try. we started our with their amazing bread basket, i was more obsessed with the condiments that it came with, the lemon butter and the dried capers with my favorite. onto the apps, we couldn't decide so we ordered multiple. the lar<mark>G</mark> appetizer platter was big enou<mark>G</mark> for 5 people and it had a little but of everything. i had picked the oysters crudo, which were fantastic, the burrata, amazing, lobster arancini, best arancini i have had. i could have stopped at the apps and been happy. \n\ni ori<mark>G</mark> had planned to <mark>G</mark> the lemon spa<mark>G</mark>, but then i wanted the branzino, so our waiter told me to order the branzino and i could have the spa<mark>G</mark> as a side. perfect! this dish was executed to perfection. i love seabass, this had a perfect char on the skin, and the lemon spa<mark>G</mark> is as <mark>G</mark> as everyone says. the shrimp was as big as my palm.  my friends rack of lamb was my favorite. i would order this next time. the ribeye was cooked perfectly too. tons of sides! ravioli, crispy polenta, aspara<mark>G</mark>, and lemon potatoes. \n\nnext up, the dessert tray. i was so full by the time this came around, but we still indul<mark>G</mark>. she has some really unique desserts.\n\nservice was excellent, our server was very attentive, as well as everyone else that helped him out.\n\nhi<mark>G</mark> of my ni<mark>G</mark>, she came around to the table and spoke with us about our meal. she was so personable and nice, upon leaving, i was able to take a picture with her. totally made my ni<mark>G</mark>.", 
            "first off, there isn't a restaurant in the world that is trying harder!  from the hostess that bumped somebody over so we could sit at the bar, to the mana<mark>G</mark> who came over and introduced himself, to the bartender chris who wickedly and seamlessly substituted the vodka redbull that i ori<mark>G</mark> ordered for the vodka concoction he prepared in its place, to the expediter that explained the salt and chili accompaniment to the bread, service and attention to detail off the charts.  \n\nnow the food.  we only sampled <mark>G</mark> favorite platter, a $50.00 sampling of <mark>Baby Sweet Peppers</mark>, stuffed dates, and the antipasto assortment of calamari, ahi crostini, etc., and while nothing was bad, nothing really crushed it for us either.  the bread presentation is a lot of sizzle and less steak, even with the fresh rosemary bread they bake in a ramekin.  probably not fair to rate a restaurant on one appetizer plate but this was all we ordered.\n\ni was really struck by the attention to detail everywhere.  servers looking at <mark>G</mark> to see if they needed polishing, bartenders wiping off the side of the <mark>G</mark> because a bit of foam trickled down, etc..they have assembled a terrific team, and this is obviously not the case of a celebrity chef just stamping their name on the front door, but a labor of love by an obvious perfectionist who has invested a bunch of blood, sweat, and tears and isnt about to let someone else screw it up.",

            "dropped by this little joint for lunch yesterday.  the restaurant has been open for about six weeks but has only been serving lunch since last wednesday.  the mana<mark>G</mark> told me that reservations are pretty much required for dinner but lunch is easier to drop by and eat.  i'm <mark>G</mark> it's because people are sleeping off the prior ni<mark>G</mark>'s festivities.  \n\nfirst off, the staff is very friendly and attentive.  the tables by the windows have a <mark>G</mark> view of the strip.  there is a nice loun<mark>G</mark> area between the tables and the bar.  \n\nthe lunch menu is smaller than the dinner menu, serving antipasti, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches.  oh yeah, desert too. :-) \n\nstarted off with a <mark>G</mark> of red win san<mark>G</mark>.  very tasty but a little on the expensive side.  first to arrive was very <mark>G</mark> bread served with an equally tasty pesto.\n\ni had the <mark>Wood Roasted Mushrooms</mark> for my antipasti.  it was oyster mushrooms with toasted marcona almonds and ricotta salata.  very <mark>G</mark> antipasti.  i really like marcona almonds because they are so buttery but i felt the flavor <mark>G</mark> a little lost in this dish.\n\nnext was the carbonara pizza.  basically it was a <mark>G</mark> italian breakfast pizza.  it was topped with two fried e<mark>G</mark> and prosciutto (i think it was <mark>Prosciutto San Daniele</mark>), and black pepper.  the dou<mark>G</mark> was not very thick, the prosciutto was flavorful without being too salty, and the yolk running off the sides added to the flavor.  overall an excellent dish!\n\ni wanted a li<mark>G</mark> desert so i ordered the sorbet and <mark>G</mark>.  my mistake!  it came with a small scoop of each flavor: strawberry sorbet, banana sorbet, chocolate <mark>G</mark> and white chocolate <mark>G</mark>.  the sorbets were li<mark>G</mark> and full of the fruit flavors.  the <mark>G</mark> were also very flavorful and insanely rich!\n\nthe presentations for lunch were pretty strai<mark>G</mark> forward.  i'm <mark>G</mark> dinners plates come out a little more artistically.  i <mark>G</mark> i have to come back for dinner and find out.\n\nso make a reservation, come to ve<mark>G</mark>, and enjoy!", 
            "we were super excited to try this place and went without a reservation at about 11:30am.  the polite hostesses told us to come back in about a half an hour, which was no problem - i assumed the restaurant would be crowded and busy, as it just opened.  when we returned, we waited a little lon<mark>G</mark>, then were seated near the bar.  the restaurant has an amazing view of the strip, but we couldn't see anything from our table.  the restaurant was about half empty, leading me to believe this was more of a soft open - i know they haven't been open for lunch long.\n\nservice was very friendly.  i had the prosecco san<mark>G</mark>, which was delicious, and we had some fantastic <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark>.  the bread they brou<mark>G</mark> out at the be<mark>G</mark> of the meal was absolutely wonderful, thou<mark>G</mark> a bit <mark>G</mark>. i was very disappointed to see that there was only one pasta dish on the menu for lunch - i thou<mark>G</mark> for sure <mark>G</mark> was famous for her delicious pasta dishes!  i couldn't order the <mark>G's Baked Pasta</mark>, as it contains pork, so i went for the <mark>Lemon Pesto <mark>G</mark> Cheese</mark>, served with spiralized zucchini and potatoes.  it was quite <mark>G</mark>, but it took a really, really long time to come out.  like, probably 40 minutes.  it's a <mark>Lemon Pesto <mark>G</mark> Cheese</mark>!  we were <mark>G</mark> pretty antsy - not to mention hun<mark>G</mark> - and we prefer spending our time wandering around ve<mark>G</mark>, not sitting in a booth.\n\nmy husband ordered the muffeletta sandwich, a wed<mark>G</mark> of bread with various cured meats.  we later realized this sandwich is premade and is sitting with the antipasto items in the front deli case area.  why did it take 40 minutes to put a premade sandwich on a plate with salad?  he found the bread somewhat so<mark>G</mark>, likely because it's premade.  it didn't take long after we left the restaurant for my husband to start to feel ill and nauseous; he ended up out of commission the rest of the day.  i'm not sure how long the sandwiches were sitting in the case, but it mi<mark>G</mark> have been just a touch too long.  he had not eaten anything else that day save a banana, and he hadn't had anything to drink but water.\n\nthe wait staff was very kind and attentive every step of the way.  however, it appears that they just haven't worked out lunch yet.  i would not return.",

            "i have been anxiously waiting to try <mark>G</mark> ever since they've opened. i'm not sure if it was the hype of a new restaurant opening on the strip or my fanatical love for <mark>G</mark> and her recipes, but i sadly left <mark>G</mark> feeling less than satisfied. first of all, i have to mention that i went to <mark>G</mark> during their lunch service, which to my knowled<mark>G</mark>, had only started a few days earlier. the lunch menu did not appeal to me as much as the dinner menu but i fi<mark>G</mark> any meal would still be amazing. i'm a little disappointed that they mostly offer salads and sandwiches since i adore carbs and love me some pasta. they had one pasta on the menu and their specialty pasta that day was lasa<mark>G</mark>. i'm thinking that i made the mistake of expecting too much and letting my anticipation <mark>G</mark> the best of me. \n\nfirst off, i love the cromwell. we hit valet and took about a 5-minute stroll throu<mark>G</mark> the casino, which was beautifully redone (i hadn't been to the cromwell since their opening). i heard that their <mark>G</mark>, semi-vinta<mark>G</mark> chandeliers were found in the former barbary coast stora<mark>G</mark> and were refurbished and <mark>G</mark> a little facelift to match the d\\u00e9cor of the cromwell. and they are just stunning! they <mark>G</mark> off a red hue that makes the casino feel more intimate and exclusive. i immediately felt like i was the star of a seductive music video and i should've been walking in slow motion. anyway, back to <mark>G</mark>. you take an escalator up to the restaurant (or approx. two fli<mark>G</mark> of stairs if you dare) and are <mark>G</mark> by very cute hostesses in classy but fun and flirty (almost mesh see-throu<mark>G</mark>) bcbg-like dresses. they have a charming waiting area with a cozy \"home & <mark>G</mark>\" touch and...a secret photo booth! well, it's not so secret, but it's a little closet-sized room hidden behind heavy curtains. you can take a picture of you and your date and automatically upload it to your facebook or have it emailed to you!\n\nthe interior of <mark>G</mark> is beautiful. i love the fresh market feel at the entrance of the venue and the open layout of the restaurant. every table had a view from any point of the restaurant since the windows face out onto las ve<mark>G</mark> blvd. and flamin<mark>G</mark>. the d\\u00e9cor is appealing, with wood floors / tables and the furnishing reminds me of being at home. the dayli<mark>G</mark> streams throu<mark>G</mark> the restaurant which li<mark>G</mark> up the venue in a bri<mark>G</mark> but delicate way. i wasn't too fond of the <mark>G</mark> (the water <mark>G</mark> reminded me of candleholders) and some of the bowls kind of flopped over on its side easily, which i ima<mark>G</mark> mi<mark>G</mark> conclude in a lot of broken <mark>G</mark> and spilled food. but enou<mark>G</mark> about that, and on to the food. the house bread that they brou<mark>G</mark> out was okay, very similar to a pizzeta but the thing that made it amazing was the pesto dipping sauce that accompanied it. \n\nrated on a scale of 1-10:\n\n10 - burrata cheese w/ balsamic-salt (really <mark>G</mark>, but it's hard to mess up burrata cheese)\n10 - <mark>Prosciutto San Daniele</mark> (also really <mark>G</mark>, but hard to mess up and was served with your everyday, avera<mark>G</mark> \"french's\" mustard?)\n1 - <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> w/ roasted wild mushrooms (horribly dry and the marsala was watery)\n5 - carbonara pizza (just made me feel like i was eating more house bread since the toppin<mark>G</mark> were very minimal)\n5 - italian cookies for dessert (this was recommended to us by the server, but i think my cookies are better - lemon cookies were the best)\n\nall in all, my meal was just sub-par for me. a lot of my collea<mark>G</mark> have a<mark>G</mark> that their experience was either similar or worse. just to <mark>G</mark> you an idea on pricing, i ordered two <mark>G</mark> of wine along with our food and our total bill came to $130.00 before <mark>G</mark>. i'm still optimistic that dinner mi<mark>G</mark> be better so i'll have to come back to try that and <mark>G</mark> an updated review.",

            "i went a couple of weeks a<mark>G</mark> for my bachelorette while stating at the cromwell. everything about my dining experience at <mark>G</mark> was amazing! we arrived a few minutes before our reservation and while we waited we were shown to the photo booth to entertain us. we were then promptly sat - waited on a team of servers that were exceptional all the recommendations (bacon wrapped fi<mark>G</mark>, lemon pasta with prawns, prosciutto) was beyond delicious- we just ordered a bunch of items and shared family style to <mark>G</mark> the most out of the menu- i recommend doing that since so everything's so <mark>G</mark>. the cocktails were also <mark>G</mark>, always had drink and water refills, staff was very accommodating, friendly, helpful without feeling like they were pushing expensive dishes. and we had a view of the bella<mark>G</mark> fountains :) best dining experience in ve<mark>G</mark> that weekend, and many were <mark>G</mark>!", 
            "spectacular. i wish i could <mark>G</mark> it 10 stars! everything from the service to the food was outstanding. <mark>G</mark> drink, delicious bread with pesto and a killer carbonara pizza. i will definitely return.", 
            "dang, i want to <mark>G</mark> this place four stars, but i can't.  the food is just too <mark>G</mark>.  why four?  my wife and i had a reservation for 8:45 this past saturday for our 11th anniversary.  we arrived early, at about 8:20.  we ended up waiting until 9:25 to be seated.  no hu<mark>G</mark> deal, but the female front of house mana<mark>G</mark> came up to us at about 9:10 and said she would comp our first round of drinks.  it never happened.  it also took us about 15 minutes to <mark>G</mark> our first drinks once seated.  i <mark>G</mark> it, it's new and it was saturday ni<mark>G</mark>.  \n\nas for the food?  crazy.  crazy <mark>G</mark>.  it made me for<mark>G</mark> about the rou<mark>G</mark> start immediately.  we had four courses, each as <mark>G</mark> as the other.  we started with an salami dish that came with pickled cherries, apricot, and two kinds of mustard.  sounds odd, but you roll them all up into one bite and you understand why they make it.  i was shocked how well they balanced each other out.  \n\nsecond we had <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> with roasted wild mushrooms.  i thou<mark>G</mark> i knew what marsala was supposed to taste like...nope.  this was far better than any meatball and sauce i have ever had.  how did they make <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> taste that <mark>G</mark>???\n\nthird we had pasta (bucatini calabrian chili pomodoro & fresh ricotta) .  it was just as <mark>G</mark>, and now i understand why fresh pasta is key.  this dish will finally <mark>G</mark> me to break down and buy the pasta attachment for my kitchenaid mixer.  \n\nthe main course we decided on was the whole roasted chicken for two, cacciatore style.  first off, they bring the chicken in a lar<mark>G</mark> bowl to you from the kitchen, uncut for your inspection.  they take it back at that point and cut it for you.  this <mark>G</mark> you time to wipe the drool up.  the flavor was amazing, and had a smoked paprika rub.  the cacciatore sauce was perfect.  \n\non the side we had crispy polenta with checca sauce.  i have never had polenta, so i did not know what to expect.  i was expecting something close to <mark>G</mark>, but this was so much more.  the texture was like silk, and the flavor was mild and tasty.  \n\nthis meal was worth the wait and the price.", 
            "excellent service, and almost perfect food. a big fan of <mark>G</mark> as well since i watch food network a lot. \n\narrived at ve<mark>G</mark> and this was our first stop due to our reservations. a remodel hotel that has <mark>G</mark> ri<mark>G</mark> at the 2nd floor. if you wait outside the restaurant, there is a photo booth for you to take pictures. yes i said it, they so ballin' that they have a photo booth to use(too bad i hate taking pictures or else i'll be all over that haha). \n\nanyway, when you first walk in, you can see all their different kind of homemade pastas and it's kinda an open kitchen sort of way. <mark>G</mark> by our server that thorou<mark>G</mark> explain the items on the menus and cocktails. you have an electronic(ipad) menu. we decided to order the tasting menu(i for<mark>G</mark> the name), two appetizers, two pastas, and two entrees. the mana<mark>G</mark> came up to us and check on us which was awesome. we were also <mark>G</mark> complimentary drinks which was an extra +. it was a sweet wine drink that was <mark>G</mark> to us topped with lemon. sooooo <mark>G</mark>. not sure why they <mark>G</mark> us the drinks(maybe cause they're barely open)\n\ni love the hot bread that they <mark>G</mark> you. althou<mark>G</mark>, i can't eat too much of that because it's such a heavy filling bread. \n\n<mark>G</mark> broccoli rabe w/ calabrian chili vinai<mark>G</mark> - nothing too special but i do like the chili oil sauce on it. plus, it's <mark>G</mark> to have some kind of ve<mark>G</mark>. \n\nfinocchiona - the salami. it was enriched with flavors. topped with <mark>G</mark> and apple. <mark>G</mark> wonderfully to<mark>G</mark>. \n\nthe sampler came with <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> w/ roasted wild mushrooms, citrus marinated calamari salad w/ sundried tomatoes & olives, lobster arancini w/ calabrian chili pomodoro & basil aioli, and shrimps. we ordered the medium size one. \n\ni don't know if it's me personally but i was really dis<mark>G</mark> by the <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark>. i thou<mark>G</mark> it had a really stran<mark>G</mark> flavor to it and this is probably the thing i don't ever want a<mark>G</mark> at <mark>G</mark> + the lobster fritter thing. the lobster thing was so so. i felt like it tasted better than it looked. i liked everything else after that. they had this shrimp that was marinated in a salad sauce that was really <mark>G</mark>. they <mark>G</mark> you jumbo shrimps because the shrimps were fucking hu<mark>G</mark>. it was really tasty. the cucumber frittes/fries were addictive and so was the calamari.\n\npersonally, the two thin<mark>G</mark> that i loved the most was the two pastas. ravioli (rah-veeoh-lee) lobster, aspara<mark>G</mark> tips & tarra<mark>G</mark>  and the *spa<mark>G</mark> (spah-<mark>G</mark>-tee) shrimp, lemon & basil. the ravioli was <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark>. the skin was perfect and the inside was filled with lobster. i recommend eating it as a whole bite because if you tried to eat it piece by piece, the sauce comes out from the ravioli making it less flavorful and tasty. the *spa<mark>G</mark> (spah-<mark>G</mark>-tee) shrimp, lemon & basil was really amazing. it seems so simple but the spa<mark>G</mark> was soo <mark>G</mark>. it tasted fresh and they had fresh shrimp that compliments it well. the lemon and basil wasn't too strong which made me love the dish. i recommend people to <mark>G</mark> their pastas...it was heavenly. \n\nthe two entrees were lovely as well. the waiter described the salmon as one of the best salmon you can <mark>G</mark> and i think he was ri<mark>G</mark>. it was so juicy and it was cooked perfectly. it seemed like it was still a little raw but i think it was meant to be like that because it just add another layer to the dish. i could do without the succotash. \n\nthe veal was really <mark>G</mark> as well. it was fried perfectly. if you cut it, the juices flows out. look at pictures and it is topped with cheese on top. a really heavy dish.\n\noh and the other thing i didn't like about <mark>G</mark> was the side dish sweet corn & spicy sausa<mark>G</mark> . i think it was a personal thing but i thou<mark>G</mark> the corn wasn't cooked all the way. the sausa<mark>G</mark> tasted fine and all but the corn had a nasty texture to it. \n\nbesides that, i recommend <mark>G</mark> to all people. i can't wait to come back a<mark>G</mark> the next time and trying more of their pastas and hoping to meet <mark>G</mark> herself. excellent experience with amazing food and service! cheers", 
            "i loved everything about this restaurant--especially the customer centered service.  oh, the food was outstanding.  every bite was delicious.  however, it it the \"people\" who make this a <mark>G</mark> experience and a tribute to <mark>G</mark>'s name.\n\nfrom the moment you are <mark>G</mark> at the top of the escalator until you pay your check (very reasonable prices for the hi<mark>G</mark> quality of food), you understand that the people working there are really happy to be there and to be of service to you.  they are ri<mark>G</mark> there for your every need and request.\n\nmy hat <mark>G</mark> off to the mana<mark>G</mark> of <mark>G</mark>, as he is doing a difficult job and <mark>G</mark> a 10 star result.",

            "eh. went in mid july for our 1 year wedding anniversary dinner. tried to book reservations 2 weeks before we <mark>G</mark> to ve<mark>G</mark>, but they were all booked. (this was before <mark>G</mark> was open for lunch). my hubby and i were waking past the cromwell (please see separate review) and we wandered upstairs to <mark>G</mark> a look at <mark>G</mark>'s. we were able to make a reservation a week in advance for dinner at 9:30pm on a monday. upon making the reservation, the hostess asks if we will be celebrating anything special. i tell her its our anniversary. (thinking maybe <mark>G</mark> will come say hi?!). they were very vocal in telling us about the dress code. however, as we arrived in our sunday best. people strolled in wearing sneakers, shorts, and maxi dresses from the pool...the ni<mark>G</mark> of our reservation, we arrive a few minutes early. there is a free photo booth there that was a fun and free souvenir. the open concept kitchen as you walk into the dining room is <mark>G</mark>. fresh antipasti station, fresh pasta being handmade, bread being baked... the room itself is beautiful. very white, very chi chi. very manhattan pretentious. when you are first seated, the waiter brin<mark>G</mark> you a menu with \"<mark>G</mark>'s selections\". this menu is several courses meant to work to<mark>G</mark> that <mark>G</mark> arran<mark>G</mark> to compliment eachother. this was $120 pp. we weren't interested in eating all that. the waiter brou<mark>G</mark> over an ipad to take drink and antipast orders. i didn't want to drink and the (3) choices of antipast did not impress me. i was praying the whole menu wasn't on an ipad because this layout was so annoying to use. finally the waiter comes back with a real menu. i am a major foodie (please see all my reviews), and it took me forever to find something i was interested in eating. this rarely (if ever) happens to me. <mark>G</mark> raved and raved about having \"<mark>G</mark> free food\", so we expected to see <mark>G</mark> pasta. nope. her <mark>G</mark> foods were meat and ve<mark>G</mark>, which by the <mark>G</mark> of <mark>G</mark>, are <mark>G</mark> already. that was a disappointment. a<mark>G</mark>, it  took forever to fi<mark>G</mark> out what to order. <mark>G</mark>'s italian food is not your \"traditional\" italian food. (ex spa<mark>G</mark> and meatballs, manicotti, braciole, red sauce, etc). for traditional, amazing,  italian food, please see my review for buddy v's. her food is more mediterranean italian- lots of lemon, fennel- very different recipes and combinations of food. i felt lost and unfamiliar with the menu. we wound up ordering <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark>, shrimp scampi with marscapone cheese, and we each had a salad. the meatballs were excellent. shrimp scampi was very different. not at all <mark>G</mark>, which is often synonymous with scampi. salads were <mark>G</mark>. they bring out a big selection of bread to the table, with pesto dip and several other dips, and that was <mark>G</mark>. the only thing i entertained <mark>G</mark> as an entree was the rack of lamb, but it was $45, and something i make at home. i wanted something different. for dessert they bring over an entire cart of desserts- from homemade <mark>G</mark>, to cookies, to pastries... we had cappuccinos and tiramasu. i had traditional tiramasu and my husband had peanut butter & jelly tiramasu. those were amazing. it was extra cool that <mark>G</mark> was there that ni<mark>G</mark> cooking, and coming out to tables in the dining room to talk with patrons. they seemed to send her out to select tables, aka hi<mark>G</mark> rollers, as she didn't <mark>G</mark> around the room to all. that wasn't cool. it was very cool to see her in person, as i am a big fan of her shows, but being the anniversary and all, she could have stopped by. i wonder why they even asked that...we felt it was a little too much for us. we are laid back people that enjoy casual places. not enou<mark>G</mark> offerin<mark>G</mark> on the menu for our palette. we <mark>G</mark> to ve<mark>G</mark> every year, and i don't think we would <mark>G</mark> back. for 2 people for 2 appertizers, 2 salads and 2 desserts with cappuccino, it was over $100. portions are small.", 
            "we made a reservation about 1 month in advance for our dinner at <mark>G</mark>'s. my husband and i were celebrating our 10 year anniversary and my mother joined us for our meal (her treat which was awesome). our seating time was @5:15, and we arrived a few mins early so we stood and looked at the different pictures and such on the walls before being seated. we were <mark>G</mark> a tour of the stations and explained what each person was doing. we were seated in the corner, kind of like a little private space, it was really nice. the windows were shut and blinds pulled because the sun just pounds that space from about 5:00-7:00. once 7:00 hit, they raised the shades so you could look outside. upon being seated, we were <mark>G</mark> by our server who was very very very knowled<mark>G</mark> about everything. he showed us the i-pad with the drinks and such. also, we had a lady who would fill our waters and <mark>G</mark> new plates and such for courses. she was so kind, we warned her we were extremely thirsty as we had played tennis at the cosmo that day and she sure made her promise of never leaving us with an empty water <mark>G</mark>. the <mark>G</mark> mana<mark>G</mark> also came by to introduce us and to wish us a happy anniversary. \n\nwe choose the following 3 drinks to kind of \"share\" and \"try\"........\n\n#1 hannibal: botran reserve rum, maurin quina, fresh lime, blood oran<mark>G</mark> and mint syrup, chianti float. it was served in a <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> with crushed ice. the chianti float was served in a lime turned inside out. \n\n#2 la strada: campari, homemade lemon sorbeto, berta<mark>G</mark> limoncello, proseco. this was the li<mark>G</mark> of the drinks. very refreshing.\n\n#3 the destroyer (conan the destroyer)\nclase azul tequila reposado, fresh tan<mark>G</mark>, oran<mark>G</mark> and basil, basil ice sphere. this was the stron<mark>G</mark> and my husbands favorite. \n\nwe then choose 3 apps to share:\n\n#1 <mark>Wood Roasted Mushrooms</mark> w/ toasted marcona almonds & ricotta salata. very <mark>G</mark>, <mark>G</mark> assortment of different mushrooms.\n\n#2 *rollatini - ricotta stuffed e<mark>G</mark> & pomodoro. very small but very <mark>G</mark>.\n\n#3 calabrese, spicy calabrian chili, the ori<mark>G</mark> pepperoni, pork. when ordered, this was my least favorite but ended up being very very <mark>G</mark>.\n\n#4 (just my husband) pasta e fa<mark>G</mark> w/ creste di <mark>G</mark>, cannellini & parmi<mark>G</mark>-re<mark>G</mark> (soup)\n\nmy husband and mother shared the assortment of breads and breadsticks as i cannot eat them because of wheat aller<mark>G</mark>. they were very kind in asking if it was ok if they brou<mark>G</mark> the bread out as i could not have it. \n\nwe then choose 2 pasta courses to share. i am <mark>G</mark> free, so the knowled<mark>G</mark> the server had about it was wonderful. \n\n#1 *spa<mark>G</mark> (spah-<mark>G</mark>-tee) shrimp, lemon & basil made with their house made <mark>G</mark> free pasta. it was excellent. i always <mark>G</mark> worried ordering <mark>G</mark> free pasta as its usually just an afterthou<mark>G</mark>. the server assured me that <mark>G</mark> would not put something on the menu she was not confident was the best. let me tell you this was the best <mark>G</mark> free pasta i have ever had. i could tell the time and perfection that went into it. that ni<mark>G</mark>, the <mark>G</mark> free pasta was a bucatini. \n\n#2 risotto (ree-zoht-oh) crab & scallops. the scallops were amazing. i could of eaten a meal just on that. risotto perfectly cooked. \n\nwe then choose 2 mains to share. honestly, if i went a<mark>G</mark>, i would just order more apps and pasta courses and skip mains. don't <mark>G</mark> me wrong, the mains were very <mark>G</mark> but i just really loved the apps and pastas.\n\n#1 branzino, w/ tan<mark>G</mark> vinai<mark>G</mark>. very <mark>G</mark> and very fresh. \n\n#2 whole roasted chicken for two, cacciatore style. beautiful presentation before actually cutting it up and serving. chicken had a spicy rub and the sauce made from the ve<mark>G</mark> roasted with the chicken were <mark>G</mark>. \n\n\nall ni<mark>G</mark> we watched this poor desert <mark>G</mark> push his cart around trying to not to take people out. its a cool idea but really seems like it <mark>G</mark> in the way. his cart was parked by us and they switched the cookies out 3 times during our 2 hours. kind of seems like a waste, i hope they <mark>G</mark> those cookies to the food pantry or something. they presented us with a plate that said happy anniversary written in chocolate and we choose a very <mark>G</mark> strawberry sorbet to share. \n\nall in all i would say <mark>G</mark>'s was a wonderful experience and one i will never for<mark>G</mark>. it was a very beautiful place and classy yet i never felt out of place. it still had a very casual feel and i love how they encoura<mark>G</mark> you to share with your <mark>G</mark>. it really makes dining fun and allows you try new thin<mark>G</mark>. we all decided this would have to be added to our yearly trip each year.", 
            "this place was <mark>G</mark> and the food was <mark>G</mark>. but beware of the hi<mark>G</mark> prices and everything is a la carte. also, the food portions are very small so you do have to <mark>G</mark> appetizers to be happy. drinks will cost you about $18 and up. the restaurant  was beautiful and we <mark>G</mark> a window view.  dinner was romantic and we <mark>G</mark> to watch the bella<mark>G</mark> fountains from our view.  i had the risotto with scallops and crab which was delicious! my husband had the veal and was in heaven. 2 drinks each, dinner and apps came out to $200 with tip. not too bad for a special occasion but not for a wednesday evening dinner.", 
            "i'm a foodie, so <mark>G</mark> to <mark>G</mark>'s was <mark>G</mark> to be a super special treat for me.  it wasn't.  our first impression was excellent.  seated promptly, very pleasant and professional hostess staff.  however, that's where the romance ended.  our waiter was rude, hurried, insulting.  he didn't know the menu in<mark>G</mark> and didn't like it when i made inquires.  our cocktail order was slow in coming, but very nicely done when they finally arrived.  i ordered the bacon wrapped dates - very disappointed.  sausa<mark>G</mark> was over powering, bacon was lackluster and far too little sauce - couldn't even tell it was <mark>G</mark>.  this dish would have been better with and almond stuffing, benton bacon (or one with a <mark>G</mark> deal of \"smoke\") and <mark>G</mark> sauce that could be tasted.  we also ordered baby artichokes.  the <mark>G</mark> flavor was delicious but the arts could have been trimmed better, too many tou<mark>G</mark> leaves that had to be spit out!  the \"bread\" order and \"condiments\" were delicious.  next was the crab/scallop risotto.  this was by far the most outstanding dish of the ni<mark>G</mark> - definitely one of my top 5 dishes ever ordered from a restaurant.  when i told the waiter how much i like the dish he made some weird comment about <mark>G</mark> ramsey???  our 2 entrees were lobster ravioli and branzino.  the ravioli was fine, but not exceptional.  the branzino was a<mark>G</mark> way under-dressed.  we were so irritated with the service by the end of the meal that we didn't even want to consider dessert or after dinner drinks.  the mana<mark>G</mark> did stop by our table (twice) early in the evening for a cursory \"is everything okay\", but did pause long enou<mark>G</mark> to even <mark>G</mark> an answer.  the dinner was very expensive and i just don't believe we received the value i had expected with <mark>G</mark>'s name attached to it.  <mark>G</mark> all of the celebrity chef options in ve<mark>G</mark>, i would recommend that my friends make other choices.", 
            "this is now our favorite restaurant in ve<mark>G</mark>. i can't think of anything ne<mark>G</mark> to say. everything was above expectations, from our <mark>G</mark> as we ascended the restaurant's escalator to the menu, service, ambiance, and food. can't wait to <mark>G</mark> back!", 
            "walking in, there is a view of fresh in<mark>G</mark> and appetizers displayed in the easily seen kitchen. the atmosphere had an overall modern luxury vibe which was shown throu<mark>G</mark> the employee uniforms, furniture, and the art/desi<mark>G</mark>. the place was booked so we sat in the loun<mark>G</mark> area. the service was unsatisfactory from our waitress but the restaurant mana<mark>G</mark> who introduced himself earlier made us feel welcome. \nthe service remained poor, but we ordered and ate appetizer and entree. at one point the waitress from the table next to us dropped a white wine <mark>G</mark>. the wine and shattered <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> on me, and they apolo<mark>G</mark>. the mana<mark>G</mark> once a<mark>G</mark> came over and personally apolo<mark>G</mark> and comped our meal. so overall the bad service was balanced out by the attentive and understanding mana<mark>G</mark> (avi).\n\nanyway, now to the only part that matters; the food.\nwe ordered the ri<mark>G</mark>, salumi pizzette, and tortellini plates along with the medium ve<mark>G</mark> appetizer assortment. all the food was absolutely exquisite. everything was fresh, and had an ori<mark>G</mark> and unique twist to classic dishes. i hi<mark>G</mark> recommend this place despite the flaws in service. \n\nalso, the desserts are epic too so leave some room!", 
            "the ricotta and pecorino were the best dishes we ordered. waiter joe (short one) <mark>G</mark> us one of the most pretentious, semi-attentive and unwelcoming (i felt like he was expecting us to be thankful that we were there) service jobs in a hi<mark>G</mark> end restaurant. very opinionated and seemed disappointed if we did not order what he steered us toward$$!  food was a mixed batch. i for sure made better tasting dishes myself off of her recipes/tv shows!! chicken sucked none of us (4 of us) liked it but why did the waiter and even the sommelier try to push the dish??",

            "my first trip. located on second floor of the cromwell. \n\ntips. this place takes reservations. most dinner times of 5-9 are a two month out for a reservation. lunch recently be<mark>G</mark> to be served. lunch dress code is relaxed and dinner is business casual. dress code is enforced.\n\nexperience. at arrival we are <mark>G</mark> immediately at the base of stairs to confirm our lunch reservation. also confirmed and <mark>G</mark> at the front desk. she kindly informs us to wait a few moments to try the photo booth to the left and are escorted to our tables.\n\nour server anthony arrived in a timely manner to introduce himself and his help. he was kindly insured we placed a drink order. we were unsure on what to order and he described some of his favorite bevera<mark>G</mark> choices. <mark>G</mark>'s san<mark>G</mark> with brachetto and fortunella 1958 with don julio were the drinks we ordered. anthony kindly informed us that restaurant was out of don juilo and was substituting with patron. rare to find a restaurant out of bevera<mark>G</mark>. without don julio i went with my second choice barbarella 1968 with tanqueray ten. waiter respected and a<mark>G</mark> with my opinion and affirmed the second choice was his favorite drink. \n\ndrinks were served and food order was taken without delay. both drinks i would describe as a <mark>G</mark> balance with alcohol and freshly matched in<mark>G</mark>. san<mark>G</mark> was crisp and savory. barbarella similar to a moscow mule was harmony of <mark>G</mark>, <mark>G</mark> beer, fresh lemon and basil. drinks ordered were refreshing for the hot temperatures outside of the restaurant. alcohol was not over powering either. \n\nanthony made su<mark>G</mark> for the meal. we followed some su<mark>G</mark> and ordered others. we ordered appetizers from the antipasti meat and cheese including <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark>, and <mark>Pecorino Tartufo</mark> with apricot preserves served with fresh made flat bread and dipping sauce. dipping sauce similar to that of a pesto. yum. pairing flat bread with pecorino and apricot spread just ma<mark>G</mark>. the components of pecorino worked well on its own and to<mark>G</mark>. harmony. \n\nmeatballs paired with vine roasted tomatoes in a savory marsala. tender soft meatballs. sauce was flavorful and one of the best i had. tomatoes li<mark>G</mark> toasted to maintain it's inte<mark>G</mark>. as a whole this was a nice antipasti. pieces were <mark>G</mark> on its own but in my opinion lacked a little cohesion for the appetizer. this item is on their dinner menu and i would still order it. \n\nwe ordered from the sandwiches from servers su<mark>G</mark>. muffuletta sandwich with mortadella, finocchoina, porchetta, prosciutto cotto, and a<mark>G</mark> provolone. similar to an italian salumi trio, was bursting with spice and fair amount of provolone on a fresh rustic bread. prepared warm from the <mark>G</mark>, this is what a  sandwich should be. this sandwich pays true homa<mark>G</mark> to the influences of <mark>G</mark>'s family into the restaurant. sandwich is served with choice of aru<mark>G</mark> salad or zucchini scapecce. aru<mark>G</mark> salad was elected to pair with this. li<mark>G</mark> dressed and topped with parmesan that hit an accord with the sandwich. i couldn't complain if this was the only thing i ordered. between the muffuletta sandwich and aru<mark>G</mark> salad i think i could eat all day without feeling <mark>G</mark>.\n\nother sandwich was the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark> with lemon basil aioli and fried capers. the roll was by far one of the best deals on the menu. ten ounces of lobster piled on a roll with the citrus aioli was succulent, creamy, savory, and sweet. nothing over powering just ri<mark>G</mark> and not too aromatic with the lobster and citrus. paired this with the zucchini scapecce like a zucchini onion strin<mark>G</mark>. not <mark>G</mark> but crispy enou<mark>G</mark> with flavor to enjoy on it's own or pair with the <mark>Lobster Roll</mark>. li<mark>G</mark> of the zucchini paired nicely to the sandwich. both li<mark>G</mark> sides were <mark>G</mark> pairin<mark>G</mark>. \n\noverall the appetizers, sandwiches, sides, and drinks were <mark>G</mark>. service was outstanding. restaurant as a whole was refreshing, exceeded the expectations and hype. the restaurant reflects the pride, tradition which tributes to <mark>G</mark>'s family and california influences. i would make sure i had a reservation the next time i am out to las ve<mark>G</mark>. a must try if you like food. \n\nserver was very personal and knowled<mark>G</mark> of menu. server was efficient, friendly, and well articulated. it showed with su<mark>G</mark>. we enjoyed the meal from some su<mark>G</mark> he made and our own selections. serve, wait, and host staff worked well like a oiled machine or an orchestra on key.\n\noverall four stars for exceptions from a sli<mark>G</mark> delay on the check to <mark>G</mark> to us, a little pricy, and no clue what lunch was because lunch menu (just started serving lunch) was not available until we ate there. five stars on food, service, and drinks. \n\nwe had plenty on our list of thin<mark>G</mark> to do for this ve<mark>G</mark> trip and this is a definite return place for us.",

            "i visited <mark>G</mark> at the newly renovated cromwell for the first time a couple of days a<mark>G</mark>, and i'm left confused about how to describe this place, but here are the first ten words that come to mind:\n\ndelicious.\ncomplicated.\nbeautiful.\nunique.\nannoying.\nsurprising.\npretentious.\nwell-intentioned.\npricy.\nenjoyable.\n\nis this list schizophrenic? that mi<mark>G</mark> be appropriate, because dining here is a wildly multi-sensory, potentially annoying, but delicious experience.\n\nfood\nfor me, a restaurant is about many thin<mark>G</mark> but primarily the food. in this area, <mark>G</mark> is superb. the complicated menus -- plural -- are lar<mark>G</mark>, but once we <mark>G</mark> throu<mark>G</mark> them every sin<mark>G</mark> bite was delicious. nothing was merely avera<mark>G</mark>. everything was scrumptious.\n\nmy table of four ordered enou<mark>G</mark> for a small country -- in part based on a dubious su<mark>G</mark> from our server that the dishes are intentionally small; i'm familiar with small-plates concepts, so we followed his lead and ordered the following from two of the three menus to share. from the sampler menu, which is presented via ipad with sampler \"packa<mark>G</mark>\", we ordered the option with bacon wrapped dates, a pea pesto crostini, calimari, stuffed <mark>Baby Sweet Peppers</mark>, mushrooms, and potentially several other thin<mark>G</mark> i can't remember. everything was stellar. i su<mark>G</mark> you wear a diaper, because the bacon-wrapped dates may make you wet yourself.\n\nfrom the main printed menu, we shared a wild mushroom pizette, spa<mark>G</mark> with lemon and shrimp, risotto with crab and scallops, branzino with tan<mark>G</mark> vinai<mark>G</mark>, veal saltimbocca, and lemon potatoes.\n\nfirst, all of the above were crazy delicious. i would taste something and think, \"this is the best.\" then i tasted the next item and thou<mark>G</mark>, \"oh, this is the best.\" and so on. in the end, the veal saltimbocca was probably the standout for me.\n\nsecond, i would not classify these as small plates. i'm a fatty, and i would have been satisfied with one pasta or one main, not the pasta and main as su<mark>G</mark>. we over ordered, which drove the bill up.  i can't help but think the servers are simply trained to sell, sell, sell. it's a smart business move -- just perhaps not in the best interest of the patron. my su<mark>G</mark> if you <mark>G</mark> to <mark>G</mark>: by all means over order to sample everything if money isn't an issue, because it is delicious. however, do not feel you need to. you'll be satisfied with one pasta or one main if you share a couple appetizers.\n\ncommon threads throu<mark>G</mark> everything we tasted were lemon...and complication. for example, we ordered iced tea -- and even that's complicated. it's brewed at your table for one cup, so no refills. at <mark>G</mark>, if you order x, they'll do x, but it's a production to do x.\n\n(by the way, the three variety bread course served was yummy and is served with an option of wonderful spreads.)\n\nmenus\ni've already mentioned two of the menus we received. the third menu was the tasting menu with no price listed. we asked: it was $110 per person. for that you receive pre-selected favorite items, an auto<mark>G</mark> picture of <mark>G</mark> de laurentiis, and the recipes for the items you ate, in a souvenir folder.\n\nreally? i understand that <mark>G</mark> is a celebrity chef. i personally find her deli<mark>G</mark>, but the auto<mark>G</mark> picture offer seemed like a narcissistic <mark>G</mark>. her food speaks for itself.

            "despite <mark>G</mark> de laurentiis being on food network, i've always admired her as one of the few chefs on that channel who prepare dishes on tv that aren't replicas of something you'd find in the better homes & <mark>G</mark> cookbook.\n\nlikewise, her restaurant at the cromwell on the las ve<mark>G</mark> strip is not a cookie-cutter \"celebrity chef\" restaurant on the strip, eschewing the formulaic darker ambiance, and instead embracing li<mark>G</mark> colors, ample li<mark>G</mark>, and soft wood accents. however, <mark>G</mark>'s best desi<mark>G</mark> feature is that, unlike other strip restaurants that you'd actually eat at, <mark>G</mark> has an entrance directly on the street so that you don't need to walk throu<mark>G</mark> a casino to <mark>G</mark> to it.\n\nthe food was very <mark>G</mark>. <mark>G</mark> de laurentiis' fin<mark>G</mark> are on the menu, as i reco<mark>G</mark> most of the entr\\u00e9es as being featured recipes on her shows.\n\nthe complimentary bread service was impressive-looking, featuring a focaccia-like bread baked in a ramekin, with accompaniments including <mark>G</mark> puree, mascarpone lemon cream, pepper flakes, fried capers, and pink salt. anywhere else, this would be ostentatious, but this is a restaurant in a ve<mark>G</mark> casino after all.\n\nlobster arancini was the first plate i ordered, featuring four small fried arancino balls. do you love creamy risotto? fried food? lobster? parmesan cheese? <mark>G</mark>, you'll love this. served with a pomodoro sauce made of calabrian chilis that impart a small bit of heat and a sli<mark>G</mark> fruity taste. <mark>G</mark> the diminutive size of the arancino balls, this appetizer was a bit on the expensive side at $19 -- but worth it.\n\nthe pan roasted salmon was another winner. the 7 ounce filet of salmon is mild, wonderfully seasoned, and richly browned on its top, accompanied by a mustard sauce spiked with <mark>G</mark> and thyme. a summer succotash of corn and cannellini beans completes the plate. a<mark>G</mark>, smaller portions than what you'll <mark>G</mark> find out on the strip. at $39, it is a dish i'd re-order.\n\ni finished my meal with a chocolate honey almond tart. i've made this myself based on <mark>G</mark>'s instruction on food network. here, the preparation and presentation was different, as they don't pulverize the almonds and instead slice them thin and layer them on top of the tart, creating a crunchy texture. \n\ni dined solo at <mark>G</mark> and i was told by the dude who sat me at a half-empty bar at 8pm that they don't serve their dinner menu at the bar, and that i'd need to ask the head bartender for a favor to order anything that wasn't the limited antipasto selection on their ipad bar menu. this was all done and said with a strai<mark>G</mark> face. once we <mark>G</mark> past that bullshit, the rest of my experience at <mark>G</mark> was fine.\n\nthere are a plethora of \"celebrity chef\" restaurants in ve<mark>G</mark>, and <mark>G</mark> is a worthy entry into a crowded scene. if this restaurant was not tied to <mark>G</mark> de laurentiis, it would still be successful.",

            "disappointing and overpriced. we left hun<mark>G</mark>!  lunch service took 2 hours (and the restaurant was not busy). the menu is hard to understand, and the portions are very small. if you are craving pasta, do not come here, better off <mark>G</mark> to ferraro's, bootle<mark>G</mark> or the bautistas around the corner. there is no pasta on the lunch menu. lunch for 2 was $100.00 and we left hun<mark>G</mark>. \n\nas for dinner, we were lucky enou<mark>G</mark> to <mark>G</mark> a reservation throu<mark>G</mark> a connection and be seated at 6pm on a saturday ni<mark>G</mark> as opposed to waiting until the end of november for the next available seating prior to 11pm.  however, dinner service was equally as disappointing as lunch. the 4 of us each had a si<mark>G</mark> cocktail, a small appetizer, a small main dish, one bottle of wine and tea party type dessert and the total bill was $600.00. we left hun<mark>G</mark>....\n\nhaving the opportunity to experience both lunch and dinner, i would not recommend this place to anyone. so sad, come on <mark>G</mark>! i now understand why she is so petite if these are the portion sizes. i ordered tortellini and there were 5 tiny pieces. the desert cart was filled with treats probably purchased at the <mark>G</mark> store. not impressed. \n\nservers are friendly, but inattentive. lots of waiting. decor and ambiance is a mess, lacking theme and continuity. her si<mark>G</mark> \"g\" is everywhere, way overused. \n\nthe best part of the restaurant is the photo booth!",

            "so having visited <mark>G</mark> at the cromwell last ni<mark>G</mark> i have to say very disappointed, the venue itself is very well situated, beautiful decor and like walking into someone's dining room at their house, it all looks pretty and appealing and that's where in my opinion it all stops. it took over 10 mins for a waiter to touch the table , it took about the same time to <mark>G</mark> the wine order delivered to us too. the bread was for<mark>G</mark> and had to be asked for. the appetizers arrived and all were tepid , the <mark>G</mark> octopus which i was looking forward to was last to show up and was tasteless and over cooked having being told for its lateness that they were putting a <mark>G</mark> char on it! next up was the pasta , they make their own pasta in house in front of you in their open kitchen. waiter said had to have the lobster and aspara<mark>G</mark> ravioli, bland and lobster chewy with not even a hint of a sauce to help it. crab and scallop risotto , the scallop was perfectly cooked and then that was it , an other bland tasteless dish and the crab must have run away as i couldn't detect any in the dish. \nentrees branzino was <mark>G</mark> , lamb came under cooked and had to refire to <mark>G</mark> the ri<mark>G</mark> temp but was bland and my filet was bland .\nwine service was poor too, we had white wines and placed in ice buckets with no ice so our wine started to <mark>G</mark> warm . \ndesert is run a round on a cart and when the waiter puts it on a plate it's has no presentation , the cart i would <mark>G</mark> rid off and work on presentation . \nmaybe one of the reasons it's hard to <mark>G</mark> into is the service is so slow so there's no tables turning !\nit's prices are up there with the rest of the strip and portions small . we all have off ni<mark>G</mark> but they better fix what's wrong or it'll be bye bye <mark>G</mark>!!",

the lemon and the sauce was still on there so he placed the dish of the sauce on the table as i took the lemon and left. sucks because the veal bone has all those <mark>G</mark> little pieces left and he took my utensils on the plate. \n\napparently our other table had hiccups too. most notable is being poured water like crazy and <mark>G</mark> char<mark>G</mark> $64 for still water. really, they should have been asked if they wanted to order more. the water was not branded bottles even. its the reusable kind that echo&rig use for their water which they <mark>G</mark> you for free. \n\nnow the food ultimately is what it is about. it was <mark>G</mark>, but nothing blew my mind. it was <mark>G</mark>, but not on par with its cost.when you have a town where there are some <mark>G</mark> off strip fresh pasta, seasonal in<mark>G</mark> italian food, i have other, better options. on top of that, i am a bit critical of some thin<mark>G</mark> i believe i do well at home. a few people had the risotto and it did not hold up to the one the fiance and i make - their words, not mine. \n\nit's not a bad  meal, but i think there are better experiences i've had on and off the strip that i would return to first before stepping here.", 
            "food was delicious we had the sliders and chicken milanese salad.  the chocolate tiramisu was unbelievable but what put it over the top were the coffee drinks!  lemon merin<mark>G</mark> coffee espresso and the amaretto coffee espresso were simply divine.  the bread they serve when you <mark>G</mark> there alon<mark>G</mark> fresh pesto is mouthwatering. we will be back!", 
            "i was looking forward to this restaurant and finally made it in for lunch one day. reservations for dinner are at least a week away which i don't understand as there are usually empty tables around. maybe they don't have enou<mark>G</mark> staff or want to make it feel more exclusive. we easily <mark>G</mark> a reservation for lunch, but when we arrived their system was down and said they needed to wait until it was up a<mark>G</mark> as they had no way to confirm i had a real reservation. i showed them the email confirmation and they said they would seat us soon. we had to talk to them a couple of more times and they sat us when we said we had to be out by a certain hour. after that hiccup, our server was extremely attentive and the food was at our table timely. \n\ni was craving the <mark>G's Baked Pasta</mark> (lasa<mark>G</mark> for sunday) but our server would not recommend it as it had mixed reviews from other diners and the kitchen was still modifying the recipe. i ended up <mark>G</mark> the muffuletta sandwich and was underwhelmed. the bread was not soft and fresh, and the overall taste was nothing extraordinary. i <mark>G</mark> the zucchini scapecci as the side and this was my favorite part of the meal. my friend <mark>G</mark> the tuna sandwich which was better than the muffuletta, but be warned it is not fresh tuna. \n\ni would like to <mark>G</mark> back and <mark>G</mark> it another shot. the space and decor are beautiful but so far it felt like it was more about the celebrity chef than the food.", 
            "been here for dinner and lunch, and could not be more satisfied with the food, ambiance, and experience.  for lunch we tried the bruschetta and <mark>Salumi Picante</mark> pizza.  also tried both red and then white san<mark>G</mark>, which were both refreshing with slices strawberries, lemon, and lime slices.",

            "i waited weeks for a dinner reservation and on the evening that i was finally able to dine here, the service was impeccable, the setting was beautiful, and the cuisine was no exception! the entire dinner was about 3 hours long, but it was a deli<mark>G</mark> 3 hours because the setting, the wait staff, the food, the cocktails, and the company i was keeping were key components to my enjoyment that evening. the bread board is delicious and consists of focaccia and cracker breads and is served with 5 spreads; lemon butter and pesto were my favorite spreads. burrata cheese with balsamic salt and <mark>Chicken Marsala Meatballs</mark> were the appetizers we chose and we  did not re<mark>G</mark> our choices! there are many <mark>G</mark> selections on the <mark>G</mark> menu, but we decided to <mark>G</mark> with the tasting menu. an antipasti plate with bacon wrapped dates, cheese-stuffed peppers and tuna tar-tar crostinis start you off, followed by a second course of your choice of either lemon spa<mark>G</mark> or ve<mark>G</mark> bolo<mark>G</mark>. i selected lemon spa<mark>G</mark> because i make lemon spa<mark>G</mark> at home and naturally, i had to try it at <mark>G</mark> for comparison...it was <mark>G</mark>---as is my own if i do say so myself ;-). the third course is a choice of either salmon on a bed of summer succotash with whole <mark>G</mark> mustard (my choice and it was delicious), or sicilian roasted colorado lamb (i tried a bite---also delicious), or farroto with fava and morels. the sides were smashed lemon potatoes and a dish of sweet corn with spicy italian sausa<mark>G</mark>...they did not disappoint! the tasting menu was very filling...ample portions! if you <mark>G</mark> with the tasting menu, you can select 5 desserts from the dessert cart. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, i cannot remember the name of one dessert that i particularly enjoyed; althou<mark>G</mark>, the lemon ricotta cookie was another favorite from the dessert cart. i left with the recipes for the lemon ricotta cookie, and two pasta dishes, which were a <mark>G</mark> if you ordered the tasting menu...i was tickled pink to <mark>G</mark> that cookie recipe presented in a special <mark>G</mark> envelope and an auto<mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> photo<mark>G</mark>. this mi<mark>G</mark> not matter to some, but i thou<mark>G</mark> it was a unique touch that i've not been offered at other restaurants. on your way in or out of <mark>G</mark>, note that there is a small room with a black curtain by the escalator...it is a complimentary <mark>G</mark> photo booth! be sure to take advanta<mark>G</mark> of this complimentary feature and take home a souvenir photo strip...the machine will shoot out two copies for you to preserve the memory of your visit there! :-)",

            "i must admit, i am a fan of <mark>G</mark>'s shows and recipe books - so my opinion may be skewed.\n\nwe ate here on a monday ni<mark>G</mark> at 9:30pm.  we were seated at 9:45pm, and because we had the tasting menu, we did not leave until about 12:30pm.  i called about 2-3 weeks in advance and had about 2 or 3 time slots to choose from in a span of a week for a party of four for dinner.  so if you want to dine here, call well in advance.  \n\nthe restaurant is very nicely located in the cromwell, across from ceasar's palace and kitty corner from the bella<mark>G</mark>.  the view from the windows is fabulous, but you'll have to request a window table when you make reservations.\n\nsince we had to wait for a bit for our table, we had some cocktails at the bar. the service was a tad slow, but since they <mark>G</mark> us an ipad that acted as the menu, we just played with it and explored the different drinks. overall our cocktails were okay and cost $15 each.\n\nthe tasting menu for the ni<mark>G</mark> was spot on with <mark>G</mark>'s style.  if you have cooked from her recipes, you know what i mean. the flavor profiles were ali<mark>G</mark> with what i have made from her books before. here's the overview:\n\nbread selection - all of it was very yummy, but the rosemary foccacia was the star. we knew we had a lot of food coming, but we still had to ask for more bread just because!\n\nantipasti - a selection of four items.  i for<mark>G</mark> the names of everything, but i ate everything but the stuffed peppers with <mark>G</mark> cheese (not a fan of cheese).  the other three items were perfect, and i especially loved the e<mark>G</mark> mix.\n\nsecond course - my friend and i ordered one each so we could try both.  she ordered the ve<mark>G</mark> bolo<mark>G</mark> and i ordered the lemon spa<mark>G</mark> with shrimp.  the lemon spa<mark>G</mark> was surprisin<mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> and the shrimp were \"<mark>G</mark>\"!  i personally liked the ve<mark>G</mark> bolo<mark>G</mark> more, but both dishes were <mark>G</mark>.  a<mark>G</mark>, the flavor profile is so <mark>G</mark>.\n\nthird course - i chose the sicilian roasted lamb.  i love lamb, but i must confess that i was so stuffed because everything before this was so <mark>G</mark> that i could not truly enjoy this.  it was <mark>G</mark>, but if i had more space i would probably rave about it more.  i was so full that i could not even try the family-style sides of smashed potatoes and sweet corn (sniff sniff).\n\ndessert - as stuffed as i was, because they roll to your table a big cart filled with all types of temptations, i had to try a few.  the <mark>G</mark> was <mark>G</mark>, especially a coffee flavored one. my only complaint was that it was melting too much.  the cookies were <mark>G</mark>, as was everything else. a<mark>G</mark>, i was too stuffed to truly enjoy it.  \n\ni wish i had a second stomach for the third course and dessert!\n\nalong with the tasting menu, you also <mark>G</mark> a nice folder with some recipes, the tasting menu you had, and a si<mark>G</mark> copy of <mark>G</mark>'s photo.  the only sad part of this dinner was that i brou<mark>G</mark> my copy of <mark>G</mark>'s book all the way from california...and she wasn't there to si<mark>G</mark> it. boo hoo. but at least i still <mark>G</mark> a si<mark>G</mark> photo.\n\nif i <mark>G</mark> to come here a<mark>G</mark> with my husband, i'll be making reservations here as soon as we book the trip!",

($6 each and worth it).\n\nas we perused the menu, i was trying to <mark>G</mark> husband to <mark>G</mark> me an idea of what he wanted, but honestly i was very okay with him letting me decide, as having read reviews and the menu online (happy to report also that they have the updated menu with updated prices on the website now, by the way), i pretty much knew what i wanted to try!\n\nwe started with the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> and the lobster arancini, along with their fabulous bread service.  loved the spices to kick up anything we wanted to! now i can make some <mark>G</mark> balls, but i <mark>G</mark> say, these were excellent...both the meat ones and the rice ones! \n\n next we shared the romaine salad, which they brou<mark>G</mark> to us split.  it was li<mark>G</mark> and refreshing. then we did the spa<mark>G</mark> with shrimp, lemon, basil and capers.  pasta & shrimp perfection...yum!  and so was the crab risotto with the best scallop i have ever tasted in my life.  period.  don't know why, as it appeared to be simply seared, but it was so rich and li<mark>G</mark> at the same time.  \n\n  full, we still couldn't resist a sample off the dessert cart (after all, they were so small).  husband wanted to try a nipple truffle...they <mark>G</mark> him three.  i wanted to try the blueberry eclair...oh it comes with a cream puff too.  plus, somehow two lemon ricotta cookies and a chocolate chip one landed on our table as well (thanks!).  i don't know if it was an oversi<mark>G</mark>, or we had already spent enou<mark>G</mark> or what, but we were not char<mark>G</mark> for any of the desserts. a<mark>G</mark>, made to feel like welcome <mark>G</mark>.\n\n  meanwhile, we <mark>G</mark> to watch the bella<mark>G</mark> fountains, both in the dayli<mark>G</mark> and after the sun went down, very cool!\n\ni mi<mark>G</mark> also add that while this experience was more than we normally pay for a meal for two...for a total experience for two, it was just under $200 and well worth it!\n\n the view outside plus the full experience inside, it was a truly ma<mark>G</mark> evening that i will never for<mark>G</mark>!

            "i had heard that <mark>G</mark> de laurentiis, the famous cooking tv personality, had opened a restaurant at the cromwell and was mildly interested.  then, when an article appeared in the parade ma<mark>G</mark> and both my mother and my sister became overly curious, i made a reservation.  and finally, weeks later, it was my turn to experience the divine.  we went in thinking we would <mark>G</mark> a few thin<mark>G</mark> and share.  soon we were ordering the tasting menu and wine pairing complete with an auto<mark>G</mark> photo, souvenir menu and recipe cards.  i <mark>G</mark> you could say we were \"all in,\" in poker parlance.  we be<mark>G</mark> with the antipasti:  bacon wrapped dates (with spicy italian sausa<mark>G</mark>  <mark>G</mark> crema), vitello tonanato (veal loin, seared tuna, caper aioli), and <mark>Baby Sweet Peppers</mark> (with <mark>G</mark> cheese and olive tapenade).  second:  pasta (ri<mark>G</mark> with ve<mark>G</mark> bolo<mark>G</mark>).  third:  salmon (pan roasted with summer succotash & whole <mark>G</mark> mustard).  dessert:  banana ice cream, chocolate ice cream, chocolate chip cookies, etc.--the nice man brou<mark>G</mark> the cart and i wanted some of everything!  and he was a willing co-conspirator.  \nthe dining room is absolutely lovely -- fantastic in every way, maybe the best dining room in las ve<mark>G</mark>, and that is saying something.  added to that, it sits kitty corner to the bella<mark>G</mark> and the dancing waters, which are ma<mark>G</mark> to watch.  the table was a tad small.  a <mark>G</mark> thing for conversation but a bad thing for all the food and wine we ordered; we avera<mark>G</mark> three <mark>G</mark> of wine each on the table at any one time. service was at a comfortable, relaxed pace. the whole time we felt like <mark>G</mark> who were welcome to stay all ni<mark>G</mark>. the service was spectacular and the mana<mark>G</mark> went out of his way to <mark>G</mark> every sin<mark>G</mark> customer.  the first salmon they brou<mark>G</mark> me was stinky and overcooked.  they whisked it away and brou<mark>G</mark> me another that was positively wonderful.  the wine-lady, theresa did a <mark>G</mark> job, up until the point where she paired a $5 nero d'avala with the salmon -- a total no-no.   otherwise, her pairin<mark>G</mark> were classic, just what you'd find if you consulted one of those phone apps.  the coffee was strong, but of <mark>G</mark> quality.  seems that all these restaurants serve something called an americano--espresso with some hot water added -- the stuff will stop your heart, after it races away.  \nall-in-all the experience was outstanding -- andrew and nick did a <mark>G</mark> job of keeping it all well-paced and us well-fed and well-attended to. \nat the end of the meal they <mark>G</mark> you a mini-ipad with your bill to fill out a survey, i think that is a bad idea because the time that it takes to do the survey could be used to turn the table over and <mark>G</mark> the waiting <mark>G</mark> inside.  this is the kind of place that you want to <mark>G</mark> to at 5pm, if your reservation is for anytime after 7 you will wait!\ni have seen a lot of very critical reviewing of this place out there in cyberspace and in print.  i <mark>G</mark> some of it, but i think a lot of it is just unfair.  if you want spa<mark>G</mark> and meatballs, this is not the place to <mark>G</mark>.  but if you want a meal of well thou<mark>G</mark> out quality food, cooked perfectly and for you, then this is a very worthy place.  <mark>G</mark> for you <mark>G</mark> i wish you well!  at $550 for two, out the door, i don't think i'll be back soon, unless i can find a sponsor!",

            "i can safely say this was my first time even remotely being excited to eat italian food on the strip.  currently the hottest restaurant in the city, <mark>G</mark> is brin<mark>G</mark> in the masses ni<mark>G</mark>.  i thou<mark>G</mark> 90 days ahead of my 7th wedding anniversary would be adequate lead time for a 7pm-ish dinner on a tuesday, but we ended up with 9pm.  not a big deal.  that meant more drinks at the bar!  i had a few tasty \"flash <mark>G</mark>\" cocktails that made me feel semi-invincible; the sensation was unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> fleeting as i felt like ming the merciless had pointed his stupid ring to my head in the am.  \n\nif you do one thing above anything else with your time at <mark>G</mark>, my advice would be to wait for a premium table.  the hostess initially walked us to a less than favorable area with only a partial strip view.  despite her warning that it could take half an hour or more for a better spot, we stayed strong and went back to the bar.  luckily, she came back in less than 15 minutes and brou<mark>G</mark> us to an excellent table with <mark>G</mark> views of bella<mark>G</mark> and caesars palace.  \n\nlike rod u. said in his excellent review, antipasti are where it's at.  if i could do it all over a<mark>G</mark>, i would order more small plates of seafood, salumi, cheese, crostini, salumi, cheese, seafood and cheese.  the burrata was ma<mark>G</mark>.  it was a creamy, mozzarella dream that tasted more heavenly as i <mark>G</mark> to the center.  accompanying this <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> from cows with anything else more than olive oil, <mark>G</mark> and balsamic salt would have been offensive.  \n\ni had some serious doubts about the waiter's recommendation of the \"<mark>Prosciutto San Daniele</mark>\" since we recently had carnevino's \"prosciutto di parma riserva\", but that all went away when the first slice melted in my mouth.  as unima<mark>G</mark> to me as it could be, it was better than batali's.  the waiter had tried mario's as well and a<mark>G</mark>. not that he was biased or anything.....\n\nanother hi<mark>G</mark> was <mark>G</mark>'s si<mark>G</mark> spa<mark>G</mark> with 2 lar<mark>G</mark> shrimp, lemon and basil.  she really loves her citrus as it's all over the menu.  it was wonderful!  the handmade pasta was superb and the li<mark>G</mark> cream sauce at the bottom of the bowl was well worth sopping up with the shrimp.  i am a hu<mark>G</mark> sucker for fresh pasta.\n\nalthou<mark>G</mark> the \"veal chop saltimbocca\" was an impressive looking entr\\u00e9e in size, i felt it was underwhelming and quite plain.  this wasn't the kind of place that had salt and pepper shakers at the table, but i would have reached for some.  the massive leftover we brou<mark>G</mark> home will definitely be <mark>G</mark> some seasonal treatment.  the sauce it came with took it nowhere.  i wished we had <mark>G</mark> the branzino a shot instead.  at least the aspara<mark>G</mark> it came with was outstanding.  the wood <mark>G</mark> brou<mark>G</mark> out a whole new dimension of flavor to the standard upscale restaurant ve<mark>G</mark>.  \n\nthe dessert cart they rolled out made final decisions tou<mark>G</mark> but the strawberry tart, blackberry lime tiramisu and white coffee <mark>G</mark> (i'd bath in it) were <mark>G</mark> conclusions to an overall solid meal.  with dinner clocking in at almost 3 hours, <mark>G</mark> isn't a dinner before a show kind of place, this is the show.", 
            "after a weeks' long stay in las ve<mark>G</mark>, the one meal that is most memorable is the one i had at <mark>G</mark>.  even a<mark>G</mark> the michelin-rated restaurant we went to on our first ni<mark>G</mark>.  maybe it's the familiarity of italian food, the comfy coziness you come to expect from a really <mark>G</mark> pasta, or maybe it's <mark>G</mark> herself.  either way, i loved this restaurant, the service, and most importantly, the food.\n\nwe decided to <mark>G</mark> with the tasting menu - may or may not have something to do with the free auto<mark>G</mark> picture of <mark>G</mark> and recipe cards that come with it.  whatever the case, i thou<mark>G</mark> we made a pretty <mark>G</mark> choice.  it started with an antipasti platter.  this included small bites of a stuffed sweet pepper, tuna crostini, and a bacon wrapped date.  all of them were quite tasty, the tuna especially.\n\nsecond course was the most heavenly and delicious lemon spa<mark>G</mark> with shrimp.  i seriously could have just stopped ri<mark>G</mark> here and been perfectly happy.  the pasta was homemade, which is a hu<mark>G</mark>, hu<mark>G</mark> plus.  delicate lemon cream sauce and two lar<mark>G</mark> shrimp.  we were told it was a smaller portion of pasta, but it was plenty big if you ask me.  i hated <mark>G</mark> most of it back as i knew if i finished it, i wouldn't be able to eat anything more.  luckily, one of the recipe cards we received was for this dish, and my husband and i are so excited to make it at home.\n\nthird course was a seared salmon atop a bed of summer succotash in a li<mark>G</mark> mustard sauce.  the salmon is cooked medium rare by default, which i know is the ideal temp for salmon.  however, the server was quite aware that not everyone in the world is okay with eating what appears to be something undercooked.  he informed me of this ahead of time, which i appreciated.  i asked for a medium salmon, and that is exactly what i <mark>G</mark>.  to me, it was perfect.  it wasn't over the top on seasonin<mark>G</mark>, but somehow it was extremely flavorful.  li<mark>G</mark>, flaky and paired perfectly with the succotash and sauce.  a<mark>G</mark>, i had to send most of it back because i was <mark>G</mark> too full at this point and i didn't want to miss out on dessert.\n\nmy husband <mark>G</mark> the lamb, and he enjoyed it very much.  we also received this dish as a recipe card, so i'm sure we will be having lamb at our house in the near future.\n\naccompanying the entrees were two family-style sides: smashed potatoes (<mark>G</mark>!) and a sweet corn wth chorizo.  i loved both of these.  they are the epitome of comfort food to me.  another thing i could have just eaten all by itself and been perfectly happy.\n\nlast course was dessert.  they bring over an unwieldy, awkward cart filled with about 10 or so different thin<mark>G</mark>.  we were seated in a narrow space with tables on either side, so i have no idea how this cart ever made it over to us.  i was so full by this point that dessert didn't even sound <mark>G</mark>, but we split a peanut butter/raspberry jam tiramisu anyway.  it was surprisin<mark>G</mark> li<mark>G</mark> and very satisying.  it was a small, sin<mark>G</mark> portion so if you're on the ver<mark>G</mark> of unbuttoning your pants at the table, i think this item will be just enou<mark>G</mark> dessert for you.\n\nwe did <mark>G</mark> one of the chocolate cake thin<mark>G</mark> to <mark>G</mark>.  and then didn't proceed to eat it until the next ni<mark>G</mark>.  it didn't taste all that <mark>G</mark>, but that could've been cuz it sat in a plastic container for over 24 hours.\n\ni really had a <mark>G</mark> time at <mark>G</mark> and would 100% <mark>G</mark> back if we were locals and had the opportunity to do so.  i've already recommended this restaurant to several friends, and of course it is one of the hi<mark>G</mark> of my vacation recap.  to anyone trying to decide where to eat while visiting las ve<mark>G</mark>, all i can say is <mark>G</mark>, <mark>G</mark>, <mark>G</mark>!  you won't be disappointed.",

            "if this review was about the food at <mark>G</mark> it would be a 5 star review, in fact i'd be petitioning yelp to add a 6th star because the food is that <mark>G</mark>. however due to the absolutely abysmal service i received today at lunch <mark>G</mark> is <mark>G</mark> 2 stars. i hope my experience was an outlier & from what i've heard/seen that may be the truth but the service ruined what would have been an amazing meal for me & has probably made it so i won't return any time soon.\nas i said the food was amazing. everything came quickly from the kitchen (other than the bread which was a little backed up), but everything was plated beautifully & tasted amazing. we started with the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> & prosciutto dan danielle to start. the meatballs had a <mark>G</mark> flavor profile & were cooked to perfection. the prosciutto was a perfect balance of meat & ham & paired nicely with the warm bread & pesto. our entrees were the <mark>Venetian Panino</mark> & lasa<mark>G</mark>, both were delicious & while the portions are a touch small i was happy with them. for dessert we had zappole which were served with a chocolate sauce g & were a perfect end to the meal.\n& thus ends the <mark>G</mark> part of the review. let's discuss the service:\ni had a reservation that was made on open table, which was a <mark>G</mark> idea because even at 12:45 on a wednesday there was a line to <mark>G</mark> seated. we checked in & were seated within minutes by a very friendly hostess, who informed us we were seated in christopher h's section & that he would be by with menus in a moment.\n10 minutes later, we still haven't seen or heard from christopher, the busboy notices that we've been seated for a while & brin<mark>G</mark> us over some water, apolo<mark>G</mark> for the delay & <mark>G</mark> & fla<mark>G</mark> down our server.  about 3-5 minutes later he came over & dropped off the menus. he introduced himself & then went on for about 5 minutes explaining the menu in full detail. this would have been <mark>G</mark> however he was talking in a very hushed mumble & we could barely hear every 5th word he said over the noise in the room. he then said <mark>G</mark> us a minute to make our decision & he'd come back.\nanother 5 minutes after we had closed our menus & set them on the ed<mark>G</mark> of the table he finally came over & took our order.  he hurried off & entered our order, the apps came out before the bread which is fine, the runner explained that the bread oven was a \"little backed up because everything is made fresh\" but it came about 2 minutes after our apps <mark>G</mark> delivered. no big deal, it was delicious when it arrived. \nthe busby then came by & cleared our app plates & brou<mark>G</mark> over some silverware for our main course. our waiter came by moments before our entrees arrived & asked if we would like some more bread, to which i replied, \"yes the bread is <mark>G</mark> we'll take another\". \nthe entrees made their way to our table & they were <mark>G</mark>, the busboy came by & topped off our bevera<mark>G</mark>, but our server is nowhere to be found. no \"hey how's everything tasting\" or \"hey would you like some fresh cracked pepper\" nothing. he is bending over backwards to cater to the 5 top a few tables away from us & the couple seated ri<mark>G</mark> next to us, but he never  comes over to our table. we finish our entrees & the busboy scoops up our plates.\nmy aunt wants to check out the dessert menu, however our waiter is nowhere to be found so she <mark>G</mark> up, walks over 2 sections & asks a different waiter for a dessert menu. we then place a dessert order with the busboy because we haven't seen our waiter in a <mark>G</mark> 20 minutes, even thou<mark>G</mark> he's been to the table directly next to us no less than 4 times.  dessert is delivered & our waiter brin<mark>G</mark> out plates & a fork for the dessert course after the food has arrived. i immediately ask for the check as the 90 minutes we've been there was lon<mark>G</mark> than i planned & i need to duck out quickly for work.  he brin<mark>G</mark> the check by & moseys off.\ni have worked in the industry, i've waited tables in the past & am a majority of the time a <mark>G</mark> tipper however the service i received at a white table cloth celebrity chef spot was not worthy of my usual 20-25%. the bill was about $70, i paid $75, & our waiter took the check & went back to the wait station. \ni watched as his eyes <mark>G</mark> about as big as dish plates & he looks ri<mark>G</mark> at me & comes back with the bill to our table. he asks, \"did i take this too early\". to which i reply, \"no we're fine.\" he then says, \"you do know that here at <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> isn't included in the bill?\" to which i say, \"i know, there was nothing about your service that deserved more, maybe if you had actually acknowled<mark>G</mark> our existence you would have <mark>G</mark> a better tip.\"  he just shru<mark>G</mark> his shoulders & walked off.\non the way out the busboy once a<mark>G</mark> apolo<mark>G</mark> for the wait, but once a<mark>G</mark> the server didn't say a word other than to complain about his tip. \ni really enjoyed the food & it's a beautiful room, but that service was so bad that i probably won't be returning anytime soon.", 
            "well, here's the scoop:\n\n- we just walked in and had to wait 30 minutes for a table of 3. no reservation. \n- the food was delicious but the portions were sli<mark>G</mark> on the small side for the price.\n- the server we had was super slow and not very <mark>G</mark>.  everyone besides him was just fine,\n- the atmosphere was very cool and the decor was nice. we thorou<mark>G</mark> enjoyed that. \n- everything is a la carte. we each ordered a soft drink, a salad, two appetizers, each had an entree ($3), and had four of the small desserts they bring around on their dessert cart. oh, and sabrina ordered a coffee. i believe our bill was $240. a bit expensive for what it was. ok, very expensive for what it was.\n- the len<mark>G</mark> of time between our appetizers and entrees was way too long. we all a<mark>G</mark> to that. \n\ni would probably only <mark>G</mark> back if money fell out of the sky and we had a different server.",

            "3.5 stars.  i told myself i would write more reviews for this last foray to my favorite city, but writing a review for <mark>G</mark> is tou<mark>G</mark>.  there are equal amounts of pluses and minuses in my mind....and the fact that <mark>G</mark> delaurentis is my fantasy woman (don't tell the wife) makes this review especially difficult, but here <mark>G</mark>.\n\nyou need to make reservations well ahead of time.  ri<mark>G</mark> now, this restaurant seems to be the hottest thing around and even calling a month ahead only <mark>G</mark> us a 10:15 p.m. reservation. \n\nthe cromwell seems nicely redone.  leaving our taxi, we walked throu<mark>G</mark> the casino to the escalator leading strai<mark>G</mark> up to <mark>G</mark>.  it was bustling even at 10:00.  while we waited, we took advanta<mark>G</mark> of her photo booth-a definite thumbs up!\n\nthe restaurant, like the woman, is beautiful and so......tasteful.  should we expect less?  our table <mark>G</mark> us a partial view of caesar's and the bella<mark>G</mark>. clientele were well dressed except for one party of 4 dudes in shorts, jerseys, and baseball caps worn backwards.  \n\n<mark>G</mark> opened her windows, letting in the cool fall air.  <mark>G</mark> in theory, but a few thin<mark>G</mark> worked a<mark>G</mark> the ambience.  first of all, the restaurant was a bit noisy considering the beautiful people dining....ahem.  on this ni<mark>G</mark>, sirens cut throu<mark>G</mark> the restaurant every few minutes.  (we found out later that a distubance had occurred downtown.)\n\nour waiter seemed to know his stuff and had a wry demeanor i liked.  the problem was his timing was not in synch with ours.  for instance, he was ready to take our drink orders when we were still deciding between a red or a white to <mark>G</mark> along with our food.  when we decided, he was <mark>G</mark>.  i know we could have used the ipad, but neither the wife nor i could <mark>G</mark> it to <mark>G</mark> where we wanted it.  in <mark>G</mark>, everything was a little slow....ordering, drinks, food, coffee, check.  we were always waiting......\n\nthe food was perplexing.  servin<mark>G</mark> were small, but in<mark>G</mark> were quality.  tastes were innovative, but not necessarily what i wanted.  for instance, i ima<mark>G</mark> the crispy oysters rockefellers would be spinachy, cheesy, and bacony, with a rich sauce that i thou<mark>G</mark> would be crisped up somehow.  (my vocabulary is <mark>G</mark>!)  now maybe i'm wrong, but althou<mark>G</mark> the oysters were fresh, they were cooked in what tasted like a mi<mark>G</mark> sauce (wine vine<mark>G</mark>).  i think the crispy part was the bacon.  so it was refreshing and different, but not what i was looking for.\n\nthe same thing happened with her spa<mark>G</mark> with shrimp.  i wasn't expecting that much lemon so the first bite surprised me. the rich. cheesy pasta needs to be eaten hot. it <mark>G</mark> on me as i ate and while you mi<mark>G</mark> think there isn't enou<mark>G</mark> shrimp, they are quite lar<mark>G</mark> and cooked perfectly.\n\ni should have asked more questions about each dish.....at least then i wouldn't have been off balance so much.  i would <mark>G</mark> the food 4 stars, but service <mark>G</mark> only 3 stars for all the waiting......i still love you, <mark>G</mark>.......",

            "my husband and i are hu<mark>G</mark> fans of <mark>G</mark>.  we enjoy watching her on the food network and the today show. so we were excited to dine at her first restaurant. reservations were made ahead of time (about 2 months) as they have been busy since opening. \n\nthe restaurant had a <mark>G</mark> open feel with views of the bella<mark>G</mark> fountain. we took advanta<mark>G</mark> of the tasting menu (which is available on selected ni<mark>G</mark>).  you also receive a si<mark>G</mark> photo<mark>G</mark> of <mark>G</mark> and recipes to take home. the tasting menu took us back to our first meal when we visited italy. included antipasti, pasta, entree, and dessert. my favorites: bacon wrap dates, crostini topped with cured ahi, lemon spa<mark>G</mark> with shrimp and their chocolate tart with <mark>G</mark> crust topped with almond brittle.  pasta is made fresh and cooked al dente- just the way i like my pasta. salmon was also wild cau<mark>G</mark> and flown from washin<mark>G</mark> the day before. so fresh!  \n\nthe service was fantastic!  kevin our host was very knowled<mark>G</mark> about the menu and drinks. always came back to check on us especially after each dish was served. this is what will always have me coming back to dine. \n\nalthou<mark>G</mark> the tasting menu was pricey, it was well worth it.  it <mark>G</mark> us a sampling of <mark>G</mark>'s favorite dishes, and the service exceeded our expectations. \n\nthis is a must if you are in ve<mark>G</mark>. they are now open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. bon appetito!", 
            "i came here for lunch on my birthday with my mom and brother. i made reservations via open table, so of course, it was simple. \n\nwe had a moment before our table was ready, so i was excited to check out the photo booth. it's a very cool set up of having a built-in complimentary photo booth, except it is a very ti<mark>G</mark> space and it's difficult to reach the screen and be situated when the session starts. it was also unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> for us that their printer was out of service that morning! sad face! they do allow you to send the photos via e-mail, but the pixel quality is atrocious.\n\nthe restaurant is beautiful and the view of the strip (and bella<mark>G</mark> fountains) is <mark>G</mark>. i love the open kitchen and the antipasti bar. we were <mark>G</mark> a table next to the floor-to-ceiling windows, which was very nice. the chairs were comfortable, too. \n\nwe started with <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> with parmesan pomodoro ($15) and burrata with balsamic salt ($12). the meatballs were tender and flavorful; very satisfying. the burrata was also delicious; really creamy and <mark>G</mark> with that balsamic salt, evoo, and micro aru<mark>G</mark>. both fantastic antipasti dishes. they also offer complimentary bread that appears to be baked in a similar fashion to pizza (it may be their pizza dou<mark>G</mark>). it's served with a yummy pesto oil.\n\n<mark>Lobster Roll</mark> ($35): lemon basil a\\u00efoli and fried capers. all sandwiches are served with aru<mark>G</mark> salad or zucchini scapecce. i chose the zucchini scapecce, but was served the salad, so our server <mark>G</mark> brou<mark>G</mark> a small plate of scapecce to the table. it was a <mark>G</mark> error because i truly enjoyed the salad and the scapecce! they were delicious alone and with my sandwich. the sandwich is open-faced and stacked with scrumptious lobster meat. the mixture was so tasty!\n\n<mark>Venetian Panino</mark> ($18): turkey, <mark>G</mark>\\u00e8re, fontina, whole mustard, and peppadew. this panini sandwich was also well-made and delicious. it not entirely exciting, so i probably wouldn't order it over all the other menu selections. my mom really enjoyed it thou<mark>G</mark>!\n\n<mark>G's Baked Pasta</mark> of the day ($24): the lasa<mark>G</mark> had layers of e<mark>G</mark> as well as your usual suspects. this was really, really <mark>G</mark> lasa<mark>G</mark>. i love the addition of e<mark>G</mark> layers to make it a bit more healthy. \n\nchocolate tiramisu ($8): chocolate zabiaone and espresso-soaked ladyfin<mark>G</mark>. tiramisu is one of my absolute favorite desserts and this is seriously one of the best tiramisu i've ever had the pleasure of eating. they also wrote a very nice \"happy birthday\" messa<mark>G</mark> on the plate.\n\nespresso nocciolato ($9): lavazza <mark>G</mark> riserva, nutella, whipped cream, toasted hazelnuts, and a li<mark>G</mark> dusting of cocoa powder. this was really tasty and a fun way to drink a shot of espresso!\n\nthe food was all delicious! the service was wonderful and we had a very pleasant experience. it was a fantastic birthday celebration. my only complaint: why is everything so petite??! you pay quite a premium on the dishes that i didn't expect from <mark>G</mark>. also, beware that you are char<mark>G</mark> for \"still\" water! i thou<mark>G</mark> they meant tap water when i was asked (they only offered still or sparkling), so i was surprised to see the char<mark>G</mark> on the bill. oddly, they only served us the one bottle, then switched to tap water without asking us if we wanted another bottle of still water.",

            "i really wanted to eat here but had no reservations.  luckily we sna<mark>G</mark> seats at the bar which was <mark>G</mark>.  the full menu is not available at the bar but parts of it are. certain pastas could be ordered while others could not.  i'm not sure why this is a rule but it is.  some really <mark>G</mark> wines available by the <mark>G</mark>, i'm not too familiar with italian wines the the bartender helped me choose a couple that i really ended up liking.  \n\nstarted with the kale and wild mushroom pizette and the lobster arincici.  both were very <mark>G</mark>, the portion size was small but perfect considering they were both very rich.\n\nthe service  was <mark>G</mark> and the <mark>G</mark> behind the bar were sweet.  unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> like almost all bartenders i encounter in ve<mark>G</mark> they seemed a little jaded and who can blame them.  people come to ve<mark>G</mark> and <mark>G</mark> on there worst behavior.  there where rude customers sitting on both sides of us.  the man to the ri<mark>G</mark> of me was appalled that his charred octopus had a burnt flavor to it.....hello!!!!\n\nanyways do yourself a favor and try <mark>G</mark>.  i want to come back for breakfast and lunch.",

            "not terrible. when you expect to pay $400-500 for dinner for four, you just want something more than that. this was meant to be our 'big splur<mark>G</mark>' meal for our weekend in ve<mark>G</mark>. here's the lowdown:  ambience: lovely, modern italian upscale restaurant, busy. tables are so close to<mark>G</mark> that i had to apolo<mark>G</mark> to <mark>G</mark> behind me as i accidentally bumped his chair several times. service: <mark>G</mark>, slow paced, but that's <mark>G</mark> for a restaurant experience of this $$ scale- you kind of want time to stop for a while to enjoy the meal. servers attentive and friendly. food: recommend: <mark>G</mark>'s favorite antipasti: delicious bites of crostini, olives, mushrooms, and other <mark>G</mark>. this was $60, but enou<mark>G</mark> for all four of us to enjoy as an appetizer. if only we had stopped there. the <mark>G</mark> salad, li<mark>G</mark> dressed with a vina<mark>G</mark> and parmesan, looked delicious. the lobster ravioli was chock-full of nice lobster pieces and very delicious. now for the downside: soup du jour was a roasted cauliflower. meh, it was okay, a small portion. my partner had the minestrone and i had a taste. this was in no way minestone. it was a thin, processed <mark>G</mark> that had no identifiable ve<mark>G</mark> in it and tasted of the sin<mark>G</mark> at the bottom of the pot. the frico of parmesan (a little crisp of <mark>G</mark> shredded parm) couldn't save the flavor and, soaked in the <mark>G</mark>, the texture suffered too. i wanted to have another bite just to make sure it was as bad as i'm describing, but i stopped at the first bite without re<mark>G</mark>. partner and i shared the chicken cacciatore style, about $60, meant for two. note that style-part. this was not standard cacciatore. this was a whole chicken (a petite one) and the parts were breaded and deep fried. the fried chicken, stacked prettily on both sides of the platter, was so dry and tastelessly overcooked there wasn't enou<mark>G</mark> of the small crock of a ve<mark>G</mark> ra<mark>G</mark> type sauce to save it. we did finish it, which tells you how tiny this bird was- with this amount of food on the table, ima<mark>G</mark> each of us eating four pieces of standard fried chicken. relative had a risotto dish which she described as making better herself and other had the <mark>G</mark> lamb chops which he described as tasteless, without seasoning. overall, the food presentation was just as pretty as <mark>G</mark> herself, but lacked the expected excitement and flavor she brin<mark>G</mark> to her show. all four of us were disappointed with the meal. hope the kinks work themselves out, but we won't be back to see it.",

            "i am a hu<mark>G</mark> fan of <mark>G</mark>, so i was very excited to support her and her restaurant. i had made reservations in advance for 11 am on a sunday morning and was told that it would be breakfast time when i arrived. not wanting to waste any time i looked up in advanced what i had wanted to order online. my friend & i ended up arriving 30 mins late due to the rain and having a very hard time finding the parking structure to the cromwell hotel. needless to say, we didn't make breakfast & it was already lunch time when we had arrived. we had to take the long way thru the flamin<mark>G</mark> hotel, and it was a bit of a pain in the ass.\n\nanyways! we were seated ri<mark>G</mark> away and i loved how cute the hostesses dresses were. it was very \"<mark>G</mark>\" like. the service was def up to par, the mana<mark>G</mark> checked up on us three times asking if we needed anything and if the entrees were delicious. our server was very knowled<mark>G</mark> and very patient with us, while we decided what to order. we didn't order her recommendations but what we <mark>G</mark> were delicious! the complimentary flat bread and pesto was amazing. so fresh & delicious. i ordered the aru<mark>G</mark> salad with pancetta, candied lemon peels, and freshly shaved parmesan cheese. i thru on an order of the shrimp and <mark>G</mark> two hu<mark>G</mark> shrimps. the salad was one of the best salads i have ever had. it was very simple but tasted so <mark>G</mark>. i do think however, it needed some kind of crunch.. maybe some walnuts or pecans perhaps. i also ordered a vanilla tea which was also <mark>G</mark> but was rather on the cold side. my friend ordered a pepperoni pizza which she enjoyed but it wasn't necessarily amazing... i wasn't really feeling the decor on the inside but the outside of the restaurant looked nice. towards the end when we <mark>G</mark> our bill... it was around 50 dollars, which i thou<mark>G</mark> to be pretty cheap.. but then a<mark>G</mark> i paid 22 dollars for salad.. lol.\n\nall in all i will be back in au<mark>G</mark> to try dinner!!

            "i was excited to <mark>G</mark> a reservation at 8:15 p.m. on a weekday only a couple of days beforehand.  i had wanted to try this restaurant ever since it opened.  it's situated on the second floor of the cromwell and is considered part of the total rewards family, so you <mark>G</mark> $1 off per entree if you show them your free membership card (and <mark>G</mark> points)!\n\nwe arrive a little early and had planned to order a drink at the bar.  the restaurant wasn't full - maybe 1/2 or so?  i noticed that throu<mark>G</mark> the ni<mark>G</mark>, the restaurant was never at capacity.  maybe they do this purposely to allow for better service?  anyway, we were seated only a few minutes after checking in, so we didn't have a chance to order at the bar, which looked like it had nice and comfortable seating.\n\nthe restaurant offers a tasting menu for $100 something along with a booklet of of a couple of the recipes and a picture of <mark>G</mark>.  i noticed they also did this at <mark>G</mark> ramsay steak, too.  we declined and instead ordered from the re<mark>G</mark> menu.  we also noticed that their specialty cocktails were listed along with photos on an ipad instead of on a menu.  <mark>G</mark> did this as well...maybe it's a new ve<mark>G</mark> thing?  i liked it, thou<mark>G</mark>.  you don't order with the ipad, thou<mark>G</mark>, but order with your waiter.  we ordered:\n\n-<mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> - really tender meatballs (comes with five small meatballs).  sauce seemed like re<mark>G</mark> spa<mark>G</mark> sauce but you could tell the meatballs were not your ordinary fare.\n-lemon and basil spa<mark>G</mark> ($34) - the spa<mark>G</mark> was supposed to come al dente, but it didn't.  it was sli<mark>G</mark> overcooked.  boo.  the two shrimp it came with were very lar<mark>G</mark>, sweet, and delicious.  however, the spa<mark>G</mark> itself was disappointing.  i could taste more of the pasta itself vs the sauce, which was a li<mark>G</mark> lemon sauce.  i felt sli<mark>G</mark> cheated at the price and wasn't very happy with the dish. \n-scallops & crab risotto ($32) - this was also very avera<mark>G</mark>.  my friend had been craving a <mark>G</mark> risotto after a while, but this just tasted like soupy rice.  the scallops were a bit on the salty side, and i think there were maybe three little pieces of crab in the rice.  it was decent but not as <mark>G</mark> as oc's pinot provence corn risotto i had a year or so a<mark>G</mark>.\n-broccoli rabe ($10) - my friend thou<mark>G</mark> this was a bit too salty, but i thou<mark>G</mark> it was just ri<mark>G</mark>.  it was cooked nicely and had a sli<mark>G</mark> sweet chili flavoring.   \n-chocolate budino - came chilled and was very smooth (thicker than a pudding and creamier).  thumbs up.  the little sprinkles of pistachio crumbs were really <mark>G</mark>, too.  \n\nthey <mark>G</mark> us a short of sweet sparkling wine as an amuse bouche, which i liked.  it reminded me of a li<mark>G</mark> moscato.  they also <mark>G</mark> you three kinds of bread.  our favorite was the big crispy cheese \"chip\".  yum.  they also <mark>G</mark> you a platter of five different condiments like lemon butter (nicely whipped with a sli<mark>G</mark> taste of lemon), dried capers, etc.  cool!  drinks were about $14 each.  i ordered one that was quite lar<mark>G</mark> and semi-sweet  (it was pink colored and not her si<mark>G</mark> cocktail).  it didn't seem to have much alcohol in it, but it was refreshing at least.\n\nunfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, our entrees were lackluster and sli<mark>G</mark> disappointing.  we had a much better dinner the ni<mark>G</mark> before at <mark>G</mark> ramsay steak, thou<mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> was more expensive.  <mark>G</mark>'s was no inexpensive meal either but just wasn't worth it.  restaurant decor is soothing and nice - reminded me of someone's fancy house.", 
            "this was one of the best meals i have had in recent memory.  the location of the restaurant is perfectly set to provide a 270 de<mark>G</mark> view of the strip.  our curved booth was front and center to the bank of windows overlooking bella<mark>G</mark> and caesars palace.\n\n<mark>G</mark>'s choice of interior desi<mark>G</mark> touches and colors was immaculate.  the staff was friendly and attentive.  the cocktails were amazing.  i had one with jameson black barrel called flash.  all her cocktails are named after movies that her family had produced.  the cocktail was the best cocktail that i have ever had off one of those si<mark>G</mark> cocktail menus.\n\nthe bread plate came out and it had a freshly baked bun of rosemary foccacia that was presented in a cast iron bowl.  also with some flat bread parmesan crisps and breadsticks.  along with those were some small bows of pink sea salt, fresh pesto, marscapone spread, and chili flakes.  we dipped and crunched our way throu<mark>G</mark> those while enjoying cocktails and <mark>G</mark> over the strip.  \n\nfor appetizers we had 1 cauliflower soup, 1 beets and cheese and apples salad, and 2 caesar salads.  the caesar salad's were off the charts.  the dressing was a caesar vinai<mark>G</mark> that was so fresh and tasty.\n\nentrees were surf and turf - filet mi<mark>G</mark> under a crab raviolo with the most amazing sauce - each of these were the best i have ever tasted.  pork ra<mark>G</mark> papperdele - pasta was perfectly al dente.  risotto with scallops - the best scallops i have ever tasted.  <mark>G</mark> salmon - the best i have ever tasted!\n\ndesserts were an apple tart and a chocolate <mark>G</mark>.  the apple tart was excellent.  so fresh tasting and the chocolate <mark>G</mark> was awesome.\n\nto <mark>G</mark> you an idea of how <mark>G</mark> the food was, i asked the waiter \"how do these dishes taste so <mark>G</mark>?  is it the quality of the food, like the freshness?  what is it!?\"  \n\ndon't <mark>G</mark> to las ve<mark>G</mark> without eating here.",

            "<mark>G</mark> dining experience overall, small pricey portions. everything has her name on it! the place mats, plates, napkins, etc....it literally screams <mark>G</mark>. just in case you for<mark>G</mark> where you're eating. \n\nnot sure why, but everything i ordered had lemon in it. including my cocktail. \n\nthe one thing that stood out to me was the bread. they <mark>G</mark> you bread sticks, these cheese crackers, and a little pan of focaccia. this comes with a tray of toppin<mark>G</mark> to compliment: fried capers, lemon butter, pepper flakes, pesto, sea salt. this was <mark>G</mark>! \n\nspa<mark>G</mark>: no it's not your red sauce with meatballs. creamy lemon sauce with 2 prawns on the side. i don't really like shrimp but these were very <mark>G</mark>. pasta was very li<mark>G</mark> and delicious. also $34 for a very very small amount. \n\nsquash crostini: prosciutto and lemon ricotta with squash bits. these were <mark>G</mark>, but 4 little toasty bits cost me $15! \n\nin the end, the ambience, the presentation and the food made it worth it. very pricey for the portions thou<mark>G</mark>. oh and the check comes with an ipod which i have no idea what for.", 
            "we had lunch here with my family last year on september 5th. we were impressed with the interiors of the restaurant, it looks clean, classy and homey. we also partook of using their photo-booth at the waiting area of the restaurant. customer front service were young ladies, they were <mark>G</mark>. our server was a french dude, who was also very nice and welcoming. the mana<mark>G</mark> also made sure that my 3 year-old son is comfortable, he was <mark>G</mark> a portable dvd player so that he can watch a movie. that was very nice. since they're relatively new, we were asked a couple of times on how we were doing. while it is a family restaurant, unlike a typical italian restaurant their servin<mark>G</mark> are portioned, meaning it is a fine dining serving. it was expected, but mind you their food was flavorful. we loved everything we ordered, from the antipasti, entree and dessert, food was fabulous. dining experience was superb, if you hit ve<mark>G</mark> on your next trip, do try <mark>G</mark>'s!",

            "very disappointed!! \n\nwe went to <mark>G</mark>'s for my wife's 49th birthday while in ve<mark>G</mark>.  my wife and i were both looking forward to having dinner here and were not surprised by the hi<mark>G</mark> prices.  we expected it, since we were eating at a place owned by a famous chef'. \n\nthe restaurant was ele<mark>G</mark> with a pretty decent view of the strip,  however, we were very surprised by the poor quality of our dinner.  seriously disappointed!! .  \n\nour filets and lobster ravioli was seriously short of our expectations.  while we expected the small sized portion, which is typical with finer dining (you know, less is more), the flavor did not not make up for it.  both of our filets were burned on one side and was topped by one small ravioli.  yes, that's correct, one ravioli.  the ravioli was very dry and hard around the ed<mark>G</mark>, where i had to use my knife to cut it.  you would think at $56 dollars (ala carte) you would expect it to be perfect!  i just could fi<mark>G</mark>...the only way to ruin a filet is by over cooking it....they did.\n\nservice was okay, i say just okay because our waitress was having trouble with the other wait staff. a little disa<mark>G</mark> over using each others menus.  the service staff need a lot more training it seems.  our small table for two quickly became over crowded. as the dish (extra dish) piled up,  with the raised place mat, bread dish, and <mark>G</mark>, there was little room for anything else.  hence, once the bread tray arrived, it didn't easily fit on the table.  so picture what it looked like when the bus boy didn't remove empty dishes,  i was forced to start stacking dishes on my table and had to ask to have them removed.  .\n\nthey did bring my wife a very tiny dessert and sparkling wine because it was her birthday.  however, i think it was more that we complained to the mana<mark>G</mark>, who told us we should have told him or the waitress sooner.  \n\nthe interesting thing was that the bill included an iphone to take a survey on the service we received.  one of the questions was \"did the mana<mark>G</mark> visit you during your meal?\" since he didn't show up until after we had received our bill and completed the survey, i said \"no.\"   funny, after i advised him of the poor quality of food, the mana<mark>G</mark> asked if i had already completed the survey.  the irony was he never offered any way to make up for our poor experience.  my opinion, it was because i had already filled out the survey.\n\nso, after settling our $200 bill,  we a<mark>G</mark> we wouldn't be returning to <mark>G</mark>'s on our next trip to ve<mark>G</mark>.  especially since ve<mark>G</mark> has plenty of <mark>G</mark> restaurants to choose from during our four to six visits a year.", 
            "i was super excited to try out <mark>G</mark> because of the previous reviews and pictures i had viewed on yelp and because of <mark>G</mark>'s reputation in the culinary world (i just love her!) however, i was not overly impressed with my overall experience when i dined here for breakfast a couple of weeks a<mark>G</mark>.\n\ni made a reservation for 2 people on a sunday morning, so when i showed up ri<mark>G</mark> on time, i was surprised they weren't able to seat us ri<mark>G</mark> away since we were one of the first tables there. they told us it would be about a 5-10 minute wait... i would have understood this if they were just waiting for their full wait staff to show up for the morning shift, however they kept seating other tables before us that had actually arrived after us. after about 20 minutes of waiting around, i finally went back to the hostess stand to ask what the scoop was, and she rushed around a little bit to finally <mark>G</mark> us seated.\n\nthe restaurant decor was absolutely beautiful thou<mark>G</mark>, with so many \"<mark>G</mark>\" details throu<mark>G</mark> the space. <mark>G</mark> si<mark>G</mark> tableware and even <mark>G</mark> si<mark>G</mark> cappuccino cups and saucers. these little touches were <mark>G</mark>.\n\nthe service was extremely slow. our server would disappear forever before we could track her down to order more items. wasn't my favorite. \n\nwe started with the breakfast pastry assortment... $15 and not really worth it. there were maybe 2 items out of the 5 or so that i actually liked. our entrees were <mark>G</mark> thou<mark>G</mark>; i went with the italian hash:  potatoes, bacon,  salami, peppers, tomato, onion with sunny side up e<mark>G</mark> & toast. felt like a cleaner version of \"hash\" compared to what i am used to in texas. this plate was $19...  kind of expensive for a breakfast item... but then a<mark>G</mark>, this is ve<mark>G</mark>. my boyfriend had the american breakfast, which was fine... nothing special. so for some lackluster pastries, two entrees, two coffees, and 1 over-priced mimosa, the final bill for breakfast came out to $100 after tip. \n\nnot sure i would su<mark>G</mark> this spot to anyone. happy i tried it, but doubt i will ever be back. sorry <mark>G</mark> :(",

(1). we waited 15 minutes and watched as tables emptied around the exterior windows which are where we wanted to sit.  i walked back to the hostess stand to check on our table and brou<mark>G</mark> up we would be happy with any of the 6 tables that were open by the windows.  she said those were reserved for dinner which would be opening at 4:30. (2) i promised we would not take 2 1/2 hours and would be as accommodating as possible.  she said she would let us know.  walked back to join my wife at the bar, still no wine.(3) and the bartender(s) were now all con<mark>G</mark> at the back of the bar....  another 5 minutes and our hostess <mark>G</mark> us at the bar and said our table was ready... i walked to the back of the bar and told our bt we were being seated...he <mark>G</mark> me the receipt. still no wine and said <mark>G</mark> it our hostess and she would handle. (4). the hostess then sat us in the bar area in the back by the kitchen completely on the other side from the window area.  i asked our hostess if we could sit and one of the empty 5 tables that i pointed out.  she said she would have to ask a mana<mark>G</mark>. (5)  we then sat at a sofa chair area in front of the bar to wait for her mana<mark>G</mark>.  after another 5 minutes my wife was really embarrassed as this was her big surprise for me to eat with her...and she said i'm sorry...we can <mark>G</mark> if you want to which i said...lets just wait 5 more minutes....i looked over at my bartender who was still at the back of the bar...i then looked at the now 6 empty tables and said to my wife lets <mark>G</mark>...  i walked back to my bartender and told him to cancel the white burg and he started talking sideways that the som was coming(6) to which i said don't worry about it...we walked out to the hostess stand and told the hostess to not worry about seating us to which she also said the mana<mark>G</mark> would be ri<mark>G</mark> with us(7)... i was already on the escalator heading down and my wife told her it just wasn't worth it now.  needless to say it was a disaster and i spent my $300 on lunch next-door.  i <mark>G</mark> they for<mark>G</mark> that there are hundreds of <mark>G</mark> spots in ve<mark>G</mark> all vying for our hard earned money. so that was my story.....  it blew.", 
            "the server was incredibly stuck up and rude, treating us more like he deserved to be waited on than us.  we were seated for a late dinner around 9:45 and were rushed into ordering because the kitchen closed at 10:30.  for this price, why would you seat people when they cannot order at a comfortable pace?  they were also out of a few dishes that we very much wanted to try.\n\nthe food was unique and delicious, but not up to the level that the prices and atmosphere would su<mark>G</mark>.  i enjoyed the food, but it was nothing compared to what i have experienced at similarly priced restaurants.", 
            "first off i have to start by lau<mark>G</mark> at some of these reviews. people complain about prices. do you not understand you are on the strip? if you don't want to spend that money then don't <mark>G</mark>. and if you are complaing then your probably trying to <mark>G</mark> something free out of it. like one person who complained then continued to say they didn't even offer us a free dessert. really? shocking.  i <mark>G</mark> out to eat all the time and never once did i <mark>G</mark> on yelp and blast a restaurant like some of these people do. if you don't like it who cares. don't <mark>G</mark> back. do you really think i'm <mark>G</mark> to listen to you <mark>G</mark>? i will make my own decisions.  with that said i have been to <mark>G</mark>. about 4 times already. why? cause i know <mark>G</mark> food. because i don't listen to other people. the mushroom pizza, the shrimp pizza are amazing. <mark>G</mark> flavor combos and the pizza dou<mark>G</mark> is li<mark>G</mark> and crispy. coming from the east coast you can't <mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> pizza out here. this by far is the best. the antipasto is like none other in ve<mark>G</mark>. it's a,meal in itself. have that at the bar with a drink and your set.  i basically tried all the pastas. and yes a<mark>G</mark> it was <mark>G</mark>. service is always spot on and so are the bartenders. now if you don't mind spending money, because you are eating on the strip,  and you have an understanding about food this is the place.  for her first restaurant, it's a <mark>G</mark> start.", 
            "once a<mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark>'s did not fail to impress. \ni came in with my family last saturday for dinner (first time for dinner) and we could not have been more blown away. there were three of us and we shared everything.\n\nour server joseph was top notch. he was sweet and funny, he really took care of us.\n\nwe started out with the lar<mark>G</mark> salumi platter and i'm drooling thinking about it now. a mixture of salami (salumi?) and cheeses to <mark>G</mark> with the house made bread\nwe also ordered the bacon wrapped dates !!! you must must try them. sweet, spicy and salty. i need those back in my life.\n\nnext, we had the buccatini and lemon spa<mark>G</mark>. the buccatini had a spicy red sauce and was definitely my favorite. i am a hu<mark>G</mark> fan of spicy! the lemon spa<mark>G</mark> was accompanied by jumbo shrimp.. the size of my hand! \n\nlastly, we ordered the 22 oz bone in rib eye with an e<mark>G</mark> on top and farrotto. the food was so incredibly tasty and delicious. we didn't <mark>G</mark> to dessert we mi<mark>G</mark> have to come back just for that and for breakfast!!",

            "we dined here last ni<mark>G</mark> for a early valentine's day celebration.   as locals working in the industry you very rarely celebrate anything on the actual day. when first arriving to the restaurant we noticed how beautifully decorated the hotel and entrance to the restaurant was.  if you remember what bill's was before you would a<mark>G</mark> how much of a face lift this place <mark>G</mark>.  we checked out the photo booth before dinner since we <mark>G</mark> there 5 mins before our reso and they didn't seat us ri<mark>G</mark> away.  as we walked out of the booth the hostess told us our table was ready but not to worry about the pictures cuz it was out of paper to print them.   why wouldn't you put a si<mark>G</mark> up or something so <mark>G</mark> know to email the photos to themselves?   or not take the pictures at all.  whatever!  we followed the hostess to what seemed like the back corner of the restaurant.  the table she tried to seat us at was literally in the corner with a deuce so close to it we mi<mark>G</mark> as well have had dinner with the couple next to us and been a party of 4.  i asked her if any other table would be available.   she had us wait in the loun<mark>G</mark> while she went back to check.  we didn't mind the wait, about 15-20 mins, ordered a cocktail to start.  <mark>G</mark> selling tactic if it was one!  taylor, the hostess, came back to escort us to a table by the window overlooking the fountains.  she was super friendly and accomadating!  honestly her willin<mark>G</mark> to help us was probably the hi<mark>G</mark> of our ni<mark>G</mark>.  once at the table our server came over and <mark>G</mark> us, presented a wine list and dinner menu.  he took a moment to explain the menu and some si<mark>G</mark> dishes.  the <mark>G</mark> came over and interrupted him during his spiel, said hi to us, said something to the server, and then walked away.  weird.   (and he never touched the table after that)  i was torn between a couple different items and asked the server what he would recommend.   he didn't seem as if he wanted to answer my questions.  almost as if we were bothering him.   we ended up ordering the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, bacon wrapped dates, burrata, and the tricolore salad to start.  they were all <mark>G</mark>, nothing spectacular.   the bread selection was <mark>G</mark> thou<mark>G</mark>.   we wanted to order a bottle of wine but had a couple questions for the sommelier.   he was tied up at another table and we didn't <mark>G</mark> a chance to order the wine until we were done with our apps.  a little disappointing.   in his defense the apps did come out quite quickly.  but still, no one likes to be rushed.  the weird thing was the apps came out super quick but we waited a long time for our entrees.   for our entrees i <mark>G</mark> the spa<mark>G</mark>, her si<mark>G</mark> dish.   it had these hu<mark>G</mark> prawns with lemon and capers.  it sounds better on paper than it was.  my bf had the pasta with the pork ra<mark>G</mark>.   both dishes were very bland.  we had to add salt and red pepper flakes from the bread presentation to spice it up.  i hate to say it but we were super disappointed.   we had heard so many <mark>G</mark> thin<mark>G</mark> about this place but didn't have anything <mark>G</mark> for ourselves.  they have this dessert cart that you see <mark>G</mark> around that apparently is only for the patrons who ordered the tasting menu.  so don't <mark>G</mark> your hopes up when you see it unless you have the tasting menu.  we ordered the cookies for dessert since nothing really jumped out at us.  they were unique.   not soon after we dug into the cookies our server dropped the check.  obviously he had someplace else to be and we were in his way!  overall we were disappointed.  not to mention once the bottle of wine was opened we had to keep pouring it ourselves.  maybe $100 bottle of wine is too cheap to have any sort of table maintenance.   the server hardly came by to check on us.  maybe we were just to critical of the place or maybe they were having an off day.  but none the less, with so many <mark>G</mark> options in this city <mark>G</mark> will not be at the top of our list.  sometimes people that work in the same industry are much more critical than others.  or maybe not, who really knows.",

(when she checked with the kitchen thou<mark>G</mark>, it did materialize.) she also cleared our apps without asking if we were done because our entrees were ready.  third, the food execution......the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> were tasty and the burrata a<mark>G</mark> delicious. i did a repeat of the branzino because i loved it so much the first time, but this time it lacked seasoning and was the skin was crispy in parts and so<mark>G</mark> in others. my friend <mark>G</mark> the rack of lamb, which was a pretty tiny portion to be<mark>G</mark> with, which wouldn't have been an issue if 1/3 of it was big <mark>G</mark> of fat.  we didn't even bother with dessert.  \n\ni have no issues with portions sizes and inflated prices on the strip because usually you <mark>G</mark> what you pay for from a reputable restaurant.  this was a major disappointment.  i may one day try it a<mark>G</mark>, but it'll be for breakfast or lunch if anything.",

            "i had such hi<mark>G</mark> hopes for this restaurant, but sadly was let down. stopped by for lunch today and tried both pasta dishes, as the first one was so bland i sent it back. the 2nd dish was the pasta of the day, lasa<mark>G</mark>, seasoned better but still subpar. i have tried many of her recipes at home myself and they have all come out <mark>G</mark>, but it appears her cook staff needs more practice. they can start by maybe tasting the food before sending it out.\n  the view was nice and our waiter, victor, was excellent. other than that, i would not recommend this place.",

            "a <mark>G</mark> of us <mark>G</mark> to las ve<mark>G</mark> a few times a year, and we always try new top-end restaurants on each trip.  this time <mark>G</mark> was our choice for saturday ni<mark>G</mark>. \n\nthe <mark>G</mark>:\nthe ambiance of the place was <mark>G</mark>.  the check-in process was very efficient, and we sat in the bar / waiting area and had drinks while we waited for our table (we arrived early to enjoy a drink).  our table was ready ri<mark>G</mark> on time (in fact a few minutes early) and we were seated in the smaller room off the main dining area (which was fine with all of us).  \n\nthe not so <mark>G</mark>:\nfirst, let's talk about the food.  we ordered a lot of appetizers for the <mark>G</mark> to try a bunch of thin<mark>G</mark>.  it came to the table very quickly - which was <mark>G</mark>.  in terms of quality thou<mark>G</mark>, none of it was bad, but none of it was <mark>G</mark>.  we all considered it very pedestrian - and i think the best word to sum it up: \"meh\". \n\nsecond, we had a party of five people.  we all know that there are a set number of pieces for most dishes (4 pieces, 6 pieces).  most hi<mark>G</mark>-end restaurants we've been will ask us if we would like to have an extra piece made for the <mark>G</mark> so everyone can try something (and our answer is always yes - re<mark>G</mark> of the extra fee).  that wasn't offered here - in fact - the one place we did ask for it - it didn't happen.  we were informed that the standard pizza was cut in to four pieces.  we politely asked if they could have it cut in to five pieces.  needless to say, our request wasn't well received and sure enou<mark>G</mark> - not 2 minutes later - out comes a pizza in four pieces.  we don't even think the request was passed on <mark>G</mark> how quickly it came out (nor did the server mention anything about it).\n\nlast, one of our party had ordered a beer and he considered it too warm.  the bottle was reasonably cold - but the beer itself inside was actually quite warm.  he asked if they could please <mark>G</mark> him another one - and after a brief exchan<mark>G</mark> (i don't think they really understand why he was asking) - they <mark>G</mark> him a fresh one.  same problem here - warm inside.  so they took this one and put it in a bucket of ice for a few minutes after we asked a<mark>G</mark> for a cold one - needless to say the problem wasn't effectively solved (and a<mark>G</mark> - no apolo<mark>G</mark> for the inconvenience or offers for something else).  \n\nsummary:\nwe had very hi<mark>G</mark> expectations (the ni<mark>G</mark> before we enjoyed a <mark>G</mark> meal at a different restaurant) - but unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, this restaurant didn't deliver.  the best i can say was the food was \"meh\" and the service was just ok but certainly not <mark>G</mark>.  there are a lot of other <mark>G</mark> restaurants in las ve<mark>G</mark> and i think that <mark>G</mark>'s is <mark>G</mark> to really have to step up the <mark>G</mark> if they want to compete.",

            "the husband and i have been wanting to eat at <mark>G</mark>'s restaurant for a while. we finally dined here for dinner last month for my birthday. in fact, i think i called in the reservation about 3 months before. not that i needed to that far in advance, but its never bad to plan thin<mark>G</mark> early, ri<mark>G</mark>? i also requested a table with a <mark>G</mark> view. althou<mark>G</mark> they said \"we will try as much as possible, but not <mark>G</mark>,\" we did end up <mark>G</mark> a table facing the bella<mark>G</mark> fountains. also <mark>G</mark> a fantastic view of the crazy traffic on las ve<mark>G</mark> blvd, lol. \n\ncustomer service was excellent. our server and the staff was very nice, polite and attentive. drinks were refilled and dirty plates were taken away in a timely manner. so here's the thing: years a<mark>G</mark> when i did watch <mark>G</mark>'s cooking show, i really liked her recipes because they were simple. few in<mark>G</mark>, preparing didn't look too difficult and of course everything looked so <mark>G</mark>! when i was browsing the menu, everything looked so complicated. i <mark>G</mark> it doesn't help that i'm picky about what i eat, but its never a <mark>G</mark> si<mark>G</mark> for me when nothing on the menu really catches my eye. so i ordered probably the most boring thing on the menu: spa<mark>G</mark>. i know, i know, but it was the only dish that didn't have thin<mark>G</mark> that i hated like squash, mushrooms, brussel sprouts, etc.\n\nwe started with appetizers. we asked our server what appetizer was popular under the meat cate<mark>G</mark>, and he recommended the bacon wrapped dates. not a fan of dates, but they were stuffed with sausa<mark>G</mark> and wrapped in bacon. sounded like they were worth a try. i was surprised that i could hardly taste the dates and the sausa<mark>G</mark> did have a kick to it, but they were <mark>G</mark>. we also ordered the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>, which were juicy and tasty as well. it also came with a <mark>G</mark> amount of sauce.\n\nnow to the main course. i was excited when the food was brou<mark>G</mark> to our table because the presentation was pretty. for my spa<mark>G</mark>, there were two jumbo shrimp on the bottom and a dollop of spa<mark>G</mark> sitting on top of the shrimp. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, i didn't like the lemon sauce too much. i was kind of over it after the first few bites, but forced myself to eat it all because this place isn't cheap! u<mark>G</mark>, i'm definitely not a fan of sweet spa<mark>G</mark>. it needed butter, or maybe just salt. my husband, on the other hand loved his food! he ordered the bone-in tuscan rib-eye with truffle flakes. our server said that occasionally they offer the truffle flakes in the restaurant. i thou<mark>G</mark> it was weird that there was a sunny side up e<mark>G</mark> on the steak. but then a<mark>G</mark>, i do hate e<mark>G</mark>. i know that e<mark>G</mark> are used to make a lot of foods and that is fine. i <mark>G</mark> i should say that i don't like e<mark>G</mark> by itself or e<mark>G</mark> that are visible. anyway, he said that the rib-eye was fantastic and one of the best steaks he ever had. \n\ni really wanted to order a tiramisu for dessert, but our server told us that they only serve it when they have some special \"tastin<mark>G</mark> menu.\"  :( total fail for me, but at least one of us really liked the food here.\n\nbeen there, done that, but i probably won't be back. a little disappointing, but oh well, there are many other <mark>G</mark> eats in ve<mark>G</mark>!",

            "had lunch here on a lark, since we're a fan of <mark>G</mark> on food network. the view of the strip is exceptional -- one of the best without being on somebody's roof. food wise, my mar<mark>G</mark> flat bread was <mark>G</mark> (thou<mark>G</mark> not amazing); the same can be said for my partner's <mark>Lemon Pesto <mark>G</mark> Cheese</mark>. the shaved zucchini(?)/potato \"fries\" were really creative and delicious thou<mark>G</mark>.\n\nit is worth noting that the portions are relatively small, but that wasn't the worst thing in the world <mark>G</mark> the amount we had <mark>G</mark> ourselves elsewhere during the vacation. moreover, the price was exceptionally reasonable for the strip -- with a 20% off coupon our bill (for two) came to around $25. it absolutely makes sense as a place to <mark>G</mark> a nice casual lunch for a reasonable price if you're recovering from a food or<mark>G</mark> the ni<mark>G</mark> before (a not-uncommon problem for ve<mark>G</mark> vacationers!).",

            "dining at <mark>G</mark> was <mark>G</mark>. however, i will start this review off by saying i wish i had come for dinner. the lunch menu is si<mark>G</mark> limited compared to their dinner offerin<mark>G</mark>. for example, there are only 3 pasta options for lunch. ima<mark>G</mark> my disappointment when i learned the lemon shrimp spa<mark>G</mark> that everyone raved about on yelp is not offered on the lunch menu, only dinner! \n\nbut, i di<mark>G</mark>. ambiance: located on the 2nd floor of the cromwell, the restaurant is beautiful. let's be honest, <mark>G</mark> is beautiful. she is probably my only and real \"woman crush.\" the restaurant ambiance and decor emulate her. it's very inviting, spacious, ele<mark>G</mark>, yet also homey. not to mention a <mark>G</mark> view of the bella<mark>G</mark>. we requested a view of the fountains like everyone said and they were able to obli<mark>G</mark>. \n\nfood/drinks: the san<mark>G</mark> ($15) was pretty and tasted as <mark>G</mark> as it looked. lunch menu had a bunch of appetizers, pizzas, salads, and sandwiches. a<mark>G</mark>, super limited pasta menu, and no additional entrees... or at least i can't remember any. thin<mark>G</mark> i tried:\n<mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> ($10)- okay, lots of flavor and the sauce they came in was <mark>G</mark>. a <mark>G</mark> appetizer to start. \n<mark>Wood Roasted Mushrooms</mark> ($14)- tasty and tender. but super small. \n<mark>Lemon Pesto <mark>G</mark> Cheese</mark> with prosciutto and tomato ($22)- the prosciutto is an extra $4, you can <mark>G</mark> it without for $18. i couldn't really taste it because it was so thin, it really only made it a little more salty. the lemon flavor wasn't too prevalent either. the main flavor here is the pesto. it was <mark>G</mark> but $18 for a <mark>Lemon Pesto <mark>G</mark> Cheese</mark> sandwich? ponder that for a min. all sandwiches come with your choice of salad or fried zucchini strips. <mark>G</mark> the zucchini strips, they're still ve<mark>G</mark>! thus, you can feel less <mark>G</mark> about them. \nsausa<mark>G</mark> pizza- pretty <mark>G</mark> but also quite oily. probably wouldn't <mark>G</mark> next time. \ncaprese salad ($19)- the heirloom tomatoes were excellent and the mozzarella was delicious. \ne<mark>G</mark> and sausa<mark>G</mark> lasa<mark>G</mark> ($24)- this was really <mark>G</mark>. the size is just ri<mark>G</mark>. \n\nservice: friendly, competent, attentive when needed, but nothing really remarkable in this area. \n\noverall, <mark>G</mark> is my home<mark>G</mark>, but i'll have to come back for dinner. the limitations of the lunch menu was surprising. also, it's obviously a pricey place... but if you can splur<mark>G</mark>, i'd definitely recommend you try her. i did it just because i like her so much. it's absolutely more of a special occasions only type of place.",

            "let me start by saying  i am a hu<mark>G</mark> fan of <mark>G</mark> and italian cuisine. i make my own pastas and pizzas from scratch and have dined at some very well respected italian restaurants across the country and abroad. i have made some of her recipes before and really enjoyed them. the burata was amazing and the the <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark> were exactly how they were described by the bartender. the <mark>G</mark> artichokes had just the ri<mark>G</mark> amount of aioli to compliment them and i was quite excited to have her si<mark>G</mark> dish which is the spa<mark>G</mark> with lemon basil and shrimp. once the dish was brou<mark>G</mark> out (about 30 minutes) i was quite disappointed with the size. the presentation and aroma were spot-on but the portion (which the bartender said was a dinner size and not really a secondi) was tiny which is the opposite of the price ($34 for pasta that fits in the palm of your hand?). the disappointment did not end there. i found the pasta to be very sticky and dou<mark>G</mark> althou<mark>G</mark> the taste was phenomenal. the sin<mark>G</mark> shrimp was cooked perfectly and the lemon and basil were the perfect balance. but overall as my main dish i was not happy with the pasta. the overall experience would have been below avera<mark>G</mark> for me if it had not been for the dessert. i was talked into the special chocolate torta which was amazing. it paired perfectly with the <mark>G</mark> of recommended wine and kept me from reviewing the restaurant poorly. overall i did not think <mark>G</mark> was a value (i know its ve<mark>G</mark>) but it was a wednesday ni<mark>G</mark> and i think maybe the \"b\" team was on in the kitchen. i still would recommend <mark>G</mark> it a try but do not <mark>G</mark> with the \"si<mark>G</mark>\" pasta. the meat and cheese plate looked robust and diverse. the rack of lamb that the <mark>G</mark> next to me at the bar said was the best lamb he ever had for what that is worth. \n\ntry it out!", 
            "<mark>G</mark>'s restaurant is overrated and i was underwhelmed.  my party of 6 ordered the bacon wrapped dates to start. the balance was all off. the sauce that accompanied the app was anemic and offered no real counter punch to the syrupy sweet (overly sweet) dates.there was also very little sauce on the plate. the best bacon wrapped dates in town are at firefly!! for my main course, i ordered the swiss chard rolls which were lukewarm when they arrived and quickly turned cold 1/4 way throu<mark>G</mark> the meal. they were also under seasoned. the rest of my party ordered the whole chicken. i did not taste it but i was told it tasted pretty <mark>G</mark>.  looking around the restaurant it seemed the chicken was a popular dish. the lower price tag for a 2-person serving may have a lot to do with that. it was one of just a few reasonably priced items on the menu.\n\non a more positive note, the kitchen made a mistake by sending a plate of chillean sea bass that no one ordered. it was on the house based on the error and our server triple checked that no other table was waiting for that plate. turned out to be the most delicious thing they served.",

 our waiter proclaims those are his favorites (althou<mark>G</mark>, i did hear him say that to the other unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> souls sharing the cupboard with us....whatever i'm still comforted by the statement).  they both were <mark>G</mark>, but needed more salt and seasoning.  the arancini took the day.  next we ordered the pappardelle and ravioli.  both were <mark>G</mark> a<mark>G</mark>, but served as an appetizer.  the pappardelle alle<mark>G</mark> had pork ra<mark>G</mark>, but it seemed missing in action this ni<mark>G</mark>.  the ravioli was very <mark>G</mark>.  it was served with a butter sauce underneath and 2, yes 2 aspara<mark>G</mark> tips.  it reminded of me of eating a steamed lobster with warm melted butter, but with the lobster being wrapped in a pillow of pasta.  \n\nessentially, everything on the menu seems to be served tapas style.  the only problem is that the price tag of $36 and $32 for tapas is a little ridiculous.  but hey, we are paying for the experience and it looks like the ea<mark>G</mark> just put tim tebow in the <mark>G</mark> and thou<mark>G</mark> my wife never says, i assume the portrait of dino remains unchan<mark>G</mark>.  \n\noverall, <mark>G</mark>'s was not worth it.  there are tons of italian restaurants in this town and just value alone will keep us away.  throw in mar<mark>G</mark> service and the fact i may be eating in a broom closet seals that. but, jud<mark>G</mark> by how busy they were, they will hardly miss us. \n  \nfood:  3.5 stars (hey, my plates were clean when then took them away)\nvalue:  1 star (proportion sizes don't match up)\nservice: 2 stars (our waiter and his assistant moved the scale two stars from the zero star hostesses that only know how to communicate on a samsung or apple device).\natmosphere:  no star (having a preseason football <mark>G</mark> as my eye contact breaker was not what i had in mind for our anniversary.  oh and thumping some j.t. like i was in a club doesn't seem to match the \"<mark>G</mark>\" brand)\n\nanyways, finished the evening off with a bur<mark>G</mark> and shake from in-n-out, so really how bad of a ni<mark>G</mark> could that have been?", 
            "the restaurant is over priced, if you're hun<mark>G</mark> don't even thinking about <mark>G</mark> there. the food is in a size of a <mark>G</mark> ball...very disappointing.", 
            "finally made it here! took three separate attempts in order to finally secure a reservation, but it was worth the wait. amazing how completely packed it was even thou<mark>G</mark> walking throu<mark>G</mark> the cromwell was depressin<mark>G</mark> empty. first impression was this amazing panoramic view of the strip. i was the first of my <mark>G</mark> to arrive so found a spot to wait at the bar. my plan was just to order a martini, but i can <mark>G</mark> that anywhere so i decided to look over the fun specialty drinks. what actually <mark>G</mark> me was i saw someone else's cocktail with this really cool ice sphere displaying <mark>G</mark>'s si<mark>G</mark> g. so i opted for the destroyer which had tequila, fresh tan<mark>G</mark> and basil. delish! lucky for me, the friends i went with have a similar passion for food so we order a lot and everyone shares. that way we <mark>G</mark> to try a little of everything. bacon wrapped dates, lemon crab arancini, aru<mark>G</mark> salad with candied lemon and crispy pancetta and the scallop risotto were all amazing. we also ordered the 28 oz bone in rib-eye finished with lemon and topped with a sunny side up e<mark>G</mark> which i was really disappointed with. althou<mark>G</mark> the presentation of it was impressive, it was over cooked and a bit on the tou<mark>G</mark> side. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> especially since that is supposed to be one of the si<mark>G</mark> dishes.",

(maybe he knew we were not <mark>G</mark> to spend $100 per person?)  when i asked about 2 entrees, he did not describe them, he simply selected one for me.  come to think of it, maybe he was a little rude.\n\nas far as food <mark>G</mark>...the bread was ok.  the wine was ok.  the salads were ok.  the entrees were ok.  the service was just ok.  despite the hype, the place is just ok.  we were hoping for a better experience.  unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, we probably won't be returning to <mark>G</mark> our next trip to ve<mark>G</mark>.",

i'm sold. so <mark>G</mark>! everything you'd ever want in a pizza...\n\n* mar<mark>G</mark> pizza: simplicity at it's best. the tomato sauce was very sweet and the traditional combo of basil, tomato, & mozzarella never fails. and on a side note...<mark>G</mark>'s pizza dou<mark>G</mark> is very <mark>G</mark>. has a nice honey note to it and it's charred to perfection in her brick oven.\n\n* <mark>Orzo Meatballs</mark>: it's that <mark>G</mark> that i had to order it a<mark>G</mark>!\n\n* zucchini scapece: i'm so <mark>G</mark> i was able to <mark>G</mark> this as a side order. strands of potato, zucchini, and onion are li<mark>G</mark> fried and served piled hi<mark>G</mark> to your table. i couldn't stop snacking on this in between bites from my pizza!\n\n* aru<mark>G</mark> salad with candied lemon vinai<mark>G</mark>: as simple as the salad was....i really enjoyed the vinai<mark>G</mark>. little bits of candied lemon bits floated around and provided a nice burst of citrus that contrasted with the peppery aru<mark>G</mark> and crispy pancetta. \n\n* white san<mark>G</mark>: bubbly, fruity, and crisp. perfect for the hot weather!\n\noverall i had a <mark>G</mark> time at <mark>G</mark>'s. service was superb and the food was amazing. i'll admit it's very expensive but worth every penny. you absolutely <mark>G</mark> what you pay for. it definitely was the hi<mark>G</mark> of my trip to ve<mark>G</mark>. i can't wait to <mark>G</mark> back. \n\nps: make sure you stop by the photo booth for an opportunity to capture your visit!!!!",

            "as a disclaimer, i must state that we are hu<mark>G</mark> fans of <mark>G</mark> and bobby on the next food network star. and we are also accustom to fine dining. not a sin<mark>G</mark> thing about this restaurant reminded us of her warm personality and her constantly stating how important \"branding\" is. this place screams \"i have more investors to please than i can handle\" and \"this is my first restaurant\" like crazy. prices need to reflect this as it is not even close to being on par with other \"celebrity chef\" restaurants on the strip. there is a lot of work left to be done here. \n\nthat being said, most of the food was fine. everything needed a bit of editing and more salt. the \"<mark>G</mark>\" artichokes with lemon a\\u00efoli were served ice cold, and the \"<mark>G</mark>\" zucchini & e<mark>G</mark> involtini was served room temp. the pancetta in the aru<mark>G</mark> salad was chopped way too lar<mark>G</mark> for such a delicate salad but the parmi<mark>G</mark> was sliced perfectly thin. the a\\u00efoli was by far the best thing on the table all evening.  we were honestly surprised we could not hear drai's, but, when all the windows were opened, it became too loud to hold a pleasant conversation. we did not complain, but our waiter kept apolo<mark>G</mark> profusely. and that was our cue that it was time to <mark>G</mark>. so we did.\n\nthere are so many better restaurants on the strip for the same price ran<mark>G</mark>, it's really not worth a return visit. i hi<mark>G</mark> su<mark>G</mark> reading the other reviews to <mark>G</mark> a better picture of whether or not this is the dining experience you want to have. i wish we would have.", 
            "the atmosphere and service were really <mark>G</mark>; however, the food was not. except for the caprese salad, which is nearly impossible to mess up, everything we ordered was inedible for one reason or another. one of the dishes was bland, another too spicy, and the third was bland and had a texture that was inconsistent. it was definitely the most money i've ever spent on food that was that bad and a contender for the worst meal in a restaurant. i would love to hear <mark>G</mark>'s feedback if she were unknowin<mark>G</mark> served food from this restaurant.", 
            "althou<mark>G</mark> i thou<mark>G</mark> the food was fine, it was definitely not on par with other <mark>G</mark> restaurants in ve<mark>G</mark>.  we were there for lunch.  i scraped e<mark>G</mark> off of my placemat in 3 locations in front of the waiter with no response from him. his clothing was faded, ill fitting and dirty as well.  the olives and mushroom appetizers were excellent.  the panzella salad was under flavored and overdressed.  the wait staff never removed empty dirty appetizer dishes from the table, had to ask several times for cutlery.", 
            "i was kind of hesitant about coming here just because of some of the reviews that i have read.  but i just had to try out one of my favorite celebrity chefs.  i must say that our whole dining experience here was top notch.  we had a <mark>G</mark> server, i think her name was amber, and was able to <mark>G</mark> a table at the window which had some awesome views of the strip and bela<mark>G</mark>'s water show.  \neverything we ordered was delicious.  started off with the wa<mark>G</mark> beef salamis which were so amazin<mark>G</mark> addicting.  the charred octopus which was so tender that it almost didn't tasted like octopus.  i <mark>G</mark> i like my octopus somewhat chewy and it just didn't have that same consitency which must have been the reason i wasn't too impressed.  but none the less still very tasty.  and lastly the imported burrata which was very tasty with the balsamic salt that it came with.\nfor the mains we ordered the veal chop milanese which was a <mark>G</mark> portion of veal the was butterflied and deep fried with fontina cheese.  my favorite dish of the whole ni<mark>G</mark> was the crab and scallop risotto.  the risotto was perfectly cooked along with some of the best tasting scallops i have ever had.\n\npros:\nour server was the best.  she offered <mark>G</mark> su<mark>G</mark>, really nice, and came and checked up on us at the perfect times.\nthey have a nice wine list, with <mark>G</mark> variety of californian wines.  \ni really liked their bread.  \nbeautiful restaurant with <mark>G</mark> views.  if you can try to <mark>G</mark> a window seat.\nthe food was <mark>G</mark> and liked everything that we ordered specially the crab and scalp risotto.\n\ncons:\ni did notice that some tables that looked like it mi<mark>G</mark> have been ti<mark>G</mark> and hidden in the corners.  \n\noverall:\ni hi<mark>G</mark> recommend coming here.  our experience was top notch and really enjoyed our time there. however, i can see how the restaurant may come across as \"pretentious\" to some and how some people mi<mark>G</mark> have had a totally different experience as ours.", 
            "loved everything about this place. the food was amazing, and even better was the service. they were kind, informative and passionate about their restaurant. hi<mark>G</mark> recommended!!", 
            "came here for me and my wife's 15 year anniversary. she is a hu<mark>G</mark> fan of <mark>G</mark>'s and it's the one place she wanted to eat in ve<mark>G</mark>. the experience was extraordinary. the food and service were exceptional and the environment with the views was perfect for this special occasion. kevin, our server, was kind, knowled<mark>G</mark> and welcoming during the entire meal, from drink su<mark>G</mark> to the desert display, he really went above and beyond to make our dinner feel special.  we had the seafood risotto and lobster ravioli and i fully recommend them both. the risotto was al dente and the scallops cooked perfectly while the ravioli was a wonderfully blend of aspara<mark>G</mark> lobster and tarra<mark>G</mark> without any of the in<mark>G</mark> being overpowering. kevin recommended our cocktails, the destroyer ( which was like a tan<mark>G</mark> mar<mark>G</mark>) and the la strada ( which was a li<mark>G</mark> and fruity limoncello) and we ordered the artichoke arancini, which were delicious. all in all, we would come back and explore the other items on the menu, because of the wonderful experience we had last ni<mark>G</mark>.", 
            "<mark>G</mark> restaurant with a view of he strip and delicious food!  service was a little slow but they were slammed so we understood.  the bread service is a perfect way to start the meal and we followed with several small dishes to share.  all of the food selections were on point... really really yummy!",

            "this was our second time in for dinner...8 months apart...and the menu was the same, not even a special for a friday ni<mark>G</mark>. \n\ni love <mark>G</mark>...watch her shows...made many of her recipes...but for an overall dining experience in ve<mark>G</mark>, where there are so many to choose from, not really excited about recommending to others. don't <mark>G</mark> me wrong, the food was excellent with a nice wine list, and the chocolate tart is delicious (so li<mark>G</mark> for being so decadent!)...so if you like her recipes, then you should <mark>G</mark> once. they were very accommodating by splitting a pasta entre for our app and cutting the tomahawk rib eye for us to share, so kudos there. \n\nthe problem is the vibe...its an extremely tiny space with a tiny bar...trying to be a ca restaurant with a ca attitude. it's loud with not enou<mark>G</mark> staff for the amount of people they pack in...and the bar definitely needs more help. i don't mind waiting for my reservation (that you have to make a month in advance) if i can order a cocktail, but when the staff is rude because there's no place to stand to order a drink...and there's only one bartender to service the entire restaurant...then it's a problem. with that, i'm still willing to try them for brunch next trip and see if daytime is better. i want <mark>G</mark>'s to succeed, but ve<mark>G</mark> is a tou<mark>G</mark> crowd to please.",

            "i had hi<mark>G</mark> hopes for <mark>G</mark>'s, but unfor<mark>Tuna</mark> the restaurant fell flat.  i anticipated the food to be the centerpiece of the visit, but it ended up being the leading contributor to my one-star experience.  three of the <mark>G</mark> in our party shared two orders of the risotto.  not only did both plates have a si<mark>G</mark> number of crab shells (real crab at least), but all three became ill after eating it.  admittedly, the pasta and branzino were cooked much better, althou<mark>G</mark> the simplicity of the dish, an apparent hallmark of the restaurant, rendered them far from memorable.\n\nservice was more akin to the risotto than the pasta.  our waiter joey had a strong, friendly start that quickly disappeared, just as he did.  his salesmanship was hi<mark>G</mark> by his attempt to push the prix-fixe menu primarily based on an auto<mark>G</mark> <mark>G</mark> folio with the menu and a few recipes.  admittedly, joey was probably correct that the restaurant's selection of the least interesting dishes for the prix-fixe was likely not what was driving diners to choose it.  the pitch on the prix-fixe was followed by his description of one of <mark>G</mark>'s si<mark>G</mark> cocktails as the most popular selection but also the most frequently returned to the bar.  \n\nafter his presentation of the menu, joey disappeared for an extended period of time, and later in the meal he did not even bother to visit the table from the time the first course was served to when the check was delivered.  this seemed particularly surprising <mark>G</mark> the apparent hi<mark>G</mark> ratio of staff to <mark>G</mark> at the restaurant overall.  as if the experience wasn't already far short of expectations, the check was also incorrect, as joey had added a random dish that had not been ordered or served.  \n\nas someone who professionally reviewed restaurants for years, this restaurant falls on the very low end of its peer <mark>G</mark>.",

            "came in for breakfast on a tuesday morning. i su<mark>G</mark>  valet parking  best option at the cromwell if visiting as i was. head thru the casino and up the escalator were  breakfast is served at the bar from starting at 8:00 am to 9:00  and then the dining room opens up at 9:00 am.\n\ni had a conference call so it was kind of awkward setting up and ordered breakfast at the bar. but my  friendly waitress was very accommodating and helpful. on the way  i  met the head chef and i <mark>G</mark> to speak with him briefly about the prior yelp event put on here which looked fabulous. the staff was very accommodating and enabled me to take pics prior before they were open at 8 a.m.\n\nheart the attention to details here - from the napkins,  plates, condiments to the presentation of entr\\u00e9es.  the decor of the  restaurant is stunnin<mark>G</mark> beautiful. \n\ni ordered the contadina breakfast which included spinach, tomatoes, two e<mark>G</mark> over medium, polenta cakes and toast. in addition, much to my surprise - chef of cuisne bruce m.  brou<mark>G</mark> me over another entr\\u00e9e -  e<mark>G</mark> & waffles. everything here tasted so fresh and delicious.\n\ni would  hi<mark>G</mark> su<mark>G</mark> making a stop here at <mark>G</mark>'s si<mark>G</mark> debut restaurant, i'll certainly  be returning for lunch or dinner in the future.", 
            "the access to <mark>G</mark>'s was blocked this morning with no si<mark>G</mark> as to why. we could smell smoke so one mi<mark>G</mark> be left to believe there was a fire but we could not confirm. i hope it wasn't serious. we were looking forward to trying <mark>G</mark>'s but not today. not sure how to rate it since we couldn't try it, but wanted other folks to be aware in case they set out on a cold morning and become surprised like we did.", 
            "paid $45 for the <mark>G</mark> brunch tasting menu that comes with an assortment of pastries (five for $15 or $4 for one, so that was a decent deal), an antipasti platter with e<mark>G</mark> benedict deviled e<mark>G</mark>, brussel sprouts crostini, and mini pizza di pasta. the only tasty selection was the deviled e<mark>G</mark>. my friend, who was reason we went to <mark>G</mark>'s in the first place, was really disappointed in the rest of the antipasti selection. i ordered the baked sausa<mark>G</mark> & e<mark>G</mark> lasa<mark>G</mark> as my main entree. considering <mark>G</mark> is italian, i expected her to have her pastas down, but i was also disappointment as this was a $29 plate. \n\ni <mark>G</mark> to taste my friend's entree, the italian chicken & waffles with cacciatore sauce which was pretty <mark>G</mark> in comparison every thing else we had tasted. the cacciatore sauce was delicious, and the waffles had <mark>G</mark> texture. \n\n<mark>G</mark>'s dining area is beautiful, but we were really expecting to enjoy more than just the ambiance, and a bite of e<mark>G</mark> and a sauce side considering a $130 meal for two.", 
            "we were so disappointed with our visit here. <mark>G</mark> (we met her on the plane) specifically told us that she'll hve 'chestnut cake' in her restaurant during the christmas season but no one there(the servers etc) knows what that is. also our meal was not served hot and the portion was really small. sorry..it wasn't the <mark>G</mark> experience.", 
            "i can describe this place in one word: heartburn, (but in a <mark>G</mark> way). this place is an oxymoron of several thin<mark>G</mark>: casually chic, warm simplicity, homey hi<mark>G</mark>-end food. we started with the bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese, and althou<mark>G</mark> i've had many before, these dates were scrumptious. my dish was a lemon lobster ravioli which was fine; i was expecting more bold flavor. but surprisin<mark>G</mark>, the star of the evening was the oran<mark>G</mark> mocha. the best dessert coffee i have ever had. it's made with their house made oran<mark>G</mark> syrup. i can't believe the coffee is what impressed me most. so much so, that my husband and i are <mark>G</mark> back to <mark>G</mark>'s today, just for the coffee before we leave town. \n\noverall, a very enjoyable experience.", 
            "the worst. just because it's owned by a so called \" celebrity chef \" doesn't mean you should char<mark>G</mark> such outra<mark>G</mark> prices and serve less than an appetizer portion.  will never <mark>G</mark> back. olive <mark>G</mark> beats it by far.", 
            "i'm <mark>G</mark> on a curve here, but for a restaurant this expensive (the most expensive italian restaurant i've ever seen) i just wasn't all that impressed.  first, the <mark>G</mark>:  a diverse menu of italian dishes, meant to be enjoyed over at least three courses.  a nicely appointed room, with a <mark>G</mark> view of the strip -- caesar's palace and the bella<mark>G</mark> across the street (somewhat marred, on the ni<mark>G</mark> we dined, by the massive fatal car crash just down the street; but that's hardly <mark>G</mark>'s fault).  and, <mark>G</mark> really knows how to pack the flavor into her dishes.  my bacon wrapped dates, crab crostini, and tricolore salad all screamed their respective flavors.\n\nbut, there were some aspects i didn't care for.  first, the food is rich, rich, rich, even for italian.  even thou<mark>G</mark> i only had two appetizers and a salad, i felt bloated on the way out; and i can usually pack it away.  second, the relentless emphasis on <mark>G</mark>'s name.  our waiter only mentioned her about two or three dozen times.  the plates, menu, and even the towels in the bathroom were emblazoned with \"<mark>G</mark>.\"  i've never seen anything like it at any other celebrity chef restaurant, and i've been to a bunch of them.  third, and i really don't know how to explain this, but the atmosphere just didn't feel comfortable to me.  the dining room is a little bit crowded and a bit of a maze to <mark>G</mark> throu<mark>G</mark>.  the menu is a sli<mark>G</mark> difficult to fi<mark>G</mark> out, and the waiter wasn't that much help (the answer to every question about the menu was a story about how <mark>G</mark> loves this or that dish).  and the presentation of every dish was, kind of \"wow!  look at me!\"  in short, everything was just a little bit overwhelming, and i <mark>G</mark> my mental ima<mark>G</mark> of italian food is of comfort food in a homey environment, so it just felt a little off to me.", 
            "sadly the food just wasn't very <mark>G</mark>. presentation service and atmosphere were fine. $52.00 for \"short rib\" entree. it was pot roast. and not very well seasoned pot roast either. beet salad looked <mark>G</mark> but no taste. duck prosciutto was bland. for this price point we were extremely disappointed. like <mark>G</mark> etc.... but this was below avera<mark>G</mark>.", 
            "it was my fianc\\u00e9 's bday and i decided to suprise him. i had hi<mark>G</mark> expectationas...and can't wait to taste te food. so we came to the restaurant. it was very nice. very nice decorated. but when they brou<mark>G</mark> the food it was just a simple italian food. nothing special.  the same thing that i used to make at home. i'm very disappointed because if it's celebrity chef and that expensive.  it should be something unbelievably delicious.  i've been in italy. and honestly buying food in the streets of italy was more delicious and authentic then coming to <mark>G</mark>'s restaurant.  it was a big joke. never <mark>G</mark> come back. nothing special. just a simple italian food that you can eat everywhere.", 
            "first time coming here with hi<mark>G</mark> expectations, and it wasn't what my family and i had expected at all. unfor<mark>Tuna</mark>, the dining experience here was downri<mark>G</mark> awful. first off, as soon as our <mark>G</mark> of 8 entered the restaurant we were bombarded with the scent and si<mark>G</mark> of smoke. shortly following, the food was terrible. the salads included too much cheese and the pasta was too salty with no other flavor. in <mark>G</mark> we had such hi<mark>G</mark> expectations and left with a disappointing result. we will not be returning to this restaurant.", 
            "after my fifth visit to <mark>G</mark> last week, i realized that i still hadn't written a review, so here it is, #100 for 2015. \n \ni've been here for breakfast, lunch (twice), dinner, and a wedding reception brunch.  each visit has always featured excellent customer service and tasty food.  of the meals that i've enjoyed the most, dinner is my favorite because i love the lemon spa<mark>G</mark> with the hu<mark>G</mark> shrimp.  yes, the restaurant is everything <mark>G</mark>, from the plates to the paper towels in the restroom, but it is her place.  i love the decor, wide open spaces, and views of the strip.  i also very much enjoy the free photo booth in the lobby.  \nif you <mark>G</mark>, ask for seats next to the window so you can see all the hustle and bustle on las ve<mark>G</mark> blvd.\nthis is one place in town that's always been consistently satisfying for us and i look forward to having dinner here a<mark>G</mark> soon.  man<mark>G</mark>!"
