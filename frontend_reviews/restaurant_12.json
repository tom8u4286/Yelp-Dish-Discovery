            "i had heard good things about this place so i convinced my friend to go with me to try it out on a recent trip to vegas. we showed up around 8 o' clock on a sunday night and we had to wait about 15 min. not bad considering there a few shops around that you can browse through to help pass the time away.\n\ni won't spend much time talking about the food because there are hella reviews about this place. my friend and i ordered the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>, the <mark>American Classic</mark>, and the buttermilk zucchini fries. the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was....well...a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. i'm a firm believer that a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> can only get so good. the burgers were phenomenal. i made the mistake of eating my half of the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> before the half of the <mark>American Classic</mark>. although the latter was good, it still paled in comparison to the former. the zucchini fries were good. they had a little taste of jalapeno to them which was interesting. they are a bit too rich for my taste though so i would recommend getting a side to split with one or two friends.\n\nthe thing i want to talk about is their water glasses. i will admit. i am one of those jacka$$es who drinks alot of water. what can i say? a brother needs to get hydrated. well i hate it when you go to a restaurant and they give you a glass that only fits maybe two sips of water. not so at burger bar! their water glasses are so big i didn't need to ask for a refill once. awesome!", 
            "yum!  we had a very good salad, burger, fries, and dessert at burger bar.\n\nwe ended up sharing a few things so we could try a number of dishes.  we shared a half <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> (the menu didn't offer half-portions, but our server let us know). it was pretty boring, but after a weekend of carbs and meat, we were pretty excited about a bit of lettuce. \n\nfor the burger, we shared an angus burger ($9.50) on a sesame bun with pepper jack cheese ($.95), <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> ($.95), and jalapeno bacon ($1.55).  they had so many toppings it was very hard to decide (and easy to wind up with a $17 burger if you weren't careful!)  the bacon was awesome and we loved the onions. they had some chef special burgers that came with skinny fries, but ours was just the burger, so we added an order of zucchini fries.  \n\nfor dessert (and the bit that threw me from 3-stars to 4) was the sweet cheesecake burger. it was a glazed donut sliced in half like a hamburger bun (so cute!) with a cheesecake 'burger' and toppings of strawberries and pineapple. it was so awesome and i was so sad that i had already promised half of it to mr r.  \n\noverall, it was a good lunch spot and a great burger.", 
            "before our semiannual hr happy hour, we all decided to come to burger bar for dinner.  if you're looking for a very versatile burger joint, this place offers just that!\n\ni love the space :-)  it's located on the way to mandalay place and offers a lot of seating!  the two toned walls and low lighting offer a very intimate setting for any type of party.  the back light on both bars and marble table tops really makes this place feel high end.  \n\ni really like the menu.  they have everything, for the vegetarian appetite, the vegan appetite and of course the carnivore appetite.  tonight i got that grilled chicken <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> for $8.50 + $3.50.  super affordable for being on the strip!  i also got the miller lite pint for $5.75.  i thought the miller lite was a little stale but still did the trick.  my salad, though, was on point!  romaine hearts, shaved parmesan cheese, croutons and of course, tossed with caesar dressing.  the dressing was lightly coated, not too powerful.  the parmesan cheese was thinly shaved and packed a nice punch!  the croutons were in long strips of crusted toast, which you would crumble over the salad.  i thought the chicken was grilled perfectly!  it was seasoned well and they gave a lot!  \n\ndefinitely a must try, even if you're not a burger enthusiast.  if you are, you'll be in heaven!  dress up, dress down it doesn't matter.  prices are affordable and will certainly put a smile on your face!", 
            "this is another of those places run by a celeb chef jumping into the burger craze that has hit everyone on this planet.  tried the <mark>American Classic</mark>, peppercorn, fries and the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.  the burgers were okay.  they did come at the desired temperature but its not like the pate was anything special.  the peppercorn burger in fact has too find a grind on the pepper resulting almost a dusty tasting burger.  the bun these come in was quite good, but not good enough to make me succumb to eating it.  the fries were excellent, crunchy outside and light and fluffy inside.  the surprise was the salad, which was excellent.  this looked like hand torn leaves definitely a house made dressing with the perfect touch of creaminess with the gentlest hint of anchovy in the back, just delicious.\n\nvery pricey, but hey if you are going to gamble on a burger, where else would you do it but vegas!", 
            "we went to burger bar for a late afternoon snack. the kids got pasta which  was way better than what they had been served the night before at verandah in the four seasons hotel. a perfect <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and excellent service as well,<mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> bar is a good value. we'll go back again.", 
            "went here with a group of relatives.  \n\nthe build-your-own with atlantic salmon was the surprise winner. as an alaskan i was skeptical but it was a big thick piece of fish that just happened to have been cut with a big round cookie cutter. ordered medium, it was cooked nicely.  we added spinach, asparagus, and gouda.  couldn't taste the cheese but the veggies were great; the while thing was knife and fork food, not a sandwich.\n\nthe vegas vegan was a little lame.  the pile of artfully arranged veggies was nice in theory but was lacking in the flavor department.\n\nthe jalape\\u00f1o petals were our favorite of the several fries we tried.  soft and tender with a nice kick.  skinny fries were nothing special.  i burned my mouth in the zucchini fries more than once, even after waiting awhile for them to cool.\n\nrelatives passed a lot of food on our direction.  we ate too many fried onions, but just couldn't stop.  <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> wasn't worth more than a few bites.  \n\nbut the pumpkin pie milkshake that my other half's brother ordered...that was amazing. dude knows how to pick the right indulgences.   liquid, frozen pumpkin pie.  mmm, mmm, thickness.  which we'd started with a shake of our own: would have been a better choice than all the fries that sat heavy in our bellies long into the night."

            "went here a month ago and then went again this past week...this place just gets better and better!\n\nthis time we ordered the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger...the meat was so tender and juicy and it made all the difference!  we also ordered the <mark>Burger Bar Cobb Salad</mark> which i expected to be just ok but it was excellent!  the wait staff was also super friendly/attentive which makes the experience all the better.", 
            "i tried a bite of the buffalo meat burger, the grain fed meat burger, and the <mark>American Classic</mark> burger. but i didn't find anything that new and exciting about any of them. i would've been happier at inn-n-out :( cuz it woulda saved me a pretty penny. and dont get the <mark>Burger Bar Cobb Salad</mark>, i coulda made a better salad! but quick service :)", 
            "everyone at my table seemed to love their burgers (one person even said it might be the best he's ever eaten - this was the angus burger). being a non-carnivore, i did not have a burger, or even a veggie burger, but opted for the <mark>Burger Bar Cobb Salad</mark>. it was pretty good - i'd probably order it again. it would have been great but i didn't really care for the vinaigrette dressing, although i think that the dressing definitely made it feel a bit lighter, which is a good thing in las vegas. i did try the fries, onion rings and sweet potato fries and all were very good. i really enjoyed the sweet potato fries. they're served with ketchup but if you ask for a side of ranch dressing, they'll gladly bring it to you, and the ranch went nicely with the sweet potato fries as well as the onion rings. i also tried the vanilla milkshake and it was pretty delicious. the service was friendly, it was easy to get in for a late lunch, and the prices are not outrageous. i'd return.", 
            "for an \"expensive\" burger place, this place is very good.\n\nwe had three \"create your own burgers\" and one salad.  all of the burgers were cooked as requested and very good.  the <mark>Burger Bar Cobb Salad</mark>, although a half order, was big enough for at least two people.\n\nwe had three \"big\" fries and one order of sweet potato fries - both were cooked perfectly.\n\nservice was very prompt and friendly.\n\nif you're looking for something a bit fancier than \"in-n-out,\" this is an excellent choice for a good burger.", 
            "good food!  we ordered the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> burger with jalapenos and pepper jack cheese (came out perfectly cooked and juicy) and a <mark>Burger Bar Cobb Salad</mark>.  both were very good.  also had the sweet potato fries...they were awesome.  a must try.  in my opinion they taste way better than regular fries.  service was attentive and cheerful.  would've given this place 4 stars if it wasnt for one of the snooty hostess in the front.  we placed our name on the wait list for a table of 2 and were told it would take about 15 minutes so we walked around and checked out the nearby shops.  came back in about 10 minutes and checked to see where we were on the list.  the snooty hostess snapped...there's a couple more people in front of you and we told you it would be a 20 minute wait and it's only been 5!  first off, i didnt reserve a table with you.  second, your more customer-oriented co-worker said it would be 15 minutes.  third, we waited well over 5 minutes.  i enjoyed the food.  front of the house needs more training.", 
            "ok... so mixed feelings on this place.\n\ni like the burgers... i like that they accomodate group parties with pre-determined menus ... and i like that they assign big groups 2 servers and multiple bussers. \n\nhowever... i don't like that it's so freakin' loud in there and that the set up (flow of tables and traffic pattern) is not efficient or easy to maneuver. you have to squeeze around tables, chairs and people to get through the place and then dodge the servers and the bussers who have trays of food/plates.\n\ni enjoyed the buffalo burger with zucchini fries. buffalo burger was juicy and meaty and lean.  so good!  the bun was a bit too thick for me so i only ate one side.... the zucchini fries had too much batter for me. i would prefer a lighter batter... and more zucchini... rather than the other way around.  \n\ni saw the <mark>Burger Bar Cobb Salad</mark> and it was big... and it looked really good.\n\nyes... i'll be back to try other items on the menu.... might be better to go during the week when it might not be as crowded.", 
            "we tried to check out kilroy's - food network's best burger in nevada, but found they don't offer burgers anymore (that doesn't speak well about food network selections, does it?).  so we tried this place instead, which is an arguable replacement, and it was convenient for us, with bb  being on the strip and in mandalay bay.  so, i would say the buffalo burger i had (buffalo, baby spinach, carmelized onions, and bleu cheese on a ciabatta bun) was quite good, but really, is any burger $22.00 good for a 5/8 lb patty?  it's a popular place, but overall, i found it overpriced, and thus the 3 star rating.  we had a 45 minute wait at 9:30pm.  wife had a <mark>Burger Bar Cobb Salad</mark>.  our vacation partner had three sliders for $13.50.  his wife had the black jack (monterey jack cheese) burger  at $13.55, and this looked to be the best valued burger anyway.  good place to check out for the selections and novelty, but it's a one time visit sort of place.", 
            "ate there last night after seeing criss angel.  the hostess was rather rude when we asked if we could have a booth. i would have left right then but my husband was dying to try their burgers. he enjoyed it but said it was not really worth the price.  i ordered the <mark>Burger Bar Cobb Salad</mark>. it was drenched in balsamic dressing that so over powered the meal it should have been called the vinegar salad.  had the potential to be a great salad but wrong dressing choice and way too much of it!   when i asked the waitress about the dressing she rudely said...\" that is how its made here\",  with no offer to correct it.  i would not eat there again.", 
            "i held my post-wedding dinner at the burger bar this last weekend, and i couldn't be more delighted with my experience. the incredible service began with lisa and the pre-planning process. she set expectations right from the start, made the reservation process seamless, and everything she promised was fulfilled the day of the event (down to the personalized menus she created).\n\non the day of, we received amazing service. the two servers that catered to our 40+ party were efficient, fast, and very accommodating. they took extra care to make sure that our questions were answered and that each of our guests received personal treatment. they even went the extra mile to serve the cupcake tier that we had pre-delivered to the restaurant.\n\nand of course, who could forget the food! from the buffalo burger and the <mark>Burger Bar Cobb Salad</mark> to the crabby patty kids burger, everything we ate was delicious (you have to get the spicy mustard!). i would recommend burger bar to any group big or small. you can't go wrong.",

            "worst burgers ever. this place is over priced and just gross. all of our food was cold and dry. <mark>Burger Bar Cobb Salad</mark> had old or overcooked eggs in it (you can tell when there is a dark line between the yolk and the white). staff are very friendly and attentive.....but the food...gross."

            "the food was bland and the service was slow.  my mom ordered a <mark>Grilled Shrimp Salad</mark>, and it had a ridiculous amount of lettuce in it.  the burger was undercooked and had no flavor at all.  i was not impressed, expecially for the prices.", 
            "my bad for ordering the <mark>Grilled Shrimp Salad</mark> ($13) at a burger-focused restaurant. that said, it was still disgusting. 5 well-grilled and butterflied shrimp lay on a bed of completely plain mixed greens (no onions, tomatoes, vinaigrette, nada) topped with olive oil and red bell peppers/zucchini strips that had been cooked to death at one point and then set aside long enough to become slimy. it felt like i was hunting for worms in a lettuce patch. never again. i left at least 60% of the salad for the garbage.\n\nbloody marys ($12) are a 5-star affair, if you're looking for a drink while you're there. good tomato-to-spiciness ratio, and comes with cheese-stuffed olives. yum!\n\ni'd definitely give this place another go, sticking solely with a burger next time. my friend had the hubert keller ($21) and after the first bite said he jizzed himself. seems promising. til' then, cheers!",

            "continuing my tour de burgers, i went to burger bar twice in two days.  this, however, was not the record among me and my friends.  two of my friends, went 4 times in 4 days - one had the chicken sandwich, turkey burger, angus burger and a dessert burger and another had a kobe burger, two angus burgers and a dessert burger.  all bow down to uvan and steve!\n\nwell, as far as my experience goes, i will have to say burger bar has really good quality burgers.  i had the kobe burger, rare, no toppings on the plain bun and the angus burger, med. rare, no toppings on the plain bun.  each time, the burger was cooked exactly as ordered (cool and red in the middle for rare, pink throughout for med. rare).  the bun was exceptional.  it was slightly crunchy but soft and was perfect to absorb the meat juices (which there were plenty).  the size of the patty was perfect as well - not too small, not too big, abouth an inch tall - i'd say it was around 7 oz.\n\nalthough i don't notice this at most places, i will say, each burger could have used more salt.  i don't think the meat is pre-salted before it's ground and very little appears to be put on before it's cooked.  but, just a sprinkle of salt really helped the flavor.  \n\nlots of people rave about the kobe, but i wasn't too thrilled.  for one, the texture was too soft.  (i know, i got it rare, it's supposed to be soft.  well, that's true.)  but the texture of the meat was soft.  also, the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> had a much more \"beefy\" flavor than expected.  for the price, i'm getting the angus burger from now on.  \n\nthe sides?  well, the zucchini fries are great.  whether they're frozen or not, i don't care.  they are good.  the onion rings are thick with a heavy coating and good.  the fries are fine.  the beer list is very good with well over 20 selections.    tvs for each booth - reason to linger and drink.  oh, and no corkage fee but terrible wine glasses.  service is spotty, but really dependent on who's your waiter/waitress.\n\noverall - one really great place to grab a great burger and some drinks.  \n\nwine i brought and had with the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger: 2003 miura garys' vineyard.  deep purple color, smooth rich texture, firm acidity, bright plum flavor with leather and earth.  much more rustic than the pisoni vineyard bottling i've had from miura.  tasted better after 6 hours, likely because of bottle shock on the drive up.  much more smooth, less leather and earth and more bright, sweeter plum and fruit notes.", 
            "had the best burger ever here.  ordered the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> burger with some jalapeno bacon.  tried some turkey burger that was pretty damn good too.  gosh, so tender, sloppy, and juicy.  prices were reasonable unless you like to add tons of toppings.  highly recommended.  service was kinda slow but overall a great place for a fancy burger.", 
            "i love burgers, well more so the  meat part than anything else. i heard about this place from some random tv show and it looked sooo good... i tried it last time i was in vegas.... \n\nre: the joint\nnice place, very random songs playing, i mean one min you hear babyface and the next you are listening to shiela e... lol.. various beers on tap\ni like the idea of building your own burgers, cuz i am picky and dont enjoy mustard or pickles on my burger. i decided to get the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>. i didnt throw in hella shit in it cuz i just wanted to taste it and i figured that i could always build more the following meal... but last min i couldnt help but throw in the portobella mushrooms. \n\nmy bf is a vegetarian and got the veggie burger, basically 2 'bello mushrooms and hella grilled veggies in the middle. he got a few extra grilled veggies to throw in side. \n\nre: the food\nso our food arrives and first of all, the only thing in the bun is the burger itself. the 1 slice of tomato and the 1 slice of lettuce is off to the side with the pickle ooozing its juice all over my bun and sweet potato fries. i have to give them credit for the abundance of mushroom. my angus pattie is hella tiny compared to the bun. i'm not a fan of bread so the less i eat it the better. so we throw our burgers together and the angus was tasty but a bit on the dry side. i did enjoy my sweet potato fries. i enjoyed the cheesecake burger too. i'd go back for those 2 things alone and not spend $13 on a burger. i ate every gawd daym thing and wasnt stuffed... theres something wrong with that... cuz normally i always walk away like the state puff marshmallow man.... \n\nre: the service\nthere was no mayo, the katsup and mustard were empty and i placed the katsup bottle upside down at the end of the table and 8 people walked by and didnt bother to refill it. the waiter forgot the extra shit my bf ordered and didnt really check up on us. the server was lucky i ended my meal on a good note with that daym cheesecake or else i would have stiffed him....",

            "offering a sizable length of rope is a dangerous thing, especially when a high percentage of your clientele will hang themselves with it. at burger bar, the rope is a massive number of options for each and every component of your burger. that's thousands of burger permutations, many of which are truly awful. \n\nvegas is great for people watching <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> bar is great for burger watching: take note as lance from des moines constructs his demon spawn burger and then complains about the resulting assault on his palette. \n\nyou'll also notice those deer-in-the-headlights expressions when patrons first get a look at the number of menu offerings. the burger bar staff will not jump-in with recommendations. do not be surprised by this. they don't eat there. it is just not possible. they're all amazing fit. \n\nanyway, 5 stars for this combo:\n*  1/2 pound <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, medium rare\n* whole wheat bun\n* saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms\n* <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>\n* blue cheese\n\nthe burger bar beer menu is huge with many beers on tap, so pair your burger with a cold one and some thick cut fries.",

            "on our trip to vegas a couple months ago, we stayed at the hotel at mandalay bay.  saturday evening, not feeling like going out into the hot desert air for food, we decided to stay at mandalay bay and look for some good, reasonably priced eats.  yeah, i know, reasonably priced eats at mandalay bay, good luck, huh?  well, we didn't find them.  we saw burger bar in the restaurant list in our room and decided to check it out.  upon arriving, we looked at the menu outside the place and it was a little bit more than we wanted to spend on a late dinner.  we left and walked around the shopping area and by the restaurants inside the casino area and confirmed what we already knew, no cheap eats at mandalay.  with no better ideas, we went back to burger bar.   it was pretty busy, and there was a wait for a table, so we decided to sit at the bar where there was no wait.  \n \nburger bar has a pretty wide variety of meats, cheeses, bread and toppings for you to build your own burger.  they have a veggie burger, turkey, lamb, <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, ridgefield farm beef and <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>.  once you choose your meat and bread, you can add cheese and other toppings as you like (but of course, each topping costs extra).  they have the usual topping like bacon, mushrooms, onions, chili and peppers.  if you're feeling adventurous (and have some money to burn) you can get some of the more exotic toppings like shrimp ($6.00), lobster ($12.00), foie gras ($12.00) or black truffles (1/3 oz for $30.00).  to go along with your burger, they have fat fries, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, zucchini fries or onion rings.  finally, if you don't feel like a burger, they have a marinated chicken breast, a salmon steak or a few different salads.\n \nafter waivering between the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> burger and the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger, i decided what the hell, i'm in vegas, i'll go for the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>.  i decided on mozarella cheese, fried egg, mushrooms and jalapeno bacon for my toppings and a side of fat fries to go along with it.  should have been a five star burger, but it wasn't.  i would have been way happier with a fatburger for 1/3 of the price.  i haven't had a lot of <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, and i had high expectations for it, but it seriously let me down.  it tasted like <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, nothing special.  i asked for it medium and it was overcooked too.  kind of crunchy on the outside.  the toppings were good, but again, nothing better than what i could have gotten at fatburger.  the fries were good, but that isn't tough to do fries right.  \n \noverall, a disappointing over-priced burger.  four stars for the selection, but minus two for the taste and price.  the only reason i would come back here next time i'm at mandalay bay would be to get a milkshake to go.  sitting at the bar, we were right in front of where the servers made the milkshakes.  whole milk, real ice cream and hershey's chocolate syrup, the perfect chocolate milkshake!!  they also have vanilla, peanut butter, strawberry, and banana.  mmmm...chocolate banana peanut butter milkshake...drool.  i sorely regret not getting one.  it was, however, enjoyable to watch the cute waitress make them.  darnit, now i have the milkshake song in my head...", 
            "i am sure you are all familiar with the traditional salad-bar concept. you walk up to a selection of ingredients and fix yourself a personalized salad. burger bar takes that idea and steals it on behalf of carnivores everywhere (but primarily in las vegas!). there is no need for a sneeze guard at burger bar since all of the available ingredients, or burger toppings if you will, are listed on the menu. they do offer pre-designed burgers that range from reasonable to not-so-reasonable price-wise, but the fun as far as i am concerned is in building my own burger. \n\nfor eaters more adventurous than i, which basically means everyone, burger bar is one of the few places in las vegas where i would suggest you go to frequently. with so many restaurants in las vegas it is hard to go someplace you have been before at the expense of trying somewhere new, but i try to apply that concept to dinner more than i do for lunch. burger bar, though a fantastic dinner spot, works well for lunch too. each time you go, you can create a new burger blueprint like one you have never had before. there are enough options to keep you entertained visit after visit. and even though i basically get the same thing everytime, it hasn't gotten old yet. \n\n<mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> + sesame seed roll + bacon + cheddar cheese + fried egg = bliss. add their brown gravy and you'll wonder why anyone puts ketchup on a burger (and it's great on their skinny fries). \n\nwhen, not if, you go looking for burger bar, you'll find it in mandalay bay in the mandalay place.",

            "this place is located inside the mandalay hotel and we were staying at the venetian and we decided to walk to burger bar not knowing how far it was. the walk was astronomicallllllyyyy far and i thought to myself that no burger was worth this s-word. and for a minute, i could of sworn the hotel was moving further and further away from us. \n\nbut we finally got there, and all of us ordered our food. i didn't know you can fry pickles which is super delicious btw. i had the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> with bacon and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> and it was amazing. from what i heard, it's the same as the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger for half the price. but  do you know what also was amazing? meeting sam worington from avatar, thats what! he walked by our table and he was extremely humble and was nice enough to take a picture and signed some autograph. \n\nsooo in retrospect, the walk was totally worth it!! =)", 
            "took the $10 cab ride down to mandalay to stick some of hubert keller's red meat in my mouth.\n\nthe wifey and i stumbled onto this place about two years ago, before everyone knew who hubert keller was, before top chef, before it turned into a herpes-ridden-french whore. and i'm not talking about the waitresses.\n\ntime for a second visit... i say yes...\n\nwalked into the mandalay... if you've screwed a shark in the face, you've gone too far. \n\nonce we actually found the place again, we walked right in for a late 10pm vegas dinner.\n\ndrinks?  tons of beer to tantalize, but i was already three jameson's in, so let's stick to it.  so i ordered another one.  waitress brings it and i thought it was vodka.  this shit was so watered down it was a joke.  if i was just there for drinks i would of donkey-punched the shit out of the bar tender and wrote \"suck it vegas\" on his forehead.... \n\nbut, i didn't.  i don't fuck with people who can fuck with my food.  and since we didn't order yet, i didn't want to get my burger finger fucked by a pissed-off bar tender.  meaning, this restaurant isn't nice enough to send shit back.  some places, you just have that gut-feeling that someone will ryan reynolds the shit out of your food. \n\nso, i sipped my water with a splash of jameson, and got down to business.\n\nthe wifey ordered the <mark>American Classic</mark>.  it was good. not mind-blowing, just good. the regular fries were tasty.  especially dipped in mayo.  you know what they say, \"when in france.\"\n\ni got the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, fried egg, bacon, cheddar cheese.  my creation.  they should call it the heart attack breakfast burger. yup.  it was fucking good.  well worth the trip. then again, if you put bacon and a fried egg on a donkey dick, i would eat that too.\n\noverall, i would go back... i would just order a beer with my burger.", 
            "it's not really fair to compare the burger bar to other burger places. only on the strip in vegas can you blow $25 on a burger and not really care. it's actually a good value, considering that's only 1 hand of black jack for most people. i guarantee you'll enjoy this burger way more than that one hand of black jack. \n\nthe burger bar is celebrity chef, hubert keller's creation. he has a few of his own burger combinations on the menu, or you can build your own from extensive options. i actually wish that hubert keller would have more of his own burgers on there. there are only like 6 listed on the menu. i like creating my own, but hey you are the famous chef, dazzle me. \n\ni've been there a couple of times, so i can report on a few different burgers. i highly recommend the surf 'n <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>. i'm not sure it says on the menu, but i think all the burgers are 1/2 lb. they are nice and thick. the surf 'n turf is <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, topped with a 1/2 grilled lobster tail, and grilled asparagus on a plain bun. because i believe all burgers should come with cheese, i had them add provolone to it. now pay attention to this next part, because i believe i have improved on hubert keller's creation. order some pesto and mayo on the side. mix it together and use this as a sauce. yum, you'll never have a burger like that anywhere else. \n\nyou can choose different types of meat for your burger. after trying a kobe burger on this last visit, from now on that's the only way i will go. it's about $7 more for a <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger than the black angus, but it's so juicy that it melts in your mouth. the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> is actually american kobe, so it's not crazy expensive like the real japanese kobe. american kobe is a hybrid between black angus and japanese wagyu beef. it has the highest marbling of any beef in the united states, and is as fine as you can get without importing actual japanese wagyu beef. you also get to pick from 5 different buns and about 45 different toppings. toppings are as plain as american cheese and are as fancy as pan-seared foie gras. \n\njust so i could try 2 burgers on this last visit, i cut them in half and shared them with my brother. burger number 1 was a do it yourself kobe burger. we agreed on provolone cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, sauteed oyster mushrooms, on an onion roll. had the burger medium rare. the result was such a juicy burger that you didn't need any mayo, ketchup, or any other sauce. just the natural juices of the burger with the toppings was perfection. \n\nburger number 2 was new on the menu since the last time i ate there. it's called the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>. the menu says it's his favorite. it's a buffalo burger with blue cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, sauteed baby spinach, aoli, on a ciabatta bun. i think the buffalo had the least amount of fat of all their burgers, as such i found it wasn't as juicy. i was expecting it to maybe have some different kind of flavor, but it didn't. it could have just been lean ground beef. it's also the same price as the kobe, so unless you are trying to be healthy, go with the kobe. the blue cheese was kind of medium, which wasn't a bad thing. a very strong blue would have over powered everything. of the 3 i've had so far, it was my least favorite, but still good. \n\nthe fries were ok, but the buttermilk zucchini fries, were excellent. got those with a ranch dipping sauce. they have some dessert \"burgers\" on the menu that i must try sometime. they use a donut for a bun and have fillings like cheesecake and grilled pineapple for example. it's so hard to save room for them though, perhaps they deserve their own visit.", 
            "love of my life, you are not a person. you come in the form of a burger. and you reside here, so very far away from me. ::single tear::\nthis was the last place i ate during my first trek to sin city, and what a way to end the trip. the menu is fantastically huge, with all kinds of goodies to pile onto your burger. and when i say \"your burger\", it truly becomes your burger, because you make it what you want. care for some chipotle aioli? go for it. more of a <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> person? be my guest? oh, no, you say you want <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> instead? they have those too! i mean, portabellos, spinach, fried egg, bacon.... peanut butter?? so many different reason i need to get back there.\nit's a shame that my tummy and pain threshold are not as strong as i would like them to be, otherwise i would have added one of the yummy-sounding milkshakes to my order as well. what's so special about a milkshake? well, the fact that they have a list of shakes with alcohol in them is pretty friggin' special to me, so back off. :)\nperfectly done, medium <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> with swiss cheese, sprouts, avocado, mushrooms and aioli.... this is called \"the ali\".... at least in my head. oh. em. gee. love love love on a bun.\ndo it. you know you want to!", 
            "the brilliantly innovative and sometimes crazy mind of hubert keller decided to step away from the fancy, upscale french eateries and create a..... burger joint?  it's true, and if you've been here before, you should also know it's delicious.  \n\nlocated inside mandalay bay's \"mandalay place\" (their shopping center) - this burger joint is almost always crowded and buzzing with people.   we came here on a weekday around 3pm thinking that would be a good time to come and get a table right away.  we were wrong.  we still ended up waiting for almost 20 minutes to get a table but since we had been here before and knew what awaited us, we would've waited an hour.  \n\nthe last time we were here, we ordered the rossini burger ($60), which is burger bar's most famous and most talked about burger.  you get a 1/3lb. of <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> (which is nothing compared to the original japanese beef, but it's still pretty tasty) topped with sauteed foie gras (duck fat) and shaved black truffles on an onion bun.  omfg!\n\nthey have four different kind of fries you can order.  skinny, fat, sweet potato or zucchini.  we have tried all of them and our favorites are the sweet potato and the fat fries!\n\nif you order the rossini burger, you get a \"sweet burger\" after your meal.  we ordered the creamy cheesecake burger - the buns are actually a glazed donut that's been sliced in half, there's a patty made of cheesecake and then there's a caramelized pineapple slice on top of it.  it was freakin' amazing!  \n\nservice was excellent and when we told the waitress we were splitting the rossini between the two of us, she brought us two separate plates, each with a huge half of the rossini burger, and each with their own order of sweet potato fries!  very nice!  \n\nnot all the burgers are this expensive, mind you.  you can still get a kobe burger without the foie gras and truffles for about $20.  i've also tried their \"<mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>\"($25), which has a 1/3lb. of <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> topped with a grilled half lobster and grilled asparagus.  it doesn't come close to the rossini burger in taste, but it's still a pretty delicious and decadent burger!  \n\nthis restaurant has become a regular destination for us whenever we're in vegas.  my wife insists we have to get a burger at burger bar.  \n\npros:  rossini burger! four different kinds of fries!  great service!  outstanding food in general.\n\ncons:  it's almost always busy, but what can you expect?", 
            "i visit burger bar @ mandalay bay every time i come to vegas. \n\ni'll list my most recent experience.\n\ni had a $50 resort credit to use.  so brian being brian, i order the surf & <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>.  the surf & <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> is <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> burger wit half a grilled lobster, grilled asparagus and a plain bun.  i eliminated the asparagus and kept the lovely lobster.  this was like $24.25.  would i buy this with my own cash?  no way.  however, how often do you have lobster on a burger...........most likely never.\n\ni always order the fat fries with my burgers here because they are so utterly delicious.\n\nnow here are some bad things people will say.\n-it's a little expensive.  yes, there is no disputing that.  the burgers are a little pricey, as are the beers.  guess what, who cares?  if you want to save money go to the buffet.  you could get a cheaper burger at in-out burger if you're so inclined.  \n-it's a simple burger place, why are the people so loud?  the staff here likes to have fun.  they may be a little loud, as would the customers.  this is not l'atelier de jo\\u00ebl robuchon.  this is a simple, yet good restaurant that should be affordable for most people.\n-this isn't in mandalay bay!  well, technically it's not.  it's in mandalay place which attaches the luxor to mandalay bay.  i will for strategical purposes, state that it is in mandalay bay.\n\ndespite the complaints, i know though, when i come to las vegas...........i stop here.  the serving sizes are huge, the food is delicious and the staff is friendly.  5 stars.  *note: i should have given this 5 stars over a year ago*", 
            "this was my first time having a kobe burger.  i honestly wasn't that impressed, but it wasn't bad.  my friends loved their burgers though.  maybe i'll try the standard <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> burger next time i go.", 
            "the burger was absolutely delicious.  i opted for the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, since many on here said it was delicious on it's own, and both my stomach and my wallet thanked me.  not once did i question bypassing the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> or buffalo burgers, tempting as they may be.  amazingly juicy at a perfectly cooked medium, with mushrooms, peppers and <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> on top, i'm not sure i've had a better burger.  their housemade dijon was also a delicious addition.  the fries (tried both fat and sweet potato) were good and very reasonably priced but not exactly must-haves.  i also got dessert, sharing both a nutella milkshake and the raspberry float.  the nutella milkshake is a chocolate lover's dream, and luckily i am one.  <mark>Mini Chocolate Chips</mark>, chocolate syrup, chocolate ice cream, chocolate whipped cream and nutella.. yep it's as good as it sounds.  at $9, it's also a bit pricey, but hey, you might as well go all out when you're already spending close to $20 for a burger and fries.  the raspberry float was tasty too, even though i don't usually like fruity things.  all-in-all, an amazing burger place.  definitely give it a shot if you're in the area.", 
            "believe the hype!! experience a \"burgasm\" like you've never experienced before. yeah i said it, a burger orgasm that you can't get from eating a big mac or in-n-out burger, but right here, right now, burger bar.\n\ncan i get an angus burger on a sesame bun with chopped jalapenos, jalapeno bacon, a fried egg (over-easy!), <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, and chipotle aioli sauce? yes, i can! my creation was so amazing with the right amount of spices and flavors mixed so well together with the thickness of the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>. to be honest, the fried egg really did it for me... you cannot go wrong with that!!! my only suggestion is to pass on the $5 beer battered pickles: not worth it...trust me. (the fat fries were also alright). what is worth it is the +$15 you will spend on one burger that will leave you wondering how'd a burger make you feel so completely satisfied?! & if the cost is what's stopping you from coming here, bet $20 on black at the roulette tables and cross your fingers for a win that'll be spent on something you won't regret!!", 
            "ah the first destination of gluttony was at the burger bar @ mandalay bay. not only was the gf and i hungry after making our way down to vegas, we were starting to get grumpy about it. \n\nthe wait time: 25 minutes. \n\nthe gf really didnt want to wait, but lucky enough she decided to do so or i would have missed out on what could have been...a great experience. \n\nduring the wait, i stayed thirsty and ordered a deadlift ipa. being a gym junkie, i got the badge on my iphone to prove it, i went with the deadlift ipa just because a deadlift was a exercise. lol. \n\nthe 9 oz's of golden brown liquid was filled in a wine shaped glass. why couldnt restaurants serve ipa's in a schooner. 33oz of great beer would eliminate the hassle of reordering. id be down for that. not your standard beer, on a empty stomach, you can get tipsy quickly. as i grabbed my beer, the bartender forgets to even ring me up as i stood there waiting for the bill. our table was ready and i was not about to stand there waiting for a bill so i took it with me to the table. already, this place was a ++++ for me. did i just get this right? a free beer? hell yea! \n\nwe sat down and looked over the menu. kobe burger was the only option for me but i was debating if foi gras for a extra $30 even worth it. the gf rejected the notion of me eating a $60 burger so i parted ways and decided to go with some toppings. \n\nkobe burger........and then some.\n-avocados\n-coleslaw\n- american cheese\n- bacon\n- <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>\n\nthe total for my burger alone was $26. all that was missing was a fried egg, in which the restaurant wanted to serve scrambled due to the recent egg scares. i ended up passing on it, but i knew a fried egg would have made it even better. \n\noh and it doesnt end there. i got an order of sweet potato fries and a caramel latte milkshake. \n\nif your going to do it, do it big! that is just what i did. \n\nthe gf had a angus burger w/ aioli and skinny fries. \n\nas expected, when our burgers came out, <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> is <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>. i tried both the angus and kobe and was able to make a direct comparison. hell, even in a blind taste test, i would be able to differentiate <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> with <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>. the very first bite of the kobe burger and the juices gushes all over my hands. the texture was so soft and moist. each bite took very little effort as the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> melted away in my mouth. \n\nthe caramel latte milkshake was made of coffee ice-cream, caramel syrup, graham crackers, and butterscotch morsels. my god, it made me wonder what the other milkshakes tasted like because this one was just indescribable in words. any explanation would be unjustified. \n\nthe burger bar got me. it got me good. definitely a must try if you want a great burger.", 
            ":o)\n\nit pains me to give burger bar four stars.  first of all, i'm not typically a burger type of gal, except when it comes to in n out, but everything surpassed my expectations and was super tasty.  unfortunately, my burger's lobster was overcooked and service slightly disappointed me.  :(  \n\n\nburgers:\n<mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> - buffalo, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, baby spinach, blue cheese on a ciabatta bun.  the buffalo added the perfect amount of gaminess to give this burger a good earthy kick with the blue cheese to add a mildness to it.  which was slightly odd since blue cheese has so much flavor and usually packs a bold punch.  everything harmonized beautifully and i was happy to chomp away. \n\nsurf & turf - black angus, grilled half lobster, grilled <mark>Green Asparagus</mark> on a plain bun.  sadly, the lobster was overcooked and was chewy.  other then that, the <mark>Green Asparagus</mark> complemented this burger perfectly.\n\n<mark>American Classic</mark> - <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, america cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion on a sesame bun.  a very good basic burger.  the juiciness of the beef makes this one exceptional.\n\n\nsides:\nsweet potato fries - hands down the sweet potato fries won the sides battle.  they were very typical very good sweet potato fries.  good ratio of sweetness and saltiness, and nice and crispy\n\nonion rings - these babies reminded me of the onion rings you get at carl's jr. with the same texture and crispiness.  the biggest difference between the ones at burger bar is that the onions doesn't slide right out of the ring.  :) \n\naioli - do yourself a favor and just get it.  it's so good.  i wanted to cover my hands with this sauce and lick it all day.  i know it sounds absolutely disgusting, but it was soooooo good!!\n\nzucchini fries, skinny fries, fat fries - they're all good, but not amazing.\n\n\nfrom a service standpoint, i was a bit disappointed because we told the server that it was my friend's birthday.  sadly, she didn't bring us a little burger dessert, but we were stuffed beyond all belief to even fathom having another bite.\n\nhere's a little note.  keep their number on hand.  even though they don't take reservations, you can call them to ask them for a wait time and to put your party on the list.  it's almost like a fast pass for the burger bar.  :)", 
            "all i can say is jalape\\u00f1o bacon!!!!!! \n\nokay really wanted the best or one of the best burgers in vegas ots. after several reviews we decided to give it a shot. decided on the kobe with cheddar and all the fix ins. gf had the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> w/jalapeno bacon, cheese, shared fries and had a beer. bartender recommended an ipa for me (delicious, creamy not too heavy and potent). i am coming to the realization that i am not a huge kobe fan but for some reason i keep trying. fries came first, average steak fries with good ranch. burgers came and mine was okay. gf's burger was awesome. perfectly cooked-med-but it was the jalapeno bacon that made the meal. it was spicy and delicious a must try. i would definitely return and try more beer other options and dessert!", 
            "this place had the single best milkshake that i've ever eaten in my life!\nwho's ever though of a nutella, chocolate milkshake with <mark>Mini Chocolate Chips</mark>, chocolate mousse, fudge and nuts? they're awesome!\n\ntheir burger selection is also out of this world. they've got everything from the plain jain <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> patty to <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> with a lobster on top. anything you get is worth every penny.\n\nthe dessert is awesome and quite unique as well. i got the chocolate version that's built out of a doughnut, chocolate thing, passion fruit jelly sheet, and sliced kiwis. it's made to look exactly like a burger, but tastes nothing like one at all. if you're ready for hitting the town wired, this sugary concauction will do the trick for sure!",

(chef's favorite is buffalo with spinach, carmelized onions and blue cheese with a red wine and shallot reduction sauce on ciabatta) -  approx. $25\n\n2) build-your-own - <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> with <mark>Green Asparagus</mark>, oyster mushrooms, bacon and peppercorn cream sauce on a soft onion bun - approx. $17\n\n3) skinny (plain) fries - approx. $3\n\n4) glass of house merlot ($7) and glass of red diamond cabernet ($10)\n\nboth burgers were amazing.  they nailed medium rare on both.  we split them in half and shared.  we savored every bite.  we couldn't really decide which we liked better.  the flavor on the chef's favorite might've won by a hair, but the texture on the build-your-own was much nicer than the texture on the other (the crisp bacon, al dente asparagus and earthy, slightly chewy oyster mushrooms were all a nice contrast to the tender burger and soft bun; the chef's favorite was pretty much all soft, melt-in-your-mouth-no-teeth-necessary kind of mouthfeel.)\n\nfries were good; not too greasy, not too salty.  we rarely ever finish an order of fries, but we ate all of these and dipped some in our burger sauces!\n\nhouse merlot was fabulous minus (boring, a bit watery, not fruity like a merlot should be.)  red diamond cab was much better.  it's a $10-11 solid table wine you can find at sam's club.  would've liked to see a little bit bigger selection on the wine list (there were only about 4 reds by the glass and 6-7 total.)  but i guess they want you to drink beer (extensive beer list by country.)\n\nservice was hit-and-miss with server forgetting about us twice for a long time.  also, right after we sat down, she came by to take our order; we asked for a couple minutes, and when she returned she brought us a check.  she had already set it on the table and started to move on before she realized she had the wrong table.  that was a precursor on the service.  it wasn't horrible, it was just thoughtless.  either she was distracted or tired or somewhat indifferent to her job (not sure which.)\n\nambience was also a disappointment.  i would've expected something unique or inventive.  nada.  take away the menu and the food and i could've been in any average burger place anywhere.  no hint i was in a top-tier chef's restaurant at mandalay bay.  kinda noisy; too many little kids and crying babies for my thinking (we had a 10:30 pm dinner.)\n\nbut for me, food is king, and the food was grand.  we were pleasantly surprised by the bill; under $65 before gratuity.  it was yummy enough that i actually thought, \"i could come back here again...tomorrow.\"",

            "bumped up to 5 stars because i had impeccable service and a burger that made me wipe both sides of my mouth.. before taking a bite!!\n\nsat at the bar: (for like 2 hours)\n\nround 1: (under chef's burgers with skinny fries) <mark>American Classic</mark>: \"<mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, american cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion on sesame bun.\" absolutely delicious angus, cooked right on my prefered medium well, bacon thin but not much fat and toppings fresh. only thing that could use a slight improvement would be adding a slightly larger/taller sesame bun (because the patty isn't small, a little more bread would be a plus).. with that said, its still was an excellent burger!! the fries were like mcdonald's skinny but weren't as salty and had a plain potato fry flavor.. no complaints.  \n\nround 2: <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger and fat fries: \"this <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> from snake river melts in your mouth, tender with an unmatched flavor, the most expensive beef in the world for the most discriminating palate.\" who in the right state of mind would read this on a menu and not want to order at least one ??!!.. as much as i wanted to try the \"<mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>\" or add some truffle or foie gras toppings to this burger as i planned before i made this trip, i got sucked in their brilliant description of marketing genius of having this burger alone! i ordered it plain (coooked medium plus) to indulge its full flavor without being bloody or burnt and without any support of sauces, toppings and even cheese. i've had kobe in the past but this particular kobe patty was amazing! it wasn't too rich or velvety but just had and an incredibly saturated fatty & buttery flavor that was beyond comparison of any <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> burger i've ever had. now, this isn't the type of burger i would eat on a regular basis like i would an angus. because i feel this is more of a real treat like gourmet or having truffle, foie gras, uni, eggs nest.. just my opinion. nonetheless, definitely one of the best burgers i've had in my life, bar none! the fat fries had the same flavor as the skinny but i liked these better, i personally prefer fatter sliced fries and more undercooked than crispy. \n\n* i ordered the beer sampler (6) different beers to choose from domestic/imported: i'll cut right to the chase - \"humboldt brown hemp ale (usa)\".. your welcome =)\n\nservice was 10.0/10.0, i felt special. i must of exchanged words with 5 different staff members including the manager in regards to anything that i needed to make my dining experience any better and some interesting conversations that set a nice vibe.. atmosphere was relaxed and live at the same time (sports games were playing and some indiviudals cheering, but not annoyingly loud). both burgers were memorable and absolutely worth every penny. \n\n*for those of you that felt their burgers were mediocre at most, please advise me of a burger that you obviously feel that's more worthy.", 
            "burger bar i wish you weren't so far....from me! :)\n\nwell in actuality i am glad cus i would be 400lbs if there was a burger bar in the bay area.  i have been coming here for years and am a loyal customer.  mandalay bay is not a centralized location for where i like to stay on the strip but i make a point to come here every trip.  i like it that much.\n\nthere are a few tricks to this place though.  you get to pick your burger meat and i honestly think when a reviewer chooses the wrong meat, they feel like this place isn't good.  the trick is that you only need to order the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> burger.  if you get the vegetarian fed beef selection you are simply not going to get that fatty, juicy flavor a burger needs!  come on people, if you were in the donner party, would you have selected the skinny person or the fat guy to eat?....lol  the fat is what makes a burger juicy and delicious.  also, a burger is really only supposed to be cooked medium at the most.  if you really want a juicy burger, anything else will dry it out.\n\ni love the fat fries but my friend swears by the skinny ones.  maybe i am just prejudice against anything skinny, i dunno :)\n\ni read a review on here about the nutella milkshake.....omg!  that was a freaking awesome choice.  i almost couldn't finish that and the meal.  it is almost too much....notice i said almost?  that's right, i kicked it into fat guy gear and took it all down baby!",

            "not going to lie, i was a little tempted to order this $60 rossini burger that was on the menu just to say that i've had it. unfortunately, it sounded too heavy before a night out on the town and drinking, so i opted out.\n\nthis is located in the strip mall at mandalay bay. i've walked by several times, but had never been in. while you're waiting, they have a free photobooth outside to take some photos. you can either social media tag them or e-mail to yourself. cool little perk and makes the time go by faster before you're seated. i'm sure there are some great photos as the drunks come rolling through.\n\na full bar is available and they have a ton of beers to choose from and there are various televisions on different sporting events if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nwhat i tried:\ni created my own burger with the australian <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> with a ciabatta bun, spinach, swiss, fried egg, tomato, and chipotle aioli. this was served with skinny fries that were thin and crispy, just the way i like 'em. the burger itself wasn't everything that i had hoped for. as you know, i feel like i suck when it comes to building my own masterpieces, so i usually opt out. i should have stuck to my own habits and done so again.\n\ni don't think that the spinach necessarily worked on the burger. it was saut\\u00e9ed but really watery making the rest of the burger super moist. i order the meat cooked medium and the combo of spinach and medium meat juices didn't really blend well. to be perfectly honest, i couldn't tell that the beef was that much better than the normal patties that my friends had in their sliders. next time i will opt for the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> and save myself $8. but at least i can say that i tried it.\n\ni snuck some onion rings off of my friend's plate. they were pretty damn delicious. the onion was sweet inside and the outside was crispy and airy. they stayed crispy throughout the whole meal and i was tempted to order a second round. i was too stuffed, and that weird burger combo kinda gave me a stomach ache. again, not their fault, i chose the flavors.\n\nservice was good and everything came out fast. our server was patient with some of my drunk table mates- i'm sure they get a lot of the crazy banter all the time.\n\ni wish i would have tried one of their desserts. they have a good variety of shakes (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and something called a chocolate burger.\n\ni would come back and try one of their other burgers and will sub for a side of onion rings. this place is more expensive than a typical restaurant, but it's expected since it's inside a hotel on the strip. live a little.",

            "if you are going to put the name of a food in the name of your company, you better know how to make a fantastic version of it.  burger bar delivers. \n\nsitting at the bar was a good alternative to  waiting  for a  table at lunch. they have some standard burger configurations (from $12 to $65), but they also have a make your own section. so i concocted an <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> burger on sesame seed bun with <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>,  peppers and american cheese. and a side order of a combo of fat fries and onion rings (ask nicely and they might combo it for you, too). \n\nthe burger was amazing. cooked perfectly medium with a  pink center, and quite juicy. the burger and toppings were perfectly sized to each other and the bun, which is something you don't often see. and the toppings were plentiful. this is one of the best burgers i've had. the fries were nothing to write home about, but the onion rings were crispy rings of perfection. \n\nthe price is a bit steep ($18 for the above) but i think well worth it. after all, a quick burger at the mandalay pool costs $12. \n\na new favorite place to go in vegas.", 
            "wow is all i can say about this place. i came in here with zero expectations but left with the highest praise. as soon as i took my first bite i hailed it the best burger i've ever had. i'm not much of a gourmet burger kind of guy, but maybe thats because i've never had burger bar before.\n\ni opted to get the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> burger cause that seemed like the most popular choice. i also added bacon to my burger because cmon...bacon... we just got into vegas that day and was already pretty tired from the drive so i was ready to eat and knock out. \n\nthe burger itself was so juicy and so flavorful. the 2 main things i always look for in a meal is texture and flavor, and man did this burger deliver. every bite seemed to taste better and better as i went on. the bacon that was in my burger was just the icing on the cake. it was cooked exactly the way i like it, which is right on the border of soft and crispy. this made the texture of each bite soft, juicy and chewy all at the same time while packing a punch of flavor.\n\ni definitely would recommend this place to pretty much anybody. even though each burger ended up being close to $20, i felt like i completely got my money's worth. next time i go, i definitely want to try some of the more expensive options", 
            "i came to this place with pretty high expectations. let me tell you what... they did not disappoint!! our server was extremely helpful and explained the menu thoroughly. i'm not going to explain the entire menu but we began with the jalape\\u00f1o onion pedals and zucchini fries. man were they delicious. they sound like typical bar food, but these were done right. perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. not too greasy and not a hint of sogginess. \n\ni opted for the \"build your own burger\" option.  chose the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, sesame seed bun; topped with: smoked gouda, bacon, over easy egg, lettuce, tomato, onion, and of course tuffle mayo. the truffle mayo was absolutely amazing and is a must when you check it out. it takes a special kind of mayo for me to dip my fries in there. i've never in my life dipped my fries in mayo... but i wiped that shit clean. \n\nmy girl got the same except ciabatta bread and <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>. instead of the mayo she got the chipotle aioli. also very good. \n\nlastly, i got the vanilla shake with heath bar and cookie dough. the shake was really good as well. i'm not a big shake person and honesty i can't remember the last time i've had a shake... but this one was definitely memorable."

            "one of my favorite restaurants anywhere.  the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger is...um...well it's making my mouth water just thinking about it...\r\n\r\nthe burger bar offers a wide variety of burger choices, but the real fun is in the topping choices (ranging from the ordinary: tomatoes, pickles, onions...to the extreme: lobster, black truffles!!!).\r\n\r\ngood drink choices (quite a few beers on tap) and wonderful homemade fountain sodas.  excellent sweet potato french fries.  \r\n\r\nmy favorite there, however, must be the \"chocolate burger\" dessert.  it's a warm glazed donut sliced in half (to look like a hamburger roll), a round slab of chocolate grenache, fresh strawberries, fresh mint, mango gelatin and raspberry syrup.  great stuff.\r\n\r\nif you're in vegas, check out the burger bar!\r\n\r\nhere's the website: http://www.usmenuguide.com/burgerbar.htm", 
            "i actually found this place by accident when i was in vegas celebrating my friends 30th birthday.  the deal was we had a time constraint and he didn't want to go to a super fancy place, since our cash was reserved for young single moms/college girls dancing ... err working their way though school. \r\n\r\nso wandering from excalibur to luxor to mandalay bay we saw the burger bar.  \r\n\r\nseating was easy and immediate considering it was ~ 8:00pm on a friday night, and i'll admit our waitress was insanely cute.  the menu gives you a lot of options.  you can order pre-assembled burgers or you can choose meat, topping, cheese, bun, basically everything that will go on your burger.  one of the guys did get the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger, which he was very pleased with.\r\n\r\ndessert (included when you get the kobe burger) has an all sugar burger.  buns are two donut halves, the lettuce is really mint, tomatoes would be strawberry ... you get the idea.\r\n\r\ngood service, very relaxed atmosphere, and you can go either way with prices.  if you've been winning, then go for the kobe.  if not get something simple.  either way burger bar is a simple place to grab a burger before you rip up the town.", 
            "this place rocks.  the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger was the best burger i've ever consumed in my life. perfectly cooked, and with nothing special on it...it was amazing.  perfect texture, you can actually taste the sweetness of the meat.  to top it off, they offer ranch zucchini fries, which rocked.  i'm a huge fried zucchini fan, and this did not disappoint.", 
            "continuing my tour de burgers, i went to burger bar twice in two days.  this, however, was not the record among me and my friends.  two of my friends, went 4 times in 4 days - one had the chicken sandwich, turkey burger, angus burger and a dessert burger and another had a kobe burger, two angus burgers and a dessert burger.  all bow down to uvan and steve!\n\nwell, as far as my experience goes, i will have to say burger bar has really good quality burgers.  i had the kobe burger, rare, no toppings on the plain bun and the angus burger, med. rare, no toppings on the plain bun.  each time, the burger was cooked exactly as ordered (cool and red in the middle for rare, pink throughout for med. rare).  the bun was exceptional.  it was slightly crunchy but soft and was perfect to absorb the meat juices (which there were plenty).  the size of the patty was perfect as well - not too small, not too big, abouth an inch tall - i'd say it was around 7 oz.\n\nalthough i don't notice this at most places, i will say, each burger could have used more salt.  i don't think the meat is pre-salted before it's ground and very little appears to be put on before it's cooked.  but, just a sprinkle of salt really helped the flavor.  \n\nlots of people rave about the kobe, but i wasn't too thrilled.  for one, the texture was too soft.  (i know, i got it rare, it's supposed to be soft.  well, that's true.)  but the texture of the meat was soft.  also, the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> had a much more \"beefy\" flavor than expected.  for the price, i'm getting the angus burger from now on.  \n\nthe sides?  well, the zucchini fries are great.  whether they're frozen or not, i don't care.  they are good.  the onion rings are thick with a heavy coating and good.  the fries are fine.  the beer list is very good with well over 20 selections.    tvs for each booth - reason to linger and drink.  oh, and no corkage fee but terrible wine glasses.  service is spotty, but really dependent on who's your waiter/waitress.\n\noverall - one really great place to grab a great burger and some drinks.  \n\nwine i brought and had with the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger: 2003 miura garys' vineyard.  deep purple color, smooth rich texture, firm acidity, bright plum flavor with leather and earth.  much more rustic than the pisoni vineyard bottling i've had from miura.  tasted better after 6 hours, likely because of bottle shock on the drive up.  much more smooth, less leather and earth and more bright, sweeter plum and fruit notes.", 
            "i have to say that the burgers here are good, but you would expect them to be damn good for how much you pay for a burger.  we tried both the kobe burger and angus burger and both were extremely good and tasty.  fries there are not special, in fact mcdonalds fries are better.  i dinged them the most on service.  the waitstaff was very very slow and really did not seem to make an effort to get our food to us in a timely fashion.  i woudl recommend this place to anyone who is in the area and craves a great burger, but frankly, if you had foie gras and <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> at home, i dont see why you wouldnt be able to make an equally good burger on ur own.", 
            "for what it is, a \"burger joint\" they do a pretty good job.  if you've read my other reviews, you know that i don't eat red meat, but my boyfriend considers himself an aficionado of sorts.  he makes an incredible burger (that even i will eat).  \n\nanyway, back to burger bar.  there are several options:  beef, <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, buffalo, turkey, or veggie.  then you choose the bun, then the toppings, and then you pay an additional fee for thin fries, fat fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings, zucchini sticks.  i went veggie burger.  for toppings, i went with avocado, colby jack, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, and oyster mushrooms.  to make up for the fact that a veggie burger costs about $2.00, they had two thick patties stacked on there.  it was actually really good.  i was impressed.  i had onion rings on the side, which were good as well, although, i think they were frozen...no big deal, this isn't a gourmet meal.\n\nbrian, my boyfriend had the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger, with a fried egg and swiss cheese.  he said it was the best burger he's had in a restaurant.  he loved the burger and the thin fries.  \n\noverall a great burger, either veggie or <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>.", 
            "why 3 stars when they have <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>?  service stinks!  slow...and unattentive.  come on, people, can we have some decent service for the friggin' jacked up prices we're payin'???\n\non the bright side, the turkey burger is a nicely seasoned and moist burger.  usually, i get a very dry burger with turkey...this one was perfect!  added some portobella's, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, and provolone for good measure.  yum!  and the shoestring sweet potatoe fries are yummy...not quite as good as my own, but they did the trick.  \n\nvegas...you're fun, but pricey and not attentive...am i asking too much???", 
            "a burger in vegas?  not what you'd expect to dine on with sooooo many buffets and prime rib specials available within a 1 square mile radius.  the burger bar is conveniently located in the shopping wing, mandalay place at mandalay bay.  it's not really so much a bar...it reminds me more of like an upscale ice cream parlor.  the place is pretty spacious with counter seating and wood booths with granite tables. they offer a wide range of beers, both domestic and imported specialties, along with their version of the 'six dollar' burger.  the burgers are gourmet style, courtesy of hubert keller and are actually worth their inflated price.  they use some real top grade beef...ridgefield farms corn fed beef to <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> to <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>...they have something to satisfy the most discerning beef lover.  not fond of beef, try their lamb, buffalo, chicken, or turkey burger.  for something more healthy, they also have salmon steaks and a veggie burger.  i tried the ridgefield farms <mark>American Classic</mark> burger, which came with bacon, lettuce, and a tomato slice.  the surprise on the menu, next to the $60 rossini burger (<mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> laced with foie gras and truffles), are the many condiments that one can add to your burger...over 40 different choices.  i opted for the jalepenos and peppered jack cheese.  and here, when you ask for medium rare, it comes medium rare...it came out perfect.  also a surprise, the service...excellent and attentive.  worth the splurge...go have one!", 
            "any place that i visit four times in the course of one weekend, especially in vegas where there are so many options, i feel obligated to give five stars.  especially because on the fourth visit one of the kitchen staff waved at me.  apparently i became a \"regular\" real quick.\n\n1) my first stop after being picked up at the airport by vegas yelper myke, five of us decide to have lunch at the burger bar.  i ordered a mr burger with pineapple, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, swiss and prosciutto.  ill tell you what though...that decision took almost an hour.  so many options.  i was disappointed none of us opted for the $60 burger which consisted of half a lobster, shrimp, and some other expensive goodies.  you can add truffles to your burger as well and up the price, but i guess we figured since this was our first stop of a long weekend, we should be somewhat frugal.  <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> was not an option for me...but it was definitely an option on the menu.  also i had a delicious mimosa which was my first drink in 2 weeks, so it went down into my belly which was ready to welcome it with open arms.\n\n2) same day....other people show up to vegas and they get hungry.  now, i wasn't in the mood for another burger one hour later, but i did order my favorite beer blue moon.  that selection was a lot quicker than the burger, but their beer list is super extensive.  it was the best selection i found all weekend, and had i not been craving a blue moon, i could have stared at that list for an hour too.  \n\n3) still the same day...that night, i am in need of some serious food, seeing as though all i had eaten all day was the burger in the am.  so three of us, before heading out to the club, went and ordered the fries, sweet potato fries and the zucchini sticks.  a perfect little inexpensive snack to coat my tummy with the grease it needed.\n\n4) saturday night, my roommates were looking for the perfect ipa.  with the extensive beer collection, they found it.  i had a corona.\n\nthanks again for lunch myke.", 
            "i absolutely love this burger bar at mandalay.  they were open late on a friday night, when my boyfriend and i just arrived, so after a long 3 hour drive, we were starving, and craving something too good to be true.  we knew exactly what we wanted...a <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger.\n\nnow this is the 2nd time we've been here, and neither experience has left us in dissapointment.  i've tried the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, the turkey burger, and now the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, and no other burger i've had has been this meaty, juicy, and succulent.  paired with the sweet potato fries, and it's one of the best meals i've had in my life.  the burgers are huge, and the servings of fries can feed 2, so if you wanna save your money for gambling or appetite for liquor, than share.  \n\nwe also had the dessert burger, which was okay. it's just cool to look at. the doughnut and chocolate ganache were my favorite parts, but the fruit combined with it was a little tart for my liking.\n\nbut this place definitely earns 5 starts for the food, ambiance, and service. amazing.\n\nthe burgers come with your standard toppings (lettuce, tomatoes, a pickle spear). you get to choose what type of bun, the burgers themselves cost between 8-16 bucks, and toppings are extra.  google the website for a more extensive menu (along with prices)", 
            "didn't think you'd come to vegas for a burger, did you!?  well, this ain't a mere burger.  it's a burger with a capital 'b'!\n\nall three times, i've had some form of addition and subtraction to my basic burger - medium juicy patty and a ton of fresh raw onion.  that to me is probably all i would go for on a normal day... no cheese.  cheese always seem to overtake the taste of everything else it's added on, for me.  but add an egg cooked over-easy, real bacon and some jalepenos... omfg - i'm having a burgasm!\n\ni always almost have the black angus 'coz i wouldn't get the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>.  \ni just think it's kind of silly that they called it <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>... kobe as we all know, is nowhere near america and the ones they serve here are from idaho... ummm... \n\nbut this is a good place for a cold beer (they really are as cold as beer should be, i'm told), a very very very good burger and a nice ambiance with surprisingly not many rowdy kids considering it's a burger place - maybe they too are too busy  having their mini burgasms to be annoying :)  again, they might need a new host (she's as stupid as she looks) but everyone else is great.  still can't get over the twins who work there - they always throw me off :)", 
            "burger bar, located in mandalay place, is a hamburger lover's dream! the restaurant's name says it all, as this place is literally a \"burger bar\" where you build your own burger. they do have some preselected options as well if you're indecisive, but i recommend building your own. each burger comes with the standards (lettuce, tomato, onion, and a pickle). but this is the fun part!\n\nlet's start with the meat (or non-meat) selections: <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, another beef i don't recall, <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, turkey, salmon, and veggie. from there, it's off to bread. they had everything from plain to whole wheat and ciabatta. the best part, however, is all of the other fixings! from cheese (blue, mozzarella, cheddar, swiss, etc.) to other burger oddities like foie gras, they've got you covered. my burger was a turkey on plain bread with mozzarella and peppered bacon. as a side, i had the buttermilk onion rings, and they also offered fries and sweet potato fries. check this place out!",

            "see profile site for full review with formatted pics.\n\n\nperhaps it was boulud, perhaps keller.....at some point someone decided that a 99cent cheeseburger at mcdonalds simply wasn't enough.  foie gras, truffles, shrimp, lobster.....you name it, you got it.  while i do find it odd that i found myself being led into burger bar by my friend when i don't particularly like beef and don't eat burgers, i will admit to have had a few in the past and my all-time was the thurman burger in columbus ohio, a famous one in its own right.  in a day that included tableau for breakfast and alex for dinner i must say i didn't expect much from the burger bar....but i was pleasantly surprised.\n \nwhile the bar was located in a shopping mall at mandalay bay i didn't judge....most of vegas feels like a mall anyhow and per se in nyc is located in a mall, as well.  arriving around 2:30pm there was a line...a good sign i guess....our names were taken and 10 minutes later we found ourselves seated at a 4-top in the middle of the restaurant.  while the place was quite loud, conversation was quite easy and our menus were delivered quickly.  with 5-6 bread options, 5-6 meat options, 40-50 topping options, plus desserts it actually took longer to order than we had imagined.  eventually i settled on the turkey burger on ciabatta with grilled shrimp, pesto, and a side order of sweet potato fries while my buddy opted for the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger with sharp cheddar and hickory bacon on whole wheat with spicy skinny fries and a sampler of beers.\n \nas the place was busy we chatted for a bit and i decided to get up and explore.  much to my surprise the kitchen was wide open for viewing and i wandered about to realize how fresh all the ingredients were, the bread being baked in visible ovens, and the meats stored in large lockers.  everything appeared very hygienic and clean, very much unlike your average burger shack.  by the time i arrived back at the table my buddy was working on his beer and approximately two minutes later the food arrived.  while i spent a moment dressing my burger and eating my incredibly garlicky pickle spear, i heard my buddy partially-moan....clearly he was loving this burger.\n \nonce my burger was adequately dressed and i had a large pile of ketchup for my fries it was time to dig in.  crisp ciabatta with a fluffy interior first greeted my tongue followed by the wonderful basil blast of the pesto mingling with plump and tender shrimp and well cooked yet juicy turkey.  great texture, quality ingredients, wonderful flavor, well cooked....what more can you ask for in a burger?  i next dug into the fries which were simply fantastic and #3 only to michael mina's duck fat fries and michael symon's lola fries in terms of crispy outside and soft/salty inside.  i do find it rather unfortunate that the restaurant did not order an organic/original ketchup given the quality of the ingredients otherwise, but i guess a minimal amount of hfcs won't kill me.\n \nhaving finished off our burgers and laughing more at the pti analysis of the usc/oregon state result my buddy and i opted for a dessert burger - the chocolate version featuring a split donut topped with a chocolate gnache puck, mango \"cheese\", and strawberries.  humorous in presentation and tasty in flavor, this choice was excellent and split down the middle this \"burger\" was just enough after the huge burger/fries.  the mango cheese was especially surprising in its fresh taste and jello-like texture while the chocolate puck was so rich i doubt i'd have finished one myself.  the donut was a tad dry, imo, but didn't hurt the burger overall.\n \nall told i liked the energy and the food at burger bar.  while certainly our most \"low class\" meal, i actually enjoyed the experience and the pricetag more than sensi and craftsteak and my buddy loved it which was excellent since he humored me in going to so many french restaurants on the weekend.  imo, foie and truffles are best served by a chef like stratta or savoy and not on a piece of beef and buried under toppings...the concept of the rossini burger is ludicrous and anyone ordering it is showing off and missing out on the opportunity for more originality and customization at a lower price.  regardless, to each his/her own and i think the concept of designer burgers has a lot to offer...even if the underdressed and uncustomizable option at father's office is still the standard by which most burgers are judged.",

(btw - i recommend the sweet potato fries over all other fries because we actually tried all of them)\n\nthe service was nice, the waitress kept my tea filled pretty much the entire time i was there. my only complaint is that i wish it wasn't at the extreme end of the strip. if you're not cabbing it, make sure you take advantage of the tram from luxor. walking to mandalay bay is pretty much out of the question.",

 in all, you had a choice of i would say at least 2 dozen items.  of course the gourmet items (as listed above) were more expensive.\n\ni got the angus with both monterey jack and provolone cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, aioli (should've gotten the chipotle aioli) and proscuitto.  you have a choice of plain, sesame, wheat, or ciabatta (i think there was one more?) as your bun.  i decided to just play it safe and go with a plain bun.\n\nmost of the reviews i had read and raved about the sweet potato fries, and for $2.85, you can order an individual portion as your side.\n\nour food came out and the burger looked and smelled delicious.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cni2l-vkg_pdospj6xlixq?select=jfesknrcardv3qriayq_oa\n\ni couldn't really tell between my 2 cheeses, but oh well.  the meat was well seasoned and while it wasn't a perfect combination of flavors, i really liked all of my toppings.  the sweet potato fries were nice and crispy but not overcooked, so i really liked that.\n\noverall, i think everybody liked it.  i've heard small things here and there that they didn't like, but i consider it a successful meal.  they apparently also have build your own milkshakes, but i think that would have absolutely sent me over the top.\n\ni definitely know where i'm coming to get a good burger next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "after spending a good 25 minutes across the way at lush, i felt like my masculinity was challenged by all the essential oils and body scrubs, so what do i decide to do?  \n\nburger bar!  this place is for the guy's guy.  cute female wait staff and hostesses wearing as little as possible, little tvs at every booth with big ones along the wall showing manly shows like espn and poker tournaments, two full pages of exotic beers and other booze, huge burgers with any kind of topping you could dream of, and five kinds of fries.  i simply sat in and soaked up the testosterone, and all those girly exfoliant soaps were washed right out of my mind.\n\nthe main focus of burger bar is the burgers.  this place has burgers with many options for a total customizable meal.  first, you choose your burger meat, with the basic being their ridgefield beef for around $8.95, <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> for $10, <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> for $13+, and even a veggie burger for the vegs out there.  you can choose from among 5 different buns, and the whole thing comes with lettuce, tomato, and onions on the side, for you to put on at your leisure.  on the right side is a long list of toppings for your burger, ranging from the mundane to the extravagant.  for example, you could have <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> on your burger, or cheese, or bacon; you could also have a half a lobster tail, shrimp, foie gras, or black truffles.  each topping comes with its own price to add to the burger, which makes it easy to overspend.  with sauces as well, you could be paralyzed by the sheer number of choices.  \n\nnot to worry!  burger bar has selected a few choice \"chef burgers\" for you, with toppings pre-chosen and an accompanying price.  one is a simple burger with just the meat, the bun, cheese, and some bacon on it, for about $12, i believe.  the top of the line is a monster called the \"rossini\", which sounded like they just wanted to take the most expensive and rare items and put them all in one burger.  this burger contains the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, along with grilled foie gras, the black truffles, and a few other delectables, for a whopping $60.  \n\noverall, i liked it.  the service was prompt, but tended to leave you alone most of the time, the food was really good and very filling (i made my own choices, it was good).  the coffee here sucks, though; don't even bother with it.  all-in-all, walked out paying $35 even with tax and tip for two people.  not bad at all.  i might have to come back when i'm rich to try that rossini...", 
            "this was a positively sublime burger-eating experience.  when in town for a weekend, this was the one place i wanted to make sure i stopped by, and i wasn't disappointed.  buddy and i each ordered the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger and couldn't have been happier.  the meat was prepared perfectly, and the list of available toppings was extensive.\n\ni love that the toppings went from mild to wild and cheap to expensive.  this is probably the only place where one could get a burger with both shaved truffle slices and velveeta.  i went with carmelized onions and gorgonzola - delicious!\n\nas others have said, you must try the sweet potato fries.  they are well worth the extra expense and are scrumptious.\n\none last piece of advice - do the call-ahead seating.  the restaurant doesn't do reservations, but you can call ahead up to a half hour.  my buddy and i did this and were able to walk right in upon arrival.  the place was packed, and the relatively huge line that formed behind us didn't care for us all that much.  in the end, the price was more than reasonable, given how well-prepared and customizable the meal is.  there may be a better burger somewhere else, but i certainly have yet to find it.", 
            "frankenstein's monster was made out of bits and pieces of unrelated human beings.  so if frankenstein's monster was staying at mandalay bay, where would he eat?   the burger bar, where you can have a hamburger made out of seemingly unrelated ingredients.\n\n<mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, lamb, fois gras, lobster, black truffles and avocado are just scratching the surface of the mismatched concoctions that come alive at the burger bar.  this isn't a buffet table loaded with burger toppings, but made to order concoctions of your own design (though they do have some pre-designed burgers to choose from).\n\nthe creative genius doesn't end with the burgers though.  a selection of beer floats are available as well.  that's right - beer float.  ice cream and beer.  we're no longer serving mary shelley's frankenstien and now serving mel brook's young frankenstein.  and that's not all bad.\n\nwhen my wife pointed out the beer floats, she laughed.  unflinching, i immediately ordered the beer float sampler.  5 different micro-brew style beers, with 5 different flavors of ice cream.\n\ni have to admit, most of them tasted better than i thought they would, and my wife who mocked me for ordering them was also slurping them down (i don't ever need 5 scoops of ice cream).\n\nwhile i cannot say that the beer floats are the best beverage i've ever had, i can say that it was offered.  the burger however, was one of the best burgers i've ever had (second only to detroit's miller's bar).\n\nthe burger bar is a 3-star setting with 4-star prices and superior burger options.  strap it to a table, expose to lightning, and you have a place that even a monster could love.", 
            "i saw this place on giada's weekend getaway, and since i've seen the show i promised myself i would go there. our wait was about an hour long, and the entire time we were saying \"this better be worth it.\" let me tell you, it definitely was. by the time we were there, we were starved. \n\ni ordered a <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger, with <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, mushrooms, and provolone cheese and the truffle oil sauce with onion rings, fat fries, and zucchini fries. oh my gosh! divine! the fat fries and onion rings were nothing memorable, however the zucchini fries were soo delicious, i am craving it as i type this. i couldn't finish all of it (obviously), so we brought it home and unfortunately i didnt finish my burger as ph did not have a fridge. sad times, sad sad times.", 
            "the burgers here are oh so yummy! i wish they had something like this in chicago. the one thing that they need to seriously improve on is their waiters. our waiter was so terrible. he wasn't helpful at all and he didn't stop to check on us at all. we waited forever for the check. so back to the food being yummy. fries were good and i loved that we were able to customize our burgers. i had the veggie burger which looked weird but it was so good. the others had the buffalo burger and <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>. we were all so happy with our choices. i liked the atmoshpere of this place. we didn't have to wait for our table so that was a big plus.", 
            "two weeks separated from our recent trip to vegas, i am still thinking of the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger i devoured at burger bar. sometimes you just want to say \"no more buffets\" and just get a good piece of meat between 2 pieces of bread. this wasn't just a piece of meat though. being my first <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger ever, i had to order it medium rare. i usually order bacon with my burger, but oh no, not on this one. oh,  this thing is a piece of art, i tell you. i took a moment as it sit there daring me to pick it up and eat it. but no, as if to torture myself a few minutes more knowing that relief is right in front of me (almost like when you want to take a shit so bad, u finally reach a toilet bowl, u hold it in just a few seconds longer). i sit there admiring this man made creation. i could kiss the chef in th ass. it was beyond delicious. while you're there, go on and order the nutella milkshake, holy moly. it's just beyond amazing. oh, and people who gave this place less than 4 stars didn't order the kobe burger, haha.", 
            "the wait was pretty long.\nwe had a false alarm from the buzzer thing and when we went to the  hostess thinking we would be seated, she was kind of rude about it.\n\ni ordered the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, it was dry and didnt have much flavor.  do they season the burgers there? \n\nexpensive burger for sure\n\nmaybe i expected too much from their  burgers.", 
            "this was our last meal in vegas before hopping on a plane and getting back to reality.  knowing that burger bar is a hubert keller restaurant, i went in expecting a lot...maybe expecting too much.\n\nyou basically build your own burger here.  there are so many choices.  you get to pick your meat, bun and your toppings.  i went with the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> burger with bacon, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, sprouts and bleu cheese( http://static1.px.yelp.com/bphoto/dut55eqdtmpnzgyjn_jvkg/l ).  i swear the restaurant wasn't very busy, but the food took for-e-ver to come out, and we were huuuungry!  after watching food pass us by to other tables, our food finally came.\n\nfor a $14 burger(after all my toppings), i was expecting to have a super orgasmic experience when biting into my burger.  the burger was good, but definitely not the best burger i've ever had.  the meat was nice and juicy, but  the flavor didn't wow me.  \n\nagain, service was sloooooow.  we were done with our meal, and we wanted to pay our bill so we could head to the airport.  our waitress was nowhere to be found.  we finally get our bill and want to pay it, but again, the waitress disappeared.  maybe i was just more irritable because i was tired and hungover.  but it seriously seemed like we waited forever.\n\nwill i come back again?  maybe.......they do have a <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger...hmmm.", 
            "i'm a big fan of thier foie gras burger, in fact it would be better you just have a onion bun with foie gras and mushrooms.  the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> is a a bit overated because its basically just ground up <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> packed into a patty so there is not a dinstinct taste.  the lobster was also a little dry.", 
            "this is \"the counter\" but even crazier.\n\n- build and design your burger to your own liking... how can you go wrong?\n- <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> as an option? win\n- the wait time for this place is a little long (1 hour)... be sure to get reservations", 
            "this is by far the best burger i've ever had.. i try to come here every vegas trip.. this is now my 4th or 5th time being here, and every time the burger is absolutely perfect.  the sweet potato fries and the great selection of brews on tap helps too.  they have many excellent toppings to choose from, but lets face it - a burger is about the meat and the bun... and the bacon... and all of it is so tasty.. and every body i kno that tries this place tells me they r gunna make it a point to come here on every vegas trip.  one bit of advice - go for the angus burger.. don't bother spending the xtra money on the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger.. its good but not any better than the angus.  <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> is known for its marbling and is meant to be eaten as a steak so its a waste to grind it up and throw it on a grill where all that marbling gets lost - but whatever you get im sure you'll like it", 
            "this place is really cool because you can build and customize your own burger. this is the first time i have tried a buffalo burger and it is a lean red meat but it falls apart very easily. my bf ordered the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger which is $60 and added on a lobster tail ($12) along with other fixins. he also had the peanut butter milkshake which was to die for. you can also customize your milkshake and put whatever you want in it. i didn't like the set up of this place because it feels like a dark bar.", 
            "i don't know what it is about vegas but they definitely know how to make a burger! the night before we left vegas, we decided to stop by this place since there were a group of people waiting outside. we figured that if there is a crowd, it must be good. the wait was only 20 minutes which wasn't bad since we were distracted by the shops and displays for the lion king musical. little did we know that we get to \"build\" our own burger with any of the ingredients they have listed on the menu. some weird reason i wasn't surprised to see froi gras, lobster, black truffles and japanese <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> on the menu. my burger consist of black angus, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, portobello mushrooms with ciabatta bread. omg! the mushrooms were long slices and so sweet. everything was just dripping out of my hands. hands down this is my favorite place to get a burger in vegas.", 
            "i consider myself a burger expert - have to, there's fast food in the family - and so we tried this place, mostly because of the hype about the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger.  i think it maybe that i just don't like the greasyness of kobe, and it tastes a little gamey (to me ...).  the place was okay, but just okay, and not a bad choice for a quick bite (if they don't have a crowd - but a crowd doesn't always mean good - have you been to chipoltle lately?... shudder), the sweet potato fries are not as good as you think they will be, service is slow.  menu is good, lots of interesting choices - but it would be a place i would go to because i was at mandalay bay doing something else, not that i would go to mandalay bay to go there.", 
            "great burgers. lives up to the hype in my opinion. they're not the biggest burgers, but that's fine with me because i didn't feel like a complete fat slob when i devoured the whole thing. i love that you can customize your burger, although the price will add up with all the toppings. the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger was amazing! it was tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. definitely one of the best burgers i've had. my wife's veggie burger was the best that she has ever had also. the size of the toppings are pretty big so if you're looking to save a little cash split the toppings with whoever you're with. the <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> they gave me were plenty for two burgers. the skinny fries were nothing special but the onion rings were large, crispy and delicious. next time i'll have to try the sweet potato fries. the black and white milkshake was tasty, with good sized chunks of cookie dough in it.", 
            "2nd time here last saturday. the wait sux but it's worth it. good quality food at affordable prices. we split one kobe and turkey burger amongst 4 girls and added a side of sweet potato fries and fried zucchini. (they charged a $2 split fee per burger) we were trying to save our tummies for dinner. we had to wait about an hour to sit and it took awhile to order and get our food. by the time we were done, it was 3 hours till dinner time. =/\n\nthe turkey burger was better than the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger. it was juicy and seasoned perfectly. kobe patty was bland. the fried zucchini and sweet potato fries were excellent. service was so so, just really slow. there were a bunch of open tables but still a lot of ppl waiting. maybe they're understaffed?",

            "great burgers and fries- with a little sticker shock. yes it's expensive, but the burgers are among the best i've ever had. i ate here twice during a recent trip to las vegas and had a great experience both times. the sweet potato fries are always great and i tried the zucchini fires which were good- but i didn't need a whole plate of them. i ordered the foie gras on one of my burgers ( i love foie gras) and probably would not order it again at burger bar- it was rubbery, unseasoned and just blah. \n\nthe kobe burgers at burger bar are the way to go- super juicy and meaty tasting. i've had kobe burgers other places, but burger bar's are the best. my fav burger- <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, blue cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> and bacon on a sesame bun- perfection!",

            "3.5 stars \n\nnew year's eve at 3pm, sat at the bar and we were served immediately. the bar server was very helpful. i ordered blue moon on tap and boy on an empty stomach, it definitely went to my head quickly *smile*. i ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> $20 with sweet patoto fries and my hubby ordered an <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger $16 (not to be confused with the rossini kobe burger at $60 with truffles) with added choice of toppings + $4 and a side of onion rings. \n\nas i waited, i noticed that the restaurant looked like a comfy burger joint, with booths and tables. the booths each had a mini flat screen so you can watch while you eat. there are two bar areas, for those who do not want to wait for a table. take a seat at the bar if you are hungry and want to be served immediately. \n\nmy burger came in a foccaccia bread with loads of blue cheese. my first bite was great, a mouthful of cheese, tender meat and chewy bread. i tasted my hubby's burger and mine was definitely the winner. the hubby's kobe burger had lots of hard bits in it and that was surprising, especially if its supposed to be a kobe burger.\n\nall in all a good experience but i still prefer the perfect burger at lbs at the red rock casino. i want to say that i will come back here but even if my $20 huber <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> is good, it's still does not beat out the perfect burger.",

            "i'm a lover of top chef masters and top chef in general, so when i saw that hubert keller had a menu favorite burger, i had to take a shot.  spinach and blue cheese on a burger, i mean, could he really marry these ingredients on top a buffalo burger?\n\nfirst off, let me preface this by saying that perhaps my palate isn't refined enough to appreciate this particular marriage of ingredients.  with that said, i thought the blue cheese was overpowering and the spinach gave the burger an unusually mushy texture to what was an slightly adventurous attempt at a traditional american flavor.  so, onto something more positive.  the buffalo meat was red and flavorful, when the taste of blue cheese wasn't overpowering.  also, i had a piece of my friend's <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger which was the complete opposite as far as ingredients, clean, simple and flavorful.\n\nall in all, i think hk's burger was just a bit too complicated and may have worked for some, just not me.  everyone else seemed thoroughly satiated with their meals, a hawaiian burger and kobe, so would i recommend coming back? perhaps. $20 a burger is a pretty steep price, but nothing a trip to the craps table couldn't fix.\n\nbtw, if you're thinking about getting that $500 burger+champagne at the fleur de lys in sf, a note from our waitress: try out the $60 at the burger bar which is basically the same thing, just w/o that champagne pairing.  au revoir!", 
            "it's not really fair to compare the burger bar to other burger places. only on the strip in vegas can you blow $25 on a burger and not really care. it's actually a good value, considering that's only 1 hand of black jack for most people. i guarantee you'll enjoy this burger way more than that one hand of black jack. \n\nthe burger bar is celebrity chef, hubert keller's creation. he has a few of his own burger combinations on the menu, or you can build your own from extensive options. i actually wish that hubert keller would have more of his own burgers on there. there are only like 6 listed on the menu. i like creating my own, but hey you are the famous chef, dazzle me. \n\ni've been there a couple of times, so i can report on a few different burgers. i highly recommend the surf 'n <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>. i'm not sure it says on the menu, but i think all the burgers are 1/2 lb. they are nice and thick. the surf 'n turf is <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, topped with a 1/2 grilled lobster tail, and grilled asparagus on a plain bun. because i believe all burgers should come with cheese, i had them add provolone to it. now pay attention to this next part, because i believe i have improved on hubert keller's creation. order some pesto and mayo on the side. mix it together and use this as a sauce. yum, you'll never have a burger like that anywhere else. \n\nyou can choose different types of meat for your burger. after trying a kobe burger on this last visit, from now on that's the only way i will go. it's about $7 more for a <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger than the black angus, but it's so juicy that it melts in your mouth. the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> is actually american kobe, so it's not crazy expensive like the real japanese kobe. american kobe is a hybrid between black angus and japanese wagyu beef. it has the highest marbling of any beef in the united states, and is as fine as you can get without importing actual japanese wagyu beef. you also get to pick from 5 different buns and about 45 different toppings. toppings are as plain as american cheese and are as fancy as pan-seared foie gras. \n\njust so i could try 2 burgers on this last visit, i cut them in half and shared them with my brother. burger number 1 was a do it yourself kobe burger. we agreed on provolone cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, sauteed oyster mushrooms, on an onion roll. had the burger medium rare. the result was such a juicy burger that you didn't need any mayo, ketchup, or any other sauce. just the natural juices of the burger with the toppings was perfection. \n\nburger number 2 was new on the menu since the last time i ate there. it's called the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>. the menu says it's his favorite. it's a buffalo burger with blue cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, sauteed baby spinach, aoli, on a ciabatta bun. i think the buffalo had the least amount of fat of all their burgers, as such i found it wasn't as juicy. i was expecting it to maybe have some different kind of flavor, but it didn't. it could have just been lean ground beef. it's also the same price as the kobe, so unless you are trying to be healthy, go with the kobe. the blue cheese was kind of medium, which wasn't a bad thing. a very strong blue would have over powered everything. of the 3 i've had so far, it was my least favorite, but still good. \n\nthe fries were ok, but the buttermilk zucchini fries, were excellent. got those with a ranch dipping sauce. they have some dessert \"burgers\" on the menu that i must try sometime. they use a donut for a bun and have fillings like cheesecake and grilled pineapple for example. it's so hard to save room for them though, perhaps they deserve their own visit.",

            "burger and bar.... those two words are music to my ears. \n\nyeah, so i was very tempted to buy the 60 dollar burger (yeah right), but instead i stuck with the black angus burger and my gf got the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger. i figured... hey, ground beef is ground beef right? wrong! i was really enjoying my burger with my favorite toppings (mushrooms and swiss) until my gf made me taste her <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger. her burger melted in my mouth and made my burger just a mediocre hamburger. thanks sherri!! :p \n\nbut either way, the food was great. but i do recommend you choosing meat that you cant get at mc donalds and go with the kobe or higher. spend a lil more and you go from a great burger to the juiciest tender burger you can imagine.", 
            "i saw a lot of mixed reviews on burger bar (both for this location and the one in san francisco), but i was still eager to try it after seeing it featured on top chef masters.\n\nit actually took some time to find it.  burger bar is not located in mandalay bay but mandalay place, which is a little shopping mall adjacent to the casino.  it was late in the morning (just before 11:00am) and the mall was pretty empty.  when burger bar opened though, there were quite a few groups waiting to go in.\n\nthe atmosphere was kind of like a chain family restaurant without all the kitsch and decorations.  the atmosphere was loud, casual and comfortable, but there was nothing to it.  the dining area was not that big.  seating was available via tables, booths and the bar.\n\nthe focus on the menu, of course, was burgers and fries.  while it was expensive for burgers and fries, it did not feel expensive for las vegas.  many menu items were less than $20 and gourmet burgers do go in the $12-$18 range in l.a.  at burger bar, there are a few pricier burgers <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> can be customized with some fancy ingredients (like lobster) that can lead to some really pricey burgers.\n\ni went with the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger.  the burger was about small-to-medium sized.  a lot of burger places like the counter and father's office definitely have bigger burgers.  the bun (which can be customized) was nice.  the tomatoes, green leaf lettuce and onions were fresh, but they were very ordinary.  i got some cheese, which was an extra cost, and some homemade dijon mustard.  the meat had a good flavor and was juicy (also not too greasy).  it was not anything great, but it was a decent, okay burger.\n\ni ordered some of the fat fries, which the waitress recommended.  skinny fries and sweet potato fries were also available.  i liked the fries, but they were not as hot as they should have been, which was kind of odd.  since they just opened the restaurant, i was surprised the fries tasted like they had been sitting around for a while.  i've definitely had my share of food in vegas that was served cold, but i would think this place would have a higher standard.\n\nthe milkshake was expensive but good.  it was a chocolate and nutella milkshake.  it had a good flavor and consistency.  it could have been a little colder.  it was topped with crunchy hazelnuts, chocolate syrup and chocolate whipped cream.  it was definitely heavy on the chocolate and probably could have used something contrasting to balance the shake out.  while i liked the shake, the portion was a little on the small side.\n\nthe waitress was very good--attentive, informed about the menu and friendly.\n\nthere is a lot of bad and overpriced food in vegas because the casinos know they have a captive audience and they let their standards slip.  burger bar, while not great, is definitely better than some of the vegas restaurants i've tried.  it also presents a better value (though maybe slightly overpriced, considering the size of portions, when compared to some burger joints in other major cities).  still, if you go to one of those cafes in vegas, you are probably going to spend right around the same amount for a burger.\n\ni probably would not make a special trip to burger bar, but if we were around mandalay bay again, needed some food and weren't looking to spend too much, burger bar would definitely be a place i would give another try.\n\nfinal note: for me, celebrity chef restaurants often feel more like a brand than a representation of the chef's food because the chef is hardly ever there.  chef hubert keller was there that day; he was not in the kitchen though.  he was having a meeting (outside of the restaurant in the mall area).", 
            "the brilliantly innovative and sometimes crazy mind of hubert keller decided to step away from the fancy, upscale french eateries and create a..... burger joint?  it's true, and if you've been here before, you should also know it's delicious.  \n\nlocated inside mandalay bay's \"mandalay place\" (their shopping center) - this burger joint is almost always crowded and buzzing with people.   we came here on a weekday around 3pm thinking that would be a good time to come and get a table right away.  we were wrong.  we still ended up waiting for almost 20 minutes to get a table but since we had been here before and knew what awaited us, we would've waited an hour.  \n\nthe last time we were here, we ordered the rossini burger ($60), which is burger bar's most famous and most talked about burger.  you get a 1/3lb. of <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> (which is nothing compared to the original japanese beef, but it's still pretty tasty) topped with sauteed foie gras (duck fat) and shaved black truffles on an onion bun.  omfg!\n\nthey have four different kind of fries you can order.  skinny, fat, sweet potato or zucchini.  we have tried all of them and our favorites are the sweet potato and the fat fries!\n\nif you order the rossini burger, you get a \"sweet burger\" after your meal.  we ordered the creamy cheesecake burger - the buns are actually a glazed donut that's been sliced in half, there's a patty made of cheesecake and then there's a caramelized pineapple slice on top of it.  it was freakin' amazing!  \n\nservice was excellent and when we told the waitress we were splitting the rossini between the two of us, she brought us two separate plates, each with a huge half of the rossini burger, and each with their own order of sweet potato fries!  very nice!  \n\nnot all the burgers are this expensive, mind you.  you can still get a kobe burger without the foie gras and truffles for about $20.  i've also tried their \"<mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>\"($25), which has a 1/3lb. of <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> topped with a grilled half lobster and grilled asparagus.  it doesn't come close to the rossini burger in taste, but it's still a pretty delicious and decadent burger!  \n\nthis restaurant has become a regular destination for us whenever we're in vegas.  my wife insists we have to get a burger at burger bar.  \n\npros:  rossini burger! four different kinds of fries!  great service!  outstanding food in general.\n\ncons:  it's almost always busy, but what can you expect?", 
            "mmmm, burgers. one of my favorite foods.\n\ni'm not much for fancy burgers but i made an exception for this place. i was in vegas for a week (!) for work and stuck in mandalay bay. now, i'm not saying mandalay is bad place but a week indoors anywhere is rough. my birthday happened to fall that week so a group of about 35 of us ditched the company-sponsored festivities one night and headed to the burger bar in mandalay place to celebrate my 34th year of existence.\n\nfirst, i will give the staff kudos for arranging seating for us. when 35 people roll up with no reservation, i'm sure it's not easy but my guess is the check for 35 justifies the hassle. we had to wait for a while but only because some large group with little kids was already in the place. sidebar: vegas is no place for a family vacation. take your fucking kids to disneyland, not a place famous for gambling, sex and getting piss-drunk. i don't fuck up your legoland vacation by getting hammered and then hitting on your wife after spending $500 in a strip club so don't fuck up my vacation by bringing your hyper kids to vegas and letting them run around while screaming their heads off. deal?\n\nbut i digress, on to the food. i ordered the \"<mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>.\" i mean, it's named after the owner (and world-renowned chef) - it's gotta be the shit, right? it's actually a buffalo burger, not beef, with <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, blue cheese and baby spinach on a ciabatta bun. it was indeed the shit. one of the best burgers i have ever had, in fact. i also ate half of my boss' <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger, also excellent. and they don't mess around when you order rare or medium-rare. you better like it bloody if you order it that way, not like those chain restaurants that are afraid to leave any pink in the meat. it makes me nervous to order food in those places. i mean, why are you afraid to serve your food a little underdone? what does that say about the quality of your ingredients?\n\nthe sides (sweet potato fries, regular fries) were good but nothing special. i wish i had ordered dessert. they had some good looking \"sweet burgers\" and milkshakes on the menu. maybe next time. the beer menu is very impressive and they serve pitchers.\n\nthe service was very good. they were quick and came by often. with 35 people in the party, i was less concerned with their friendliness, i just wanted them to get the orders correct in a timely fashion, which they did. i willl definitely go back the next time i am at mandalay.", 
            "for me, this is the mecca of burger joints. i also believe this is the proof i needed to know that god really does love me. he sent his only begotten surf & <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> to save me in my time of hungover need.\n\nthis place is wonderful! from the casual, sportsbar feel (tv's in every booth) to the excellent beer selection, i was impressed. this place would make tim \" the toolman\" taylor bark with manly excitement!\n\nwhere do i start? oh yeah...we started with fried jalepeno-flavored pickle spears and zucchini. both were great! i was especially happy to be washing it down with sd's very own stone ipa, a local treat.\n\nso, i was there with my gf and we decided to pick a couple burgers and share. that didn't work out very well for her i might add. given it was my birthday week in vegas i decided to splurge on the surf & <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>. yea i said it!\n\nthe perfect amount of lobster atop a prime black angus burger that rested on a healthy amount of asparagus, along with a side of mushroom sauce. ya only live once right? this bad boy left me speechless. the fries were thin and crispy but this burger was an extreme delight. \n\nafter biting into the s & t burger, i didn't think it could possible get much better. i should have known...the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger here is easily the best burger i have ever had in my existence. period. sorry rocky, it's true.\n\nyou can get it however you want and add from 30 or 40 toppings. i felt like since i was a first-timer here that i wanted to make this burger work for me. i went easy on it and just added carmelized onions and some cheddah. ya know how the middle of the burger is always the best, juiciest bite? this entire kobe burger was the middle of the burger all the way around...in other words, orgazmic!\n\nthe service was excellent, very friendly and attentive. they seemed moderately busy but we were seated after maybe a 5 minute wait. i will never go to vegas again without eating a kobe burger from here. this succulent treat is king in vegas and will have you singin' love me tender at first bite. long live the king!", 
            "i have been to the burger bar in san fran so when i was in vegas, of course i had to hit it up again and again it did not disappoint. i got their signature mint milkshake with alcohol and it was the best as it ever was. its one of the best tasting shakes out there, alcohol or no alcohol i think everyone will like it. i'm not even usually a mint lover and i love that shake. \n\ni got the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger with sweet potato fries and onion rings and eveyrthing was delicious. the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> was very tender and cooked perfectly at medium rare. a lot of places struggle with medium rare, they make it either rare or overdone so i really appreciated the fact that burger bar cooked it so perfectly. their fried foods were great as well. this is a restaurant that i would go over and over and over because its good food, good milkshakes at a great price.", 
            "the burger was absolutely delicious.  i opted for the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, since many on here said it was delicious on it's own, and both my stomach and my wallet thanked me.  not once did i question bypassing the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> or buffalo burgers, tempting as they may be.  amazingly juicy at a perfectly cooked medium, with mushrooms, peppers and <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> on top, i'm not sure i've had a better burger.  their housemade dijon was also a delicious addition.  the fries (tried both fat and sweet potato) were good and very reasonably priced but not exactly must-haves.  i also got dessert, sharing both a nutella milkshake and the raspberry float.  the nutella milkshake is a chocolate lover's dream, and luckily i am one.  <mark>Mini Chocolate Chips</mark>, chocolate syrup, chocolate ice cream, chocolate whipped cream and nutella.. yep it's as good as it sounds.  at $9, it's also a bit pricey, but hey, you might as well go all out when you're already spending close to $20 for a burger and fries.  the raspberry float was tasty too, even though i don't usually like fruity things.  all-in-all, an amazing burger place.  definitely give it a shot if you're in the area.", 
            "thank you for having a veggie burger - this allows me to come here with my husband!  i am in search of the perfect burger and this one was really good.  i also love top chef masters and hubert keller.  i love the fact the hubert has 2 higher end restaurants and then the burger bar - shows me he does not take himself too seriously.  \n\nhad the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> (chef's favorite) with ciabatta bread, soft blue cheese, spinach and onions.  it was fantastic.  the blue cheese was perfect, not overwhelming at all.  a perfect blend.  also tried the fried pickled jalapenos - wow.   next time i want to share the rossini burger with someone (<mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, foi gras and truffles) - right up my alley! \n\ngreat selection of beer as well.", 
            "my third time here, and it's still so good!\n\nwe sat at the bar today since it was very busy during lunch hours. everytime i've been here, it's usually packed!\n\nmy bf and i shared the rossini, sub fat fries!\n<mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> cooked medium rare, topped with seared foie gras and truffles. accompanied with sea salt, pepper corn, and some sort of auju. ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh sooooooooooooooooo good, i'm drooling now just writing this review. eek i'm in heaven every bite i would add a little sea salt, some pepper corn with a drizzle of the auju! man... heaven! \n\nthis burger is really rich that's why bf and i opt to share! \ndelicious! will be back for this $80 burger! ahah", 
            "this places makes me wish i had 4 stomachs.  i don't know where to begin on this one.  custom burgers with just about any meat, any topping, any cheese with full on variety in fries/rings/shakes and probably anything you could dream up.  the one thing i learned on this last visit was that they have the most impressive beer line up in vegas, we are talking vintage varietels (i ended up with the anchor steam christmas brew 2008) including chimay, stone, and many other micro brew legends.\n\nthis last visit i really went for it.  <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, add lobster tail, add flour de lys sauce (think da vinci code), and of course sweet potato fries (note: they are no healthier than regular fries, but much more delicious).   $50 later, i am a supremely happy camper.  now to get a burger n beer for $50 would be typically unheard of, but i truly feel i got good value and can easily win it back at the tables.  for a perfect finish try rolling around the corner and grabbing a yaegar bomb frozen concoction at the nearby yard stand (a few doors down towards luxor).", 
            "a bit pricey, but worth it for the experience.  i had a <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger which was excellent.  the fries were nothing special which surprised me a bit.  everything else on the menu seemed \"gourmet\" so the fries seemed a bit out of place... season them up at least??  i also tried the chocolate desert burger which was really cool.  looking at it, you would think it's just a slider or small burger.  it's actually a piece of chocolate shaped like a burger in between a donut shaped like a bun with a mint leaf for lettuce, kiwi slices for pickles, and a paper thin slice of mango masquerading as cheese.  it looks amazing and the flavors really compliment each other.", 
            "this time i was not drunk, and the burger was still awesome!!! but this time we tried the trio sampler, fat fries, sweet potato fries and deep fried jalapeno pickles! wow, i could not stop eating the sweet potato fries and the deep fried pickles were awesome! i had the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> with pepper jack and spicy aioli spread and the meat was cooked perfectly and very juicy. normally i dip my burger in some kind of sauce but this time i just enjoyed that meat flavor from my burger. ahhh i want another one now!", 
            "can be tricky to find if you don't know vegas really well, since it's in the walkway *between* mandalay bay and the luxor. it's worth it. follow your nose to the lush bath products store across the hall.\n\non its face, it seems pretty straightforward: decent bar, burger joint, tvs in the booths showing some sport or other. it goes deeper. start with the beer list - great selection, large draft list and truly wonderful bottle list. i've had award winning canadian beers here that i can't even get in canada. if you've never had a unibroue beer from quebec, i recommend the unibroue 17.\n\nthe menu, too, goes deeper. not just burgers. grain fed or naturally raised beef? wagyu, maybe? you are spoiled for choice, but if that intimidates, they have several reasonable pre-defined burgers to choose from or riff on.\n\ni'm the guy who brought melissa y. (below) here on her birthday, making lots of noise about the $60 burger. <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, foie gras, 1/3oz of shaved black truffle on an onion roll. the rossini, they call it. we each had one, and they were great. better than great - putting black truffle on a burger is something i haven't done before or since (except on return trips here) and it is some inspired eats, my friend. you would not do badly to spend some blackjack winnings on that little masterpiece.\n\nbut. i'm going to tell you something important here, so listen good: you can do better. you can make a thing more pure and more perfect. you can reach the platonic ideal of burger in this place, and reaching platonic ideals isn't a thing we get to do very often in our lives. are you ready? then let's begin.\n\nditch the foie - it adds richness where none is required, and the richness it adds is lost in the strong flavours. ditch the kobe, too. kobe is either getting you beautiful texture (not irrelevant in ground meat, but certainly *less* so than with steak cuts) or beautiful flavour, but the naturally raised beef has that in spades. ditch the onion bun as well, if you want my opinion. i like onions plenty, but baked into a roll they lose some of their fire and even if the result is still tasty, you're missing the opportunity to go for their ciabatta (great texture, nice yeasty flavour, works with the beer) or their sesame (a classic, done well).\n\nokay, so now: keep the black truffles (keep the black truffles), but maybe get your cheese on, and add some pepper bacon or a fried egg. congratulations, champ, you've got yourself a burger that adds no pretense, that gilds no lilies, but which explodes with flavour you didn't think a burger could have. this is it, this is the burger you've been waiting for.\n\ni'm proud of you, soldier.", 
            "so after years of hearing that we need to try burger bar, my husband and i finally decided to take the plunge.\n\nburger bar is located in mandalay place, which is the shopping area between mandalay bay and the luxor.  there are lots of restaurants around this area and valet is a breeze at mandalay place.\n\nhusband and i got right in and had a seat in the booth.  they have a huge beer selection (which had the husbands attention immediately!)  but we decided just to do burgers and fries.\n\ni had a <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger, on an onion bun, with a fried egg, mayo, lettuce, tomato and onion.  i had sweet potato fries with this.  i ordered the burger cooked medium and i'm glad i did!  if would have ordered it medium-rare, i think the burger would have come out moo-ing at me!!  (mind you- i'm all about medium-rare on a good steak!)\n\nthe husband had the <mark>American Classic</mark> with sweet potato fries.\n\nwe both agreed that we would have rather went to red robin or stripburger over burger bar.  for one, you would think the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> would have great flavor.  not even.  it was ok at best.  husband said that he thought it was \"pretentious to charge that much for a burger that tasted like that.\"\n\nafter both our burgers and fries (we had water to drink) and after tip, we walked out paying $45.00.\n\ndefinitely a cool place, and i'm glad i tried it, so i know that i don't ever have to go back.  definitely disappointed!", 
            "this place is pretty genius. i had the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> with a fried egg on top, delicious. be careful how you order your temp; med=med rare, med well =med, etc... stellar beer selection!", 
            "oh how i love the burger bar.  oh how i love vegas!  i'm gonna keep this short and sweet.  but let me ask you something.  would you turn down a free $60 burger?  i was at the burger bar last year with a couple of buddies and i told them that i would get them all the rossini burger if i won big.  well, i won big... so big that i was ready to purchase 4 rossinis.  but these foolios declined.  well, their loss.  so instead, they settled for the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger.  juicy, tender, cooked to your liking, add some cheese and bacon, a side of onion rings, and an ice cold beer... what more could you ask for?!?!", 
            "burger bar in vegas (mandalay bay) is the ultimate burger experience. i went for a work dinner and heard all the rave that it was ran or created by famous restaurateur hubert keller. i never heard of him before, but now think everyone should know about this place.\n\ni ordered the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>. this is the most expensive burger i ever ordered ($16). i have to agree that melts in your mouth and is very tender.  i went crazy and customized it by adding bacon and pepperjack cheese... and boy that really did hit the spot. \n\neverything orders was delicious - onion rings, sweet potato fries etc. i love eating work with group so you can try everything.", 
            "dinner on the strip and my t. suggests the burger bar at mandalay bay.  it's my first visit at this hubert keller restaurant and it's busy on a saturday night.  they don't take reservations and won't seat you until your whole party is there...so hurry up people! \n\nthe six of us squeeze into a booth where individual booth televisions make this a very sports bar friendly atmosphere.\n\nif you noticed, i'm not the biggest burger fan, so i end up with the vegas vegan burger with buttermilk zucchini fries ($12) - sandwiched between two portobello mushroom caps are grilled roma tomatoes, grilled zucchini slices, sauteed peppers, and a roasted eggplant slice.  sure, it's pretty generous sandwich because they really do load it up with veggies, so you'll get your fill on the vegetarian burger.  the fried zucchini was pretty standard, crispy and not soggy at all.\n\nthe husband had the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger ($16.50), straight up.  they ask if you want to add various fillings like cheese, mushrooms, etc.  but he stuck to just the beef so he could taste the meat itself.  it was decent, but nothing special or worth the price.  (i guess what makes this place special is all the toppings you can add - 8 different kinds of cheese, lobster or shrimp, foie gras, chili, black truffles, or three different sauces.  all of these definitely bring the price of your burger up though!)\n\nservice was okay - we had to ask the waitress more than once for extra ranch dressing, etc.  it's a busy place and with high backed booths, it's hard to see your tables.\n\noverall, been there once and that's enough.  don't think a return visit is necessary at this point.", 
            "i love burger bar. i have been there about five times so far and even tried the rossini ($60 burger). the price tag on the burgers is well warranted as i have yet to experience a burger that compares.\n\nthere is usually always a 15-20 minute wait during dinner time and if you are super hungry that can be annoying. for me, it has always been well worth the wait. overall the staff is friendly enough, service is solid -- nothing exceptional but also nothing to complain about. the food, however, is what earns this place a five star rating. i have had several burgers off their menu and the rossini, of course, tops them all -- but for more budget oriented people i'd recommend the buffalo burger or the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger.   i had the buffalo burger with <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> and avocado along with zucchini fries on my most recent visit. it was good but i should have ordered it medium instead medium well. i think with buffalo meat being lean and dry naturally it is best to order it a bit juicier. <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger was simply amazing and i have no complaints about it. the skinny fries are okay, as are the sweet potato fries and zucchini fries...i don't know, i have never met a fry i didn't like..\n\ni truly believe that you can't go wrong with anything on the menu at burger bar.", 
            "i had read in my trusty fodor's guide that this was a good spot for an inexpensive lunch. we walked all the way down the strip to the location (it's in between the luxor and mandalay bay). the resturant is located inside a small mall and when we got there was not overly packed. you can select what type of meat you want, they have everything from <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> to salmon to veggie. then you select your toppings, again plenty of choices and then your bun type. i had the veggie burger with sweet potatoe french fries. the burger was delicious! i believe it was made with lentils and cheese and pumpkin puree? my man had an organic beef burger with bacon and seemd to enjoy it thoroughly! the drinks are expensive, $6 for a corona? but this is vegas and there are no longer cheap options a plenty. i liked the vibe and here and would go back but the location makes it kind of troublesome.", 
            "okay, so everyone loves the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger. the first time i went i tried it and i was not impressed at all. it seems like such a waste of great meat to just grind it up. maybe it's because i'm not used to the flavor or i didn't like the idea of paying that much for a burger but i didn't think it was that great.\n\nthe second time i ordered the <mark>Country Natural</mark> and customized it to my liking; i was very satisfied this time. the meat was juicy, the bun was tasty, and the sauce gave just the right complimentary flavor. the fries were also seasoned and cooked perfectly so that they were nice and crispy but not burnt.\n\nthe food took awhile both times but the server was nice and she had all these cool tattoos. i like.",

            "ah the first destination of gluttony was at the burger bar @ mandalay bay. not only was the gf and i hungry after making our way down to vegas, we were starting to get grumpy about it. \n\nthe wait time: 25 minutes. \n\nthe gf really didnt want to wait, but lucky enough she decided to do so or i would have missed out on what could have been...a great experience. \n\nduring the wait, i stayed thirsty and ordered a deadlift ipa. being a gym junkie, i got the badge on my iphone to prove it, i went with the deadlift ipa just because a deadlift was a exercise. lol. \n\nthe 9 oz's of golden brown liquid was filled in a wine shaped glass. why couldnt restaurants serve ipa's in a schooner. 33oz of great beer would eliminate the hassle of reordering. id be down for that. not your standard beer, on a empty stomach, you can get tipsy quickly. as i grabbed my beer, the bartender forgets to even ring me up as i stood there waiting for the bill. our table was ready and i was not about to stand there waiting for a bill so i took it with me to the table. already, this place was a ++++ for me. did i just get this right? a free beer? hell yea! \n\nwe sat down and looked over the menu. kobe burger was the only option for me but i was debating if foi gras for a extra $30 even worth it. the gf rejected the notion of me eating a $60 burger so i parted ways and decided to go with some toppings. \n\nkobe burger........and then some.\n-avocados\n-coleslaw\n- american cheese\n- bacon\n- <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>\n\nthe total for my burger alone was $26. all that was missing was a fried egg, in which the restaurant wanted to serve scrambled due to the recent egg scares. i ended up passing on it, but i knew a fried egg would have made it even better. \n\noh and it doesnt end there. i got an order of sweet potato fries and a caramel latte milkshake. \n\nif your going to do it, do it big! that is just what i did. \n\nthe gf had a angus burger w/ aioli and skinny fries. \n\nas expected, when our burgers came out, <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> is <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>. i tried both the angus and kobe and was able to make a direct comparison. hell, even in a blind taste test, i would be able to differentiate <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> with <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>. the very first bite of the kobe burger and the juices gushes all over my hands. the texture was so soft and moist. each bite took very little effort as the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> melted away in my mouth. \n\nthe caramel latte milkshake was made of coffee ice-cream, caramel syrup, graham crackers, and butterscotch morsels. my god, it made me wonder what the other milkshakes tasted like because this one was just indescribable in words. any explanation would be unjustified. \n\nthe burger bar got me. it got me good. definitely a must try if you want a great burger.", 
            "burger bar is a loud, crowded, but deliciously wonderful place. the burgers are perfectly cooked to your liking. i ordered mine medium and it was perfectly pink all the way through. i did the customize your own burger. i opted for the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger with <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, cheddar, avocado slices, and skinny fries. perfect and delicious, loved the skinny fries nice and salty hot and crunchy. the milkshakes look fantastic but i was so full there was no way i could fit more in. \n\ndefinitely would go again!!\n\nonly complaint they said 15-20min wait but it was more like 30-40. very popular spot.", 
            "i live in sf and have been to burger bar before, so i knew exactly what was in store for us. great burgers, great shakes and bank breaking for lunch, but that's not an issue for me. \n\ni know you are not supposed to fall in love in vegas, but i did. nutello shake, let me get yo number baby b/c you got it goin on!!! absolutely hands down the best shake i have ever tasted. they serve it up in a ginormous glass and it's enough for two unless you are like me and you just want to be greedy and enjoy every last spoonful to yourself. i shared, i did. \n\nwe both had the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger. i got mine with the jalapeno dusted bacon. check that out folks. spicy bacon is all good in my book! we went with the fat fries b/c we had bad skinny fries at another spot the day before and we wanted real fries this time around. burger was cooked to perfection. huber rocks it. it's like ordering a steak when you dine at burger bar. they are on point with this aspect of the food. when you say medium rare, it's medium rare. when you say well done (as my good friend lizzy said) it's well done. i appreciate the attention to detail in life and clearly my boy hubert does as well. \n\nthe decor is simple and the tables are reminiscent of a tgif, which is not cool and they have mini tv's at each booth. so much for my promise to lizzy that i wouldn't watch sports today. the sf location has these really cool high sitting tables and cool chairs and i guess i expected since it's vegas, they would do it right. whatever, the food was off the charts, the service was exceptional and in the end, burger bar is a very safe spot to grub b/c you know for a fact it's gonna be on point each and every time.", 
            "were normally not burger fans, but felt like something different. we were not disappointed, the food was awesome. we both had <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burgers with customized toppings. \n\nthe service was good and quick and the place had tv's all over. they have a ton of beer, mostly bottles and a full bar. it's also close to a bunch of other restaurants, which is cool if you're doing a little bar hopping.",

            "one of my favorite burger places in lv!  i always get the turkey burger, and it's always juicy and delicious (many turkey burgers at other restaurants are often dry and bland, but bb knows their turkey burgers)!  i've had a few bites of the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burgers (my hubby's favorite) and they are extremely tender and juicy :)  i was also ecstatic to find a place that has sweet potato fries (some pretty damn good sweet potato fries to be more specific).  it's also great that they are open later :)", 
            "ate here on my last night in vegas. very welcoming staff and was seated within five minutes. i loved the decor of the restaurant/bar. the beer was great and my girlfriend had a sombrero (khalua/milk) which was also very tasty. but now onto the nitty gritty. we tried the fries sampler with fat fries, skinny fries, and onion rings and all were cooked to perfection. i enjoyed every bite of them. now....one of the best burgers i have ever had. was the one they let me create through their nifty \"create a burger\" section on their menu. you get to choose the type of meat, bun, toppings, cheese, anything you can think of to create your perfect burger. i got mine with a wheat bun, <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, red wine sauce, pepper jack cheese, and jalapenos. the burger was soooo juicy. incredible. delicious. mouth watering! it is very hard to compare to any other burger i have had in recent memory. although the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> makes it a little more pricey at $24 for the entire burger it was definitely worth the money. enjoy your own burger creations!", 
            "so my friends and i were in town for a conference, and we're trying to find a place that's better than fast food but wouldn't require reservations or dropping 40+/person.\n\nwe actually did the random restaurant picker @ urban spoon and got this place.  i was really impressed.  i had the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger medium rare which was awesome as well as both sweet potato fries and onion rings.\n\nthe food was great, the service was fast (esp considering our waitress had a table of 15+ right next to us), and i'd definitely go back for 2nds.", 
            "to me, las vegas is all about glitz and glam.  thanks to burger bar's rossini burger, you can feed the glamorous foodie in you too!\n\nokay, the restaurant itself isn't really glamorous; it's a typical bar/burger joint.  at the time i dined here, the 2010 world cup was going on, so the place was packed with testosterone-driven men of different nationalities, screaming and getting heated up.  but the food is another story.  that's right.  i'm talking about the legendary: the rossini.  rossini burger may overwhelm you at first.  when i first saw the description, i thought to myself, \"sure, i enjoy <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, foie gras, and black truffles, but all in one setting, in a form of burger?\"  after minutes of serious hesitation, i decided to order it.  if i don't enjoy the burger, oh well, at least i would have gained an invaluable experience.\n\nokay, the burger was good.  but of course, it should be good; it has three of the most treasured ingredients in the culinary field after all.  but after a couple of bites, i started to feel the heaviness of the burger and i was done before i could even finish half of the burger.  i also ordered the nutella milkshake, but i couldn't even get to it.  so if you are a lightweight diner like me, share and split the burger!",

            "burger bar is where we head to after a mandalay bay concert or after drinks at the foundation room. \n\nat bb you can choose to eat your burgers from booths, tables, or at the sit down bar. despite all the seats, bb does get crowded, especially during lunch, dinner, or the weekends. this place has tv screens everywhere, in every booth, along the wall at the sit down bar, and a few others placed throughout the place. it's more like a sports burger bar...i like seeing espn on the screens, i'm a guy, it's in my dna! the crappy thing i don't like is that they pump music through their speakers and since music is loud, people also speak louder. don't expect to have a nice quiet conversation with your date or friends...this ain't the place for that.\n\nthe menu is simple. you can pick one of  their set menu items or create your own burger. reasonable priced menu especially for the lv strip. you can choose from different meats...black angus, <mark>Country Natural</mark>, american kobe, & buffalo. for you other people not looking for meats...they have a veggie burger, chicken, salmon, or turkey. then you can dress it up with whatever veg, cheese, or sauces, on their lists. and you can get your burgers with fries (fat, skinny, or sweet potato), buttermilk zucchini fries or onion rings, & beer battered jalapeno pickles (never tried these). i usually keep it simple: <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> on a sesame seed bun with <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> & spinach, with sweet potato fries or onion rings, & a $7 chocolate shake (yes i did just order a $7 shake!). the wife likes the surf & turf- black angus burger, grilled half lobster, & asparagus. they also have a $60 rossini burger-kobe, foie gras, black perigord truffles, on an onion bun...pretty steep for a burger but if it floats your boat-eat it.\n\nthey also have a pretty good selection of beers, wines, and cocktails. beer is beer everywhere except when it comes to the prices and bb alcohol prices are higher than other similar food joints. we always pass on the drinks. \n\nfor the most part we've had decent service. but we do avoid the lunch and dinner crowds because those are the times we've had hit or miss service. it's mayhem trying to wave down a server during a weekend dinner rush. and it seems like they play extra loud music to help to drown out the customers that need assistance lol! seriously, you can hear espn, loud music, people talking loud just to hear themselves...and that's going on all at once. bb has the unmistakable ambiance of a high school cafeteria.\n\noverall, bb is fun burger joint where you can create your \"own\" masterpiece of a burger. we like that they offer you many different selections of toppings, but beware on your add on's, they can definitely add up. you could easily be eating a $20+ burger. so bring your earplugs and just text away with your friends...and enjoy your burger.", 
            "when i think of hubert keller, i don't think of this place at all.\n\nthe environment here makes me think of a higher end biker bar. all the waitresses are wearing hip hugger jeans, tight black spaghetti straps with their midriffs showing, cleavage popping and their tramp stamps proud and loud. that said, the waitresses are all very sweet and accommodating. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> which is a buffalo on ciabatta bread with spinach, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, blue cheese, and the usual condiments. i liked it a lot, and it was very juicy as well. i loved the sweet potato fries which the waitress allowed me to substitute at no additional cost.\n\n my other party member built their own burger: <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> with mushrooms, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, avocado, and some other condiments that escape my memory. that was actually significantly better than the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> i had, perhaps it was due to a preference in the meat selection. \n\nthe sizes are filling and i was glad i didn't order a shake, even though i really wanted to. i wouldn't have been able to finish both my burger and a shake without rolling off the escalator in a food coma induced state. if it wasn't so far off from the main strip, i would come here more often. however, for those driving to and from vegas, make this your first or last stop on your trip, unless you're staying @ mandalay bay. vegas traffic just isn't worthwhile.", 
            "after hearing about the burger bar for the last two years i finally got a chance to try it and the gourmet burgers are very good. i went with a business associate and we both ordered the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger which, according to the menu, is produced in the snake river area. our burgers were cooked perfectly and were tasty. i ordered the buttermilk onion rings and they were excellent. maybe the best onion rings i have ever eaten!\n\nburger bar offers a huge selection of condiments to pile on your burger but every item will add a buck or two the the cost of the meal. the kobe burger will run $20 so be prepared.\n\nservice was very good and the iced tea and lemonade are both perfectly prepared. the restaurant reminds me of a loud sports bar and there is loud music playing over the speaker system.  it is very difficult to hear and carry on a conversation.  it is a good choice for quick meal, once you are seated, and a tasty burger.", 
            "i stopped in here when i was vacationing in lv last weekend, and it was probably the food-highlight of the trip.  i had the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger with peppered jack cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, and the typical burger toppings.  it was fantastic.  the onion rings were also delicious, and the bloody mary i had was hands-down the best i've ever drank.  i don't think i'd go out of my way to visit this place again on my next trip (considering how many places there are to eat in vegas,) but it's definitely worth checking out if you're close-by.", 
            "the best burger we ever had - each of us - that is for sure\n\nmy wife and i went thereon our first night in vegas. we saw the reviews and figured this is right for us\n\nrestaurant is nice sports bar, very casual, not uptight at all. service was very good. \ni had a <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger just to try cause i figured i need to know if you really need to waist such good cut of meet in a burger. to tell the truth i still do not know. it was a very delicious burger, cooked perfectly they way i love but not sure it was really  the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> vs regular beef with 30% fat.....\n\nmy wife had a lean buffalo burger which was also out of this world.\n\nwe each had a different fries with our meals - both were great!\n\nthe toppings you chose to put on the burgers were disappointing and expensive. disappointing cause we felt they take a way from the pure burger taste and some that were over 4$ just is too much for a little bit of this or that......\nmy wife also took a \"salad\" side which was just a 7$ very very small ball of very few leafs(less then a hand full) of this and that.....really a joke under any salad standard and a total waist of time\n\nadd to that 2 beers and you are looking at $80 evening that had a pint + a burger.....so certainly  on the high end side for 2 burgers in a sport bar.\n\nbut and a huge but - they were the best burgers we ever had!!!", 
            "really good. i had the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, which was pretty good, but not worth the $17 i paid.  fries (couple different types to choose from) and the various sauces were real good. being able to add whatever you want to your burger is very nice, but of course you pay for it.  wife had to check the burger twice to ensure it was turkey; it tasted so good. lots of tvs and your pop is constantly full.  great selection of beer on tap and in the bottle.  not a whole lot of flavor on the burger would be my only complaint.", 
            "second only to in and out, hubert keller's burger bar is a top burger joint.  ive been there twice and have tasted four different creations of burger and they are all delicious.  i love how many different toppings you can choose, and they are all high quality ingredients.  you can go from really fancy (truffles, lobsters, <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>) or just plain ol american.  either way, it can form to any wallet.  if you dont want to choose your own ingredients they have pre-selected top burgers, the <mark>Black Jack Burger</mark> was really good.  i thought the skinney fries were too overdone, but the sweet potato fries were good.  this time around we tried a milkshake, the black and white one.  omg milkshakegasm.  delicious, creamy, chuncks of cookie dough and homemade chocolate whipped cream.  if that isnt you thing, i hear burger bar has the largest selection of beers on tap on the whole strip.   the french man created the best over the top burger joint- good eats with a healthy dash of vegas flash.", 
            "i wanted a bloody, rare burger. and that's what i got. i'm pretty sure i could hear my burger moo at me when i bit into it. dripping in juice...so good. and yes.. again, it was so yummily rare.  \n\ndon't worry - all y'all who are afraid of a lil pink, my friends got their burgers medium and no moos coming from their burger.  tons of burgers to choose from or opt for the build your own burger variety.  they even have an oh-so-indulgent <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger!  \n\ni got the <mark>Country Natural</mark> burger, added on a fried egg, bacon, and provolone.  in all honesty, i wanted to go all out and add truffles and truffle sauce, and foie gras, but i was trying to be good.  even with me 'sacrificing', that burger was amazing. when i ordered my burger rare.. it came rare. i love that. i love ordering meat rare and it being done right.  it totally tickled my burger fancy. \n\nmy friends got their burger - and i wish i could tell you what was on theirs - but i was so involved in my own bloody burger goodness that i just didn't notice.  \n\nwe also shared the sweet potato fries and zucchini fries.  the sweet potato fries were good - albeit, perhaps the least amazing part of the whole meal - and the zucchini fries were delicious!!! soft and crunchy at the same time. all that washed down with a yummy spaten optimator beer...this whole meal made me one very happy girl.\n\nwait...that's not all. we ended the meal sharing a mint chocolate chip milkshake made with a mint liqueur. amazeballs, i tell you.  we were so full we were convinced we'd only sip some and take no more. but it was so good, we forced our fat asses to keep going...and we regret not one sip of it.  \n\nsat at the bar, didn't have to wait for a table, and the bartender/waitress was super awesome and nice.  so, my verdict? burger bar = happy lil me.",

            "i had the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> and the buffalo was surprisingly good.  i wasn't expecting it to be as juicy and flavorful.  my only complaint was that the <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> and blue cheese overwhelmed the burger.  others at my table had the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger or the black angus burger which were good, but not out of this world.  \n\ni would definitely come back to try the buffalo burger again, but would probably opt to build my own and take the less is more philosophy.",

            "there's a loooong wait here for a reason. burger bar is awesome. the best thing about it i would say, are the endless options (customizable burgers, drinks, etc). not to mention the deliciousness. burger prices range from normal to ridiculous ($60) for those with fancy tastes. there was turkey, salmon, normal beef, <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, etc, with all sorts of fancy toppings available. (the expensive one had truffle essence...i still have no idea what that tastes like).\n\nwe ended up splitting a kobe burger (they charge for splits, ugh!)  as pictured (http://media4.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xpx-07jmgknbobjsoybp2g/l). the patty was impossibly tender and wonderfully seasoned. we ordered a dipping sampler for our fries (\nhttp://media2.ct.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gb-cp9wlcvvqknjj0-d2fq/l). it was super-fun to try all the sauces. i liked the chipotle sauce the most. i also got seriously what i consider the most luscious strawberry margaritas ever (http://media1.ct.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wozjlux7yg4yrr6yctuxbw/l). i had two of them. there was a lot of fresh, sweet strawberry puree in there, as well as scattered mint leaves for to make it even more refreshing.\n\nlast, we topped our meal off with dessert. there were many, many choices available...including alcoholic milkshakes, with customizable flavors (pick the liquor, pick the flavor)! amazing. we settled on the dessert burger, which consisted of donuts sandwiching a sheet of passionfruit jelly, kiwis, strawberries, and gnutella (http://media4.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7p_glg35zpgolnw-fjhlqg/l), accompanied by a drizzle of raspberry sauce and a dollop of whipped cream. it was soooo cute and yummy. i loved burger bar!! next time i'm getting an alcoholic milkshake...",

(chef's favorite is buffalo with spinach, carmelized onions and blue cheese with a red wine and shallot reduction sauce on ciabatta) -  approx. $25\n\n2) build-your-own - <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> with <mark>Green Asparagus</mark>, oyster mushrooms, bacon and peppercorn cream sauce on a soft onion bun - approx. $17\n\n3) skinny (plain) fries - approx. $3\n\n4) glass of house merlot ($7) and glass of red diamond cabernet ($10)\n\nboth burgers were amazing.  they nailed medium rare on both.  we split them in half and shared.  we savored every bite.  we couldn't really decide which we liked better.  the flavor on the chef's favorite might've won by a hair, but the texture on the build-your-own was much nicer than the texture on the other (the crisp bacon, al dente asparagus and earthy, slightly chewy oyster mushrooms were all a nice contrast to the tender burger and soft bun; the chef's favorite was pretty much all soft, melt-in-your-mouth-no-teeth-necessary kind of mouthfeel.)\n\nfries were good; not too greasy, not too salty.  we rarely ever finish an order of fries, but we ate all of these and dipped some in our burger sauces!\n\nhouse merlot was fabulous minus (boring, a bit watery, not fruity like a merlot should be.)  red diamond cab was much better.  it's a $10-11 solid table wine you can find at sam's club.  would've liked to see a little bit bigger selection on the wine list (there were only about 4 reds by the glass and 6-7 total.)  but i guess they want you to drink beer (extensive beer list by country.)\n\nservice was hit-and-miss with server forgetting about us twice for a long time.  also, right after we sat down, she came by to take our order; we asked for a couple minutes, and when she returned she brought us a check.  she had already set it on the table and started to move on before she realized she had the wrong table.  that was a precursor on the service.  it wasn't horrible, it was just thoughtless.  either she was distracted or tired or somewhat indifferent to her job (not sure which.)\n\nambience was also a disappointment.  i would've expected something unique or inventive.  nada.  take away the menu and the food and i could've been in any average burger place anywhere.  no hint i was in a top-tier chef's restaurant at mandalay bay.  kinda noisy; too many little kids and crying babies for my thinking (we had a 10:30 pm dinner.)\n\nbut for me, food is king, and the food was grand.  we were pleasantly surprised by the bill; under $65 before gratuity.  it was yummy enough that i actually thought, \"i could come back here again...tomorrow.\"", 
            "i got a <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> patty.  i wasn't blown away.  nonetheless, the meat had a good flavor - juicy, wholesome.  it didn't taste old or cheap or even worse, it didn't have a cow smell/taste which i've experienced at other gourmet burger places.",

            "burger bar has a great name.  who doesn't enjoy a good beer to go along with a good burger?  they have the variety of toppings and selection of beer to deserve their name.  yet i don't think their food deserves their prices.\n\ni had the kobe burger and topped it with japaleno bacon, carmelized onions, and got their black truffle sauce on the side.  with the price of my burger now above $20, i expected heaven on an onion bun.  when the food was brought out, my heart sank.  \n\none of my burger pet peeves is when the bun is bigger than the patty.  if i'm paying this much for a burger, it's disappointing when 25% of the burger was all bun and no meat.  perhaps the cost and size is offset by the quality of the beef?  after all, the menu states, \"this <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> from snake river melts in your mouth, tender with an unmatched flavor, the most expensive beef in the world for the most discriminating palate.\"  \n\nunfortunately i agree with only half of that.  it was a very tender burger; they're not too far off by saying it melts in your mouth.  but unmatched flavor?  when i was asked how the burger tasted, my only reply was, \"it's really tender.\"  sadly, the unmatched flavor was nowhere to be found.  i didn't use the truffle sauce at all for the first half; after that i was pouring that sauce all over in an effort to give the burger flavor.\n\nin the end i'm suspecting that is was an off day, since many people have enjoyed the kobe burger during their visits.  but based on this first experience, i can't see myself coming back anytime soon.",

            "not going to lie, i was a little tempted to order this $60 rossini burger that was on the menu just to say that i've had it. unfortunately, it sounded too heavy before a night out on the town and drinking, so i opted out.\n\nthis is located in the strip mall at mandalay bay. i've walked by several times, but had never been in. while you're waiting, they have a free photobooth outside to take some photos. you can either social media tag them or e-mail to yourself. cool little perk and makes the time go by faster before you're seated. i'm sure there are some great photos as the drunks come rolling through.\n\na full bar is available and they have a ton of beers to choose from and there are various televisions on different sporting events if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nwhat i tried:\ni created my own burger with the australian <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> with a ciabatta bun, spinach, swiss, fried egg, tomato, and chipotle aioli. this was served with skinny fries that were thin and crispy, just the way i like 'em. the burger itself wasn't everything that i had hoped for. as you know, i feel like i suck when it comes to building my own masterpieces, so i usually opt out. i should have stuck to my own habits and done so again.\n\ni don't think that the spinach necessarily worked on the burger. it was saut\\u00e9ed but really watery making the rest of the burger super moist. i order the meat cooked medium and the combo of spinach and medium meat juices didn't really blend well. to be perfectly honest, i couldn't tell that the beef was that much better than the normal patties that my friends had in their sliders. next time i will opt for the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> and save myself $8. but at least i can say that i tried it.\n\ni snuck some onion rings off of my friend's plate. they were pretty damn delicious. the onion was sweet inside and the outside was crispy and airy. they stayed crispy throughout the whole meal and i was tempted to order a second round. i was too stuffed, and that weird burger combo kinda gave me a stomach ache. again, not their fault, i chose the flavors.\n\nservice was good and everything came out fast. our server was patient with some of my drunk table mates- i'm sure they get a lot of the crazy banter all the time.\n\ni wish i would have tried one of their desserts. they have a good variety of shakes (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and something called a chocolate burger.\n\ni would come back and try one of their other burgers and will sub for a side of onion rings. this place is more expensive than a typical restaurant, but it's expected since it's inside a hotel on the strip. live a little.",

(i know, right?!) then i got the skinny fries.  the waitress suggested the truffle mayo. i will not suggest it, i demand that if you go here, you get it!  omg, i could've eaten that with a spoon. ok, ok....you get the point. i also had a, build my own \"alcoholic\" shake. the guy that owns this place is a genius! chocolate ice cream, bananas, peanut butter sauce, frangelica, malibu banana. what the \"f\"!??!!  they had their own little room in the middle of the restaurant just for building ice cream. i will be going back tomorrow for lunch.",

            "unlike most of the places i review on this blog, burger bar is a place i can write a review on based strictly on memory. still, given the opportunity a few days ago to stop in there for lunch i didn't hesitate. besides, i didn't have any quality pictures to post until that point.  because i've been here so many times i was almost nervous that i would give this restaurant preferential treatment, but since i've been taking a way more analytical approach to my burgers lately i found that burger bar wasn't quite the perfection i remembered it.  but it was still close.\n\nlocated in the elusive mandalay place shopping area connecting mandalay bay and the luxor, burger bar is placed amongst overly expensive clothing stores, men's shaving boutiques and some other more touristy shops of late. the restaurant has been there for quite a few years now and is maybe looking slightly dated, but it's still a good atmosphere. it's very open pretty much anywhere you sit, even in the booths, so don't go there if you're looking for a decent amount of privacy. also if you're going on the weekend, or even potentially during a weekday lunch, expect a wait or try the bar.\n\nother than a small selection of slightly overpriced burgers, the menu is pretty much do-it-yourself. you have your choice of meats; angus, <mark>Country Natural</mark>, kobe and buffalo, along with chicken, salmon turkey and veggie if you're into that sort of thing. while the kobe is totally delicious, i find it to be a bit expensive and have been completely happy ordering the angus. but more on that shortly. once you've chosen your meats, you have a very long list of choices for veggies, cheeses, meats, sauces and plenty of other fancy things. i've had quite a few different burgers over the years, and all of the toppings have been great.\n\nfor this particular meal i went with the angus, swiss cheese, and mushrooms on a sesame bun. fairly simple, but that's fine because the meat always stands out as a great flavor on its own. one of the biggest things i can say about this restaurant is that however you order your burger it will always come out that way. consistency is key, and they never disappoint. i ordered medium-rare, and it's as pink as it could be. and like i said, the meat really has great flavor, so whether you have a ton of toppings or almost none, you're guaranteed a great burger. after eating a lot of others around town lately, i could say that this burger might be lacking a bit of seasoning now, almost as if the burger is outdated like the restaurant. still it is fantastic and won't disappoint.\n\nthe various buns i have had are always good, no matter which one you get there seems to be a proper meat to bun ratio. the mushrooms were flavorful, and just the right amount. my cheese was melted as always, the lettuce and tomato on the plate were also very fresh. i haven't always been a fan of pickles in the past, but they're growing on me with all these burger meals so now it's a welcome sight on my plate.\n\nthe fries are the one slight weak spot in this meal; my skinny fries were just ok, a bit too generic for such a fancy menu. the sweet potato fries have been really good in the past, especially with some ranch, although it's been a while since i've had them. i'm not always a fan of fat fries, but they're a little better here so you might want to try them when visiting.\n\nmy burger, fries and drink came to almost $19; i would consider that a bit on the high side if it wasn't in a very touristy spot on the strip. i'm not always too happy about spending that much on a burger meal anywhere, but compared to bradley ogden or even blt this is a huge value for the same price. this place is still one of my favorite choices in town based on the burger alone, so do yourself a favor and check it out."

            "this is another of those places run by a celeb chef jumping into the burger craze that has hit everyone on this planet.  tried the <mark>American Classic</mark>, peppercorn, fries and the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.  the burgers were okay.  they did come at the desired temperature but its not like the pate was anything special.  the peppercorn burger in fact has too find a grind on the pepper resulting almost a dusty tasting burger.  the bun these come in was quite good, but not good enough to make me succumb to eating it.  the fries were excellent, crunchy outside and light and fluffy inside.  the surprise was the salad, which was excellent.  this looked like hand torn leaves definitely a house made dressing with the perfect touch of creaminess with the gentlest hint of anchovy in the back, just delicious.\n\nvery pricey, but hey if you are going to gamble on a burger, where else would you do it but vegas!", 
            "solid burgers, but not sure if it's worth the price. i got the <mark>American Classic</mark> burger. the bun was nice and soft and the bacon was crisp. wish the cheese was a bit more melted. i ordered it medium, but it came out to be more like medium well as it was not very pink in the middle. i was pretty disappointed in the somewhat limp fries. they should come out more crisp. as a caloric  indulgence, i also got the black & white milkshake. for $8, i really wish that there was more milk shake and less whipped cream! the glass is also very tall, skinny, and deceiving. you think you get a lot of milkshake, but you really don't. and there's no stainless steel cup with the overflow. sad face.", 
            "the epitome of \"meh\". we sat at the bar, and waited quite a long time for our burgers to come out. when they did finally arrive, my <mark>American Classic</mark> burger was just ok. kind of dry. it wasn't horrible (i've had much worse), but there was absolutely nothing notable about it. the truffle mayo side i ordered didn't taste like much else but mayo. the skinny fries were crispy, which i appreciated, but i wasn't wowed by what i expected to be a juicy mouth-watering hamburger.\ni could have had fuddruckers for half the price.", 
            "burger bar was just meh... especially for the price! the four of us got lucky, and ended up finding spots at the bar, or else the wait was over an hour long (ridiculous!) my friends, who are lovers of foie gras, were excited to try the kobe burger with seared foie gras (which is now banned in ca). this burger was an expensive $60, and my friends were really disappointed by the taste. the foie gras pieces were small and not of good quality. good thing i opted out of the foie gras burger! i ended up just getting the <mark>American Classic</mark>, which was not any better. nothing super great about it, meat was whatevers, and the burger actually came out a lil cold. it did not taste like \"right off the grill\" temperature. would not spend the money or come back!",

            "yum yum and more yum. we ate here last year and it was great so thought we'd try it again this year and definitely not disappointed. i had the vegan veggie burger (i'm not even a vegan) which was grilled eggplant, capsicum (i think you call them red peppers here) zucchini, on a mushroom cap bun (no bread) and it was delicious and super filling!! my partner had the all <mark>American Classic</mark> which he loved as well. \nthe service was fabulous despite being packed and even allowed me to change my skinny fries to sweet potato fries a few minutes after i ordered without a hiccup. they had a great service where instead of just waiting they just messaged us when our table was free and we were seated 2 minutes after we put our names down. \nwill we come back here? definitely!!",

            "the <mark>American Classic</mark> was really flavorful! \n\nwe decided to split the burger because we were eating a late lunch and didn't want to be too full come dinner time. the burger was smaller than i imagined a $15 burger would be, but paired with the fries, it was the perfect amount of food to split if you're trying to go \"light\" for lunch or dinner. \n\nour waitress was super helpful and had the burger cut for us and kept it on one plate rather than charging us the $2 \"splitting\" charge.  the sweet potato fries were fabulous! added bonus: $6 draught beer! way cheaper than the $13 beers at all the hotels.  would definitely go back!", 
            "so i can honestly say i had a better burger at carl jr's.  \nmy friend got the bison burger and i had the <mark>American Classic</mark>. my burger was so sloppy it was falling apart before the waiter had it at my table.  i guess for it being an upscale slightly pricey burger place i expected my burger to be fully assembled and not lackluster in taste.  my friends bison burger was so much better than mine,but both of our fries came out cold.  the server dropped the food but we did not see him again until he asked if we wanted refills and left the check.  \nsave your money, this place is overrated",

            "first off, i'm a huge fan of hubert keller's tv show and had to visit las vegas to dine at his restaurants. although his other restaurant fleur (located in the same building downstairs) was somewhat disappointing, the burger bar served the best burgers i have ever eaten. i ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> the first time, and it was delicious. the sweet <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> sauce that came with it was perfect, and the medium rare buffalo patty was cooked to retain the optimal moistness. my dad let me try a bite of his <mark>American Classic</mark>, also medium rare, and it tasted even better than my burger! i loved this restaurant so much i came here for lunch again days later. unfortunately, i did not have as great of an experience. i ordered the <mark>American Classic</mark>, and also i still call for it to be medium rare, it was much dryer than before. i asked for <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> instead of raw onions, but they still gave me raw. i called sweet potato fries both times, but they were less crunchy the second time. the service also felt less attentive than it had during the preceding visit. with that said, the burger bar still remains my favorite burger place, and i would definitely return on my next visit to las vegas.", 
            "the best turkey burger i have ever eaten. i recommend requesting to sit in erin's area... she is an amazing waitress. never had to ask for one thing... very nice and attentive. my mother had the <mark>American Classic</mark> hamburger and she ate the entire burger along with fries and a vanilla milkshake... that tells me that she truly enjoyed her meal. kudos to the professional chef for creating an amazing restaurant that you can sit and actually enjoy your meal and get your money's worth. will definitely come again."

            "all i can say is wow wow wow. number one the selection and quality of the burgers was absolutly amazing. number two the selection of beer was huge. they carried beers ive never seen at restaurants before. the waitress was extremely nice and kinda reminded me of michael jackson which made the experience even more enjoyable. but seriously this place is a must. i had the <mark>Black Jack Burger</mark> and mmmmm. the only downside is that the place is so nice and enjoyable you kind of wish it was fancier. i'm serious try this place an you might have to come back multiple times on your trip.",

            "hands down, best burger i have ever eaten. before even entering mandalay bay, i was telling myself to critically rate this restaurant for every minute detail. working from a fast food burger joint (in-n-out burger), i've had my plentiful shares of burgers from all sorts of places and arriving at one of my favorite chef's resto, hubert keller, i was pleasantly impressed\n\naccompanied by the 2 most trustworthy women in my life, we busted a \"lord of the ring's\" journey to get here. from the manadalay bay entrance, the burger bar is far... once arrived at this eatery, i noticed the settings is quite dim and social. there was a bar ofcourse but there were also booths and tables. great take on a mix between a \"fine brewery\". the place \"looked\" packed and we had to wait for a good 15 min. for a booth but there were already a couple of empty booths so i didn't understand the point of waiting... our server was nice at first but like a oddly new friend that you meet who suddenly opens up the next day, you see their real side and you don't like it. she was serving us like a quick asian at an oriental restaurant. didn't really care for hospitality, but got our orders right. she was also pregnant so maybe it was a mood swing that we ended up seeing?... i dunno. anyways, onto what we ordered:\n\nmarinated chicken breast burger w/ swiss cheese on a whole wheat bun - great chicken taste, nice and tender and the slice was not too big to overwhelm the swiss cheese or the bun. the cheese even had holes in it! the bun to compliment was great as well. fluffy and a discerning wheat taste. these guys weren't playing around with the choices of ingredients.\n\n<mark>Black Jack Burger</mark> on a ciabatta - a thick beefy behemoth with thick italian square buns. it wasn't accompanied with any cheese (cuz my girl didn't ask for any) but the taste was still apparent. medium well, moist ground up beef which was well seasoned and full of flavor. i really wished there was some sauce to accompany it but for a mere bread, meat, and veg combo, it still tasted out of the ordinary. \n\n<mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> on an onion bun - as a lover for steak and lobster, this burger was right up my alley. think of a cheesecake with a graham cracker crust topped with thick full whip cream... but savorized! the asparagus was buttered with the texture of a moist graham cracker, my medium rare black angus didn't seem as big as the <mark>Black Jack Burger</mark>'s but the texture was pure butta (that thing couldn't keep together on a fork). the lobster was perfectly cooked, tender for a lean meat, and complimented the steak and asparagus texturely, perfectly! i was kind of worried the server didn't ask me if i wanted cheese on it, but honestly you don't need any. just another flavor to get in the way of the stars of the show. on the down side, from how moist everything was, it made the bottom bun really soggy. nevertheless, the onion bun had an onion taste that you could not miss (which was great!) \n\nthe lettuce, onions, and tomatoes on the side of these burgers were fresh and crisp. it could've been a side salad all together. plus the pickle garnish had nice suttle taste, not overwhelming like your at home jar pickles, but almost like a cucumber palate cleanser.\n\ntyping about side salads, i had one as one of my sides. it wasn't all that great, but with drenched olive oil for a dressing , it did have a good enough taste to finish. the other sides we had were fat fries and sweet potato fries. fat fries were crispy and thick, which i thought tasted way better than the flimsy sweet potato fries. about sweet potato fries, they are popping up everywhere now, sadly these aren't the best i had.\n\nservice was slow, food was tasty and fast, and the price was reasonable. everything came up to be a good 60 bux plus tip, quality = price tonight. fyi: each booth had a mini tv on the side playing some type of sport. that's just overkill with the whole bar meets fine dining theme, but hey it sells! it was a great experience for all 3 of us and i would definitely come here again. portion size is just right for a hungry person, and the taste is incomparable.", 
            "i had been dying to try this place out since my arrival in vegas, and finally on our last day there we did and i am so happy that i didn't leave without trying it because it would have been a shame. \n\nthe burgers here are topnotch and made with really good quality meat. you can have your burger cooked however you want it, and you have the options of making your own burger or choosing one of the house specialty burgers. i choose the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> which is buffalo meat topped with blue cheese, baby spinach and <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, my friend had the pepper <mark>Black Jack Burger</mark> which was <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> topped with pepper jack cheese and tapenade. she had the zucchini fries as a side and i chose the sweet potato fries. \n\nthe burgers were both tasty. the meat was juicy and flavorful. every bite of my burger was pure deliciousness. my friends zucchini fries were superb, and my sweet potato fries were crispy and just perfect. it was my first time trying buffalo and it was really good and not gamey at all, and i think i actually prefer it to beef burgers. \n\nwe also shared a milkshake which we customized. we chose chocolate ice cream, fresh banana, cookie dough and vanilla whipped cream. it was soo rich and good! \n\nto top it all off, the service was attentive, friendly and fast. our waitress was super nice and we felt well taken care of.", 
            "not good! milkshake was awesome, burger was worst thing ever.\n\ni had the <mark>Black Jack Burger</mark> on ciabatta. it was somewhere in the $15 range. i know this is vegas but i figure a $15 burger would be comparable to red robin. maybe it was just the particular burger i ordered.\n\nthis burger was dry, the ciabatta roll was beyond dry. the burger disseminated itself, i had way too much roll and not enough meat. the meat (ordered medium well) looked suspiciously like my partners' medium rare. it was too pink for me. the meat itself wasn't seasoned (which is fine, i guess if you like that) and seasoning wasn't available outside of ketchup and mustard. \n\nthe fat fries were good, but they probably came from a bag so i won't spend any time on that. the milkshake was great. but was it good enough that i would go there just for that? no. would i try any of their other food again? no. was i wowed by customer service? no. \n\nwhen our check arrived, our waitress asked how the food was. we said bad. she didn't believe us(!!!) and then asked why we didn't say something sooner. okay, it was our fault. it wasn't your problem to fix. it wasn't our assumption that the food you brought us was your best. what would you have done to fix it? so we payed full price for a meal we ate about half of. do not waste your time, energy or money on this wasteland. you're in vegas, there's too much good food to be wasting time in pits like this.",

            "in all honesty, this place is overrated. my favorite burger of all time is the office burger at father's office, so i am compare all burgers to that. \n\ni ordered the hubert kueller burger which consists of blue cheese, buffalo meat, and <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>. the blue cheese overpowered the meat, which itself lacked in flavor. my friend ordered the <mark>Black Jack Burger</mark> and he also said the meat (he had beef) was lacking in flavor. \n\ncombine the fact that the burger costs $20 and tasted eh, i don't recommend eating here.", 
            "second only to in and out, hubert keller's burger bar is a top burger joint.  ive been there twice and have tasted four different creations of burger and they are all delicious.  i love how many different toppings you can choose, and they are all high quality ingredients.  you can go from really fancy (truffles, lobsters, <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>) or just plain ol american.  either way, it can form to any wallet.  if you dont want to choose your own ingredients they have pre-selected top burgers, the <mark>Black Jack Burger</mark> was really good.  i thought the skinney fries were too overdone, but the sweet potato fries were good.  this time around we tried a milkshake, the black and white one.  omg milkshakegasm.  delicious, creamy, chuncks of cookie dough and homemade chocolate whipped cream.  if that isnt you thing, i hear burger bar has the largest selection of beers on tap on the whole strip.   the french man created the best over the top burger joint- good eats with a healthy dash of vegas flash.", 
            "the fries were fabulous, but the main attraction, the burger, was just okay. i ordered the <mark>Black Jack Burger</mark> with <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> cooked medium, pepper jack, an olive tapenade, and ciabatta roll. the beef could have used a little more salt as it was lacking flavor. the burger was expertly cooked, however. the vegas strip tourist pricing coupled with the lackluster burger will probably keep me from coming back.",

            "i just ate the most expensive but the best burger ever in my life. $60 burger sounds crazy but it is totally worth it. you can taste each layer of ingredient of the burger. foie gras, truffle, <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> are the best combination for burger. fried zucchini and sweet potato fries are really good. my wife had <mark>Black Jack Burger</mark> and it's very good.  highly recommended.",

            "it took me forever to get a table (about 35 minutes for two at 2 pm...but it was memorial day weekend)..however...this...place...is.....awesome!!! they got a great beer selection at decent pricing. the service was good..but more importantly..damn those are good burgers...i ordered a <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger on a sesame bun with pepper jack cheese, carmelized onions, avacado and prosciutto. and it was delicious-ness. my girlfriend's burger with jalapeno bacon was quite good too...it was hard to make decisions without offsetting flavors but with options like red wine reduction sauces, truffles, foie gras on your burger...wow..awesome-ness...even lobster...but i decided not to go there just because it didn't sound too tasty on a burger. \n\n  anyway my burger and fries was about $25 by itself..yes definitely the most expensive burger i've ever ordered...but it was damn good..<mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> bar has possibly become a new must-eat at place for my next las vegas visit (which knowing me will be within the next 3 months).\n\n~g", 
            "offering a sizable length of rope is a dangerous thing, especially when a high percentage of your clientele will hang themselves with it. at burger bar, the rope is a massive number of options for each and every component of your burger. that's thousands of burger permutations, many of which are truly awful. \n\nvegas is great for people watching <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> bar is great for burger watching: take note as lance from des moines constructs his demon spawn burger and then complains about the resulting assault on his palette. \n\nyou'll also notice those deer-in-the-headlights expressions when patrons first get a look at the number of menu offerings. the burger bar staff will not jump-in with recommendations. do not be surprised by this. they don't eat there. it is just not possible. they're all amazing fit. \n\nanyway, 5 stars for this combo:\n*  1/2 pound <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, medium rare\n* whole wheat bun\n* saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms\n* <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>\n* blue cheese\n\nthe burger bar beer menu is huge with many beers on tap, so pair your burger with a cold one and some thick cut fries.", 
            "i read about burger bar in a magazine and had to try it. while i wasn't let down, i wasn't pleasantly surprised by this place either. yes, they do a great job elevating burgers to another level of creativity and taste, but their prices are kind of ridiculous. for two people i think our check was close to $100 without drinking alcohol. sure we didn't need to order the <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>, but it's still just a sandwich. is is a sandwich really ever worth that much even with bells and whistles? this really is a glamourized sports bar in a mall. the tvs do nothing for the atmosphere. i would go back, but only if someone else was paying.", 
            "i just got back from vegas with my bf <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> bar was highly recommended by a friend of ours. i dont get everyones reviews here about the prices being so high. where are these people from that eating dinner for $10-16 is alot? we are from nyc and you cant get a decent burger here for under $15. even at a crappy applebees or chili's youre paying that for a burger and its dried out, overcooked and not customized. there was a 45 mintue wait to get in for lunch, but it was completely worth it. i love that you can customize not only your burger but your drinks. i had a cherry limeade and my bf had a strawberry one. both were fantastic with fresh fruit in them as garnish. also loved the buffalo seasoned skinny fries with bleu cheese dip. not to mention the chocolate dessert burger! omg. its a split donut with chocolate ganash and strawberries in it. also delicious and so creative. i even took a pic of it. lol. staff was courteous and attentive. my only problem with burger bar is that time did not allow for us to return there before we left las vegas. def next time though. please do not miss this restaurant!!", 
            "burger bar is located between the walkway of luxor and mandalay bay at mandalay place.  we went there around 830ish and were told to wait for half an hour.  we walked around, gambled a little bit and came back in about 20 minutes, they called a few names but no one showed up so we were able to get a seat pretty quick.\n\ni am a burger fan <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> bar really hits the spot when you are craving for one.  the menu offers some already constructed burgers, but the fun part is the ability to \"build your own burger.\"  whether it's fancy <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger with fois gras and truffles for about $60 or a black angus burger for $10, it is satisfying that the big burger you order will be cooked to perfection with the toppings you want.  i ordered a burger with jalapeno bacon, portabello mushrooms and pepper jack cheese on an onion bun, it was delicious.  \n\nthe burger doesn't come with fries so we ordered onion rings, fat fries, and shoestring buffalo fries for an addtional cost.  they were alright, i would prefer some seasoning on my fries and they were a little dry.  i've had better.\n\noverall i liked the atmosphere and the convenience of the place since we stayed at mandalay bay.  i would definitely come back and build another burger.", 
            "sometimes i just crave a juicy burger <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> bar definitely delivered. there was a long wait so we sat at the bar. i tried the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger with a side of sweet potato fries. i looove sweet potato fries! nice selection of beers as well.", 
            "i was walking around with a friend of mine after buying drinks at another place. we weren't really craving anything in particular, but this place was packed and it looked like a good idea to check it out. i like the idea of the place, you can basically customize your burger as you like it all the way down to the type of fries/sides that you want. \n\nif you want to avoid the wait, you can opt to sit at the bar (which is what we did). there was a flirtatious bartender serving us. she was totally flirting with two hefty guys in their 40s. they so wanted her, it was hilarious watching them drool over her. she wore a tight tank top that showed off her tattoo on the small of her back, total bait for the guys. \n\nservice for the food is pretty quick as are the drinks. the bartenders are pretty knowledgeable with the drinks too so they can answer your questions if you have any. you can also get a sample if you would like, which is nice. and if you want to flirt, there are plenty of bartenders to flirt with. tvs are also behind the bar, offering various sporting events. \n\nso overall, it's a pretty chill place to go to. fairly cheap food <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> the way you want it. worth trying out and fun can be had by all!", 
            "after checking out the bodies exhibit at the luxor, my man and i decided to have dinner at this place..\n\nit was such a fun experience to pick out and create our own burgers! i had the sweet potato fries with mine, which rocked. the service <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> were pretty good, and it was a unique experience, but it didn't blow me out of the water quite like i had expected.. \n\n4 out of 5 :)", 
            "this place is amazing!  being an avid burger and beer enthusiast i only expected perfection <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> bar didn't let me down.  room was packed and i opted to sit at the bar.  great decision!  they have a huge selection of beers from around the globe, especially belgium.  now, i thought my knowledge of savory ales was above average til meeting there veteran bartender dino.  a good looking, knowledgeable mixoligist with a charming whit and a skill to play off the energy of everyone at the bar.  dino took me on a tour of beers explaining what i was experiencing and what characteristics i was enjoyed, even helped me pair the perfect beer to accompany the perfect burger.  i was guided towards there \nbuffalo burger cooked a true med-rare with blue cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> on an onion roll.  my mouth waters upon thinking of this experience.  here it is, if you like to have fun, enjoy great cuisine, and drink some amazing beers, then don't leave vegas without visiting burger bar.  tell dino i said hello!", 
            "burger bar is definitely a vegas must....it was a bit difficult to find but that may be due to my gender and our proclivity of not wanting to ask for directions. \n\ni have been here twice, the first time was quite a good experience, wait staff was on their game and very attentive. i had the angus on wheat with swiss, jalapeno bacon and a fried egg. very good burger, although the patty did lack some seasoning but that may just be a personal gripe as i opt for seasoned meat over a plethora of toppings. do watch out for the first bite when getting the fried egg, lets just say it was closer to sunny side up than over medium. \n\nmy second time at the bb i was a bit displeased with the overall experience. the hostesses were rude and there were 3 of them standing doing nothing at a podium made for one person. the only thing worse than the attitude was the fact that the wait was about an hour but i can deal with the wait, its vegas and there is always something to do while you are waiting. on to the food, i mistakenly ordered the slider sampler thinking that i could get a taste of the buffalo and kobe burgers without having to order the entire burger. what i got was 3 small tasteless burgers that were on the slightly overcooked side. least i had some sweet potato fries to help calm the hunger pangs. \n\nall in all if you like options and you like creativity you need to check this place out but be prepared to shell out an extra few bucks if you want to go all out. i have yet to try to the <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>...waiting to hit the progressive jackpot before shelling out the 30 bucks or so it is for that one.", 
            "after a couple of buffets, our plans of a \"nice\" dinner were slowly dwindling away, so in the late afternoon/early evening on our last night in town, while the rest of the guys were breaking in my friends ps3 that they just gave him, i hopped on my friend's computer and checked out places that we could possibly go. a dinner at a high end fancy restaurant would have had slim chances since it would have been such last minute, plus i was getting the feeling the guys wanted a chill dinner. trying to compromise, i hit the \"$\" and \"$$\" signs in my search.\n\none of the things that popped up was this place.  personally for me, i absolutely love burgers, so i know i would have loved it.  and while it's no fleur de lys, i thought \"how can you go wrong with a restaurant by hubert keller?\"\n\ni skimmed a couple of reviews and made the suggestion to the guys.  they all seemed to like the idea. the listing said they take reservations, however i believe the listing is wrong on that because when i called, the hostess said they did not take reservations, but would happily put our name down when we were going to head in.  it was still a little early, so i called back about 30 minutes later to put my name in, however we took a little long getting over to mandalay bay from the wynn, and they had apparently already called my name.\n\nnot to worry, she bumped us back up, gave me a buzzer, and said it would still be about 20 minutes since we did have a party of 11.\n\nwe finally sat down and overall, the d\\u00e9cor and ambience of this places feels like daily grill meets a sports bar.  the booths on the right were had dark wood high backs, yet while the dark wood bar still resembled something out of a western movie saloon, they had several televisions all along the back wall.  it was fully stocked as well.  they took a page from barney's beanery and each booth had it's own television.  down the middle were a series of tables and our table was set up near the back, closet to the kitchen.\n\nour server renee, was really cool and cute too.  she looked a little bit like a cheerleader right out of high school, with her hair in pigtails and her bright yet borderline smile, she was actually really nice and took good care of us.  and no, i don't mean in \"that\" way.  pervs....\n\nthe menu is simple: burgers <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>.  on the left, they had some preset burgers, which i'm sure were meticulously decided upon by chef keller.  there was one burger called the \"rossini burger\" and it was a burger consisting of <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, seared foie gras, and black truffles.  while it sounded awesome, i was not ready to fork up $60 for a burger.  i was almost going to suggest we get that as a table and split the cost.  but to no avail.\n\nthe other side of the menu consists of building your own burger.  the concept is not new with places like the counter, 5 guys burgers and fries, and a few other places, but hubert keller included the typical add ons such as avocado, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, aioli, and various cheeses, but he brings in a variety of gourmet items such as foie gras ($12), black truffles ($30 for 1/3 oz), portobello mushrooms, and sauces such as a red wine and shallot reduction.\n\nyou start with your meat.  you have a choice of chuck, angus, american kobe, buffalo and turkey.  the basic burger will run about $9-11 or $17 for the kobe and is topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and a pickle wedge.  then there are the add-ons.  everything were of various prices, but quite reasonable and expected.  cheeses were $.70, condiments ranged from $1 to $1.50, an avocado was about $2.50?  in all, you had a choice of i would say at least 2 dozen items.  of course the gourmet items (as listed above) were more expensive.\n\ni got the angus with both monterey jack and provolone cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, aioli (should've gotten the chipotle aioli) and proscuitto.  you have a choice of plain, sesame, wheat, or ciabatta (i think there was one more?) as your bun.  i decided to just play it safe and go with a plain bun.\n\nmost of the reviews i had read and raved about the sweet potato fries, and for $2.85, you can order an individual portion as your side.\n\nour food came out and the burger looked and smelled delicious.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cni2l-vkg_pdospj6xlixq?select=jfesknrcardv3qriayq_oa\n\ni couldn't really tell between my 2 cheeses, but oh well.  the meat was well seasoned and while it wasn't a perfect combination of flavors, i really liked all of my toppings.  the sweet potato fries were nice and crispy but not overcooked, so i really liked that.\n\noverall, i think everybody liked it.  i've heard small things here and there that they didn't like, but i consider it a successful meal.  they apparently also have build your own milkshakes, but i think that would have absolutely sent me over the top.\n\ni definitely know where i'm coming to get a good burger next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "killer burger!!  what can you say about keller? he really knows how to create a burger! i ate the surf & <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>. its black angus, grilled half lobster, grilled <mark>Green Asparagus</mark> on plain bun. i paired my meal with lost coast tangerine wheat beer.  good times!", 
            "ok, just love the burger bar.  its a fancy/expensive burger joint, but the food and atmosphere are awesome.  see you start with the standard burger and then can add any type of topping you can think of.  fried eggs, avocado, lobster.  anything goes.  they also have preset exotic burgers done.  i had the surf & <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>, nothing like a huge meat patty topped with lobster tails.   just fantastic.  even their standard burger is good.  they also have a huge selection of draft beers here.  and the best part is the little lcd tv's that are in each both.  gotta love that extra special touch.", 
            "i actually liked the sports bar atmosphere of this place  great place to watch your football wagers win while filling up.  also love the beer selection(chimay and fat tire on tap).  tried the <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> with bacon.  burger was good, maybe a little underseasoned.  lobster was a tad bit over cooked.  wish it were grilled instead of steamed bun was good.  the kicker on this burger was asparagus.  surprisingly good!  overall the burger was a bit dry, could have benefitted from some sort of sauce.  this place cooks its burgers to steak temps which maybe a little rare for a lot of people.  the fries were the most disappointing part of the meal.  the skinny fries came with my meal.  they tasted very generic.  they were the type that has that crispy coating(potato flour i think)  but they were uninspired for a a burger joint.  thought in/n/out's fries blew these away.  not too expensive for a celebrity chef joint.", 
            "a friend of mine suggested this place. i have to say i enjoyed it very much. i ordered the surf & <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> which had lobster. lobster was a little tough and some garlic butter would have been nice. the patty itself was great. nice and juicy. bun was fresh. the fries were awesome. i'm a huge fan of french fries and i have to rank burger bar's as one of the best. service was good. they took our order quickly but they did not rush us. next vegas trip i am definitely going back.", 
            "i was really worried i gotta admit from some of the review but i came here anyway today and had the rossini $60 burger.\n\ni can tell you it's a combination of greasy, fatty flavors that i've never had before.  you have to salt it and add black crushed peppercorns and the sauce they give you and i promise you it is the most extravagent burger (if you can even call it that at this point) you'll ever have.  my wife had the surf & <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> with lobster and asparagus...a-m-a-z-i-n-g.\n\nnow that's it's over it all was totally worth the bill.  don't buy this stuff if your strapped for cash...it's skews your opinion too much.  come and eat this if the prices don't scare you and you'll think it's the best lunch you've ever had.  period.", 
            "i have been to a lot of these new fancy burger places and this place stands out as being the most expensive and the worst to boot.  it wasn't that tasty and was way expensive, we spent 70 bucks pre tip on 2 burgers, one soda, one beer, and one split fried zuccinni.  granted i got a <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>, it was a burger with half a lobster tale on it but it still would have been like 60 if i got a regular burger.  plus the lobster was so overcooked you couldn't bite it with the burger, it sounds way better than it was.   both burgers we had were under seasoned and nothing special, which sucks for 20 something a piece and they are served a la cart with no fries.", 
            "it's not really fair to compare the burger bar to other burger places. only on the strip in vegas can you blow $25 on a burger and not really care. it's actually a good value, considering that's only 1 hand of black jack for most people. i guarantee you'll enjoy this burger way more than that one hand of black jack. \n\nthe burger bar is celebrity chef, hubert keller's creation. he has a few of his own burger combinations on the menu, or you can build your own from extensive options. i actually wish that hubert keller would have more of his own burgers on there. there are only like 6 listed on the menu. i like creating my own, but hey you are the famous chef, dazzle me. \n\ni've been there a couple of times, so i can report on a few different burgers. i highly recommend the surf 'n <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>. i'm not sure it says on the menu, but i think all the burgers are 1/2 lb. they are nice and thick. the surf 'n turf is <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, topped with a 1/2 grilled lobster tail, and grilled asparagus on a plain bun. because i believe all burgers should come with cheese, i had them add provolone to it. now pay attention to this next part, because i believe i have improved on hubert keller's creation. order some pesto and mayo on the side. mix it together and use this as a sauce. yum, you'll never have a burger like that anywhere else. \n\nyou can choose different types of meat for your burger. after trying a kobe burger on this last visit, from now on that's the only way i will go. it's about $7 more for a <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger than the black angus, but it's so juicy that it melts in your mouth. the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> is actually american kobe, so it's not crazy expensive like the real japanese kobe. american kobe is a hybrid between black angus and japanese wagyu beef. it has the highest marbling of any beef in the united states, and is as fine as you can get without importing actual japanese wagyu beef. you also get to pick from 5 different buns and about 45 different toppings. toppings are as plain as american cheese and are as fancy as pan-seared foie gras. \n\njust so i could try 2 burgers on this last visit, i cut them in half and shared them with my brother. burger number 1 was a do it yourself kobe burger. we agreed on provolone cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, sauteed oyster mushrooms, on an onion roll. had the burger medium rare. the result was such a juicy burger that you didn't need any mayo, ketchup, or any other sauce. just the natural juices of the burger with the toppings was perfection. \n\nburger number 2 was new on the menu since the last time i ate there. it's called the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>. the menu says it's his favorite. it's a buffalo burger with blue cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, sauteed baby spinach, aoli, on a ciabatta bun. i think the buffalo had the least amount of fat of all their burgers, as such i found it wasn't as juicy. i was expecting it to maybe have some different kind of flavor, but it didn't. it could have just been lean ground beef. it's also the same price as the kobe, so unless you are trying to be healthy, go with the kobe. the blue cheese was kind of medium, which wasn't a bad thing. a very strong blue would have over powered everything. of the 3 i've had so far, it was my least favorite, but still good. \n\nthe fries were ok, but the buttermilk zucchini fries, were excellent. got those with a ranch dipping sauce. they have some dessert \"burgers\" on the menu that i must try sometime. they use a donut for a bun and have fillings like cheesecake and grilled pineapple for example. it's so hard to save room for them though, perhaps they deserve their own visit.", 
            "i saw a lot of mixed reviews on burger bar (both for this location and the one in san francisco), but i was still eager to try it after seeing it featured on top chef masters.\n\nit actually took some time to find it.  burger bar is not located in mandalay bay but mandalay place, which is a little shopping mall adjacent to the casino.  it was late in the morning (just before 11:00am) and the mall was pretty empty.  when burger bar opened though, there were quite a few groups waiting to go in.\n\nthe atmosphere was kind of like a chain family restaurant without all the kitsch and decorations.  the atmosphere was loud, casual and comfortable, but there was nothing to it.  the dining area was not that big.  seating was available via tables, booths and the bar.\n\nthe focus on the menu, of course, was burgers and fries.  while it was expensive for burgers and fries, it did not feel expensive for las vegas.  many menu items were less than $20 and gourmet burgers do go in the $12-$18 range in l.a.  at burger bar, there are a few pricier burgers <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> can be customized with some fancy ingredients (like lobster) that can lead to some really pricey burgers.\n\ni went with the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger.  the burger was about small-to-medium sized.  a lot of burger places like the counter and father's office definitely have bigger burgers.  the bun (which can be customized) was nice.  the tomatoes, green leaf lettuce and onions were fresh, but they were very ordinary.  i got some cheese, which was an extra cost, and some homemade dijon mustard.  the meat had a good flavor and was juicy (also not too greasy).  it was not anything great, but it was a decent, okay burger.\n\ni ordered some of the fat fries, which the waitress recommended.  skinny fries and sweet potato fries were also available.  i liked the fries, but they were not as hot as they should have been, which was kind of odd.  since they just opened the restaurant, i was surprised the fries tasted like they had been sitting around for a while.  i've definitely had my share of food in vegas that was served cold, but i would think this place would have a higher standard.\n\nthe milkshake was expensive but good.  it was a chocolate and nutella milkshake.  it had a good flavor and consistency.  it could have been a little colder.  it was topped with crunchy hazelnuts, chocolate syrup and chocolate whipped cream.  it was definitely heavy on the chocolate and probably could have used something contrasting to balance the shake out.  while i liked the shake, the portion was a little on the small side.\n\nthe waitress was very good--attentive, informed about the menu and friendly.\n\nthere is a lot of bad and overpriced food in vegas because the casinos know they have a captive audience and they let their standards slip.  burger bar, while not great, is definitely better than some of the vegas restaurants i've tried.  it also presents a better value (though maybe slightly overpriced, considering the size of portions, when compared to some burger joints in other major cities).  still, if you go to one of those cafes in vegas, you are probably going to spend right around the same amount for a burger.\n\ni probably would not make a special trip to burger bar, but if we were around mandalay bay again, needed some food and weren't looking to spend too much, burger bar would definitely be a place i would give another try.\n\nfinal note: for me, celebrity chef restaurants often feel more like a brand than a representation of the chef's food because the chef is hardly ever there.  chef hubert keller was there that day; he was not in the kitchen though.  he was having a meeting (outside of the restaurant in the mall area).", 
            "the brilliantly innovative and sometimes crazy mind of hubert keller decided to step away from the fancy, upscale french eateries and create a..... burger joint?  it's true, and if you've been here before, you should also know it's delicious.  \n\nlocated inside mandalay bay's \"mandalay place\" (their shopping center) - this burger joint is almost always crowded and buzzing with people.   we came here on a weekday around 3pm thinking that would be a good time to come and get a table right away.  we were wrong.  we still ended up waiting for almost 20 minutes to get a table but since we had been here before and knew what awaited us, we would've waited an hour.  \n\nthe last time we were here, we ordered the rossini burger ($60), which is burger bar's most famous and most talked about burger.  you get a 1/3lb. of <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> (which is nothing compared to the original japanese beef, but it's still pretty tasty) topped with sauteed foie gras (duck fat) and shaved black truffles on an onion bun.  omfg!\n\nthey have four different kind of fries you can order.  skinny, fat, sweet potato or zucchini.  we have tried all of them and our favorites are the sweet potato and the fat fries!\n\nif you order the rossini burger, you get a \"sweet burger\" after your meal.  we ordered the creamy cheesecake burger - the buns are actually a glazed donut that's been sliced in half, there's a patty made of cheesecake and then there's a caramelized pineapple slice on top of it.  it was freakin' amazing!  \n\nservice was excellent and when we told the waitress we were splitting the rossini between the two of us, she brought us two separate plates, each with a huge half of the rossini burger, and each with their own order of sweet potato fries!  very nice!  \n\nnot all the burgers are this expensive, mind you.  you can still get a kobe burger without the foie gras and truffles for about $20.  i've also tried their \"<mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>\"($25), which has a 1/3lb. of <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> topped with a grilled half lobster and grilled asparagus.  it doesn't come close to the rossini burger in taste, but it's still a pretty delicious and decadent burger!  \n\nthis restaurant has become a regular destination for us whenever we're in vegas.  my wife insists we have to get a burger at burger bar.  \n\npros:  rossini burger! four different kinds of fries!  great service!  outstanding food in general.\n\ncons:  it's almost always busy, but what can you expect?", 
            "i visit burger bar @ mandalay bay every time i come to vegas. \n\ni'll list my most recent experience.\n\ni had a $50 resort credit to use.  so brian being brian, i order the surf & <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>.  the surf & <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> is <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> burger wit half a grilled lobster, grilled asparagus and a plain bun.  i eliminated the asparagus and kept the lovely lobster.  this was like $24.25.  would i buy this with my own cash?  no way.  however, how often do you have lobster on a burger...........most likely never.\n\ni always order the fat fries with my burgers here because they are so utterly delicious.\n\nnow here are some bad things people will say.\n-it's a little expensive.  yes, there is no disputing that.  the burgers are a little pricey, as are the beers.  guess what, who cares?  if you want to save money go to the buffet.  you could get a cheaper burger at in-out burger if you're so inclined.  \n-it's a simple burger place, why are the people so loud?  the staff here likes to have fun.  they may be a little loud, as would the customers.  this is not l'atelier de jo\\u00ebl robuchon.  this is a simple, yet good restaurant that should be affordable for most people.\n-this isn't in mandalay bay!  well, technically it's not.  it's in mandalay place which attaches the luxor to mandalay bay.  i will for strategical purposes, state that it is in mandalay bay.\n\ndespite the complaints, i know though, when i come to las vegas...........i stop here.  the serving sizes are huge, the food is delicious and the staff is friendly.  5 stars.  *note: i should have given this 5 stars over a year ago*",

            "craft beer <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>, a winning combination.  the burger bar in las vegas has done a great job of mixing the two.\n\nour first visit to burger bar was exactly one year ago to date - and it was probably one of our best las vegas strip experiences ever.  before we knew about aces and ales - we always figured craft beer in vegas was a bust.  as a last ditch attempt on our lv craft beer journey, i decided to do some research on yelp.  did it exist?  luckily fellow yelpers were able to direct me to burger bar. \n\nat first we weren't sure what to think - my first concern was that being a hubert keller restaurant, it would be extremely expensive (sure, his food is amazing and restaurants are to die for, but only on very special occasions!)  my second concern was it's location on the strip.  i wasn't quite sure what we'd be in for.\n\nluckily, my fiance, who refers to my trip preparation as \"research,\" trusts my recommendations, so we took a chance.  we were pleasantly surprised.  it's a really cute restaurant, with more of a pub vibe.  although their logo is  a martini glass with \"burger bar\" on it, they have much more than cosmos and appletinis.  we were very happy to see dogfish head 90 minute on tap (not 60, but 90) at a very reasonable price.  they also had a decent bottle selection, keeping in mind that we were in vegas and weren't even expecting to see sierra nevada on tap.  they also had their local brew and a few others that were impressive.   nothing rare, but still more than decent.  we had been back to vegas since then, but had never made the effort to head towards that side of the strip.\n\nfast forward a year later.  our 2nd annual labor day trip, we decided to hit burger bar since we were already at mandalay bay for a concert at the house of blues.  we first arrived at 8pm and it was packed. no seats at the bar (our preferred seating of choice - easier access to the bartenders :)  and there were a ton of people waiting for a table.  we decided to head to mix for a beverage and stop by on our way back to see if anyone had left.  sure enough - 9pm on a sunday - we found two perfect spots at the bar!  timing is everything.\n\ndogfish head 90 minute was again on tap - 9oz for $5 - pretty good for a 9% beer!  then i saw lagunitas lucky 13 on tap - 9 oz for $4.50.  i really couldn't pass that up!\n\nwe ordered rounds of beer, and my fiance and i decided to split the surf & <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> (a burger with lobster and asparagus- $24.00) - surprisingly - soo good, with fries and an order of their jalapeno fried pickles.  the burger was awesome, the fries were crispy and flavorful, (not burnt) and the fried pickles were probably my favorite.  i know people who say anything deep fried is better, and i normally try to avoid that motto like the plague.  but i was glad i tried these. a hint of jalapeno in the light batter, and the clean, fresh flavor of the pickles took away that greasy aftertaste you normally get from fried food.  they did split up our order (they cut our burger up and separated the fries for us).  we noticed after that there is a $2.00 split fee, which didn't bother us - but worth mentioning in case you are thinking of sharing.\n\nthe crowd is extremely eclectic.  a variety of college kids, older couples, younger couples, families...and it was busy - even on a sunday night (although it was labor day weekend so that's expected).  almost a little too busy and loud for us.  although casual, it's anything but a dive.\n\nthe service was super friendly and nice (which is one thing that had stuck out for us the first time around).  higher end burger shops and gastro pubs seem to be the trend wherever we go nowadays - burger bar is definitely one of the better ones.  i only give it four stars because it's probably not somewhere we would frequent if we lived in lv.  it is a little pricey, and the ambience is a little noisy and cluttered. i will say that burger bar is consistent - even a year later we had the same great experience.  nothing much had changed, but i guess if it ain't broke don't fix it.  worth checking out - especially if you enjoy beers <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>!", 
            "skeptical at first.  who orders a 60buck burger?  who do you think you are blowing paper on a...burger??   well, apparently pigs fly cuz...this girl does (both thumbs guiltily pointed my way). \n\ntruth be told, i went halfsies with my cousin, so i did pay less for a decently portioned taste of pure decadence. mmmmmmmmm...\n\ndooood??!  my mouth made nasty love to that burger..no joke.  the rossini burger had foie gras and truffles on <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>.  i'm on no foie gras or truffle bandwagonee train and neither do i consider my palette super refined.  but i do and will acknowledge excellence, and that burger was excellently erotic in my mouth. mmmmmmmm.. \n\nin-n-out, rocky's (in sd), paul's (in ny) <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> bar - top 4 in my book.  and i can't really compare all my fave burger joints cuz it's like comparing apples to oranges. \n\nalso, may i suggest ordering the nutella shake.  i requested to swap out the chocolate ice cream with coffee instead and consider your first sip an insta-smile. \n\nand p.s. the service is great. and sure the wait can be long on busy days, but there's an urban outfitters just around the corner to kill time.", 
            "husband and i visited the burger bar a couple of weekends ago during our \"staycation\" on the strip.  we went on a friday night, so  it was jam-packed. upon checking in with the (very disinterested) hostess, we found out that the wait was going to be at least 30 minutes unless we found a seat at the bar. we scoped out the bar and finally found two handicapped accessible seats at the very back. hey, i'd sit at the kids table if it meant that i'd get to eat sooner. luckily, two people at the main bar left and husband was able to snag their seats. no kiddie table for us, yay!\n\nof course, sitting at the bar meant that the service was a little slow, but it wasn't horrible. the bartender was friendly, so that goes a long way.  the food definitely made up for it.  we got an appetizer of the jalepeno beer-battered fried pickles, which stayed piping hot all the way to the last bite. husband got the <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> and fries ($24) while i made my own: american \"kobe\", medium-well, oyster mushrooms, monterey-jack cheese, and bacon. side of sweet-potato fries ($22). i don't know if it was a $22 burger- i could have done without the bacon, but it was fantastic. dh couldn't keep his hands off my sweet potato fries, either.\n\nwe were too full for shakes or desserts, but enjoyed our experience there and can check it off our list of burger joints!", 
            "hands down, best burger i have ever eaten. before even entering mandalay bay, i was telling myself to critically rate this restaurant for every minute detail. working from a fast food burger joint (in-n-out burger), i've had my plentiful shares of burgers from all sorts of places and arriving at one of my favorite chef's resto, hubert keller, i was pleasantly impressed\n\naccompanied by the 2 most trustworthy women in my life, we busted a \"lord of the ring's\" journey to get here. from the manadalay bay entrance, the burger bar is far... once arrived at this eatery, i noticed the settings is quite dim and social. there was a bar ofcourse but there were also booths and tables. great take on a mix between a \"fine brewery\". the place \"looked\" packed and we had to wait for a good 15 min. for a booth but there were already a couple of empty booths so i didn't understand the point of waiting... our server was nice at first but like a oddly new friend that you meet who suddenly opens up the next day, you see their real side and you don't like it. she was serving us like a quick asian at an oriental restaurant. didn't really care for hospitality, but got our orders right. she was also pregnant so maybe it was a mood swing that we ended up seeing?... i dunno. anyways, onto what we ordered:\n\nmarinated chicken breast burger w/ swiss cheese on a whole wheat bun - great chicken taste, nice and tender and the slice was not too big to overwhelm the swiss cheese or the bun. the cheese even had holes in it! the bun to compliment was great as well. fluffy and a discerning wheat taste. these guys weren't playing around with the choices of ingredients.\n\n<mark>Black Jack Burger</mark> on a ciabatta - a thick beefy behemoth with thick italian square buns. it wasn't accompanied with any cheese (cuz my girl didn't ask for any) but the taste was still apparent. medium well, moist ground up beef which was well seasoned and full of flavor. i really wished there was some sauce to accompany it but for a mere bread, meat, and veg combo, it still tasted out of the ordinary. \n\n<mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> on an onion bun - as a lover for steak and lobster, this burger was right up my alley. think of a cheesecake with a graham cracker crust topped with thick full whip cream... but savorized! the asparagus was buttered with the texture of a moist graham cracker, my medium rare black angus didn't seem as big as the <mark>Black Jack Burger</mark>'s but the texture was pure butta (that thing couldn't keep together on a fork). the lobster was perfectly cooked, tender for a lean meat, and complimented the steak and asparagus texturely, perfectly! i was kind of worried the server didn't ask me if i wanted cheese on it, but honestly you don't need any. just another flavor to get in the way of the stars of the show. on the down side, from how moist everything was, it made the bottom bun really soggy. nevertheless, the onion bun had an onion taste that you could not miss (which was great!) \n\nthe lettuce, onions, and tomatoes on the side of these burgers were fresh and crisp. it could've been a side salad all together. plus the pickle garnish had nice suttle taste, not overwhelming like your at home jar pickles, but almost like a cucumber palate cleanser.\n\ntyping about side salads, i had one as one of my sides. it wasn't all that great, but with drenched olive oil for a dressing , it did have a good enough taste to finish. the other sides we had were fat fries and sweet potato fries. fat fries were crispy and thick, which i thought tasted way better than the flimsy sweet potato fries. about sweet potato fries, they are popping up everywhere now, sadly these aren't the best i had.\n\nservice was slow, food was tasty and fast, and the price was reasonable. everything came up to be a good 60 bux plus tip, quality = price tonight. fyi: each booth had a mini tv on the side playing some type of sport. that's just overkill with the whole bar meets fine dining theme, but hey it sells! it was a great experience for all 3 of us and i would definitely come here again. portion size is just right for a hungry person, and the taste is incomparable.",

            "we tried burger bar on our most recent trip to vegas, and i thought it was pretty good.  it was short of being the cream of the crop, but it was better than average.\n\nwhen we sat down to eat, i liked that the waitress was friendly and easy to talk to.  i also liked that they had a small tv embedded into our booth so that we could watch baseball while dining.  \n\nfor my entr\\u00e9e, i ordered the <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>, which consisted of an <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> patty with three jumbo shrimp (although the menu online says it has lobster, but it was actually shrimp when i ate here) and asparagus on top.  it was good, and tasted like they used quality ingredients.  however, it didn't mesh as well as i would have liked.  to complement my burger i substituted a side of onion rings instead of fries, and thought they were pretty good.  \n\ni can't say that i would go out of my way to eat at burger bar, but i would definitely eat here again if i am in the area and can find it.  i give it a solid 3 1/2 stars.", 
            "i was not impressed at all...i got the slider sampler...had the opportunity to try the buffalo burger, natural fed, and angus need burgers. burgers were prob decent, but the bread was sub-par, if not just plain awful. a part of a great burger is the bread, <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> missed the boat on that one! fries...nothing to brag about...i would maybe try again, but there are so many options here, maybe not!",

            "hubert keller made his foray into gourmet burgers with the opening of his first burger bar in 2004. shortly thereafter, several burger bars popped up luring customers with it's prime meats, tantalizing toppings and toothsome milkshakes. whether you fancy an ultra-luxe $60 burger or if you prefer your burgers a little more spartan, burger bar can fulfill your needs. \n\ngive your burger the ultimate treatment and choose from a dizzying array of toppings, including pan-seared foie gra, black truffles, lobster, large shrimp, homemade chili, prosciutto, fried eggs, jalape\\u00f1o bacon and more. \n\nafter tossing a few options back and forth, i decided to go with the hangover burger --certified <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> smothered in hangover sauce, chopped lettuce and served with fat fries. my friend ordered the same burger but the gluten-free version with sweet potato fries. we both relished every bite and lapping up all the hangover sauce with their tasty fries. \n\nthe birthday girl choose the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>, which comes with buffalo, carmelized onions, baby spinach and blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. this namesake burger comes with a beautiful red wine shallot reduction sauce and many sides of hefty smiles. \n\nand don't forget about ordering one of their signature milkshakes or choose from a staggering 60 ingredients to custom build your own milkshake. i had the cowboy milkshake -- whiskey and chocolate ice cream topped with chocolate marshmallows. it's very rich, almost like a chocolate mousse, so prepare yourself for one decadent treat. \n\nmenu highlights include the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, buffalo, veggie, salmon, surf 'n <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> with black angus and lobster tail. the rossini burger ($60) features wagyu beef foie gra and shaved truffles on an onion bun. \n\nwonderful burger joint tucked away in the mandalay bay shopping forum.",

            "became interested in this place when i saw the burger-themed challenge on top chef masters. went here for saturday lunch, it was pretty busy with an estimated 20 minute wait. i instead sat at the bar. i wanted to try the rossini of course, but i couldn't justify the price to myself. instead, i went with the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> medium rare (bison, spinach, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, blue cheese on a ciabatta bun). had a hitachino white ale with it. in total, $30+.\n\nnow, nothing about the food was objectionable. i ate pretty much all of it, and the portion size was definitely sufficient. by the time i got out of there, i was full. the food was decent, but it was also not very memorable or flavorful (even with blue cheese!). the skinny fries especially were quite generic and could have been served from a chain family restaurant. maybe i've been spoiled by father's office in santa monica, but the burger bar food was just...alright. add to the experience a pretty long waiting time for food, and well, i'm not running to go back. maybe i should've done a customized burger instead.",

            "best burger i've ever had.  don't let the location fool you.  this is not a \"mall\" place.  once you get past that and into the fun ambiance inside, you will see how great burger bar is!  i could not decide on the personalized burgers, so i had the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>: buffalo meat, carmelized onions, blue cheese & spinach on ciabatta.  it was excellent!  next time i will need to study the menu beforehand!  my boyfriend loved his burger and raved about it to our friends the next day-- not something he normally does.  i had a bite of his and the jalapeno bacon is awesome!  we arrived around 9:30 and it wasn't too busy, so we just waited about 15 minutes.  the service was excellent.  our water was right on top of things and we had other servers checking in as well.  probably some of the best service i've had in a casual restaurant!  oh yeah, there is a huge bar with a zillion beers on tap (i'm not a beer drinker) and hard alcohol too.  next time i definitely will try a fried egg on my burger!!!", 
            "it's not really fair to compare the burger bar to other burger places. only on the strip in vegas can you blow $25 on a burger and not really care. it's actually a good value, considering that's only 1 hand of black jack for most people. i guarantee you'll enjoy this burger way more than that one hand of black jack. \n\nthe burger bar is celebrity chef, hubert keller's creation. he has a few of his own burger combinations on the menu, or you can build your own from extensive options. i actually wish that hubert keller would have more of his own burgers on there. there are only like 6 listed on the menu. i like creating my own, but hey you are the famous chef, dazzle me. \n\ni've been there a couple of times, so i can report on a few different burgers. i highly recommend the surf 'n <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>. i'm not sure it says on the menu, but i think all the burgers are 1/2 lb. they are nice and thick. the surf 'n turf is <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, topped with a 1/2 grilled lobster tail, and grilled asparagus on a plain bun. because i believe all burgers should come with cheese, i had them add provolone to it. now pay attention to this next part, because i believe i have improved on hubert keller's creation. order some pesto and mayo on the side. mix it together and use this as a sauce. yum, you'll never have a burger like that anywhere else. \n\nyou can choose different types of meat for your burger. after trying a kobe burger on this last visit, from now on that's the only way i will go. it's about $7 more for a <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger than the black angus, but it's so juicy that it melts in your mouth. the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> is actually american kobe, so it's not crazy expensive like the real japanese kobe. american kobe is a hybrid between black angus and japanese wagyu beef. it has the highest marbling of any beef in the united states, and is as fine as you can get without importing actual japanese wagyu beef. you also get to pick from 5 different buns and about 45 different toppings. toppings are as plain as american cheese and are as fancy as pan-seared foie gras. \n\njust so i could try 2 burgers on this last visit, i cut them in half and shared them with my brother. burger number 1 was a do it yourself kobe burger. we agreed on provolone cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, sauteed oyster mushrooms, on an onion roll. had the burger medium rare. the result was such a juicy burger that you didn't need any mayo, ketchup, or any other sauce. just the natural juices of the burger with the toppings was perfection. \n\nburger number 2 was new on the menu since the last time i ate there. it's called the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>. the menu says it's his favorite. it's a buffalo burger with blue cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, sauteed baby spinach, aoli, on a ciabatta bun. i think the buffalo had the least amount of fat of all their burgers, as such i found it wasn't as juicy. i was expecting it to maybe have some different kind of flavor, but it didn't. it could have just been lean ground beef. it's also the same price as the kobe, so unless you are trying to be healthy, go with the kobe. the blue cheese was kind of medium, which wasn't a bad thing. a very strong blue would have over powered everything. of the 3 i've had so far, it was my least favorite, but still good. \n\nthe fries were ok, but the buttermilk zucchini fries, were excellent. got those with a ranch dipping sauce. they have some dessert \"burgers\" on the menu that i must try sometime. they use a donut for a bun and have fillings like cheesecake and grilled pineapple for example. it's so hard to save room for them though, perhaps they deserve their own visit.", 
            "just the two of us, me and my bf; went on a saturday night; not too long of wait, luckily they were about to clear off one of the booths; we wanted to check it out because it's by hubert keller...seems like a nice guys...at least on top chef masters. :)\n\natmosphere/location: located upstairs at mandalay bay; very casual bar atmosphere; booths have its own small tv screens tuned on a sports channel, nice and cute...but i wasn't paying much attention to it because i was hungry to devour some burgers!\n\nfood:\n-we resorted not to order the $60 burger (with foie gras and truffles...not your typical backyard burger heh?)...maybe next time? or not\n-<mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger: ordered it with onion buns, provolone and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> (which they added in addition to the red onions that already comes with); the taste? meh, it was alright, not the greatest, it was kinda drier than we liked; sweet potato fries were excellent!\n-<mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>: buffalo burger with blue cheese on ciabatta buns; nice and juicy, liked this one better than the kobe burger; skinny fries were alright, i prefer the sweet potato fries personally\n-beers: nothing extraordinary; you can also order samplers but the selections were not anything exotic that i wanted to sample\n-they have all kinds of milkshakes and beer floats but we didn't get them...lactose intolerant :(\n\nservice: fine, no complaints\n\ni don't know if i want to go back and pay $20+ for each burger (if you order \"build your own burger\" they charge for extra toppings). nice experience for once but i think in-n-out will do just fine for now.", 
            "mmmm, burgers. one of my favorite foods.\n\ni'm not much for fancy burgers but i made an exception for this place. i was in vegas for a week (!) for work and stuck in mandalay bay. now, i'm not saying mandalay is bad place but a week indoors anywhere is rough. my birthday happened to fall that week so a group of about 35 of us ditched the company-sponsored festivities one night and headed to the burger bar in mandalay place to celebrate my 34th year of existence.\n\nfirst, i will give the staff kudos for arranging seating for us. when 35 people roll up with no reservation, i'm sure it's not easy but my guess is the check for 35 justifies the hassle. we had to wait for a while but only because some large group with little kids was already in the place. sidebar: vegas is no place for a family vacation. take your fucking kids to disneyland, not a place famous for gambling, sex and getting piss-drunk. i don't fuck up your legoland vacation by getting hammered and then hitting on your wife after spending $500 in a strip club so don't fuck up my vacation by bringing your hyper kids to vegas and letting them run around while screaming their heads off. deal?\n\nbut i digress, on to the food. i ordered the \"<mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>.\" i mean, it's named after the owner (and world-renowned chef) - it's gotta be the shit, right? it's actually a buffalo burger, not beef, with <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, blue cheese and baby spinach on a ciabatta bun. it was indeed the shit. one of the best burgers i have ever had, in fact. i also ate half of my boss' <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger, also excellent. and they don't mess around when you order rare or medium-rare. you better like it bloody if you order it that way, not like those chain restaurants that are afraid to leave any pink in the meat. it makes me nervous to order food in those places. i mean, why are you afraid to serve your food a little underdone? what does that say about the quality of your ingredients?\n\nthe sides (sweet potato fries, regular fries) were good but nothing special. i wish i had ordered dessert. they had some good looking \"sweet burgers\" and milkshakes on the menu. maybe next time. the beer menu is very impressive and they serve pitchers.\n\nthe service was very good. they were quick and came by often. with 35 people in the party, i was less concerned with their friendliness, i just wanted them to get the orders correct in a timely fashion, which they did. i willl definitely go back the next time i am at mandalay.",

            "i started with the deep fried jalapeno pickles.  highly recommended.  if you have vinegar based pickles the only real way to eat them is deep fried.\n\nafter looking over the menu i didn't want the $60 kobe truffle burger.  not going to spend that much before finding out if these guys know what they are doing.\n\ni got the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>.  this is blue cheese and <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> based burger on ciabatta.  i got onion rings on the side.\n\nthe onion rings are not bad but not better than say ... carl's jr.  i've had plenty of better ones.  i ended up eating only a couple.\n\nthe burger itself was great at first.  i was so happy to see they got medium rare right.  however as you keep on eating the <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> really dominates too much and the last few bites get bad.  they say chefs care most about the first and last bites so this burger fails.  \n\nthe service was great.  i don't think i'll be going back as this place just doesn't stand out.  bill was $36 for lunch for one with no alcohol so it's steep for the quality.", 
            "i'll keep this one short and simple.\n\ni forgot what burger i ordered, but i think i would only come back for the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> for $60.  i ordered random toppings, and it was... ok.  for $20, \"ok\" is \"not ok.\"  sure, the meat was tender, the fixings were fresh, but... i could also get that for $4 at in n out.\n\nthe $7 vanilla milkshake was... also \"ok.\"  alright, i'll acquiesce that it was good.  but johnny rockets' milkshake still reigns supreme in my book, and a little over half the cost.  (mind you, i'd be willing to pay... $10 for an amazing milkshake, and cost has no factor in my decision that johnny rockets has the best i've tasted).\n\nthe bartender looked like a buxom \"trinity\" (from matrix), and she was pleasant.  i did sit at the bar with my friends to eat, and it was definitely more enjoyable to have an attractive bartender serve us.\n\nbut come back, i shall probably not.", 
            "personally my rating for this place is probably a 3.75. i personally like the place a lot especially since the restaurant is established by hubert keller. i have some major respect for hubert keller and he is my favorite chef. anyway back to the review. \n\nfirst of all, i would like to explain how this place was a major up for me when we first came here because it was still open at like 12? my friends went to the ice lounge so it was perfect to come here after the lounge. we were all hungry and this place was the only place in the mall that was still open and that was exactly why we went to this restaurant. so that was already a good start.\n\ni really like the place a lot to be honest. there were so many different kind of burger to get. it was like burger heaven to me hahaha. you could either get a fixed selection of burger or you can make your own burger with whatever topping you want in the inside. there were many pre-fixed burger that i want to get but dude...a burger with whatever you want is like a damn dream come true to me. :) so of course i picked the \"make your own burger.\" although i did wanted to try that one burger with lobster or the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> but regardless i didnt regret it one bit.\n\nso there were 4 different kind of meat you can get with the \"make your own burger.\" there is the regular, buffalo, kobe, and one other kind that i forgot. it was a week ago. anyway i got the regular patty with bacon, avocado, spinach, portebello mushrooms, grill onions, and i think thats it...? i'm not sure hahaha i got too much toppings. anyway the burget came and the burger was huge. it was like my dream come true burger :) it was so hard to bite through it bit by bit but it was so tasty bite after bite. oh man. i love the burger that i got. it was so delicious. \n\ni tried my friend's burger which was legit as well. he got the kobe patty with bacon, avocado, fried egg, grill onions and some other stuff. i took a bite of it and i was also in love with it. :) there so many different kind of toppings you can get that its just so awesomeeee! i think my rating went kinda down when i saw and taste my friend's sliders. it was so plain and doesnt look that appetizing. it was anything special just 3 sliders with 3 different kind of patty. i tried it and the taste was not special and it was not the right match as i would say. the fries was pretty good. \n\ni don't know but i wouldn't mind coming back here to make my dream burger again. hehehe :)", 
            "so..i guess burger bar is the more casual side to hubert keller. i've seen hubert many times on the streets of union square and at food and wine festivals and i always wanted to try his food. i guess this day was the perfect day. i was craving a burger and i thought what a better place than to finally experience a <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>. \ni must say i was expecting my server to show of their tummies and for them to look like they had a good time at a bar. so i was really crossed on what kind of burger to get and i ended up getting the classic <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>....i must say it was a very strange tasted. i ended up taking only a couple of bits and putting it down. i tried my friend's burgers and they tasted great. for a restaurant that focus' on burgers i was definitely disappointed. it lacked a lot of good mixtures of flavor. the fries were ok too. the sauces that they gave you were good. the servers were pleasant and nice. they were accommodation especially when the burger came out to be the wrong temperature. you would think they would have it down because it is a burger bar. i guess everyone has their slip once in a while. none the less, they were very nice about it and the manager gave him a whole new plate.", 
            ":o)\n\nit pains me to give burger bar four stars.  first of all, i'm not typically a burger type of gal, except when it comes to in n out, but everything surpassed my expectations and was super tasty.  unfortunately, my burger's lobster was overcooked and service slightly disappointed me.  :(  \n\n\nburgers:\n<mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> - buffalo, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, baby spinach, blue cheese on a ciabatta bun.  the buffalo added the perfect amount of gaminess to give this burger a good earthy kick with the blue cheese to add a mildness to it.  which was slightly odd since blue cheese has so much flavor and usually packs a bold punch.  everything harmonized beautifully and i was happy to chomp away. \n\nsurf & turf - black angus, grilled half lobster, grilled <mark>Green Asparagus</mark> on a plain bun.  sadly, the lobster was overcooked and was chewy.  other then that, the <mark>Green Asparagus</mark> complemented this burger perfectly.\n\n<mark>American Classic</mark> - <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, america cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion on a sesame bun.  a very good basic burger.  the juiciness of the beef makes this one exceptional.\n\n\nsides:\nsweet potato fries - hands down the sweet potato fries won the sides battle.  they were very typical very good sweet potato fries.  good ratio of sweetness and saltiness, and nice and crispy\n\nonion rings - these babies reminded me of the onion rings you get at carl's jr. with the same texture and crispiness.  the biggest difference between the ones at burger bar is that the onions doesn't slide right out of the ring.  :) \n\naioli - do yourself a favor and just get it.  it's so good.  i wanted to cover my hands with this sauce and lick it all day.  i know it sounds absolutely disgusting, but it was soooooo good!!\n\nzucchini fries, skinny fries, fat fries - they're all good, but not amazing.\n\n\nfrom a service standpoint, i was a bit disappointed because we told the server that it was my friend's birthday.  sadly, she didn't bring us a little burger dessert, but we were stuffed beyond all belief to even fathom having another bite.\n\nhere's a little note.  keep their number on hand.  even though they don't take reservations, you can call them to ask them for a wait time and to put your party on the list.  it's almost like a fast pass for the burger bar.  :)", 
            "i regret eating at the burger bar, now i am back in chicago searching for a burger that only exists in vegas. during my visit, i had the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> medium rare, which was medium rare and juicy. by far the best burger i ever had. my favorite part was the spinach and blue cheese that complemented each other so well. and the <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> was so sweet (in a good way). when i visit again, i hope they' still have the hubert keller!",

            "from the creative genius that brought you the fleur de lys restaurant, hubert keller brings you the burger bar. this place leaves most gourmet burger places in the dust. with its various choices to build your own burger.. to the chef's signature burgers... it's not your typical burger place... definitely and certainly not.\n\nlast year, i selected the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> which was a buffalo burger with <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, baby spinach, and blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. it was delicious however there was one burger that stood out on the menu that i was hesitant to try at first. the $60 rossini.\n\nfast forward to a few weeks ago, i decided to test out this burger to see what the whole hype was about... to see if a burger would be even worth that much to me. what crazy person would pay that much for a burger and why??\n\nwell.. nonetheless i was curious and crazy enough to do it. i must say, though i can see how some people may not find the rossini not not be worth the exuberant amount they ask for..... \n\ni found it to be utterly delightful!! from the juicy tender <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> patty, to the foie gras and black perigord truffles.. i was difficult for me to find myself eating a regular burger after having taken a bite out of this burger. the madeira sauce complimented the burger wonderfully and going halfway into the meal.. i just thought to myself.. i just ate $30 worth of food right there.. and as i contemplated if this whole meal was worth the money and hype.. i decided that the answer was a definitive and crazy, yes.\n\nfinishing off with a cheesecake burger.. it was a nice wonderful experience... also, i must note.. i was there with two other people from the sf bay area.. and we watched the giants win the world series as we finished up our meal. ahh.... definitely a cherry top finish.", 
            "i had been dying to try this place out since my arrival in vegas, and finally on our last day there we did and i am so happy that i didn't leave without trying it because it would have been a shame. \n\nthe burgers here are topnotch and made with really good quality meat. you can have your burger cooked however you want it, and you have the options of making your own burger or choosing one of the house specialty burgers. i choose the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> which is buffalo meat topped with blue cheese, baby spinach and <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, my friend had the pepper <mark>Black Jack Burger</mark> which was <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> topped with pepper jack cheese and tapenade. she had the zucchini fries as a side and i chose the sweet potato fries. \n\nthe burgers were both tasty. the meat was juicy and flavorful. every bite of my burger was pure deliciousness. my friends zucchini fries were superb, and my sweet potato fries were crispy and just perfect. it was my first time trying buffalo and it was really good and not gamey at all, and i think i actually prefer it to beef burgers. \n\nwe also shared a milkshake which we customized. we chose chocolate ice cream, fresh banana, cookie dough and vanilla whipped cream. it was soo rich and good! \n\nto top it all off, the service was attentive, friendly and fast. our waitress was super nice and we felt well taken care of.", 
            "wow...a hubert keller restaurant...well, not all i had thought it would be.  i had the kobe burger, which was surprisingly tough in texture! i have had a few \"kobe-style\" burgers and this was by far the toughest i have had...and it was cooked medium rare at that.\n\nother people in the party i was with had the <mark>Black Jack Burger</mark> and the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> which they seemed to enjoy quite a bit.\n\nthe fries were pretty tasty--we had the thick fries and the potato fries--and the zucchini fries were pretty awesome--perhaps the highlight of the meal.\n\nthey have a really nice selection of beers but also happened to run out of the one paticular beer i ordered, so i ended up getting a caramel latte milkshake, which i enjoyed most out off all the items i ordered.\n\nin the end, the bill for four of us was about $130 including tax and tip...perhaps a little more than you'd anticipate from a burger joint, and quite a bit more than i would be willing to pay to go back...maybe i will have to try blt burger next time...\n\nhappy eating!!!",

            "when i think of hubert keller, i don't think of this place at all.\n\nthe environment here makes me think of a higher end biker bar. all the waitresses are wearing hip hugger jeans, tight black spaghetti straps with their midriffs showing, cleavage popping and their tramp stamps proud and loud. that said, the waitresses are all very sweet and accommodating. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> which is a buffalo on ciabatta bread with spinach, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, blue cheese, and the usual condiments. i liked it a lot, and it was very juicy as well. i loved the sweet potato fries which the waitress allowed me to substitute at no additional cost.\n\n my other party member built their own burger: <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> with mushrooms, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, avocado, and some other condiments that escape my memory. that was actually significantly better than the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> i had, perhaps it was due to a preference in the meat selection. \n\nthe sizes are filling and i was glad i didn't order a shake, even though i really wanted to. i wouldn't have been able to finish both my burger and a shake without rolling off the escalator in a food coma induced state. if it wasn't so far off from the main strip, i would come here more often. however, for those driving to and from vegas, make this your first or last stop on your trip, unless you're staying @ mandalay bay. vegas traffic just isn't worthwhile.",

            "i'd like to start and say this place deserves more a 4.5 stars then a 4.\n\nso, this was my third time here, me and my best friend go every other year to vegas, and we always make sure to stop here no matter how far away it is from where we are staying.\n\nfirst trip, i ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>, which is buffalo, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, baby spinach, and bleu cheese on a ciabatta bun, and my friend ordered the same.  let me tell you, this was absolutely amazing, and i'm not that big of a bleu cheese fan unless its on wings.  this burger was delectable.  cooked perfectly, and the addition of the baby spinach was nice along with the onions, and on the ciabatta bun, which feel apart 3/4 of the way because it was so juicy.  the burger is easily a 5.  the reason i cant give this place a full 5, is unfortunately because of the fries, which were skinny fries.  now yes they offer different fries, but ours came with the skinny fries.  these were just a 3, needed a bit more salt and 15 seconds more in the fryer.  \n\ndrinks, this was the interesting part.  last time, i ordered multiple beers, they have, in my opinion, a fantastic beer menu.  but, i ordered the mint choc. chip alcoholic milkshake, which was absolutely amazing.  we also ordered the ice cream beer flight.  put it this way, every single person in the place looked at us regretting not ordering this for themselves.  i highly recommend.  \n\nsecond trip here.  my friend ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> again, and i ordered the <mark>American Classic</mark>.  again, both cooked perfectly, and consistant, same issue with the fries though.  and again we ordered the alcoholic drinks.  \n\noverall.  easily worth going to over any burger joint on the strip.  \n\ntrick, take the tram from excalibur to mandalay bay, saves the looooong walk.",

            "what an awesome find!!! in the middle of a shopping \"mall\" inside the mandalay bay hotel.\n\nok, so this is one of those places that have one expensive burger ($60 rossini burger). no, that's not the one i tried although i'm thinking next time i might, just to see what a $60 burger taste like.\n\nanyway, we walked in and they sat us down right away. this is a very casual place, nothing extremely fancy. it's an upscale bar, very cool, looks like a great place to grab a drink, grab a bite and hang out.\n\nwe decided to split the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> (his favorite according to the menu). the burger meat is buffalo and it comes with <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, baby spinach, and blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. it was pure heaven! the meat is very tasty and the bread is delightful. this comes with a side of skinny fries which we swapped for sweet potato fries and they were fantastic. this plate of one burger and a side of fries comes at a whopping $19.25. but we split it between two people and it was enough to fill us up.\n\no.k, are you ready? nutella milkshake!! did you hear me? i said, nutella milkshake!! ohh, vanilla ice cream blended with lots of nutella topped with homemade whipped cream topped with hazelnuts and a drizzle nutella. what a dream!!! i know they make this at some other places but this one is the best so far.", 
            "in a word: yum!  i shared the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>, surf-n-<mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>, and one of the alcoholic milkshakes (you heard me) with my friend.  the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> (buffalo meat, blue cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>) was to die for!  i would definitely recommend it.  the surf and turf was a little disappointing, which is why i'm only giving this review 4 stars, but that may be because the beef just didn't compare to the buffalo.  i don't think alcoholic milkshakes require additional explanation.  our server was super friendly and helpful and it was a trip to see her twin working on the opposite side of the restaurant.  i will definitely stop by the next time i'm on the south end of the strip.", 
            "3.5 stars. let's start off with the positives: service was very, very good. our waitress was friendly, attentive, quick to refill water, and was basically perfect.\n\nhowever, the 3 stars above indicate something wrong with the experience, and that something was the food itself.\n\ni had the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger with provolone and my fiancee ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> and fries. fries were pretty good. nice texture, nice flavor, but nothing amazing.\n\nthe <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> had a solid combination of flavors, with nice play between the cheese, the meat, and the sauce. if both burgers were as decent as the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>, i would've probably leaned towards four stars. however, my <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger, despite only being cooked to medium and still nice and pink inside, was really dry and flavorless. there was just not enough fat in my burger. no juiciness. and since the burger was very basic other than the cheese, there was nothing else to mask the forgettable patty. perhaps i should have added some truffle and foie gras to liven it up, but then i'd just be enjoying those things, rather than the burger itself.\n\nif you're going to come here, spend a bit more and get their specialty burgers, i guess. wanted to like this place because hubert keller is the man, but left feeling a wee bit disappointed.", 
            "loved this place. i had the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>. the buffalo was nice and medium as i ordered it. <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> and some crumbled blue cheese were the perfect accessories to this already flavorful burger. it came with some auju on the side that was spot on.the onion rings were good but i really enjoyed the mozzarella sticks, with a nice side of marinara sauce. i wish i was not full after the meal, i really wanted to try the nutella shake, soon!!", 
            "soooooooo disappointed in burger bar. \n\neverything was pretty standard. my friend got the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>, and honestly, for all of the bells and whistles it came with (carmelized onions, bleu cheese, red wine and shallot sauce), it was pretty bland. \n\ni built my own burger with an egg and pancetta, and while the pancetta was perfect, my burger again, left a lot to be desired. it was just a flavorless hunk of meat, and with the thickness of the patty, it's an awful lot of blandness to process. eating these burgers felt more like work than an enjoyable dining experience.\n\nwe ordered the appetizer sampler with plenty of fried goodies and a five-sauce sampler, and while the sauces were great (we kept them to flavor our burgers a bit more later), the appetizers themselves tasted like they were thawed out staples that you could pick up at any grocery store. in fact, i'm pretty sure i've purchased the fried macaroni and cheese triangles that we were served at target. \n\nwe ordered alcoholic milkshakes as well, and again, were pretty disappointed by the flavor. super thick, and while we both ordered different types (the french kiss and the chocolate cowboy), they both just tasted like chocolate. \n\nwith so many awesome dining options to choose from in vegas, burger bar really needs to step it up.", 
            "all you need to know: the best skinny fries i have ever had in my life. ever.  perfectly cut, not greasy, perfectly salted, crunchy outside, soft hot inside. i ate every last one and i could have eaten more.\n\nso it is no secret that i love hubert keller.  i have the hugest crush on him with his french accent, charming smile, and gray ponytail.  and i don't typically crush on older men, that's a fact.  i also love how he's always adorably sweet and encouraging on the top chef shows.  and his pbs shows make it look easy to make souffle...yeah, right, but he makes it look easy.\n\nso we went to burger bar after an unintended visit to the airport to retrieve my bf's lost id.  ugh.  this place looks like an updated more upscale diner with booths, tables, and bar seating.  get your fave type of seating and get ready to stuff yourself!\n\nburgers are either \"build your own\" or chef's burgers that are already designed with toppings, etc.  they even have veggie burgers and fish burgers so if you don't like beef you are still going to find something here.  i ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> that was buffalo meat with <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, baby spinach and bleu cheese on a ciabatta with red wine and shallots sauce.  if it is good enough for hubert it is good enough for me.  the burger was perfectly medium rare and the entire thing was messy and dripping with savory juices from the sauce and the <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>. it was delicious...and huge!  i didn't finish the entire thing but that may have been because i stuffed my face with fries.  the bf got the lamb burger.  this one is with secret spices, tomato, cilantro, and spicy burger bar ketchup.  it had a great spice taste, like middle eastern inspired flavor.  and the spicy ketchup - that is the stuff.  we ordered a separate order of that for our fries.  not that the fries needed ketchup but damn that ketchup was good.\n\ni cannot stress enough how good those fries were.  i am a huge fan of skinny fries, crunchier the better, and dear god they were amazing.  \n\nif you don't want burgers, they do have salads and a chicken sandwich too.  they also have milkshakes, including boozy milkshakes.  if only i had enough room for one of those too.  \n\nservice was good, our waitress was attentive and didn't let us go thirsty.  she also answered that chef keller was not there that weekend and told me i could keep up with his whereabouts (i.e. stalk him more effectively) on facebook.  she confirmed that he is a sweet guy just like i already knew.  the prices are pretty standard vegas if you ask me which means it isn't gonna be the cheapest burger...mine was $22 if that tells you.  and the ketchup extra was $1.  but hey, that's how it goes.\n\nnext time you are in vegas and want a casual atmosphere and a damn fine burger and the best fries ever you need to come here.", 
            "burger bar is bomb! <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> is bomb! next time i'm in vegas i'm trying the burger with foi gras in it...if i win money in vegas though (it's a $60 burger)", 
            "my hubby and i love this place. i swear i wanna eat there every time i'm in vegas lol. they have the best burgers anywhere. i've done the build your own with <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> i've had the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> amazing the burgers are huge juicy and cooked to perfection. the bar is one of the best i've ever been to. they do an amazing caramel apple martin it's not on the menu anymore but the staff here is so great they will make it if you ask. the fry sampler is a must there regular fries are great crisp with a cream interior and the mac n cheese croquettes are yummy melting chees perfect pasta fried just right. the pepper jack cheese shots were also amazing with a nice punch of heat and the best zucchini fries i've had anywhere. we got ours with the sauce sampler i would highly recommend the basil aioli as a dipper and the spicy ketchup. if you go anywhere in vegas this is one of the must go super staff great food great drinks it doesn't get better then burger bar", 
            "two of my good friends were in town. we had the grandest of intentions of getting all dolled up and hitting the strip for a friday full of debauchery. what ended up happening was us, drinking vodka in their hotel room and stumbling for a late dinner at burger bar, where we proceeded to stuff our faces so full and then go immediately back to the hotel room to hit the hay. (when did i get so ooooooold?) \n\nanyway, unlike my experience at holsteins (which i do like better even though i give them both the same star rating)  i did have a boozy milkshake. it was not that impressive. don't get me wrong, i love a milkshake and i still drank it all, but i wanted it to smack me in the mouth with alcohol, which it did not. mint chocolate chip with chocolate whipped cream and an alleged mint liqueur for $10.75.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>. i have a huge admiration for the chef (public tv ftw) and also inventive recipes, especially those involving blue cheese. buffalo meat (a hard find... coming from south dakota where it's everywhere), spinach, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, blue cheese and a wine reduction sauce on the side for $22. it was spectacular, though perhaps not the best choice combined with my previously vodka-soaked stomach and liver and the aforementioned boozy milkshake. \n\nwe also ordered a sauce selection for the table. you're not coming to burger bar to save money or to eat healthy, so just do it. white barbecue, basil aioli, truffle mayo, homemade mustard, chipotle aioli were our choices. loved them all but particularly the truffle mayo and homemade mustard. mmmmm. \n\nthe decor and bathrooms are where the stars really plummet for me. bathrooms are forever away, passing by the back-of-house restaurant rooms on the way. the decor looked like it was schlepped together and doesn't match a $22 burger. \n\nhowever, we really enjoyed our experience and the service was great. i would try it again!", 
            "booze, boobs <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> are all found at the burger bar on the second floor in a mall atmosphere. price of burgers start from 9.50 to 23 dollars. if you like milkshakes you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't go here.\n\na regular <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> burger costs 9.50 while a <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> is 22. carmelized onions and bleu cheese are that big of a mark up? they place it on a ciabatta bread that is extremely fluffy and not chewy so that's a plus. next time i'll order the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> and put 3 cheeses on it and get some spf's next time. the quality of meat is fine. the buns are spectacular. went back on another occasion and tried the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger. it didn't stand out like i thought it would. still, you can't go wrong eating here.\n\ngreat service. all the girls have something attractive for everyone and come in different varieties while wearing a small top and yoga pants. you have the blonde athletic type, the very skinny and perky asian, the curvy alternative gal, the drop dead gorgeous latina with caramel skin and big, curly highlighted hair and a big, curvy butt in an extra tight shirt. i fell in love with this particular girl and tried not to look at her so much during my stay. this girl was bad ass. she is making some lucky guy out there really happy. once you see a highlight like that at a restaurant i believe my taste buds take a back seat. \n\nyou should go. for the food of course. it can get busy so watch out for the hours and wait time. it can get noisy and they can sometimes play grating music.", 
            "we went there at the recommendation of a local friend who loved this place, but we left there just kind of feeling \"meh\" about the whole experience.\n\nfirst, the good: there were a lot of options for our burgers, in terms of selection of ingredients, toppings, etc.  you can even build your own burger with just about as many things as you could want in or on it, truly making your own masterpiece of a burger.  there are a ton of side options, too, and you can even get a sampler of different types of fries, tater tots and even fried mac & cheese bites.\n\nand the dulce de leche martini that i had was to die for.... it was the perfect blend of alcohol and sweetness to me!\n\nthen there's the not so good: the place is ridiculously loud to where even with a 3/4 enclosed booth with high walls separating us from patrons at the next table over, we still could barely hear anything through all the music and noise.  \n\ni had the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>, which as others have reviewed, is over $20.  yes, i get that this is considered a somewhat \"high end\" gourmet restaurant, but for 20+ dollars, i expect that burger to sing in my mouth with flavor and texture, and what i got was a very generic burger that tasted overwhelmingly of the carmelized onions and slightly stale ciabatta bread.  \n\nthe other burgers that our friends had were good, but again, no one reported that it was anything spectacular that made it worth the premium we were paying for what was essentially burgers and fries.  \n\nso in the end, it was a decent food experience, but unless our local friend insists on going, it probably won't be on our radar on our next trip to vegas.", 
            "for a random monday 2pm late lunch, the wait was about 45 minutes, so there is something to be said about that. that you're going to get some pretty good burgers here.\n\nand finally i went with their <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>. it was good, but nothing worth writing to mom about. i actually enjoyed the fries more.\n\nthe same goes with the milkshake. it wasn't too rich or fatty or anything. and it was just the right amount.\n\nbut the hk burger was just so-so. so-so that i had to box it and eat it later on. \n\nlooks like i have to come back and try the other burgers. if this place is known for the \"best burgers\" you bet i'm going to give these guys at least another shot to see if it is true and maybe try out the rossini burger. will see!!", 
            "i'm really torn on what rating to give burger bar. without a doubt, it was the very best burger i've ever had. the fries were also some of the best i've ever had and the selection of dipping sauces was vast and executed perfectly.\n\nafter perusing the menu i knew i'd be ordering the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>, a burger with buffalo, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, baby spinach, and bleu cheese on ciabatta. it was served with a side of red wine and shallot reduction. i typically tend to gravitate towards more unique protein options (such as buffalo) when ordering a burger. i love me some beef, but change is always good. i'm pleased to report the buffalo patty had a slight char on the outside and was cooked a perfect medium-rare. the onions were sweet and abundant, the spinach was the epitome of fresh, and the bleu cheese added a great tang. i loved the ciabatta as it really held up against the juiciness of the buffalo. the only thing i didn't love about the burger was the reduction it was served with. the reduction itself was really tasty, but i didn't quite get the point of it. the burger was already really flavorful and juicy and the reduction was served in a mini gravy boat. you couldn't dip the burger into it and if you poured it on the burger it would just drip down your hands. i thought it was unnecessary. \n\nas mentioned, the fries were perfection. i sampled both the sweet potato fries and the regular fries. they were nicely seasoned, fried to a golden brown, and you had the option of ordering a sauce sampler. for a very reasonable price you could order five different sauces and we settled on the aoli, chipotle aoli, pesto aoli, white bbq sauce, and truffle mayo. all were delicious and really elevated the fry experience.\n\ndrinks were also exceptional. my dirty vodka martinis were expertly made. perfect amount of olives and olive juice, strong pour, and just the perfect amount of those micro ice chards. \n\nso why only 4 stars? burger bar deserves 5 stars based on the food and drinks, but something about the experience was lacking. service was mediocre and the restaurant itself wasn't maintained very well. everything was sticky. the menu, table, bench.... the personal tv in our booth was nice, but the plastic covering was all scratched up. i realize this isn't a fine dinning establishment, but considering it does have hubert keller's name associated with it i was expecting it to be a little nicer and cleaner. \n\ndespite a few flaws, i wouldn't hesitate to return here. by far the best burger i've ever had. if you're ever in nevada, definitely hit up burger bar. be sure to bring your own wet-naps though.", 
            "definitely got food poisoning here.  went here around 8 for dinner, sat at the bar, ordered the herbert <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> (buffalo, spinach, blue cheese) medium.  service was quick, food took a while, burger was more rare than i'd expect when ordered medium, the sides were just barely browned and it had way too much spinach on it, which was kind of cold.  anyways, it tasted good.  but four hours later on my flight back home i break out in sweats and nausea sends me to the toilet.  i know you're warned about eating undercooked meat...  could also have been the spinach... \n\nother 1 star reviews mention getting food poisoning too.\n\ndefinitely will not be back.", 
            "dessert burgers to die for! sweet potato fries that are so good they will instantly become your favourites*! why exactly am i shouting!!!?\n\ncurrently, actively working my way through their chef's burgers portion of their menu -- i have had the surf/turf (not my favourite), the namestake <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>, and a third one that i am not sure of which one it was now -- only on one occasion was my burger not cooked to temperature (asked for 'medium rare'; was brought 'well done'). \n\nback to the dessert burgers. goddamn is that creamy cheese cake burger one good. \n\nthe service has been hit or miss for us here. they can be busy -- and i can understand busy -- but there are other places that are busy but still take your order fairly quickly and more importantly bring you your desserts after ordering them in a timely manner. \n\nthe weaknesses in this area force me hand in a four-star versus a five, although anyone can come here and easily have their five-star experience on a routine basis. food is great; boy, those dessert burgers cannot be overstated though. - e\n\n*that is until you try the sweet potato fries at burgr.", 
            "we were at mandalay bay aquarium and yelped this place. the wait was about 20 minutes and they wanted us to sit at a table near the entrance which was an awkward looking location as people were coming close to it when they were entering and leaving. we declined and opted instead to wait an additional 15 minutes for something else. 5 minutes later we were seated at a comfy booth. they even let us bring our fat tuesday drinks in. the atmosphere is sports bar like and fun. the waitress was nice and helpful when it came to the menu as it was our first time. she had some great recommendations. i had the lamb burger with customized toppings of <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> and jack cheese. the waitress warned that it wasn't for everyone and you either love it or hate it. i love gamey meats so to me it was flavorful and juicy. the zucchini fries could have been thicker cut because it seemed to be mostly batter but the fried batter was crisp and tasty so i enjoyed them. my girlfriend had the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> which was very tasty with just the right combination of toppings to satisfy. the skinny fries were decent french fries. we tried the martinis and they were good too. would definitely go back to try one of their other creations!", 
            "for our group's end of the year dinner, we were angling for burgers and decided on this place mainly because they were likely to be able to seat a table of just shy of twenty. i got more and more excited as i did my research and found that this was often listed as a top burger place in las vegas. hey, don't laugh at my naivete! you know it's all about bachi anyway if you're a local.\n\ni chose the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> because i wanted to try buffalo meat and i was too lazy to try to custom-build one. oh, and the whole having his name on it thing means it has to be good or else, right? indeed, it was delicious. it came out medium-rare as i had requested, and the first thing i did was try to take a bite without adding the red wine and shallot reduction. mistake number one! gotta pour that sauce on there to get the maximum flavor out of this. granted, the <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> and blue cheese complemented each other well, but you need to use the sauce. also, i liked the bite from the red onions that i threw on later and barely noticed the lettuce and tomato, which is fine by me because i just didn't want them to go to waste on the plate.\n\ndid i not talk about the meat yet? well, that's because i was saving it for its own paragraph. i loved it. it was similar to beef in a way, but it had a much cleaner flavor. it's somewhat hard to detect the unique flavor that sets it apart until you get a piece of mostly meat in your mouth, which i finally did at the end, and it's definitely not what i would call gamey or anything. it's just something different to appreciate because you don't eat it everyday (well, i guess you can, but i can't be bothered).\n\nthe only drawback to my meal was that the fries somehow just did not go with the burger, so it was like eating two separate dishes the entire time. i think i should've had sweet potato fries instead. when i tried a few of those from my friend, the sweetness called out to me as something that would have worked. so for those of you who might wanna try the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>, i do suggest that you try to substitute in sweet potato fries for the normal thin fries (but it might cost more? dunno).\n\nthere is no doubt that this is a great place on the strip to have a burger. if you're from out of town (and you're not one of those deprived people who have never tried in-n-out), you won't go wrong making this your burger stop.", 
            "quite expensive for burgers, but so worth it. i had the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> - oh my word! incredible, messy, beyond words really. there is definitely a reason he puts his name on this burger. it was my first buffalo meat experience and i wouldn't change a thing about it although i was admittedly nervous about trying buffalo! my husband had a build your own with kobe, bacon, and cheese. he was certainly not disappointed! we had the skinny fries as well, nice and crispy. felt like the wait staff was a little on the snobby side, but i was too busy focusing on the incredible taste experience going on in my mouth to notice :)", 
            "friendly service and yummy food: the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> is a must, although the chicken wings were a bit too dry, they were still very tasty!", 
            "this place is ok.  tried the <mark>American Classic</mark> and the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>.  of those two, definately go with the hubert keller buffalo burger.  with that said, both burgers were just ok.  nothing special to write home about.", 
            "after watching top chef masters, i'm a big fan of hubert keller. who else can manage to cook a 5 star meal in a dorm room using a hot plate and a shower stall? i also admire his diverse interests- not many chefs can boast about being a dj in their spare time!\n\nanyways, i was excited to try out his burger bar restaurant when we were in vegas. we got here around opening time, and there was already a line forming to try out the delicious burgers. although we had a large party, we were seated promptly. \n\nwe decided to order the chicken wing appetizer, and i had a nutella shake to start out with. the chicken wings were good, but quite small compared to other chicken wings you'll find at other places. the nutella shake was beautifully presented, with elegant swirls of chocolate syrup laced on the inside of the cup. the shake itself was smooth, rich, chocolate indulgence, topped with chocolate whipped cream and a sprinkling of whole hazelnuts.\n\nalthough i didn't order the beer float paddle sampler, a person in our party did, and it looked amazing! (see pictures for the evidence!)\n\nalthough the rossini burger was indeed tempting, i decided to forgo the $60 price tag and order the signature <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> ($22). after all, why not order the owner's favorite burger? it was perfectly cooked to order (medium rare), with tender, flavorful buffalo meat, spinach, blue cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, with a lovely red wine sauce on the side. i'm not normally a fan of blue cheese, but it meshed well with the other ingredients. the only slight negative was that the burger really needed the red wine sauce on the burger, otherwise it tasted like it lacked a little seasoning. the fries that automatically came with the burger were decent, with a nice crisp outer layer.\n\nmaybe if i strike it big in vegas one of these days, i'll splurge on that $60 gilded lily of a burger, but for now i'll go for the other signature burgers!",

            "it's a bit of a pain to find - first off, the mandalay is set back from the strip, so you have to take a (free) tram to get there.  once you do, walk through the casino hugging the right til you get to the shops (up the stairs).  then walk most of the way through the shops towards the luxor, and it'll be a small, unassuming restaurant front on your left.  \n\nit's a chill atmosphere, with whatever music playing the staff feels like listening to (my night it was 90s satellite radio), and personal tvs in the booths.  nothing pretentious whatsoever.\n\ngrabbed a solo seat at the bar, and was promptly greeted and set up/given water by multiple servers.  patrick was super duper friendly and made my night very enjoyable.   he and another guy behind the bar seem to call everyone \"baby,\" which i found rather cute and enjoyable (although i'm taken), but i had the thought that a different woman dining solo as i was might have found it unnerving.  \n\nwhatever, i had a great time chatting and hanging out with patrick throughout the night, and he was an attentive and informative server.  he seemed to really enjoy his job and is great at it.  service can often make or break a meal, and it definitely made mine.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>, with a few changes.  i got the kobe instead of the buffalo, and an onion bun instead of the ciabatta.  i also ordered the zucchini fries, with a couple sides of sauce (truffle aioli and pesto).\n\nthe burger was very good.  piled high with the toppings, and the shallot and red wine sauce was sooooo goood.  my only complaint was that the bottom bun was soggy as soon as i got my plate.  not cool.  all in all not the best burger i've ever had, but a great one and it hit the spot.  \n\nthe zucchini fries were awesome.  i've rarely had fried veggies that are juicy and taste fresh while maintaining a thick coat of batter.  also, the serving portion is ample.  the sauces were great.\n\nsadly they don't make their own ice cream, which was more noticeable when i decided on a sundae instead of a milkshake.  i got coffee ice cream with nutella, caramel, and graham cracker (i was feeling a big pig-ish).  it came in a banana split style dish - very long and narrow - with two huge scoops of ice cream, shmears of nutella on either side and a couple of graham cracker pieces on either side as well.  the caramel was sadly missing, but it was brought over as soon as he realized.  it was difficult to eat - there was too much ice cream for the dish, the nutella wasn't incorporated and is hard to do so yourself when it gets cold, and the graham crackers were whole which meant i had to break them up myself and there was no space to put them really without them fall off the ice cream on to  the table.\n\nso - bottom line - this place is good if you're in the mood for a very good burger, and some inventive fries/sauce choices.  for dessert, maybe stick with the milkshakes over a sundae.", 
            "we stopped in at around 8pm on a friday night and only waited about 10 mins for a table for 6. our server was on point even though he was also tending to a table of about 16 and upon getting seated had our drink order put in.\n\nthe restaurant was quite skinny but went back quite a bit with the bar to your right going almost the entire depth of the restaurant. the atmosphere was great, kind of like a sport bar/club/family restaurant...if that makes any sense. we had a booth towards the back of the restaurant which had its own tv with a college game on. the music was loud and you almost have to whisper into someones ear to be heard, but that why the atmosphere was so great!\n\nthe food was drool-worthy! i had the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> with bacon and it was awesome. it was a good sized burger with wine reduction shallots, sauteed spinach and blue cheese, it came with skinny fries (which were just ok) and was about $28. our table also ordered onion rings, which were also just ok, and mozzarella sticks, which were pretty good.\n\neveryone pretty much licked their plates clean (even the one in our party who ordered the vegas vegan) so it must have been pretty good. common, hawaii, you need to get your burger game on!", 
            "hubert keller made his foray into gourmet burgers with the opening of his first burger bar in 2004. shortly thereafter, several burger bars popped up luring customers with it's prime meats, tantalizing toppings and toothsome milkshakes. whether you fancy an ultra-luxe $60 burger or if you prefer your burgers a little more spartan, burger bar can fulfill your needs. \n\ngive your burger the ultimate treatment and choose from a dizzying array of toppings, including pan-seared foie gra, black truffles, lobster, large shrimp, homemade chili, prosciutto, fried eggs, jalape\\u00f1o bacon and more. \n\nafter tossing a few options back and forth, i decided to go with the hangover burger --certified <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> smothered in hangover sauce, chopped lettuce and served with fat fries. my friend ordered the same burger but the gluten-free version with sweet potato fries. we both relished every bite and lapping up all the hangover sauce with their tasty fries. \n\nthe birthday girl choose the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>, which comes with buffalo, carmelized onions, baby spinach and blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. this namesake burger comes with a beautiful red wine shallot reduction sauce and many sides of hefty smiles. \n\nand don't forget about ordering one of their signature milkshakes or choose from a staggering 60 ingredients to custom build your own milkshake. i had the cowboy milkshake -- whiskey and chocolate ice cream topped with chocolate marshmallows. it's very rich, almost like a chocolate mousse, so prepare yourself for one decadent treat. \n\nmenu highlights include the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, buffalo, veggie, salmon, surf 'n <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> with black angus and lobster tail. the rossini burger ($60) features wagyu beef foie gra and shaved truffles on an onion bun. \n\nwonderful burger joint tucked away in the mandalay bay shopping forum.", 
            "i ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> medium rare and holy s**#, it was perfectly cooked, moist and full of so much flavor that i can't stop thinking about!  this buffalo burger was my first and will not be my last!", 
            "being this is vegas and all prices are inflated (burgers start around $14 and go up quickly), it is easy to be skeptical. however, i was widely impressed by the burgers. \n\nthe spicy lamb burger was very good. it had a nice kick without being spicy just for the sake of being spicy. definitely not a burger that will ruin your taste buds and throw you into a flop sweat. the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> (made with buffalo meat), was awesome. carmelized onions and blue cheese, tough to go wrong there. my favorite, though, was the peppercorn burger. it had peppercorns (obviously) along with dijon mustard and a peppercorn sauce. i usually skip the sauces or get them on the side as i fear they will be either overpowering or make the sandwich too messy. however this sauce was outstanding. i'm not a fan of creamy sauces and although the menu states it is a \"peppercorn cream sauce,\" it was not at all what i expected. it was not a mayo-based sauce so not super thick. tough to describe, but it was fabulous. here's a great tip, get the zucchini fries rather than regular fries. they are awesome.\n\ni was very happy with the burger bar. nice selection of beers as well.",

            "i met an out of town friend here for dinner before the michael jackson one show.  i've been wanting to try the burger bar and it was convenient for having dinner and getting to the 7 o'clock show.\n\ni had read reviews of friends on yelp and had decided what i was going to get before i got there.  then i looked at the menu there and i changed my mind.  while we were studying the menu, our server brought our drinks and he kept my iced tea refilled during the meal.\n\ni opted for the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> which is ground buffalo meat.  it's topped with <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, bleu cheese, and baby spinach served on a ciabatta bun.  finally, it's served with a red wine and shallot sauce which the menu states is keller's favorite sauce.  i ordered the burger rare.  the server asked if i wanted it cool inside and yes was my answer.  \n\nit was served exactly the way i wanted it--red, cool meat.  the burger was very tasty and very juicy.  it was better buffalo than i've had in the past.  i also got a side of skinny fries which were good but nothing special.  it was also a small amount for the price.  as for chef keller's favorite sauce, i didn't find it all that flavorful.  i poured some on the burger and some on the bun but i got no flavor of cooked wine and shallots.\n\nthis is a good burger joint.  the place was crowded and noisy when we got there, but the crowd thinned out as we were there.  i guess i know how to clear a room.  i'd like to try his foie burger.  had i known that when i went to the casino before the show i'd hit a $120 bonus, i'd have gotten the foie burger.  oh well, another time.", 
            "would give 4.5 stars if i could!  yelp you need to make this change to allow for .5 stars!  anyway, stopped for a beer before hitting the foundation room at mandalay bay and stayed for an early dinner.  great beer selection on tap!! we had the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> and wedge salad.  both very good.  wait staff was superb.", 
            "this is a place i go to every time i go to vegas. the burgers are fantastic and so are the selection of beers. i switch between building my own and the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> (substituting the buffalo for kobe). the side sauce sampler is a good choice if you want variety. of the sauces, i would strongly recommend the truffle mayo.", 
            "located conveniently between mandalay bay and the luxor, burger bar delivers a juicy meaty burger for a decent price!\n\nthe burger bar is a casual place with pop music piping throughout the restaurant and sports on the millions of televisions they have.  each booth has their own television for you to catch a game or two so you'll never miss a game.  it's clean and modern and just dimly lit enough for you to feel relaxed.  \n\ni had \"the <mark>American Classic</mark>\" while the dude-man had the \"<mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>.\"  both were super delicious, hit the spot, and cooked to a perfect medium..  i really enjoyed the buffalo meat in the hk burger and that red wine and shallots sauce was crazy good.  i liked dipping my skinny fries in there.  my burger was crazy big while the hk seemed to be a smaller portion.  is this normal?  it was my first time stopping by!  i had originally wanted to try the \"spicy lamb burger\" but i was afraid it would be too spicy.\n\nwhile burger bar isn't my burger place of choice on the strip, i definitely wouldn't hesitate to stop in again!",

            "i've been wanting to check out burger bar for months!! my husband and i had a rare night off together, and decided to try a restaurant locally we've never tried before. burger bar was our pick!\nit's tucked into the mandalay place shopping area of mandalay bay but you forget about that once you're inside.\nthe hostesses were friendly and cheerful, and it was only a 5 minute wait on a saturday night, which wasn't bad at all! \n\nthe booths are comfortable, which are fitted with a small television so you can watch whatever sports. it has a generic black button underneath which can be utilized to change the channels, but it was broken so we couldn't change the channel.\n\nthey have an amazing beer selection, and we opted for magic hat #9 which was shockingly on draft. magic hat is our favorite brew, aside from dog fish head.\n\nthe husband ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> which is buffalo, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, baby spinach, blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. the hubby was a little thrown off by the ciabatta bun, but it complemented the ingredients perfectly and he had zero complaints. the fries are fresh and not too greasy and tasted unlike any fries we've ever tasted, which is a good thing!\n\ni ordered the \"perfect 10\" burger, which is bbq marinated beef with smoked gouda, carmelized onions on a fresh pretzel bun, and it came with fries and a pickle slice. i love that they serve it with the onion on the side to give me the option of using it or not. to be honest, the burger didn't even need it. it was perfectly cooked to my requested medium-well temperature. the bbq flavor was smokey with a dash of sweet and satisfied all of my taste buds! \n\nthe burgers are way filling, so if you're not too hungry, they do have a slider option that i had been considering prior to making my order. \n\nthe server was sweet and friendly, giving us enough space to enjoy the meal but checking in at appropriate intervals without seeming like she was hovering. \n\nthe total cost between our beers <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> was $62 and change. it's a bit pricey for us to go all the time, but it makes for a great date night and the quality of what you get is definitely worth the cost.", 
            "burger bar is my #1 place to eat gourmet burgers on the strip.\nit's hard to find any other place that compares to hubert keller's burger joint.\nmain reason is the vast customization of burgers and drinks. \ndeciding what type of bun, meat, condiment, sauce, and sides to get can get overwhelming, same scenario with the drinks.\n\nluckily, they have the chef burgers, the one that i like is the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>. consists of  buffalo, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, baby spinach and blue cheese on ciabatta bun served with red wine and shallots sauce. \nthe flavors are balanced very well, and the buffalo tasted fantastic it did't taste gamy or have that earthy after taste.\n\nnext time i go i want to try the rossini burger (kobe wagyu beef from austraila), it's $60 which is insane but one time should be enough.\n\nmy waitress was very kind and helpful, customer service is great here.\nthe prices are steep from a ordinary burger perspective but these not regular burgers they are over the top, creates the best experience.", 
            "first off, i'm a huge fan of hubert keller's tv show and had to visit las vegas to dine at his restaurants. although his other restaurant fleur (located in the same building downstairs) was somewhat disappointing, the burger bar served the best burgers i have ever eaten. i ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> the first time, and it was delicious. the sweet <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> sauce that came with it was perfect, and the medium rare buffalo patty was cooked to retain the optimal moistness. my dad let me try a bite of his <mark>American Classic</mark>, also medium rare, and it tasted even better than my burger! i loved this restaurant so much i came here for lunch again days later. unfortunately, i did not have as great of an experience. i ordered the <mark>American Classic</mark>, and also i still call for it to be medium rare, it was much dryer than before. i asked for <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> instead of raw onions, but they still gave me raw. i called sweet potato fries both times, but they were less crunchy the second time. the service also felt less attentive than it had during the preceding visit. with that said, the burger bar still remains my favorite burger place, and i would definitely return on my next visit to las vegas.", 
            "i got the custom wagyu and bf got the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>. the burger was good, but not great. i order it medium rare, but the burger came out rare instead. it was also a pricey place for a burger.", 
            "better than your average burger but not worth the trip or price. burger bar is definitely overhyped for what's it's worth. you'll be better served (both taste and service wise) at other joints in town like bachi burger, holstein's and other establishments. their drunken monkey and mint chocolate chip spiked shakes are also a colossal disappointment lacking any distinct flavors and instead tasting like something that would be served at johnny rockets or red robin. the hubert (helen) <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> has a beefy flavor further bolstered by use of spinach and bl\\u00ebu cheese. however, you could get a similar tasting burger for $5 at joe's junior in the east village at new york city. the reuben on the other hand lacks any punch and the corned beef overtakes the burger in the dish. the fact that the sauerkraut fails to pull through in the composition nor does it even taste much like anything when eaten alone would explain the fact that the parts of the burger cannot even hope to become much of a sum. don't waste your money here."

            ":o)\n\nit pains me to give burger bar four stars.  first of all, i'm not typically a burger type of gal, except when it comes to in n out, but everything surpassed my expectations and was super tasty.  unfortunately, my burger's lobster was overcooked and service slightly disappointed me.  :(  \n\n\nburgers:\n<mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> - buffalo, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, baby spinach, blue cheese on a ciabatta bun.  the buffalo added the perfect amount of gaminess to give this burger a good earthy kick with the blue cheese to add a mildness to it.  which was slightly odd since blue cheese has so much flavor and usually packs a bold punch.  everything harmonized beautifully and i was happy to chomp away. \n\nsurf & turf - black angus, grilled half lobster, grilled <mark>Green Asparagus</mark> on a plain bun.  sadly, the lobster was overcooked and was chewy.  other then that, the <mark>Green Asparagus</mark> complemented this burger perfectly.\n\n<mark>American Classic</mark> - <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, america cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion on a sesame bun.  a very good basic burger.  the juiciness of the beef makes this one exceptional.\n\n\nsides:\nsweet potato fries - hands down the sweet potato fries won the sides battle.  they were very typical very good sweet potato fries.  good ratio of sweetness and saltiness, and nice and crispy\n\nonion rings - these babies reminded me of the onion rings you get at carl's jr. with the same texture and crispiness.  the biggest difference between the ones at burger bar is that the onions doesn't slide right out of the ring.  :) \n\naioli - do yourself a favor and just get it.  it's so good.  i wanted to cover my hands with this sauce and lick it all day.  i know it sounds absolutely disgusting, but it was soooooo good!!\n\nzucchini fries, skinny fries, fat fries - they're all good, but not amazing.\n\n\nfrom a service standpoint, i was a bit disappointed because we told the server that it was my friend's birthday.  sadly, she didn't bring us a little burger dessert, but we were stuffed beyond all belief to even fathom having another bite.\n\nhere's a little note.  keep their number on hand.  even though they don't take reservations, you can call them to ask them for a wait time and to put your party on the list.  it's almost like a fast pass for the burger bar.  :)",

(chef's favorite is buffalo with spinach, carmelized onions and blue cheese with a red wine and shallot reduction sauce on ciabatta) -  approx. $25\n\n2) build-your-own - <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> with <mark>Green Asparagus</mark>, oyster mushrooms, bacon and peppercorn cream sauce on a soft onion bun - approx. $17\n\n3) skinny (plain) fries - approx. $3\n\n4) glass of house merlot ($7) and glass of red diamond cabernet ($10)\n\nboth burgers were amazing.  they nailed medium rare on both.  we split them in half and shared.  we savored every bite.  we couldn't really decide which we liked better.  the flavor on the chef's favorite might've won by a hair, but the texture on the build-your-own was much nicer than the texture on the other (the crisp bacon, al dente asparagus and earthy, slightly chewy oyster mushrooms were all a nice contrast to the tender burger and soft bun; the chef's favorite was pretty much all soft, melt-in-your-mouth-no-teeth-necessary kind of mouthfeel.)\n\nfries were good; not too greasy, not too salty.  we rarely ever finish an order of fries, but we ate all of these and dipped some in our burger sauces!\n\nhouse merlot was fabulous minus (boring, a bit watery, not fruity like a merlot should be.)  red diamond cab was much better.  it's a $10-11 solid table wine you can find at sam's club.  would've liked to see a little bit bigger selection on the wine list (there were only about 4 reds by the glass and 6-7 total.)  but i guess they want you to drink beer (extensive beer list by country.)\n\nservice was hit-and-miss with server forgetting about us twice for a long time.  also, right after we sat down, she came by to take our order; we asked for a couple minutes, and when she returned she brought us a check.  she had already set it on the table and started to move on before she realized she had the wrong table.  that was a precursor on the service.  it wasn't horrible, it was just thoughtless.  either she was distracted or tired or somewhat indifferent to her job (not sure which.)\n\nambience was also a disappointment.  i would've expected something unique or inventive.  nada.  take away the menu and the food and i could've been in any average burger place anywhere.  no hint i was in a top-tier chef's restaurant at mandalay bay.  kinda noisy; too many little kids and crying babies for my thinking (we had a 10:30 pm dinner.)\n\nbut for me, food is king, and the food was grand.  we were pleasantly surprised by the bill; under $65 before gratuity.  it was yummy enough that i actually thought, \"i could come back here again...tomorrow.\""

            "any place that i visit four times in the course of one weekend, especially in vegas where there are so many options, i feel obligated to give five stars.  especially because on the fourth visit one of the kitchen staff waved at me.  apparently i became a \"regular\" real quick.\n\n1) my first stop after being picked up at the airport by vegas yelper myke, five of us decide to have lunch at the burger bar.  i ordered a mr burger with pineapple, <mark>Grilled Onion</mark>, swiss and prosciutto.  ill tell you what though...that decision took almost an hour.  so many options.  i was disappointed none of us opted for the $60 burger which consisted of half a lobster, shrimp, and some other expensive goodies.  you can add truffles to your burger as well and up the price, but i guess we figured since this was our first stop of a long weekend, we should be somewhat frugal.  <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> was not an option for me...but it was definitely an option on the menu.  also i had a delicious mimosa which was my first drink in 2 weeks, so it went down into my belly which was ready to welcome it with open arms.\n\n2) same day....other people show up to vegas and they get hungry.  now, i wasn't in the mood for another burger one hour later, but i did order my favorite beer blue moon.  that selection was a lot quicker than the burger, but their beer list is super extensive.  it was the best selection i found all weekend, and had i not been craving a blue moon, i could have stared at that list for an hour too.  \n\n3) still the same day...that night, i am in need of some serious food, seeing as though all i had eaten all day was the burger in the am.  so three of us, before heading out to the club, went and ordered the fries, sweet potato fries and the zucchini sticks.  a perfect little inexpensive snack to coat my tummy with the grease it needed.\n\n4) saturday night, my roommates were looking for the perfect ipa.  with the extensive beer collection, they found it.  i had a corona.\n\nthanks again for lunch myke.", 
            "went here also for my birthday.  the food is a bit more than i would have though.  i ordered the kobe burger which was really good.  nice soft and tender.  you can also add on stuff such as cheese and <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> for $1 more each to truffles which were about $30 extra to add on.   the sweet potato fries were a bit addicting, but the regular fries were just like burger king french fries.  nothing special.  the service was friendly and fairly responsive.  i liked the atmosphere, and there's even a television embedded into the wall at the table you sit at, too bad i couldn't change the channel not that i paid much attention to the telvision anyways.  if you have the money, why not.  the burgers are nice and big.",

            "pretty decent burgers. i'm not sure they met the hype, but they weren't horrible either.\n\nto start, i ordered mine on an onion bun which turned out to be a good choice. the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> was nice and juicy, the <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> made it sweet, and the jalapeno bacon (yes, jalapeno bacon) was a really nice addition as it gave it a nice kick. and of course, peppered jack cheese.\n\nthe regular fries, sweet potato fries and the zucchini fries were all great... i just wish they had garlic aioli sauce.  ;)\n\nthe negatives i have are:\n\n1. the price. being $16 for the burger alone (as each topping has additional costs) gives it a reason not to go too often (thank goodness it's 250 miles from me), but i'd say it's worth it on the occasional visits to vegas from here on out.\n\n2. my brother's burger somehow turned out pretty bland. he had the kobe with jack as well but with guacamole and jalapenos on the side, so i question the consistency of the burgers somewhat.\n\n3. to be completely honest, w/ all those toppings, it's hard to tell the difference between <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> and your typical farm or <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>. might not be a bad idea to save $5 and get that instead.",

            "after a couple of buffets, our plans of a \"nice\" dinner were slowly dwindling away, so in the late afternoon/early evening on our last night in town, while the rest of the guys were breaking in my friends ps3 that they just gave him, i hopped on my friend's computer and checked out places that we could possibly go. a dinner at a high end fancy restaurant would have had slim chances since it would have been such last minute, plus i was getting the feeling the guys wanted a chill dinner. trying to compromise, i hit the \"$\" and \"$$\" signs in my search.\n\none of the things that popped up was this place.  personally for me, i absolutely love burgers, so i know i would have loved it.  and while it's no fleur de lys, i thought \"how can you go wrong with a restaurant by hubert keller?\"\n\ni skimmed a couple of reviews and made the suggestion to the guys.  they all seemed to like the idea. the listing said they take reservations, however i believe the listing is wrong on that because when i called, the hostess said they did not take reservations, but would happily put our name down when we were going to head in.  it was still a little early, so i called back about 30 minutes later to put my name in, however we took a little long getting over to mandalay bay from the wynn, and they had apparently already called my name.\n\nnot to worry, she bumped us back up, gave me a buzzer, and said it would still be about 20 minutes since we did have a party of 11.\n\nwe finally sat down and overall, the d\\u00e9cor and ambience of this places feels like daily grill meets a sports bar.  the booths on the right were had dark wood high backs, yet while the dark wood bar still resembled something out of a western movie saloon, they had several televisions all along the back wall.  it was fully stocked as well.  they took a page from barney's beanery and each booth had it's own television.  down the middle were a series of tables and our table was set up near the back, closet to the kitchen.\n\nour server renee, was really cool and cute too.  she looked a little bit like a cheerleader right out of high school, with her hair in pigtails and her bright yet borderline smile, she was actually really nice and took good care of us.  and no, i don't mean in \"that\" way.  pervs....\n\nthe menu is simple: burgers <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>.  on the left, they had some preset burgers, which i'm sure were meticulously decided upon by chef keller.  there was one burger called the \"rossini burger\" and it was a burger consisting of <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, seared foie gras, and black truffles.  while it sounded awesome, i was not ready to fork up $60 for a burger.  i was almost going to suggest we get that as a table and split the cost.  but to no avail.\n\nthe other side of the menu consists of building your own burger.  the concept is not new with places like the counter, 5 guys burgers and fries, and a few other places, but hubert keller included the typical add ons such as avocado, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, aioli, and various cheeses, but he brings in a variety of gourmet items such as foie gras ($12), black truffles ($30 for 1/3 oz), portobello mushrooms, and sauces such as a red wine and shallot reduction.\n\nyou start with your meat.  you have a choice of chuck, angus, american kobe, buffalo and turkey.  the basic burger will run about $9-11 or $17 for the kobe and is topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and a pickle wedge.  then there are the add-ons.  everything were of various prices, but quite reasonable and expected.  cheeses were $.70, condiments ranged from $1 to $1.50, an avocado was about $2.50?  in all, you had a choice of i would say at least 2 dozen items.  of course the gourmet items (as listed above) were more expensive.\n\ni got the angus with both monterey jack and provolone cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, aioli (should've gotten the chipotle aioli) and proscuitto.  you have a choice of plain, sesame, wheat, or ciabatta (i think there was one more?) as your bun.  i decided to just play it safe and go with a plain bun.\n\nmost of the reviews i had read and raved about the sweet potato fries, and for $2.85, you can order an individual portion as your side.\n\nour food came out and the burger looked and smelled delicious.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cni2l-vkg_pdospj6xlixq?select=jfesknrcardv3qriayq_oa\n\ni couldn't really tell between my 2 cheeses, but oh well.  the meat was well seasoned and while it wasn't a perfect combination of flavors, i really liked all of my toppings.  the sweet potato fries were nice and crispy but not overcooked, so i really liked that.\n\noverall, i think everybody liked it.  i've heard small things here and there that they didn't like, but i consider it a successful meal.  they apparently also have build your own milkshakes, but i think that would have absolutely sent me over the top.\n\ni definitely know where i'm coming to get a good burger next time i'm in vegas.",

            "we came here for lunch on our vegas trip.  it's located in the shopping area of mandalay bay.  i ordered the sliders and was pleasantly pleased - each slider was different; one had bacon, which was yummy, another had <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, which was pretty good, and the last one was just a cheeseburger with a crunchy pickle.  a couple of my friends said the burgers they ordered were pretty good as well.  their skinny fries tasted like the kind they used to have at jack in the box, which isn't really a bad thing.  overall, it was ok...everything wasn't to die for, which i kind of expect at an overpriced burger place.  i still have yet to try the burger places on my list in la, so i can't really compare.  i just have a hard time justifying paying $15 for a pretty good burger...i need it to be great...", 
            "i don't know what it is about vegas but they definitely know how to make a burger! the night before we left vegas, we decided to stop by this place since there were a group of people waiting outside. we figured that if there is a crowd, it must be good. the wait was only 20 minutes which wasn't bad since we were distracted by the shops and displays for the lion king musical. little did we know that we get to \"build\" our own burger with any of the ingredients they have listed on the menu. some weird reason i wasn't surprised to see froi gras, lobster, black truffles and japanese <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> on the menu. my burger consist of black angus, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, portobello mushrooms with ciabatta bread. omg! the mushrooms were long slices and so sweet. everything was just dripping out of my hands. hands down this is my favorite place to get a burger in vegas.", 
            "great burgers. lives up to the hype in my opinion. they're not the biggest burgers, but that's fine with me because i didn't feel like a complete fat slob when i devoured the whole thing. i love that you can customize your burger, although the price will add up with all the toppings. the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger was amazing! it was tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. definitely one of the best burgers i've had. my wife's veggie burger was the best that she has ever had also. the size of the toppings are pretty big so if you're looking to save a little cash split the toppings with whoever you're with. the <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> they gave me were plenty for two burgers. the skinny fries were nothing special but the onion rings were large, crispy and delicious. next time i'll have to try the sweet potato fries. the black and white milkshake was tasty, with good sized chunks of cookie dough in it.", 
            "i came here on a saturday and there was a two hour wait. i asked when there slow period was and they said in a really obnoxious voice \"we don't have a slow time\". um this was not true. we went back during the week and waited like 10 minutes (even though there were empty seats, and walked by several times during the week when there was no wait at all. so, the key here is to go during the week. ok as far as the burgers, my burger was cooked perfectly and the topping options is wonderful (loved the <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>). the fries were good, but i think i would do the sweet potato fries next time. also, i wanted a shake but at $8+ that was just crazy (i mean it made the $5 shake in pulp fiction appear to be a bargain). all in all a good burger place that i would return back to.", 
            "hubert keller is an instant hit with me, dwelling in san francisco for only a year and a half of my life was an increscribale twist in the direction my world headed. i guess that is why i am drawn to chef's from sf. i have been eyeing this place after seeing a piece on the travel channel. nestled between a bunch of chic stores, art galleries and bars. \n\ni dug it. \n\ni was totally pleased with the menu setup  4 basic burger types with all the sides sold separately on the side-  milkshake & beer lists as well were very, very detailed. :) great touch. \nthe surroundings were causal but people seemed touristy and business suit types. i would see this gem as a great place to get around midnight after one too many cocktails or after a day at moorea beach (the adult pool)\n\ni ordered the buffalo burger with <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, bacon, & swiss cheese. the zucchini fries and the skinny fries, they are a separate charge from the burger.  \n\ntried the 5 beer sampler and a wheat hoegarden, left a little tipsy and the perfect amount of fullness. job well done burger bar!", 
            "wow! what a great burger joint! i've only had the pleasure of trying it once and ordering takeout since the wait is ridiculously long, but 4.5 stars! ordered the burger bar sliders so that we could try three different burgers. one was angus, pretty good, very basic. a little dab of mayo and mustard and it's perfect. the next was the bacon burger which was my least favorite out of the three because the patty was a bit dry and not as flavorful. the last was the onion burger and i think this is the reason that makes burger bar so popular. the patty was so tender and moist, one bite into it and it was oozing with juices. the <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> enhances the rich flavor of the beef, my mouth probably said oh em gee! if you get the chance, order it with sweet potato fries to top it off!", 
            "great burgers and fries- with a little sticker shock. yes it's expensive, but the burgers are among the best i've ever had. i ate here twice during a recent trip to las vegas and had a great experience both times. the sweet potato fries are always great and i tried the zucchini fires which were good- but i didn't need a whole plate of them. i ordered the foie gras on one of my burgers ( i love foie gras) and probably would not order it again at burger bar- it was rubbery, unseasoned and just blah. \n\nthe kobe burgers at burger bar are the way to go- super juicy and meaty tasting. i've had kobe burgers other places, but burger bar's are the best. my fav burger- <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, blue cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> and bacon on a sesame bun- perfection!", 
            "became interested in this place when i saw the burger-themed challenge on top chef masters. went here for saturday lunch, it was pretty busy with an estimated 20 minute wait. i instead sat at the bar. i wanted to try the rossini of course, but i couldn't justify the price to myself. instead, i went with the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> medium rare (bison, spinach, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, blue cheese on a ciabatta bun). had a hitachino white ale with it. in total, $30+.\n\nnow, nothing about the food was objectionable. i ate pretty much all of it, and the portion size was definitely sufficient. by the time i got out of there, i was full. the food was decent, but it was also not very memorable or flavorful (even with blue cheese!). the skinny fries especially were quite generic and could have been served from a chain family restaurant. maybe i've been spoiled by father's office in santa monica, but the burger bar food was just...alright. add to the experience a pretty long waiting time for food, and well, i'm not running to go back. maybe i should've done a customized burger instead.", 
            "this is one of the best places i've been in vegas, and considering i've been there four times, that's saying something.  this restaurant was more my vibe than most.  tons of delicious beer on tap really won me over, and the burgers definitely helped.  considering this was one of the cheapest meals in vegas, i was surprised it was so satisfying.\n\nmy boyfriend and i loved this place so much that we went two nights in a row.  the first night i had a buffalo burger with <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, avocado and pepperjack cheese on a whole wheat bun.  the burger was cooked perfectly and was juicy and delicious.  the next night, i had a turkey burger with <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, pesto and mozzarella.  yet again, the burger was absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly.\n\ni love everything about this place, but mostly i love the \"choose your own burger\" experience and the delicious, delicious beer.", 
            "came here with the mister and his burger alone was $40! that's because he got all crazy with <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> and added lobster tail, foie gras and all the other expensive toppings, lol. my burger alone came out to around $20 (compared to the counter or slater's in la/oc, my burger would have been around $15) so not bad for vegas food!\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nturkey on ciabatta - $8.50\nbaby spinach - $0.80\navocado - $1.55\npeppers - $0.95\n<mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> - $0.95\nfried egg - $1.95\nchili - $3.00\nchipotle aioli - $0.45\nbacon - $1.15\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nthe food was good, but the wait was forever! they told us it would take an hour to get a table but it felt like two, and that's because it was two hours until we were finally seated! and i swear the hostess skipped us because when i had approached her and asked how much longer it would take, she gave me a shocked look and said, \"uh...right now\" - how convenient that right when i asked, a table was available. oh well.", 
            "i have been meaning to go here for a long long time now. it has been on my list of places to try in vegas for at least a year. why you ask? its all because the wagyu burger! it was this past friday night and i ordered mine like i order all my burgers medium with <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> and mushrooms with a side of fries. the burger is definitely among the best i have ever had. the meat is juicy and tender! the price is decent after taking into account the elevated vegas pricing at every restaurant.\n\nwould i come here again? definitely. considering some of the other expensive choices you can make for dinner in vegas, the food was great and i was definitely satisfied after eating it! a 4 star!", 
            "my boyfriend and i were excited to visit hubert keller's burger bar in the mandalay place after keller's appearance on top chef masters. \n\nmy boyfriend customized a natural burger(?) with swiss cheese and portabella mushroom on a wheat bun with a side of onion rings, while i customized my kobe burger with mozzarella, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, and garlic aioli on a sesame bun, and i got mine with a side of sweet potato fries.\n\nnow, don't get me wrong. these were good burgers. but there was nothing more to it. they were good, but not exceptional. we were expecting in-your-face goodness but the burgers certainly failed to meet that expectation, considering the chef's reputation. quite honestly, umami in la has better burgers; the patties are incredibly juicy at umami. for what the burger bar is charging, i.e. anywhere from $10 ~ $16 for a burger that comes with fries, or $16~$21 customized burger and sides, they need to do better than what they are serving now. \n\nthe only things that were memorable were the garlic aioli and the onion rings; other than that, i would consider this place as \"been there, done that\" and something that i have checked off my list, but do not expect to visit again.", 
            "it's not really fair to compare the burger bar to other burger places. only on the strip in vegas can you blow $25 on a burger and not really care. it's actually a good value, considering that's only 1 hand of black jack for most people. i guarantee you'll enjoy this burger way more than that one hand of black jack. \n\nthe burger bar is celebrity chef, hubert keller's creation. he has a few of his own burger combinations on the menu, or you can build your own from extensive options. i actually wish that hubert keller would have more of his own burgers on there. there are only like 6 listed on the menu. i like creating my own, but hey you are the famous chef, dazzle me. \n\ni've been there a couple of times, so i can report on a few different burgers. i highly recommend the surf 'n <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>. i'm not sure it says on the menu, but i think all the burgers are 1/2 lb. they are nice and thick. the surf 'n turf is <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, topped with a 1/2 grilled lobster tail, and grilled asparagus on a plain bun. because i believe all burgers should come with cheese, i had them add provolone to it. now pay attention to this next part, because i believe i have improved on hubert keller's creation. order some pesto and mayo on the side. mix it together and use this as a sauce. yum, you'll never have a burger like that anywhere else. \n\nyou can choose different types of meat for your burger. after trying a kobe burger on this last visit, from now on that's the only way i will go. it's about $7 more for a <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger than the black angus, but it's so juicy that it melts in your mouth. the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> is actually american kobe, so it's not crazy expensive like the real japanese kobe. american kobe is a hybrid between black angus and japanese wagyu beef. it has the highest marbling of any beef in the united states, and is as fine as you can get without importing actual japanese wagyu beef. you also get to pick from 5 different buns and about 45 different toppings. toppings are as plain as american cheese and are as fancy as pan-seared foie gras. \n\njust so i could try 2 burgers on this last visit, i cut them in half and shared them with my brother. burger number 1 was a do it yourself kobe burger. we agreed on provolone cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, sauteed oyster mushrooms, on an onion roll. had the burger medium rare. the result was such a juicy burger that you didn't need any mayo, ketchup, or any other sauce. just the natural juices of the burger with the toppings was perfection. \n\nburger number 2 was new on the menu since the last time i ate there. it's called the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>. the menu says it's his favorite. it's a buffalo burger with blue cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, sauteed baby spinach, aoli, on a ciabatta bun. i think the buffalo had the least amount of fat of all their burgers, as such i found it wasn't as juicy. i was expecting it to maybe have some different kind of flavor, but it didn't. it could have just been lean ground beef. it's also the same price as the kobe, so unless you are trying to be healthy, go with the kobe. the blue cheese was kind of medium, which wasn't a bad thing. a very strong blue would have over powered everything. of the 3 i've had so far, it was my least favorite, but still good. \n\nthe fries were ok, but the buttermilk zucchini fries, were excellent. got those with a ranch dipping sauce. they have some dessert \"burgers\" on the menu that i must try sometime. they use a donut for a bun and have fillings like cheesecake and grilled pineapple for example. it's so hard to save room for them though, perhaps they deserve their own visit.", 
            "love of my life, you are not a person. you come in the form of a burger. and you reside here, so very far away from me. ::single tear::\nthis was the last place i ate during my first trek to sin city, and what a way to end the trip. the menu is fantastically huge, with all kinds of goodies to pile onto your burger. and when i say \"your burger\", it truly becomes your burger, because you make it what you want. care for some chipotle aioli? go for it. more of a <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> person? be my guest? oh, no, you say you want <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> instead? they have those too! i mean, portabellos, spinach, fried egg, bacon.... peanut butter?? so many different reason i need to get back there.\nit's a shame that my tummy and pain threshold are not as strong as i would like them to be, otherwise i would have added one of the yummy-sounding milkshakes to my order as well. what's so special about a milkshake? well, the fact that they have a list of shakes with alcohol in them is pretty friggin' special to me, so back off. :)\nperfectly done, medium <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> with swiss cheese, sprouts, avocado, mushrooms and aioli.... this is called \"the ali\".... at least in my head. oh. em. gee. love love love on a bun.\ndo it. you know you want to!",

            "mmmm, burgers. one of my favorite foods.\n\ni'm not much for fancy burgers but i made an exception for this place. i was in vegas for a week (!) for work and stuck in mandalay bay. now, i'm not saying mandalay is bad place but a week indoors anywhere is rough. my birthday happened to fall that week so a group of about 35 of us ditched the company-sponsored festivities one night and headed to the burger bar in mandalay place to celebrate my 34th year of existence.\n\nfirst, i will give the staff kudos for arranging seating for us. when 35 people roll up with no reservation, i'm sure it's not easy but my guess is the check for 35 justifies the hassle. we had to wait for a while but only because some large group with little kids was already in the place. sidebar: vegas is no place for a family vacation. take your fucking kids to disneyland, not a place famous for gambling, sex and getting piss-drunk. i don't fuck up your legoland vacation by getting hammered and then hitting on your wife after spending $500 in a strip club so don't fuck up my vacation by bringing your hyper kids to vegas and letting them run around while screaming their heads off. deal?\n\nbut i digress, on to the food. i ordered the \"<mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>.\" i mean, it's named after the owner (and world-renowned chef) - it's gotta be the shit, right? it's actually a buffalo burger, not beef, with <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, blue cheese and baby spinach on a ciabatta bun. it was indeed the shit. one of the best burgers i have ever had, in fact. i also ate half of my boss' <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger, also excellent. and they don't mess around when you order rare or medium-rare. you better like it bloody if you order it that way, not like those chain restaurants that are afraid to leave any pink in the meat. it makes me nervous to order food in those places. i mean, why are you afraid to serve your food a little underdone? what does that say about the quality of your ingredients?\n\nthe sides (sweet potato fries, regular fries) were good but nothing special. i wish i had ordered dessert. they had some good looking \"sweet burgers\" and milkshakes on the menu. maybe next time. the beer menu is very impressive and they serve pitchers.\n\nthe service was very good. they were quick and came by often. with 35 people in the party, i was less concerned with their friendliness, i just wanted them to get the orders correct in a timely fashion, which they did. i willl definitely go back the next time i am at mandalay.", 
            "i don't know why i never reviewed this place sooner, but this is the home of some of the best burgers i have ever had, period.\n\ni went there with the bf for lunch, so it wasn't too busy and we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a booth. i liked the fact that each booth had it's own tv. cute.\n\nthe service was fine as well...i don't recall waiting forever or having an issue at all. maybe it's just the luck of the draw? in any case, screw the service, focus on the burgers!\n\ni love hubert keller, so i was definitely expecting something amazing. i ordered the 3 sliders, which were simply divine.  i still have flashbacks to eating the one with cheese and <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>! if i could only have one last burger before i died, that would be the one.\n\nthere were some more expensive burgers on the menu that i had been tempted to try, but since i hadn't ever been there before, i chose to be a bit frugal until i figured out if i approved of the burgers.  boy, do i approve!\n\nwhen i head back there though, i think i'll have to try something with truffles (my fav.!)...", 
            "the burger was absolutely delicious.  i opted for the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, since many on here said it was delicious on it's own, and both my stomach and my wallet thanked me.  not once did i question bypassing the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> or buffalo burgers, tempting as they may be.  amazingly juicy at a perfectly cooked medium, with mushrooms, peppers and <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> on top, i'm not sure i've had a better burger.  their housemade dijon was also a delicious addition.  the fries (tried both fat and sweet potato) were good and very reasonably priced but not exactly must-haves.  i also got dessert, sharing both a nutella milkshake and the raspberry float.  the nutella milkshake is a chocolate lover's dream, and luckily i am one.  <mark>Mini Chocolate Chips</mark>, chocolate syrup, chocolate ice cream, chocolate whipped cream and nutella.. yep it's as good as it sounds.  at $9, it's also a bit pricey, but hey, you might as well go all out when you're already spending close to $20 for a burger and fries.  the raspberry float was tasty too, even though i don't usually like fruity things.  all-in-all, an amazing burger place.  definitely give it a shot if you're in the area.", 
            "i would really give this 2 stars, but i'm upping it a little bit because the other people liked their burgers. so here is the good: we ordered one of their adult millkshakes (has alcohol) - the mint chocolate chip flavored one - which was awesome. mint and chocolate and so drinkable with mounds of chocolate whipped cream and an oreo - what's not to like? it actually didn't taste like alcohol at all, which was good for me, but got us wondering what we were paying for.that came before all our food so i was kinda stuffed by the time i got my burger. my mom had the chicken burger on a wheat bun without additional toppings and my friend had the salmon burger with blue cheese on a sesame bun. both said that their meats were cooked really well. \n\ni was way waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay less impressed. i had the veggie burger since i'm vegetarian, which had an awesome description but was pretty effing bland. it was made of mushrooms, brown and white rice, lentils, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, peas, and potatoes. it tasted just faintly of lentils and the mushy texture added nothing to the experience. i had mine on ciabatta bread, which wasn't toasted enough to my liking so it was kinda too soft. we also ordered sweet potato fries which were good, but nothing special. same with the zucchini fries, which actually seemed like every generic burger joint zucchini sticks which you can buy in a freezer section. i was super excited about their deep-fried pickles, and sorely disappointed - they were pickle spears, not chips, and the beer batter was crispy but way too heavy. \n\ni don't get why people think this place is so good - must be all the toppings. but if you have to rely on toppings, anything will taste good for a price, won't it?\n\nwhen the milkshake is the best part of my meal, suffice it to say that i won't be coming back. too bad. when you go to a top chef restaurant, you expect top chef food.",

            ":o)\n\nit pains me to give burger bar four stars.  first of all, i'm not typically a burger type of gal, except when it comes to in n out, but everything surpassed my expectations and was super tasty.  unfortunately, my burger's lobster was overcooked and service slightly disappointed me.  :(  \n\n\nburgers:\n<mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> - buffalo, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, baby spinach, blue cheese on a ciabatta bun.  the buffalo added the perfect amount of gaminess to give this burger a good earthy kick with the blue cheese to add a mildness to it.  which was slightly odd since blue cheese has so much flavor and usually packs a bold punch.  everything harmonized beautifully and i was happy to chomp away. \n\nsurf & turf - black angus, grilled half lobster, grilled <mark>Green Asparagus</mark> on a plain bun.  sadly, the lobster was overcooked and was chewy.  other then that, the <mark>Green Asparagus</mark> complemented this burger perfectly.\n\n<mark>American Classic</mark> - <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, america cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion on a sesame bun.  a very good basic burger.  the juiciness of the beef makes this one exceptional.\n\n\nsides:\nsweet potato fries - hands down the sweet potato fries won the sides battle.  they were very typical very good sweet potato fries.  good ratio of sweetness and saltiness, and nice and crispy\n\nonion rings - these babies reminded me of the onion rings you get at carl's jr. with the same texture and crispiness.  the biggest difference between the ones at burger bar is that the onions doesn't slide right out of the ring.  :) \n\naioli - do yourself a favor and just get it.  it's so good.  i wanted to cover my hands with this sauce and lick it all day.  i know it sounds absolutely disgusting, but it was soooooo good!!\n\nzucchini fries, skinny fries, fat fries - they're all good, but not amazing.\n\n\nfrom a service standpoint, i was a bit disappointed because we told the server that it was my friend's birthday.  sadly, she didn't bring us a little burger dessert, but we were stuffed beyond all belief to even fathom having another bite.\n\nhere's a little note.  keep their number on hand.  even though they don't take reservations, you can call them to ask them for a wait time and to put your party on the list.  it's almost like a fast pass for the burger bar.  :)",

            "from the creative genius that brought you the fleur de lys restaurant, hubert keller brings you the burger bar. this place leaves most gourmet burger places in the dust. with its various choices to build your own burger.. to the chef's signature burgers... it's not your typical burger place... definitely and certainly not.\n\nlast year, i selected the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> which was a buffalo burger with <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, baby spinach, and blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. it was delicious however there was one burger that stood out on the menu that i was hesitant to try at first. the $60 rossini.\n\nfast forward to a few weeks ago, i decided to test out this burger to see what the whole hype was about... to see if a burger would be even worth that much to me. what crazy person would pay that much for a burger and why??\n\nwell.. nonetheless i was curious and crazy enough to do it. i must say, though i can see how some people may not find the rossini not not be worth the exuberant amount they ask for..... \n\ni found it to be utterly delightful!! from the juicy tender <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> patty, to the foie gras and black perigord truffles.. i was difficult for me to find myself eating a regular burger after having taken a bite out of this burger. the madeira sauce complimented the burger wonderfully and going halfway into the meal.. i just thought to myself.. i just ate $30 worth of food right there.. and as i contemplated if this whole meal was worth the money and hype.. i decided that the answer was a definitive and crazy, yes.\n\nfinishing off with a cheesecake burger.. it was a nice wonderful experience... also, i must note.. i was there with two other people from the sf bay area.. and we watched the giants win the world series as we finished up our meal. ahh.... definitely a cherry top finish.",

            "the night we went it was packed and there was a 1 hr wait for a table so we had take out instead, and that only took 20 minutes.  the burgers faired pretty well as take out but there were a couple of hiccups.\n\nonce back in our hotel room, we found that they only gave us 2 of the 3 burgers we ordered and 1 of the burgers had extra toppings, all the toppings of the burger that was missed.  thankfully, the burgers were pretty big and we ordered 3 sides so there was enough to share.  we had the <mark>American Classic</mark> with a fried egg and a buffalo burger with <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, mushrooms and cheese/bacon/fried egg.  one of the two fried eggs popped on the way back to the hotel but it was still pretty good.  the buffalo burger was very juicy and perfectly medium rare, even though it was 25 minutes before it was eaten.\n\nthe sweet potato fries were ok as were the regular fries.  the mozzarella sticks were not great but that's because they were take out, if they were eaten right away at the restaurant, they may have been better.\n\nthe best part of this meal was that when we called the restaurant to let them know they left a burger off, the guy immediately accommodating and  said the meal would be comped for the mix up.  pretty good customer service!  that's vegas for ya!", 
            "when i think of hubert keller, i don't think of this place at all.\n\nthe environment here makes me think of a higher end biker bar. all the waitresses are wearing hip hugger jeans, tight black spaghetti straps with their midriffs showing, cleavage popping and their tramp stamps proud and loud. that said, the waitresses are all very sweet and accommodating. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> which is a buffalo on ciabatta bread with spinach, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, blue cheese, and the usual condiments. i liked it a lot, and it was very juicy as well. i loved the sweet potato fries which the waitress allowed me to substitute at no additional cost.\n\n my other party member built their own burger: <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> with mushrooms, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, avocado, and some other condiments that escape my memory. that was actually significantly better than the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> i had, perhaps it was due to a preference in the meat selection. \n\nthe sizes are filling and i was glad i didn't order a shake, even though i really wanted to. i wouldn't have been able to finish both my burger and a shake without rolling off the escalator in a food coma induced state. if it wasn't so far off from the main strip, i would come here more often. however, for those driving to and from vegas, make this your first or last stop on your trip, unless you're staying @ mandalay bay. vegas traffic just isn't worthwhile.",

            "in a word: yum!  i shared the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>, surf-n-<mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark>, and one of the alcoholic milkshakes (you heard me) with my friend.  the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> (buffalo meat, blue cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>) was to die for!  i would definitely recommend it.  the surf and turf was a little disappointing, which is why i'm only giving this review 4 stars, but that may be because the beef just didn't compare to the buffalo.  i don't think alcoholic milkshakes require additional explanation.  our server was super friendly and helpful and it was a trip to see her twin working on the opposite side of the restaurant.  i will definitely stop by the next time i'm on the south end of the strip.", 
            "loved this place. i had the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>. the buffalo was nice and medium as i ordered it. <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> and some crumbled blue cheese were the perfect accessories to this already flavorful burger. it came with some auju on the side that was spot on.the onion rings were good but i really enjoyed the mozzarella sticks, with a nice side of marinara sauce. i wish i was not full after the meal, i really wanted to try the nutella shake, soon!!", 
            "bring on the burger!\n\none of my favorite spots to go every time i go to vegas.\nmac n cheese croquettes are amazing. you must try it! i'm very curious as to how they make something magical like that. ordered the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> (on onion bread) with fried egg, spinach, american cheese, mushroom & <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>. very juicy and worth every penny. also ordered zucchini parmesan on the side - good coating and tasty with ranch dressing. if you're sick and tired of other \"fast food\" burgers, try burger bar! definitely worth it. will definitely come back again and try other things on the menu! check out the picture i posted.",

            "i had a beef hamburger on a sesame bun with sprouts, spinach, mozzarella, jalape\\u00f1o bacon, and <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>. i inhaled that burger! i also inhaled the skinny fries with the five sauce sampler. portion control? not a chance here.",

            "two of my good friends were in town. we had the grandest of intentions of getting all dolled up and hitting the strip for a friday full of debauchery. what ended up happening was us, drinking vodka in their hotel room and stumbling for a late dinner at burger bar, where we proceeded to stuff our faces so full and then go immediately back to the hotel room to hit the hay. (when did i get so ooooooold?) \n\nanyway, unlike my experience at holsteins (which i do like better even though i give them both the same star rating)  i did have a boozy milkshake. it was not that impressive. don't get me wrong, i love a milkshake and i still drank it all, but i wanted it to smack me in the mouth with alcohol, which it did not. mint chocolate chip with chocolate whipped cream and an alleged mint liqueur for $10.75.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>. i have a huge admiration for the chef (public tv ftw) and also inventive recipes, especially those involving blue cheese. buffalo meat (a hard find... coming from south dakota where it's everywhere), spinach, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, blue cheese and a wine reduction sauce on the side for $22. it was spectacular, though perhaps not the best choice combined with my previously vodka-soaked stomach and liver and the aforementioned boozy milkshake. \n\nwe also ordered a sauce selection for the table. you're not coming to burger bar to save money or to eat healthy, so just do it. white barbecue, basil aioli, truffle mayo, homemade mustard, chipotle aioli were our choices. loved them all but particularly the truffle mayo and homemade mustard. mmmmm. \n\nthe decor and bathrooms are where the stars really plummet for me. bathrooms are forever away, passing by the back-of-house restaurant rooms on the way. the decor looked like it was schlepped together and doesn't match a $22 burger. \n\nhowever, we really enjoyed our experience and the service was great. i would try it again!", 
            "looooooove the burgers here. can't go wrong with an <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, topped with foie gras and <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>. the aioli is also very good - perfect for dipping or to lightly spread on your burger. \n\nas far as sides - they are all pretty good. the fried mac and cheese is over the top.\n\nservice is pretty good - quick and attentive. this is a must stop at vegas!", 
            "i love this place. and when i say love, i say that with complete honestly. everything i have had here is simply amazing. let's start the long list:\n\n- macaroni & cheese croquets: fried macaroni & cheese. do you really need to ask why this is so amazing? \n- zuchini fries: yum. i'm always looking for something different than the standard fries. these always hit the spot\n- fat and skinny fries: i really like that they give you a choice, cause i feel like everyone has a preference!\n- buffalo burger: flarvorful, juicy, something different than the standard angus\n- lamb burger: the spices they use really bring out the flavor of the lamb. it's the perfect amount of spicy. again, something different that actually competes with the angus\n- angus: great quality of meat!! flavorful, juicy, and always cooked just the way you order it. i perfer mine medium, with a little pink, and it's always perfect!\n\ni also like that you can build your burger with whatever sounds good that day. i love blue cheese and bacon, with the aioli. the <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, or simply how it come. oh, and the ciabatta bun is what i always put it on. chewy, soft, and toasted. always compliments the burgers to perfection.\n\nand the best thing to order here hands down.... drum roll please....\nthe salted caramel milkshake. yes, save room, cause this is what i always want to come here for! omg, split it with your table, or keep it to yourself, either way this is my favorite thing ever. i'm drooling just thinking about it. creamy milkshake, salty goodness to balance it out, the sweetness from the caramel.

            "my last day in vegas i decided to give this place a shot before i headed to the airport.  i opted for the build your own burger, with ground beef, smoked gouda, spinach and <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> on a ciabata bun.  it was really yummy and perfectly cooked.  the fat fries were also great, came out very hot, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  the chipotle aioli was delicious with the fries.  and as far as vegas goes, its not a bad deal -- about $16 for the burger and fries.", 
            "i'm really torn on what rating to give burger bar. without a doubt, it was the very best burger i've ever had. the fries were also some of the best i've ever had and the selection of dipping sauces was vast and executed perfectly.\n\nafter perusing the menu i knew i'd be ordering the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>, a burger with buffalo, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, baby spinach, and bleu cheese on ciabatta. it was served with a side of red wine and shallot reduction. i typically tend to gravitate towards more unique protein options (such as buffalo) when ordering a burger. i love me some beef, but change is always good. i'm pleased to report the buffalo patty had a slight char on the outside and was cooked a perfect medium-rare. the onions were sweet and abundant, the spinach was the epitome of fresh, and the bleu cheese added a great tang. i loved the ciabatta as it really held up against the juiciness of the buffalo. the only thing i didn't love about the burger was the reduction it was served with. the reduction itself was really tasty, but i didn't quite get the point of it. the burger was already really flavorful and juicy and the reduction was served in a mini gravy boat. you couldn't dip the burger into it and if you poured it on the burger it would just drip down your hands. i thought it was unnecessary. \n\nas mentioned, the fries were perfection. i sampled both the sweet potato fries and the regular fries. they were nicely seasoned, fried to a golden brown, and you had the option of ordering a sauce sampler. for a very reasonable price you could order five different sauces and we settled on the aoli, chipotle aoli, pesto aoli, white bbq sauce, and truffle mayo. all were delicious and really elevated the fry experience.\n\ndrinks were also exceptional. my dirty vodka martinis were expertly made. perfect amount of olives and olive juice, strong pour, and just the perfect amount of those micro ice chards. \n\nso why only 4 stars? burger bar deserves 5 stars based on the food and drinks, but something about the experience was lacking. service was mediocre and the restaurant itself wasn't maintained very well. everything was sticky. the menu, table, bench.... the personal tv in our booth was nice, but the plastic covering was all scratched up. i realize this isn't a fine dinning establishment, but considering it does have hubert keller's name associated with it i was expecting it to be a little nicer and cleaner. \n\ndespite a few flaws, i wouldn't hesitate to return here. by far the best burger i've ever had. if you're ever in nevada, definitely hit up burger bar. be sure to bring your own wet-naps though.", 
            "i love burger bar any time my friends come to visit i always make a trip here! i have never had bad service, bad food, or had to wait very long. the beer is always great there are always different selections for you to chose from. i love that you can create your own burger. the meat selection is always fresh mouth watering goodness. prices are ok, but this is the strip and its high quality beef so its priced at a reasonable amount. oh and they have little tvs in every booth!! how could you go wrong with that?\n\ni have ordered a few things here, all consistent and great.\n<mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger which was great, came out perfect for med rare. not too bloody not too well done. i kept it simple with cheese, lettuce, tomato, and no sauce! onion rings which where amazing and the number 9 beer went great with this meal.\n\nthe next time i got a usda organic beef burger. pretty standard, except i threw on some blue cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, lettuce, and no other sauces. a-mazing!! not as juicy as the kobe wagu burger but up to par with what i was expecting. the beer i can not remember since it was a recommendation from my service who got it spot on, it was excellent. i order the zucchini which by the way with there ranch was sooooo good.  i've never ordered a shake here but they are spouse to be good as well.\n\ngreat burger joint in a very uncrowded little strip of the mall, the walk there is longer from parking but not that bad. make the trip its worth it and if you do have to wait, there is a lush cosmetics store where you can get face mask, soap and just browse to kill time.", 
            "we were at mandalay bay aquarium and yelped this place. the wait was about 20 minutes and they wanted us to sit at a table near the entrance which was an awkward looking location as people were coming close to it when they were entering and leaving. we declined and opted instead to wait an additional 15 minutes for something else. 5 minutes later we were seated at a comfy booth. they even let us bring our fat tuesday drinks in. the atmosphere is sports bar like and fun. the waitress was nice and helpful when it came to the menu as it was our first time. she had some great recommendations. i had the lamb burger with customized toppings of <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> and jack cheese. the waitress warned that it wasn't for everyone and you either love it or hate it. i love gamey meats so to me it was flavorful and juicy. the zucchini fries could have been thicker cut because it seemed to be mostly batter but the fried batter was crisp and tasty so i enjoyed them. my girlfriend had the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> which was very tasty with just the right combination of toppings to satisfy. the skinny fries were decent french fries. we tried the martinis and they were good too. would definitely go back to try one of their other creations!", 
            "for our group's end of the year dinner, we were angling for burgers and decided on this place mainly because they were likely to be able to seat a table of just shy of twenty. i got more and more excited as i did my research and found that this was often listed as a top burger place in las vegas. hey, don't laugh at my naivete! you know it's all about bachi anyway if you're a local.\n\ni chose the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> because i wanted to try buffalo meat and i was too lazy to try to custom-build one. oh, and the whole having his name on it thing means it has to be good or else, right? indeed, it was delicious. it came out medium-rare as i had requested, and the first thing i did was try to take a bite without adding the red wine and shallot reduction. mistake number one! gotta pour that sauce on there to get the maximum flavor out of this. granted, the <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> and blue cheese complemented each other well, but you need to use the sauce. also, i liked the bite from the red onions that i threw on later and barely noticed the lettuce and tomato, which is fine by me because i just didn't want them to go to waste on the plate.\n\ndid i not talk about the meat yet? well, that's because i was saving it for its own paragraph. i loved it. it was similar to beef in a way, but it had a much cleaner flavor. it's somewhat hard to detect the unique flavor that sets it apart until you get a piece of mostly meat in your mouth, which i finally did at the end, and it's definitely not what i would call gamey or anything. it's just something different to appreciate because you don't eat it everyday (well, i guess you can, but i can't be bothered).\n\nthe only drawback to my meal was that the fries somehow just did not go with the burger, so it was like eating two separate dishes the entire time. i think i should've had sweet potato fries instead. when i tried a few of those from my friend, the sweetness called out to me as something that would have worked. so for those of you who might wanna try the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>, i do suggest that you try to substitute in sweet potato fries for the normal thin fries (but it might cost more? dunno).\n\nthere is no doubt that this is a great place on the strip to have a burger. if you're from out of town (and you're not one of those deprived people who have never tried in-n-out), you won't go wrong making this your burger stop.", 
            "i had heard about burger bar for years. the hype that this place received, had me expecting the michael jordan of burger joints.... \n\nwhen i was seated, i was pleasantly surprised that each booth had it's own tv, which allowed for me to watch the nba playoffs up close. definitely a huge plus for a sports fanatic such as myself. \n\ni ordered a kobe burger with spinach, cheddar cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, and peppered bacon, while opting for the fat fries. i went with a vanilla shake to wash the food down. \n\nfirst came the shake, which was possibly the best shake i have ever had in my life. this is probably an exaggeration, but it was very, very good. next came my burger and fries. the fires were decent (hard to mess up fries), especially when dipped in the side sauces that i had added on. unfortunately, the burger tasted how it looked; very average. i'm not sure what my expectations were, but a regular, messy, sad looking, lump of a burger, smothered in <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> was not it (there were literally more onions than meat). definitely a deal breaker for me. \n\ni expected to get the mj of burgers, and was handed a darko milicic: decent, average, not bad, and not worth the hype... definitely not how i want to describe an $80 dining experience. \n\nthree stars for the shake and the tv's in the booths. food was worth maybe two.", 
            "after watching top chef masters, i'm a big fan of hubert keller. who else can manage to cook a 5 star meal in a dorm room using a hot plate and a shower stall? i also admire his diverse interests- not many chefs can boast about being a dj in their spare time!\n\nanyways, i was excited to try out his burger bar restaurant when we were in vegas. we got here around opening time, and there was already a line forming to try out the delicious burgers. although we had a large party, we were seated promptly. \n\nwe decided to order the chicken wing appetizer, and i had a nutella shake to start out with. the chicken wings were good, but quite small compared to other chicken wings you'll find at other places. the nutella shake was beautifully presented, with elegant swirls of chocolate syrup laced on the inside of the cup. the shake itself was smooth, rich, chocolate indulgence, topped with chocolate whipped cream and a sprinkling of whole hazelnuts.\n\nalthough i didn't order the beer float paddle sampler, a person in our party did, and it looked amazing! (see pictures for the evidence!)\n\nalthough the rossini burger was indeed tempting, i decided to forgo the $60 price tag and order the signature <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> ($22). after all, why not order the owner's favorite burger? it was perfectly cooked to order (medium rare), with tender, flavorful buffalo meat, spinach, blue cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, with a lovely red wine sauce on the side. i'm not normally a fan of blue cheese, but it meshed well with the other ingredients. the only slight negative was that the burger really needed the red wine sauce on the burger, otherwise it tasted like it lacked a little seasoning. the fries that automatically came with the burger were decent, with a nice crisp outer layer.\n\nmaybe if i strike it big in vegas one of these days, i'll splurge on that $60 gilded lily of a burger, but for now i'll go for the other signature burgers!", 
            "best burger i've ever had with excellent service to boot need i say more? probably not but will i of course. the food here is awesome. my burger always comes out medium rare and i never have a problem not getting my toppings. i usually order the angus burger with chipotle mayo, portobello mushrooms, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> and avocado with pepper jack cheese. fat fries are a must of course and you simply have to try the awesomeness of the nutella milk shakes. \n\nthe service is excellent. the food comes out after being cooked perfectly and you never feel like you're being ignored. \n\nthis place is definitely my favorite burger but it also has my favorite shake. i have tried plenty of other burger places but always make my way back to burger bar.",

            "always a must-stop on any vegas trip. this was one of the first design-your-own-burger places i ever encountered, but of course now other places with the same concept are all over the place. however, this one is still doing it on a grand scale and better than any other i've run across. there are such vast selections of meats, breads and toppings that anyone can find something that can become their perfect burger. for me, it's bison meat on ciabatta with bleu cheese, spicy mustard, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> and spinach. with a side of shoestring sweet potato fries, of course. oh, and a flight of ipas from their massive beer selection. service is always incredibly friendly and these folks know the menu options well. it's almost always crowded and there's often a wait for a table, but i've had good luck stalking the bar and grabbing empty seats there.", 
            "i really liked the burger bar.  this was my first experience and i will definitely love to go back.  i am extremely picky about my burgers.  the worst thing for me is to get a burger with cheap meat or gristle.  i did not have this problem at burger bar.  \n\nthere are many options to choose from on the menu.  there are specialty burgers already designed or you can make your own.  you can choose your bread, kind of burger, toppings and condiments.  i chose an angus burger on ciabatta roll with saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms and <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>.  it was delicious!  we also shared the fries and they were good too.  my daughter had a mint chocolate chip shake and that was yummy too.  \n\nthe only downfall to the burger bar is that it is pricey.  i guess that what you can expect in vegas now so it's no surprise.  the service was good but a little rushed.  all in all, i would definitely come back.  i'd love to try the kobe burger next time; i just need to wrap my head around a $17 burger!", 
            "service is fairly average but everyone is very nice. burgers are good, but the toppings steal the show. every time i have been there i have tried a new delicious topping including: <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, jalepeno bacon, aged white cheddar, avocado, bbq sauce, foie gras... the list goes on and on. i would save your money and get the regular burger and load up on add-ons, as opposed to splurging on the kobe burger. it's not real <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> even though it sounds nice to say.;) wouldn't make a trip to mandalay bay just for this place, but if i'm hungry and i happen to be in the area, why not.", 
            "i had a friend visiting from england and we decided to meet here since this is located at the hotel where he was staying at. i have never been to burger bar, so i was really excited, knowing it is owned by a renowned chef. i ordered the twinkie shake and the american burger with extra <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>. sad to say, they sound better than they taste. the burger was dry and lacked flavor, and the shake wasn't really anything to race about. i did love the zucchini fries, but that's about it. service was also just okay. overall, i was just very unsatisfied and felt like it was a complete let down compared to all the hype. not sure if i will be back again.", 
            "my husband and i both had the salmon burger. server said it was great- otherwise i wouldn't order that. it was a full thick salmon- filet, not crab cake style like i expected. i built my burger with smoked gouda, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> and avocado. omg. i ordered zucchini fries, really good- and server graciously brought out the ranch!  they had a huge selection of fries. my husband got guacamole for his salmon and the shoe string fries. it was delicious. it's a definite go.  :). it's in a shopping mall, no patio. otherwise food is great. :)", 
            "build your own delicious burger. \n\ni had a <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger with <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, swiss cheese, truffle sauce, and foie gras. \n\nit gets pretty busy by lunchtime so plan ahead. \n\ntry the sweet potato fries and onion rings.\n\nit's a great place with great food. perfect for a hangover.", 
            "i don't know what it is but since we were in vegas i actually was considering the rossini $60 burger.  as much as i wanted some foie gras  i just decided on the <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger with some smoked gouda, fried egg, portabella mushrooms, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> all on a ciabatta bun.  damn!! that first bite was vegas worthy and worth the $25. hahaha  also ordered the salted caramel shake and ga-damn that hit the spot.  love this place.  check it out if your ever in the area.", 
            "i've been wanting to check out burger bar for months!! my husband and i had a rare night off together, and decided to try a restaurant locally we've never tried before. burger bar was our pick!\nit's tucked into the mandalay place shopping area of mandalay bay but you forget about that once you're inside.\nthe hostesses were friendly and cheerful, and it was only a 5 minute wait on a saturday night, which wasn't bad at all! \n\nthe booths are comfortable, which are fitted with a small television so you can watch whatever sports. it has a generic black button underneath which can be utilized to change the channels, but it was broken so we couldn't change the channel.\n\nthey have an amazing beer selection, and we opted for magic hat #9 which was shockingly on draft. magic hat is our favorite brew, aside from dog fish head.\n\nthe husband ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> which is buffalo, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, baby spinach, blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. the hubby was a little thrown off by the ciabatta bun, but it complemented the ingredients perfectly and he had zero complaints. the fries are fresh and not too greasy and tasted unlike any fries we've ever tasted, which is a good thing!\n\ni ordered the \"perfect 10\" burger, which is bbq marinated beef with smoked gouda, carmelized onions on a fresh pretzel bun, and it came with fries and a pickle slice. i love that they serve it with the onion on the side to give me the option of using it or not. to be honest, the burger didn't even need it. it was perfectly cooked to my requested medium-well temperature. the bbq flavor was smokey with a dash of sweet and satisfied all of my taste buds! \n\nthe burgers are way filling, so if you're not too hungry, they do have a slider option that i had been considering prior to making my order. \n\nthe server was sweet and friendly, giving us enough space to enjoy the meal but checking in at appropriate intervals without seeming like she was hovering. \n\nthe total cost between our beers <mark>Surf And Turf Burger</mark> was $62 and change. it's a bit pricey for us to go all the time, but it makes for a great date night and the quality of what you get is definitely worth the cost.", 
            "burger bar is my #1 place to eat gourmet burgers on the strip.\nit's hard to find any other place that compares to hubert keller's burger joint.\nmain reason is the vast customization of burgers and drinks. \ndeciding what type of bun, meat, condiment, sauce, and sides to get can get overwhelming, same scenario with the drinks.\n\nluckily, they have the chef burgers, the one that i like is the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark>. consists of  buffalo, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, baby spinach and blue cheese on ciabatta bun served with red wine and shallots sauce. \nthe flavors are balanced very well, and the buffalo tasted fantastic it did't taste gamy or have that earthy after taste.\n\nnext time i go i want to try the rossini burger (kobe wagyu beef from austraila), it's $60 which is insane but one time should be enough.\n\nmy waitress was very kind and helpful, customer service is great here.\nthe prices are steep from a ordinary burger perspective but these not regular burgers they are over the top, creates the best experience.", 
            "delicious. \n\nthe only reason i kept from giving them 5 stars was because it took a little long for them to serve the burger and 5 stars means they have no room for improvement!\n\naside from that, the burger was perfectly cooked, i'm a medium-well kind of guy and usually end up getting burgers that are mostly well with only a slight hint of pink, if any at all... this burger was exactly what i envisioned when i ordered medium well.\n\ni love the option of being able to choose whatever toppings strike your fancy, they even have pre prepared \"chef's burgers\" that take the indecision out of it. i chose the pepper jack cheese, jalape\\u00f1os, jalape\\u00f1o bacon, and <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>. it was very tasty, juicy and worth the wait.\n\ni would recommend this place to anyone who's gonna be in especially those looking for a place to eat that had great food at a reasonable price", 
            "came here on a friday night and sat at the bar.  i decided to create my own burger.  naturesource patty on a pretzel bun with chopped jalapeno, american cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, jalapeno bacon, chipotle aioli and button mushrooms.  total price came to $1million dollars.  it was well worth it though, the burger was outstanding.  definitely one of the better restaurants in mandalay.", 
            "all i can say is, wow! this place is off the charts!  i will be making this a vegas destination! after searching all of the \"fancier\" joints downstairs at the mandalay bay, not a one of them had michelob ultra.  one person in my party would only drink that.  not sure what that is all about. anyway, the very friendliest of staff, the craziest of burger building options, the endless amount of beer selections, and then the milkshakes!!!!  first off, i started by building my own burger. <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark>, pretzel bun, bacon, cheddar and bleu cheese, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, and a shallot reduction.... (i know, right?!) then i got the skinny fries.  the waitress suggested the truffle mayo. i will not suggest it, i demand that if you go here, you get it!  omg, i could've eaten that with a spoon. ok, ok....you get the point. i also had a, build my own \"alcoholic\" shake. the guy that owns this place is a genius! chocolate ice cream, bananas, peanut butter sauce, frangelica, malibu banana. what the \"f\"!??!!  they had their own little room in the middle of the restaurant just for building ice cream. i will be going back tomorrow for lunch.", 
            "we went here with 5 people and we all opted for a build your own burger. note: if you don't get a chef's choice burger, everything (and i mean everything is ala carte). \n\ni got an angus burger with guac, american cheese, & <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> on ciabatta bread with a side of onion rings. the bread and onion rings were great. the burger tasted like it was grilled/smoky (it had the grill taste) but i did not like the <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>. they were mushy and too sweet. side note, they forgot my guac so it was separate in a container. also, it comes with lettuce, pickle, red onion, & tomato on the side. i tried the cinnamon honey mustard and it was good.\n\nthe only downside is that it's really rich and i couldn't eat all of it. \n\nps. after we left, it got really crowded (line outside the door)! reservations recommended.", 
            "it's been a while since i gave 5 stars but this place rocks! we had just arrived to las vegas and checked into the mandalay bay hotel and were starving. looking through the hotel guide this place caught my eye as the beer selection looked sweet, boy was it! i would guess easily a couple dozen draft beers on tap ranging from local microbrews through the great mid-sized breweries like sierra and firestone all the way across the pond to guinness and duvel. over a hundred bottled beers to choose from as well. i settled on a victory ipa from hop devil brewery, a tasty adult beverage for sure! nice and lip puckering bitter with a taste of german malts rounding out at 6.7abv.\n   now for food, ordering a burger was a no brainer. after all the place is called burger bar right? i went for the \"perfect 10\", a huge free range beef patty that was bbq marinated and perfectly cooked with smoked gouda cheese and <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> served on a pretzel bun. yummy!  man this one hit the spot like a cannon! highly recommended.  the burgers are pretty pricey but they come with a good portion of tasty shoestring french fries and this is vegas...\n   burgers and beer, gotta love it.", 
            "nice decor, friendly staff, clean. \nbeing able to create your own burger is always fun. i went with bbq patty, bunless (lettuce), with fixins like avo, spinach, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, with spicy aioli. i asked for medium, but my patty came with more red than expected, it was more like medium rare. but i still liked it. my husband ordered milkshake, it was so rich and thick! yumm-o! my child loved his crabby patties. good restaurant. looking forward to going back!", 
            "first off, i'm a huge fan of hubert keller's tv show and had to visit las vegas to dine at his restaurants. although his other restaurant fleur (located in the same building downstairs) was somewhat disappointing, the burger bar served the best burgers i have ever eaten. i ordered the <mark>Hubert Keller Burger</mark> the first time, and it was delicious. the sweet <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> sauce that came with it was perfect, and the medium rare buffalo patty was cooked to retain the optimal moistness. my dad let me try a bite of his <mark>American Classic</mark>, also medium rare, and it tasted even better than my burger! i loved this restaurant so much i came here for lunch again days later. unfortunately, i did not have as great of an experience. i ordered the <mark>American Classic</mark>, and also i still call for it to be medium rare, it was much dryer than before. i asked for <mark>Grilled Onion</mark> instead of raw onions, but they still gave me raw. i called sweet potato fries both times, but they were less crunchy the second time. the service also felt less attentive than it had during the preceding visit. with that said, the burger bar still remains my favorite burger place, and i would definitely return on my next visit to las vegas.", 
            "this place is a joke! unfortunately this place was recommended to me by a friend in tucson, az that said that this was the place to go for burgers. \n\nhe couldn't have been farther from the truth. this place is nothing but a burger assembly line. the burger i had came to me with slightly burnt <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> which threw off the entire taste of the burger i got. i flagged down the waitress and told her it was no good. even another person at the table that got the <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark> thought the same thing. the waitress had me wait for the \"manager\" to come out and remedy the situation. his name was \"scott\", and he had to be the most unprofessional manager i have ever experienced, he stated because i have taken two bites out of my burger that i am responsible for the bill, but he would gladly make another. after i told him i refused to pay for a burger that wasn't as advertised with burnt onions, he argued that this was policy. i told him, thats fine but if you want to charge me for some food that i refused to eat because it was amateur and sub par that he would have to call the authorities in order to get me to pay! the whole table that i was with was not only blown out of the water but was embarrassed, he offered to take only 1/3 of the cost of the meal off the bill and offered me a choice of kolbe beef sliders. i finally agreed still blown away that he was fighting this so hard. he comes back to me and tells me that they are out of kolbe beef so they prepared regular burger sliders for me! it was at that time only about 9pm on a friday night. if this place has run out of kolbe beef on a friday night, than it has no right calling itself the burger bar! my deduction, he didn't want to give me kolbe beef sliders! either way, not a win for this place!\n\nlets summarize:\n1. bad food\n2. poor service\n3. fight from the manager\n4. embarrassment from the manager\n5. lies from the manager\n6. the most pathetic sliders i have ever seen\n\nthe sliders came back to us with no condiments just dry beef on 3 buns and nothing to write home about!\n\ni was \"required\" to pay for food i did not eat, i fought with the \"manager\", and i got a super sub par slider as a sorry we suck gratitude! \noverall this place and its manager are so full of shit that i will avoid this place at all costs, and recommend some of the more local places or even other chain places that will have better food, or management that can see that someone made a mistake, and make it right! \n\nsteer clear! scott your a d bag! how you got your job is beyond me! public, just know that i am a yelp elite, and that i wouldn't steer you wrong! this place gets an f for effen horrible!", 
            "if you are going to put the name of a food in the name of your company, you better know how to make a fantastic version of it.  burger bar delivers. \n\nsitting at the bar was a good alternative to  waiting  for a  table at lunch. they have some standard burger configurations (from $12 to $65), but they also have a make your own section. so i concocted an <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> burger on sesame seed bun with <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>,  peppers and american cheese. and a side order of a combo of fat fries and onion rings (ask nicely and they might combo it for you, too). \n\nthe burger was amazing. cooked perfectly medium with a  pink center, and quite juicy. the burger and toppings were perfectly sized to each other and the bun, which is something you don't often see. and the toppings were plentiful. this is one of the best burgers i've had. the fries were nothing to write home about, but the onion rings were crispy rings of perfection. \n\nthe price is a bit steep ($18 for the above) but i think well worth it. after all, a quick burger at the mandalay pool costs $12. \n\na new favorite place to go in vegas.", 
            "the kobe burger was amazing.  cooked exactly the way i had ordered it.  <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>...so good.  sadly the side items we tried, the mozzarella sticks and onion rings were pretty \"meh\" and tasted like bag frozen bar food.  why establishments will serve amazing food next to mediocre food will forever elude me.\n\nthe $15 strawberry mojito was ok, though if it had any liquor in it, sadly the flavor went undetected\n\nthe thing that really brings the expirence down for me, was the service.   it initially started out quick and attentive, but like water in the desert, it quickly vanished.  we sat with empty drinks at the end of the table, both liquor and then water, for the better part of 20min without anyone stopping by.\n\nby the time we finally got our ticket, id forgotten who our server was.\n\nthis place could be so much better...but i guess with the throngs of people, theres really no motivation to make a good place great.", 
            "awesome! i had a <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> burger with cheddar, <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>, pineapple, fried egg, and jalepeno bacon on a pretzel bun. with truffle mayo and spicy ketchup. after 6 hours of traveling on a plane, that burger hit the spot. service was good. the server constantly refilled drink. definitely recommend and worth the price.", 
            "i came to this place with pretty high expectations. let me tell you what... they did not disappoint!! our server was extremely helpful and explained the menu thoroughly. i'm not going to explain the entire menu but we began with the jalape\\u00f1o onion pedals and zucchini fries. man were they delicious. they sound like typical bar food, but these were done right. perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. not too greasy and not a hint of sogginess. \n\ni opted for the \"build your own burger\" option.  chose the <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark>, sesame seed bun; topped with: smoked gouda, bacon, over easy egg, lettuce, tomato, onion, and of course tuffle mayo. the truffle mayo was absolutely amazing and is a must when you check it out. it takes a special kind of mayo for me to dip my fries in there. i've never in my life dipped my fries in mayo... but i wiped that shit clean. \n\nmy girl got the same except ciabatta bread and <mark>Caramelized Onion</mark>. instead of the mayo she got the chipotle aioli. also very good. \n\nlastly, i got the vanilla shake with heath bar and cookie dough. the shake was really good as well. i'm not a big shake person and honesty i can't remember the last time i've had a shake... but this one was definitely memorable."

            "is it cliche to give this place 5 stars??? i don't care! i would agree, this is probably among the best burger places in the city.....yes, the prices are more than what you would pay at apple-bee's and/or in-n-out.... but obviouslyyyy this is a much more quality burger and you do get what you pay for. \n\nfor my experience: \ni sat at the bar. i didn't plan on it, but there was no wait.. and i was hungry! overall i highly recommend sitting at the bar, there are plenty of bartenders, they are attentive and right there when you need them. if i were to be sitting in the restaurant, i would prefer to be in a booth because the tables seem like you would always feel in the way. \n\nfor our eats we started (which was a mistake) with the nutella shake. i will dream about this delicious thing for the rest of my life. something this tasty shouldn't be allowed to exist. if you love nutella, you will fall in love with this incredibly easily. its topped with fresh cocoa whipped cream, hazelnuts, and <mark>Mini Chocolate Chips</mark>! i will drink this down before i die.\n\nburgers: i really wanted the buffalo burger(which they serve here) because i love buffalo and its better alternatives to beef. but, i stuck with turkey. turkey burger with provolone and guacamole on a ciabatta bun. this baby was steamin when it came out. fresh off the grill. i really appreciated the guacamole they had here, fresh and yummy, and its obviously not for dipping chips in, and they understand that. it is for spreading and the consistency of it was beautiful for spreading! all the burgers come with lettuce, tomato, and purple onion on the side... and a pickle spear:] \n\nmy friend got a burger as well, and she also got the zucchini fries, piping hot also. these were good, and a good change from fries. \n\nsadly, i couldn't finish my burger because of the delicious nutella shake. i will definitely be back here for my indulgence and gluttony, but next time i will fast and make sure burger bar is the only thing to be in my stomach that day.",

            "is it cliche to give this place 5 stars??? i don't care! i would agree, this is probably among the best burger places in the city.....yes, the prices are more than what you would pay at apple-bee's and/or in-n-out.... but obviouslyyyy this is a much more quality burger and you do get what you pay for. \n\nfor my experience: \ni sat at the bar. i didn't plan on it, but there was no wait.. and i was hungry! overall i highly recommend sitting at the bar, there are plenty of bartenders, they are attentive and right there when you need them. if i were to be sitting in the restaurant, i would prefer to be in a booth because the tables seem like you would always feel in the way. \n\nfor our eats we started (which was a mistake) with the nutella shake. i will dream about this delicious thing for the rest of my life. something this tasty shouldn't be allowed to exist. if you love nutella, you will fall in love with this incredibly easily. its topped with fresh cocoa whipped cream, hazelnuts, and <mark>Mini Chocolate Chips</mark>! i will drink this down before i die.\n\nburgers: i really wanted the buffalo burger(which they serve here) because i love buffalo and its better alternatives to beef. but, i stuck with turkey. turkey burger with provolone and guacamole on a ciabatta bun. this baby was steamin when it came out. fresh off the grill. i really appreciated the guacamole they had here, fresh and yummy, and its obviously not for dipping chips in, and they understand that. it is for spreading and the consistency of it was beautiful for spreading! all the burgers come with lettuce, tomato, and purple onion on the side... and a pickle spear:] \n\nmy friend got a burger as well, and she also got the zucchini fries, piping hot also. these were good, and a good change from fries. \n\nsadly, i couldn't finish my burger because of the delicious nutella shake. i will definitely be back here for my indulgence and gluttony, but next time i will fast and make sure burger bar is the only thing to be in my stomach that day.", 
            "this place had the single best milkshake that i've ever eaten in my life!\nwho's ever though of a nutella, chocolate milkshake with <mark>Mini Chocolate Chips</mark>, chocolate mousse, fudge and nuts? they're awesome!\n\ntheir burger selection is also out of this world. they've got everything from the plain jain <mark>Black Angus Beef</mark> patty to <mark>American Kobe Beef</mark> with a lobster on top. anything you get is worth every penny.\n\nthe dessert is awesome and quite unique as well. i got the chocolate version that's built out of a doughnut, chocolate thing, passion fruit jelly sheet, and sliced kiwis. it's made to look exactly like a burger, but tastes nothing like one at all. if you're ready for hitting the town wired, this sugary concauction will do the trick for sure!", 
            "after a long flight from chicago to vegas that got me in at around 10pm local time, my friend recommended we immediately make our way to the burger bar inbetween luxor and mandalay bay as he heard good things about their milkshakes. though skeptical, i have to say i was intrigued by the prospects of a good milkshake and a burger. little did i know that not only were these milkshakes everything he had built them up to be but the burgers were incredible as well. good texture, perfectly cooked and highly recommend a side of sweet potato fries - which are also amazing. and you'd be doing yourself a huge disservice by just doing the burger without the milkshake. the black white milkshake may well be he world's perfect dessert. chocolate mousse whipped cream with <mark>Mini Chocolate Chips</mark> and fudge swimming in vanilla ice cream? are you kidding me? we went back the night before i left just so i could have another for the road! nice atmosphere and good service both at the tables and the bar.", 
            "snagged a booth in the back - with a table added on to fit the eight of us.  fyi - with 8 people, consider the 18% gratuity built in and the service guaranteed to not be stellar... ah shucks.\n\nhad the peppercorn burger, which was cooked correctly (+), came with a tasty peppery sauce (+), and sweet potato fries (extra $, but still great).  the highlight of the meal was the mint <mark>Mini Chocolate Chips</mark> milkshake.  liquor and chocolate blended into drinkable heavenly sips."
